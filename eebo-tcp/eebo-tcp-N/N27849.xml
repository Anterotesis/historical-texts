            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>DISCOURSE &amp;c.</head>
            <p>WHEN the death of men diſtinguiſhed by ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or talents, high endowments, and eminent ſervices to their country, demands the expreſſion of public mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and grief; their loſs is accompanied generally with this mitigation, that, however grievous and painful, it is not irreparable; and that the void, cauſed by their mortality, will perhaps be filled up by others, uniting equal abilities with the ſame zeal and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs for the general welfare. Hope then wipes off the tears, with which ſorrow bedews the grave of departed worth. But on the preſent occaſion, no ſuch conſolation can be adminiſtered; for he, whoſe expectations are moſt ſanguine, dares not promiſe again to his country the union of ſo many ſplendid and uſeful virtues, as adorned that illuſtrious Man, whoſe memory excites our grateful and tender ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and to whoſe tomb the homage of his country is to be ſolemnly offered on this day. Whether we
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:037108_0003_100D8B910AE7B3C8"/>
conſult our own experience, by bringing into compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon with Waſhington, any of our cotemporaries, moſt eminent for their talents, virtues and ſervices; or whether we ſearch through the pages of hiſtory, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover in them a character of equal fame; juſtice and truth will acknowledge, that he ſtands ſupereminent and unrivalled in the annals of mankind; and that no one before him, acting in ſuch a variety of new and arduous ſituations, bore with him to the grave a repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation as clear from lawleſs ambition, and as undefiled by injuſtice or oppreſſion; a reputation, neither depreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by indolence, nor weakened by irreſolution, nor ſhadowed by thoſe imperfections, which ſeemed to be the eſſential appendages of human nature, till provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence exhibited in Waſhington this extraordinary phenomenon.</p>
            <p>What language can be equal to the excellence of ſuch a character? what proportion can exiſt between eloquence, and the tribute of praiſe, due to ſo much virtue? Nevertheleſs, my fellow citizens, I read in the eagerneſs of your attention, your deſire to offer this tribute: Methinks I hear your filial piety, your tender reverence for your beſt friend, the Father of his country, calling on me to bear for you, at leaſt a feeble testimony of your unextinguiſhable gratitude for his ſervices, your immortal remembrance of, and veneration for his virtues. In your name therefore, I preſume to add ſome grains of incenſe to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, which throughout the United States every friend to their happineſs now preſents at the ſhrine of Waſhington. Pardon, O departed Spirit of the first of
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:037108_0004_100D8B94010448D0"/>
Heroes! if with the cold accents of an exhausted imagination, I likewiſe dare attempt to celebrate thy name, whilst ſo many ſons of genius, ardent in youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful vigour, delineate in glowing colours the vivid features of thy mind, and the glorious deeds of thy virtuous life. With unequal steps I venture on the ſame career, not ſeeking to add lustre to the fame of Waſhington, or perpetuate his memory to future times; for he is already enſhrined in the records of immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality: but humbly hoping, that a recital of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices will open to our countrymen the road to true honour, and kindle in their breasts the warmth of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous emulation, and real patriotiſm. To contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute in this manner to the best interests of his belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed country, will be to him the most gratifying com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, if in the regions of immortality, human affairs still claim a ſhare of his ſolicitude.</p>
            <p>The language uniformly held by Waſhington, the maxim invariably inculcated and repeated by him in almost every public manifestation of his ſentiments, was the acknowledgement of a ſuperintending provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, preparing, regulating and governing all human events for the accompliſhment of its eternal purpoſes, and prediſpoſing the inſtruments, by which they are to be effected. Religion and obſervation had taught him, that God's provident wiſdom <hi>reacheth from end to end mightily, and disposeth all things sweetly.</hi> Wis. ch. 8. He contemplated with Christian piety, and the philoſophy of a Sage, the most remarkable revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions and occurrencies of former, as well as his own
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:037108_0005_100D8B959B0F2B78"/>
times; and learned there from to refer every human event to the moral government of a ſupreme intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent Being. This became the polar ſtar, by which he was guided in his progreſs through life, and in all his anxious ſolicitude for maintaining the liberty, perfecting the policy, preſerving the peace, inſuring the stability of his country on the foundations of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and morality, and guarding it against the turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of faction, licentiousneſs, foreign hoſtility and artifice.</p>
            <p>This virtuous maxim of religious, moral, and political wiſdom, ſo deeply impreſſed him, never perhaps was more illustrated, than by the courſe of providence in preparing and adapting his body and mind to ſuit the deſtinies of his life. He was to be himſelf a moſt luminous proof of that truth, which was ſo rooted in his ſoul.</p>
            <p>That infinite knowledge, which in its compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive range through the whole extent of creation, embraces the future, no leſs diſtinctly, than paſt and preſent contingencies, beheld the period approaching, when this vaſt portion of America, now conſtituting the U. States; this country ſpread through ſo many climates; ſo diverſified in its productions; ſo abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant in natural reſources; ſo benefited by land and water; ſo admirably calculated for the employment of induſtry, and for affording ſubſiſtance to millions and millions, was to break the bonds of its antient connection with G. Britain, and, emancipated from

vaſſalage, elevate itſelf to the ſtation of a great, powerful and independent Empire!</p>
            <p>A convulſion ſo violent in the political ſyſtem of Europe and America, involved the demolition of deeply rooted habits and opinions. The aſſociations ariſing out of conſanguinity, habitual intercourſe, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of government, identity of laws, language and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion were to be melted down, before that wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful revolution could be compleated. A new people, unconſcious before of their own ſtrength, were to feel in their phyſical and moral energies the ripeneſs of manhood. Accuſtomed to reſpect the nation, with which they would have to contend, as irreſiſtible in arms, and inexhauſtible in reſources, they muſt dare nevertheleſs to make the vigorous effort, and conceive a reliance on their own native ſtrength. Powerful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, the neceſſary effects of long eſtabliſhed govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, would naturally counteract every tendency to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards its downfall; but theſe intereſts were to be reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by force, and borne down by the enthuſiaſtic ardor of patriotiſm.</p>
            <p>To ſuperintend the movements, and operations of ſuch a revolution; to controul, during its progreſs, jealouſies, enmities, ſuſpicions, and other conflicting paſſions; and from their colliſion, to educe national and individual proſperity, peace, order, liberty and regular government; required the diſcernment and maſterly contrivance of that Supreme Director and Artiſt, who unites together the links, and holds in his hands the chain of all human events. Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plating,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:037108_0007_100D8B9A161DC228"/>
as much as is allowed to feeble mortals, his divine agency in preparing the means and conducting the progreſs of the American revolution, we may preſume to ſay, that heaven impreſſed a character on the life of Waſhington, and a temper on his ſoul, which eminently qualified him to bear the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous part, and be its principal inſtrument in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing this ſtupendous work.</p>
            <p>We trace as far back, as to his early youth, the evidences of this providential interpoſition. Born in times, and circumſtances, unfavourable to the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and exertions of bold enterpriſe, he however ſoon devoted himſelf to uſeful and active exerciſes. He diſdained the inglorious eaſe, and ignoble purſuits, which fettered, or perverted the talents of his young countrymen; unactive, not thro' choice, but want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing objects and encouragement. To deliver Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington from the danger of contracting ſimilar habits, he was inſpired to embrace the hardy diſcipline of difficult and perilous labours, which added vigour to his conſtitution, and a robuſtneſs to his nerves, that never after ſhrunk from danger. Following the inſtinct of his towering genius, he had not reached the years of manhood, when he was engaged in enterpriſes pregnant with terror, and preſenting to his view ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of a moſt formidable aſpect. He did not howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver enter on them with thoughtleſs temerity. At that early period he began, what he preſiſted in thro' life, to aſſociate motives of public utility with mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous undertakings. The uſual occupations of
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:037108_0008_100D8B9C04056B40"/>
his young countrymen were not a ſufficient employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for his active mind: he therefore turned his views towards that vaſt Weſtern region, now ſo fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to our ears and acquaintance, but then known only by the terrors it inſpired, and the cruelties practiced by the ſavage Indians, lurking in its foreſts and receſſes. He left the endearments of ſociety to explore the courſes of rivers, to traverse plains and mountains far beyond the then inhabited frontiers; hoping to diſcover ſources, whence future opulence might flow to his country; to examine the producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and eſtimate the fertility of immenſe tracts, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of rewarding the induſtry of thouſands, pining in want and oppreſſion in foreign lands; whoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendants might people the wilderneſs, beautify it by cultivation, and multiply the reſources of his native province. In theſe atchievements, the heroic youth was to inure himſelf to hunger and thirſt; to lie on the damp earth without any covering, but the ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing branches of the oak, and the canopy of the heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens; to accuſtom himſelf to the viciſſitudes of ſeaſons, the parching heat, and chilling froſt; to herd with the beaſts of the foreſt; to be expoſed to the toma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hawk and ſcalping knife; to be ſurrounded by diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, yet never be diſheartened; to meet at every ſtep the image of death, without ever being appalled, or admitting a momentary ſentiment of deſpair.</p>
            <p>Imagine not my fellow citizens, that this is an ideal and fanciful repreſentation of Waſhington's
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:037108_0009_100D8BA4739C1110"/>
youthful years. No: it is faintly, but truly copied from real ſcenes of his life. Who, on the wing of imagination, has followed him, clambering over the lofty Weſtern mountains, fording unfathomed and rapid rivers, expoſing his invaluable life to innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable accidents of treachery and hoſtility, without ſhuddering for his exiſtence, and admiring his cool, collected courage, in conquering obſtacles, and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting danger? Such was the training and educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by which Providence prepared him for the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fillment of his future deſtinies.</p>
            <p>Far different from his, were the motives, which urged the youth of Sparta and Rome to encounter toils of danger and oppoſition. They obeyed the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of their country; they were ſtimulated by the goad of aſpiring ambition, and a deſire of acquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that falſe glory, which, in the erroneous opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their cotemporaries, attached itſelf to the men, who carried devaſtation and carnage into the bowels of neighbouring nations. With better views, and ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior courage, Waſhington penetrated into the inhoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitable confines of the ſavage Indian; that he might render them the abodes of peace, and introduce into their boſom the improvements of civilization. So ſucceſsfully the guardian angel of this choſen Youth, miniſtring to the deſigns of Providence, had infuſed already into his ſoul the ſweet ſpirit of benevolence, together with heroical fortitude.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:037108_0010_100D8BA60A4FA218"/>For him it was decreed, in the progreſſion of his life, to defend, and ultimately to eſtabliſh, by juſt and neceſſary warfare, the liberties of his country. Providence therefore permitted a train of occurrences to enſue, which ſerved to furniſh his mind with the firſt rudiments of military ſcience, and diſcipline him to the vigilance and profeſſion of a ſoldier. At that time, two powerful European nations held North America in their ſubjection: their territories border<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on each other, and each claimed rights, diſallowed by its rival power. One of them, France, ſent out a military force and her Indian allies, to occupy poſts, deemed to be within the territory of Virginia, and contiguous to the ſtations, ſelected by Waſhington, as beſt adapted to the protection of his native land: for his intrepidity and local knowledge had already plac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him at the head of a ſmall body of his countrymen, collected together to ſtop the progreſs of the Invaders. With thoſe he covered the inhabitants from hoſtile encroachment; he won the confidence of the ſavage Indian; and conducted a dangerous and intricate ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gociation for a ſuſpenſion of hoſtilities.</p>
            <p>But the durable preſervation of peace depended not on the counſels of America. England and France tranſported their enmity to her ſhores, and covered our country with hoſtile array. England, confident of her proweſs and the diſcipline of her armies, would not commit the defence of her intereſts to raw Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincials. Waſhington's ardent ſoul ſuffered him not to remain behind in ſafety, while the ſecurity of his
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:037108_0011_100D8BA79DEC6298"/>
country was at ſtake. The hand of Providence lead him forward, that he might add to his experience and native fortitude. He fought under Braddock; and that ill-fated commander having paid by his death the tribute of his raſhneſs; his army diſpirited by defeat, and flying before an enemy fluſhed with victory; Waſhington in that perilous moment, gathered round him his firſt companions in arms, and reſcued out of the jaws of death the remains of the vanquiſhed bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallions. He did more: he ſtood in the front of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and every where oppoſing himſelf to the merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſavages, ready to burſt as a dark cloud, fraught with the thunderbolts of heaven, on a terrified land, he averted the ſtorm, and reſtored to his trembling country the ſerenity of hope, and peace.</p>
            <p>The theatre of war was tranſported afterwards to diſtant provinces of America. Then the ſame all-wiſe Providence, which had inured him to danger, prepared him for the toils of government, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant duty of ſuperintending, in his riper years, the political adminiſtration of a great and widely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended people. His ſervices in the field had won the confidence of his fellow citizens; they committed to his vigilance and integrity their higheſt intereſts in their legiſlative aſſembly. In this ſchool he perfected himſelf in the knowledge of mankind: he obſerved the contentions of parties, the artifices and conflicts of human paſſions: he ſaw the neceſſity of curbing them by ſalutary reſtraints: he ſtudied the complicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſcience of legiſlation: he learned to venerate the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:037108_0012_100D8BABF3388C80"/>
ſanctity of laws, to eſteem them as the palladium of civil ſociety, and deeply inbibed this maxim, ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant for the Soldier and the Stateſman, and which he ever after made the rule of his conduct, that the armed defenders of their country would break up the foundations of ſocial order and happineſs, if they availed themſelves of the turbulence of war, to violate the rights of private property, and perſonal liberty.</p>
            <p>Thus Waſhington, during the interval of peace, ſtored his mind with the treaſures of political wiſdom. The time was approaching for him to expend thoſe treaſures on his country's welfare.</p>
            <p>I need not recapitulate the origin of the diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents between G. Britain, and her American depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies. Suffice it to ſay, that America viewed the claims of the parent country, as incompatible with her freedom and happineſs. The great ſoul of Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington revolted at the idea of national degradation; but tempering his ardor with deliberate wiſdom, he aſſociated with other Sages of his country, to meditate on her new and critical ſituation.</p>
            <p>Here let us pauſe, fellow citizens, to contemplate this exalted man, revolving in his breaſt the natural and ſocial rights of human kind; comparing theſe with actual and impending grievances, and with the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations of an allegiance due to a long eſtabliſhed go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. Had lawleſs ambition reigned in his breaſt, he would have decided the public voice for immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate hoſtility. But in this point alſo, Providence deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tined
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:037108_0013_100D8BAD8C581090"/>
him to leave a memorable and ſalutary example, He was not dazzled by the proſpect of being elevated to the chief command of the military force of America. In his opinion, nothing could juſtify a recurrence to the ſword, and a revolt from eſtabliſhed authority, but extreme neceſſity. All reaſonable means of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs ſhould be tried, before a good citizen will diſſolve the fabric of government, and expoſe a people to the convulſive ſhocks of a revolution, the exploſions of which no conſiderate man can promiſe himſelf to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate, or foreſee their termination.</p>
            <p>A reflection here forces itſelf upon my mind, which I ought not to withold from my reſpectable au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors. Would to God, that the principal authors and leaders of the many revolutions, through which unhappy France has paſſed in the courſe of a few years, would to God, that they had been influenced by a morality as pure and enlightened, as that of Waſhington, and his aſſociates in the firſt Congreſs! What ſcenes of carnage and cruelty! what private woes and public calamity would have been ſpared to that ill-fated country? and how ſacred and venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble would have ſtill remained to it the ſanctuary of religion?</p>
            <p>Waſhington and his colleagues obeying at the ſame time the dictates of patriotiſm, and the duty of allegiance, repreſented their wrongs to their Sovereign, and claimed their rights. On the event of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance, depended the redreſs of their grievances; or, if no redreſs followed, their juſtification for ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:037108_0014_100D8BB010A60A08"/>
on their defence. Britain would not relent, and all, that remained to America, was ſubmiſſion, or reſiſtance. The election was ſoon made; every one prepared himſelf for the awful conteſt, and all eyes and hopes were turned towards Waſhington. With univerſal approbation he was ſummoned to place himſelf in the front of danger, and aſſume ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme military command. The poſſeſſion of ſuch a citizen, at a moment ſo critical, was an invaluable treaſure, and an animating preſage of the favourable iſſue of the great conteſt.</p>
            <p>But far other thoughts abſorbed his attention. Modeſt, as he was eminent in valour and wiſdom, he contemplated with mingled emotions of ſelf-diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and generous reſolution, the important ſtake placed in his hands; the ſubjection or independence; the vaſſalage or freedom of an immenſe territory, deſtined to be the habitation of countleſs millions. When therefore, in obedience to the voice of his country, he placed himſelf at the head of her army, the expreſſions of his dependence on Providence ſhould never be forgotten. Claiming no perſonal merit, apprehenſive of injuring the public intereſt through ſome miſconduct; yet truſting to the juſtice of his cauſe, and conſcious of the purity of his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, he called upon his fellow citizens to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that he depended for ſucceſs, not on his own military ſkill, but on the God of battles, to whom he made his ſolemn appeal.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:037108_0015_100D8BB1D5C593F0"/>Waſhington, now at a period of his higheſt ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, drew on him the attention, not only of this Weſtern Continent; but of every European nation. O fellow citizens! what days and years of anxious diſquietude revolved over us, whilſt we gazed on this ſplendid luminary, uncertain whether it would ſhed on its country the effulgence of victory and peace, crowned by liberty; or whether its brightneſs would be ſhadowed by the clouds of diſaſter and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat?</p>
            <p>Here language fails: I dare not, I cannot follow the heroic Waſhington in the career of his military glory. To baffle the ſtratagems of the ableſt Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, to repel the onſet of the braveſt, and beſt diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plined armies, what had America to place in his hands? neither ſoldiers trained to arms, or accuſtomed to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination; nor the implements of war, nor the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures to purchaſe them. But the genius of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander finally ſupplied every deficiency. He intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced order and diſcipline; inſpired love and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; and with theſe auxiliaries, he kept together uncloathed and unpaid armies, which, under other generals, would perhaps have demanded juſtice at the point of their bayonets. Always vigilant to foil hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile attempts, he exhauſted the reſources of the enemy, without ſuffering them to force him to action. Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the blood of his fellow ſoldiers, and never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing their lives without cauſe, or proſpect of advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, humanity was as dear to him, as victory; as his enemies, that fell into his power, always experienced.
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:037108_0016_100D8BB6878F9BA0"/>
When a decree of retaliation became neceſſary to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain their licentious exceſſes, with what delicacy, without the leaſt abatement of fortitude, did he ſave the life of the victim, devoted to atone for the cruelty, that had been committed on an American officer? not however till he had compelled the oppoſing General to reſtrain and diſavow outrages, that aggravate ſo much the neceſſary evils of war. How ſacred was his reſpect to the civil authority; how effectual his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the property of his fellow citizens? When the generous feelings of the virtuous and beneficient Lewis, whoſe deplorable fate ſhould draw tears of blood from every American heart, ſent out his Nobles, and legions, to combat by his ſide, the dignity of his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and his unaſſuming merit won their entire con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence: His integrity, and conciliating ſpirit united, as a band of Brothers, nations before unknown to each other, and totally different in manners, habits and religion. Their union, of which he was the ſoul, was a new omen of victory, and gained for America the prize, for which ſhe bled and contended; honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able peace and Independence.</p>
            <p>What but unfading laurels remained now for Waſhington, after ſatisfying his honeſt ambition, and ſteering the veſſel of the American republic, through ſo many ſtorms, into the ſafe harbour of liberty and tranquillity? It remained for him to leave this impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant leſſon to the chiefs of armies, veſted with great commands; that magnanimity and true glory conſiſt in laying down their ſwords at their country's ſeet, when the object is attained, for which alone it was permitted to draw them. It remained for him, after
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:037108_0017_100D8BB8E71831A8"/>
abdicating public employments, to exhibit in the ſhade of retirement thoſe private virtues, which are the true foundations of national proſperity. Dutiful to this moral principle, Waſhington, before he left his army, ſtipulated for no perſonal reward, and even refuſed all that could be offered: Unmindful of himſelf, he was only ſollicitous to obtain for his faithful legions a generous and liberal acknowledgment of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy and valour. This being effected, as far as it depended on him, he reſigned the inſignia of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to thoſe, from whom he had received it, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed the rank of a private citizen, carrying with him into his domeſtic retreat, the eſteem, reſpect and veneration of an admiring world.</p>
            <p>Here the curtain drops, and ſeems to cloſe for ever from the public eye and public duty this wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful man. His country has no more right to diſturb his calm repoſe: He has paid ſuperabundantly her claim to his ſervices. But the views of providence over him are not yet compleated: Peace and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence are obtained; but to preſerve them, experience ſoon made it manifeſt, that to invigorate with one ſpirit the vaſt maſs of population throughout the U: States one general ſuperintending government was eſſentially requiſite, which ſaving the rights of all, ſhould likewiſe be competent to command the ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of all for the public weal; to maintain order with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and repel aggreſſion from abroad; inforce the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of juſtice, and diffuſe over important national acts, dignity, energy, unity of deſign and execution. Waſhington's penetration ſoon diſcovered the want of ſuch a government, &amp; in a paternal, affectionate addreſs to his countrymen, had bequeathed on them, as a lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:037108_0018_100D8BBA83976B18"/>
his earneſt recommendation for its eſtabliſhment.</p>
            <p>Various cauſes delayed the execution of this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary work, till the edifice of American indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, unſupported by its neceſſary pillars, was crumbling into ruin. Then every friend to his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try remembered Waſhington's fatherly advice; eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry patriotic hand was ready to prop up the tottering fabric. Wiſdom and experience combined to blend in a republican form of government all the advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, of which other forms are productive, without many of their evils. Our illuſtrious Deliverer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided at the deliberations, which produced it: The American people beſought him once more to quit his beloved retreat, and perfect a work, of which he had been the firſt founder and a principal architect. The earneſtneſs of their requeſt overpowered his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctant mind; he could not reſiſt their unanimous wiſhes, nor could any perſonal dangers ſtand in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition with the advancement of general happineſs. Yet how immenſe were his ſacrifices! how perilous his hazards! Sacrifices known only to them, who having ſpent their beſt years in tranſactions, that kept every nerve on the ſtretch, are permitted in the evening of their days to taſte of the calm repoſe of rural felicity, and the ſolace of domeſtic endearments. Diſheartening was the proſpect in venturing again on the agitated ocean of national reſponſibility. There ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſted not in the world a name ſo bright as his: no charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtood on ſuch lofty preeminence. Shall he expoſe theſe to the capricious fluctuations of popular opinion? Shall he embark, the treaſure of a reputation purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by ſo many ſervices, on a ſea, ſown thick with rocks of envy, pride and diſappointment? Theſe were ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:037108_0019_100D8BBC998639B8"/>
to appall a heart leſs ſublime, and leſs inflamed with genuine patriotiſm. But ſuch conſiderations had no effect on him, and he took into his hands the helm of the State.</p>
            <p>What were the effects of his adminiſtration? are we not deceived by magical deluſion? or is the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, which our ſenſes witneſs, really effected? Have the U. States riſen from a lethagic, impoveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, degraded condition to activity, opulence and reſpect? Does the farmer receive a generous retri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution for his induſtry? does the merchant cover the ſeas with his ſhips, conveying to every clime the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of our native ſoil? does the public creditor obtain ſecurity and payment for his generous reliance on national faith? does juſtice diſpenſe her equitable awards to every ſuitor approaching her ſanctuary? do diſtant nations reſpect the counſels, and ſollicit the friendſhip of the U. States? are the natives of every land wafted to our ſhores, as to the refuge of peace, the reſidence of true liberty? Yes, fellow citizens, this is not deluſion. Theſe are the real effects and monuments of Waſhington's adminiſtration. Yet it was thwarted and embarraſſed by internal oppoſition, and foreign intrigue. Scarce had we taſted of the ſweets of peace, enlivened by induſtry and commerce, when attempts were made to raviſh from us theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable bleſſings, and plunge us into the horrors of war: not only of war, but of a war of that kind, which connecting our intereſts and fate with that of a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, delivered up to anarchy, and a prey to frantic, outrageous paſſions, would have tended to extinguiſh amongſt us the principles of morality; inflame us with the rage of innovation; intoxicate us with deluſive,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:037108_0020_100D8BBF722D5640"/>
ruinous theories of government; and moſt probably, would have ſubſtituted them to that excellent conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, which is, and may it long continue to be! our pride and happineſs. But, thanks to thy immortal ſpirit, O ever dear and venerable Father of thy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try! thy wiſdom diſcerned the approaching ſtorm, and thy firmneſs baffled its violence. Our peace and conſtitution remain to us, unimpaired. No foreign influence dictated to the counſels of America. She increaſed in vigour; ſhe roſe in character; and by ſelf-government, by keeping herſelf diſentangled from the ſtrifes of contending nations, ſhe evinced herſelf worthy of her independence.</p>
            <p>After ſettling his country in this deſirable ſtate, Waſhington had fulfilled the deſtinies of that provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which formed him for the exalted purpoſe of diffuſing the choiceſt bleſſings over millions of men, and preparing the ſame for millions yet unborn. His wiſh to bury himſelf again in the ſhades of retirement returned on him with redoubled force; to hide, if poſſible, his greatneſs from the world; and in the ſweet repoſe of domeſtic life, diverſified however by uſeful and honourable occupations, to forget his paſt glory. The laſt act of his ſupreme magiſtracy was to inculcate in moſt impreſſive language on his country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, or rather on his deareſt children, this, his deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate and ſolemn advice; to bear inceſſantly in their minds, that nations and individuals are under the moral government of an infinitely wiſe and juſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence; that the foundations of their happineſs are morality and religion; and their union amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves their rock of ſafety: that to venerate their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution and its laws is to inſure their liberty. Then
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:037108_0021_100D8BC3C15439A8"/>
he took his tender farewell of public employments, devoting the remainder of his precious life to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable ſelf-review of it, through all its viciſſitudes and agitations; a review, for which every wiſe man, knowing his accountability to a ſovereign Judge, ſhould allot time and make opportunity.</p>
            <p>After endeavouring thus far to ſatisfy our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon duty to our illuſtrious Deliverer, before I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, I am earneſt, my fellow citizens, to leave im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed on you, in ſtrong characters, ſome principal features of his mind, and furniſh you with ſhort me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morials of his moſt remarkable actions, hoping there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to perpetuate your gratitude, and incite you to emulate his virtues. Happily, to ſupply my inabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, I find this taſk executed, as it would ſeem, by the ſpirit of prophecy, and in the language of inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the 8th chapter of the book of <hi>Wisdom</hi>; where the author's expreſſions need no comment to appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate them to Waſhington. So ſtriking the reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance! ſo true is the picture! Here are the words of the inſpired writer: <q>I purpoſed, ſays he, to take wiſdom with me to live with me, knowing that ſhe will communicate with me of her good things, and will be a comfort in my care—for her ſake I ſhall have glory among the multitude, and honour with the antient, though I am young; and—I ſhall be admired in the ſight of the mighty, and the faces of princes ſhall wonder at me.—By the means of her, I ſhall have immortality, and ſhall leave behind me an everlaſting memory to them, that come after me. I ſhall ſet the people in order, and nations ſhall be ſubject to me. Terrible kings hearing ſhall be afraid of me; among the multitude I ſhall be found
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:037108_0022_100D8BC558F1CDA0"/>
good and valiant in war. When I go into my houſe, I ſhall repoſe myſelf with her; for her converſation hath no bitterneſs, nor her company any tedious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but joy and gladneſs. Thinking theſe things with myſelf, and pondering them in my heart, that to be allied to wiſdom, is immortality.—I went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſeeking, that I might take her to myſelf.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In this picture, every ſtroke of the pencil exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits traits of Waſhington. The early maturity of his judgment was the fruit of his youthful conferences with wiſdom. She initiated him into her counſels, and procured for him love, reſpect, honour, confidence, authority and command: She enabled him to <hi>set the people in order</hi> by good government, and an impartial, diſintereſted adminiſtration of it; and when, all pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic duties fulfilled, he <hi>went to his houſe</hi> to repoſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>no tediousness</hi> or <hi>bitterness</hi> mingled themſelves in their converſation, but <hi>joy and gladness,</hi> ſerenity of mind, and the pleaſing proſpect of conſcious inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity.</p>
            <p>Providence having preſerved and lengthened his days, that he might rear up his country in the infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of her independence, ſuffered him now to withdraw himſelf from the diſquietudes of government. He had infuſed the ſpirit of his adminiſtration into all its departments. His excellent Succeſſor inherited, not only the mantle of his office, but his wiſdom, firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and love of peace, ſubordinate only to a determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of never purchaſing it, at the price of national diſhonour.</p>
            <p>Waſhington beheld from his retirement, as the Jewiſh legiſlator from the ſummit of mount Phaſga, the flouriſhing proſperity of his country. Health
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:037108_0023_100D8BC7F1154308"/>
ſweetened his repoſe and rural occupations; his body and mind retained their uſual vigour. We flattered ourſelves with the expectation of his continuing long to retain them: Joy beamed in our hearts, when on every annual revolution, we gratefully hailed this, his auſpicious birthday. But, alas! how dark is the cloud, that now overſhadows it? The ſongs of feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity converted into the throbs of mourning! The prayers of thankſgiving for his health and life chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into lamentations for his death! Who feels not for him, as for his deareſt friend, his protector, and his Father? Whilſt he lived, we ſeemed to ſtand on loftier ground, for breathing the ſame air, inhabiting the ſame country, and enjoying the ſame conſtitution and laws, as the ſublime and magnanimous Waſhing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton. He was inveſted with a glory, that ſhed a luſtre on all around him. For his country's ſafety, he often had braved death, when clad in her moſt terrific form: he had familiariſed himſelf with her aſpect; at her approaching to cut the thread of his life, he behold her with conſtancy and ſerenity; and with his laſt breath, as we may believe from knowing the ruling paſſion of his ſoul, he called to heaven to ſave his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and recommended it to the continual protection of that Providence, which he ſo reverently adored. May his prayer have been heared! May theſe United States flouriſh in pure and undefiled religion, in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, peace, union, liberty and the enjoyment of their excellent Conſtitution, as long as reſpect, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and veneration ſhall gather round the name of Waſhington; that is, whilſt there ſhall be any ſurviv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing record of human events.</p>
