            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>IS eaſie and uſeful to obſerve how the Word of God frequently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents the Ruler of his People in a <hi>twofold</hi> Light: In the <hi>One,</hi> we behold him raiſed up by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Appointment &amp; Providence to Rule and Judge the People; In the <hi>other,</hi> we view him on a Level with every Subject to be ruled and judged by the ſame Laws and Lord. With relation to the former of theſe Capacities, we have had frequent Diſcourſes upon theſe Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, have ſeen the civil Ruler fixed in his Poſt, cloathed with Authority from the great Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the World, made the Miniſter of his Providence, <hi>A Revenger to execute Wrath upon him that doth evil,</hi> Rom. 1. 3. 4. and a Protector to defend him that doth well. And have heard the People <hi>put in mind to be ſubject to Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and Powers, to obey Magiſtrates,</hi> Tit. 3. 1. not only for <hi>wrath,</hi> but alſo for <hi>Conſcience ſake.</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:006131_0005_1027F0B1EC14F920"/>
It mayn't then be unſeaſonable to treat of civil Rulers in their ſubjected Capacity, <hi>as under the Law to Christ,</hi> and in Conformity to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired Preacher in our Text, declare their Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations to Zion's King, who demands their Submiſſion and Obedience.</p>
            <p>In this Pſalm the Spirit of Propheſy teſtifies and declares the mighty oppoſition that would be made to the Redeemer's Kingdom, the Victories and triumphs of his Grace, and the extent of his Empire notwithſtanding, that he ſhould have <hi>the Heathen for an Inheritance, and the uttermost parts of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

His invincible power ſhould ruin them ſuddenly, eaſily and irrecoverably.

Learn <hi>Wiſdom</hi> &amp; <hi>Inſtruction</hi> from theſe memorable Events, theſe evident Diſplays of mercy and wrath; that you reſiſt not his Authority, nor contemn his Laws, but caſt down your Crowns &amp; Sceptres, your Honours and Intereſts at his Feet. This advice belongs to all both high &amp; low, rich &amp; poor together, for all are equally concern'd to become obedient <hi>to the Lord from Heaven.</hi> Only 'tis directed to
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:006131_0006_1027F0B375499DE8"/>
Kings and Judges, the Heads &amp; Leaders of a People, whoſe Examples have ordinarily a prevailing Influence upon thoſe under them. Their <hi>Obedience to the Faith</hi> opens a great Door and effectual unto the Goſpel of Chriſt, and their <hi>Diſobedience</hi> ſhuts up the Kingdom of Heaven againſt Men. Thus mightily prevail'd that argument, Joh. 7, 48. <hi>Have any of the Rulers, or of the Phariſees believed on him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The intervening verſe contains the <hi>general</hi> Matter of Duty enjoined on them, together with the Direction how to qualify it. <hi>Serve the Lord with Fear, rejoice with trembling,</hi> v. 11. <hi>Serve the Lord,</hi> for he is your Maker and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver, Friend and Benefactor, Redeemer and Judge. <hi>With Fear, with awful Fear</hi> &amp; ſolemn Caution, for the Lord is a holy &amp; jealous God, who cannot be deceived &amp; will not be mocked, <hi>who accepteth not the Perſon of Princes, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardeth the Rich more than the poor,</hi> Job 34. 19. <hi>Who will cut off the ſpirit of Princes, and is ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible to the Kings of the Earth,</hi> if they rebel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 76. 12. <hi>With filial Fear</hi> and Reverence, for he is a God of tender mercies and great Kindneſs, and delights in them who are free &amp; chearful in his Service. And thô you <hi>rejoice</hi> in all that the Lord has done to and for you, in that he has honoured you before his People, and ſet you among Princes &amp; great Men on the Earth, and has brôt you under the
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:006131_0007_1027F0B7B4BF9210"/>
Diſpenſation of his Grace; Yet conſider that abſolute rejoicing is the Condition and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy of Angels, and not of Men, who are to qualify this grateful Exerciſe <hi>with trembling,</hi> leſt they receive the Grace &amp; Goodneſs of God in vain, leſt being lifted up to heaven, exalted high in Honours and Privileges, they are brôt down to Hell. Raiſed Circumſtances prove a Snare to many, Joh. 5. 44. <hi>How can ye believe who receive Honour One of another, and ſeek not the Honour that cometh from God only?</hi> And the great do fall when the Lord ariſes to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe Judgment. Pſal. 110. 5, 6. <hi>He ſhall ſtrike thrô Kings in the Day of his Wrath, and ſhall wound the Heads over many Countries.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>rejoice with trembling.</hi> Thus their Duty in <hi>General</hi> is ſet forth and qualified.</p>

They wou'd have withheld their impious hands, and not have crucified their <hi>King.</hi> This our Saviour pleaded on their behalf when nailed to the croſs, ſuffering the dire Effects of their Malice, Luk. 23. 24. <hi>Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.</hi>

The once humbled &amp; ſuffering ſtate of the Redeemer was for a Stone of ſtumbling and Rock of offence to the Houſe of Iſrael: They wou'd not have <hi>this Man,</hi> ſo mean of Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, ſo low in outward circumſtances, <hi>to rule over them:</hi> Yet to prevent offence we hear the Holy Ghoſt when foretelling his Incarnation, at the ſame time giving him thoſe Titles which beſpeak him very God, <hi>our rightful Sovereign.</hi> Iſa. 9. 6, 7. <hi>Unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given, and the Government ſhall be upon his Shoulder: And his Name ſhall be called, Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful, Counſeller, the mighty God, the everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Father, the Prince of Peace. Of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of his Government &amp; Peace there ſhall be no End, upon the Throne of David and upon his Kingdom to order it, and to eſtabliſh it with Juſtice and Judgment, from henceforth even for Ever.</hi> Oppoſite hereto is the <hi>Socinian Creed</hi> which acknowleges Chriſt but as a meer Man, denies the Lord that has bought us the Glory due to his Name, and makes void that <hi>Godly</hi> Subjection to him which we owe. It robs our Religion of One of its chief &amp; peculiar Glories, and rejects the Head-corner Stone in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Building. Thus the fooliſh Builders in the jewiſh Church did, to their own Overthrow and Diſperſion. We ſee fulfilled in them thoſe awful words, Mat. 21. 44. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall fall on this Stone, ſhall be broken: But on whomſoever

it ſhall fall, it will grind him to powder.</hi> That People are <hi>broken,</hi> and become as <hi>Powder</hi> or <hi>Dust</hi> that is ſcattered over the Face of the Earth. Why then wou'd any, thro' the pride and naughtineſs of their Hearts, revive that dangerous Creed which was the Root of the Jews Infidelity &amp; Ruin; and in Vindication of which they cou'd not anſwer a word, when Chriſt put that plain convincing Queſtion to them, Mat. 22. 43, 44, 45. <hi>He ſaith unto them, How then did David in ſpirit call him Lord, ſaying, the Lord ſaid unto my Lord, ſit thou on my right hand, 'till I make thine Enemies thy footſtool? If David then call him Lord, how is he his Son?</hi> They did not, or they wou'd not know the Meſſiah to be <hi>Lord,</hi> "which Truth was the only Key to unlock this Difficulty." But bleſſed be God, who hath hid theſe things from the wiſe and prudent and revealed them unto Babes, hath divinely taught ſo many of the Sons and Daughters of men this Myſtery of Godlineſs, <hi>God manifest in the Fleſh. That David's Son is David's Lord;</hi> hath unveiled their Eyes to behold him ſitting on a Throne high and lifted up; Iſa. 6. 1. <hi>Having on his Veſture and on his Thigh a Name written,</hi> KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 16.

            <p n="2">2. Secondly, <hi>Subjection to Christ implies the Knowlege of his Laws and the receiving of them and them only as the Rule to govern us.</hi> With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Conſent there is no Subjection: And <hi>Qui non ſenitit, non conſentit.</hi> He that underſtands not the Law, can't conſent to it as his Rule.

And the <hi>great Work</hi> of his ſtanding Miniſtry in the Church, <hi>even</hi> to give People plain, full and faithful Information of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of the Goſpel, that they may <hi>know the things which belong to their Peace,</hi> and if they rebel they may <hi>have no cloak for their Sin.</hi>

the world from <hi>ſuch,</hi> our King came into it to Execute the office of a Prophet, to be the <hi>Light of Men,</hi> Luk. 2. 32. <hi>A Light to lighten the Gentiles, and the Glory of his People Iſrael,</hi> i. e.

            <p>Now then he Expects that we Submit to theſe <hi>Laws only</hi> which he has given us.

Such things have ariſen from and been impoſed by Perſons affecting Singularity, or gratifying a proud, ſelf-exalting &amp; lordly Temper. A ſmall acquaintance with eccleſiaſtical hyſtory ſufficiently evidences what an Enemy humane Impoſitions have been to the Laws of Chriſt's Kingdom. How contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry they have wrought to the pure Deſigns of the Goſpel, how they have deſtroy'd that <hi>Peace</hi> &amp; <hi>Charity,</hi> which is the <hi>bond of perfectneſs,</hi> and <hi>to which we are called,</hi> Col. 3. 14, 15.

            </p>
            <p>Surely, Chriſt, <hi>The Wiſdom of God,</hi> knows beſt what Laws will befriend &amp; ſerve his own Kingdom, and theſe he has furniſhed us with, and confined us to, as the <hi>only Rule</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Practice,</hi> and they are ſufficient to make <hi>the Man of God perfect,</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 17.</p>

            <p n="4">4. Fourthly, To receive Chriſt as our King, ſuppoſes a Conſideration of, and conſent to the Inconveniences that may attend his Subjects. <hi>They must thrô much Tribulation enter into the Kingdom of God,</hi> Acts 14. 22. They muſt not only ſhare in common with others the ordinary Calamities of Life, but endure many Troubles that are peculiar to the People of God; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially at a time when Iniquity does abound, when Truth &amp; Order are oppoſed, when <hi>falſe Brethren</hi> creep in, and blind Zeal puſhes them on, the may they expect violent <hi>Aſſaults</hi> and opprobious <hi>Inſults,</hi> and all manner of Evil ſpoken againſt them falſely. Wherefore that they might not take offence at the Croſs, our Lord has beforehand propounded the terms of Diſcipleſhip, thoſe that are moſt diſpleaſing &amp; contrary to Fleſh &amp; Blood. See <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 4. where Jeſus ſpeaking to his Diſciples of the Sufferings that were like to come upon them, ſays, <hi>Theſe things have I told you, that when the time ſhall come, ye may remember that I told you of them,</hi> That you mayn't be ſhaken in your Minds, nor look on them as a wrong done you.

Of this ſort was <hi>a certain Scribe</hi> who came to Chriſt with this precipitant Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, <hi>Maſter, I will follow thee whitherſoever thou goest,</hi> Mat. 8. 19. Therefore our Lord who knew his heart, his raſhneſs, and what he needed to conſider more of, replies to him, ver. 20. <hi>The Foxes have holes, and the Birds of the Air have Neſts; but the Son of Man hath not where to lay his head.</hi> Can you follow ſuch a Maſter who has no Wealth to beſtow upon you, no Houſe to invite you to, or entertain you in? This likely ſtopt his mouth and changed his purpoſe; we have no anſwer from him. We can't be Diſciples too ſoon, if we are willing to deny Self But Chriſt deſires no followers who will Diſhonour him more by their Apoſtacy than they do honour to him by their Profeſſion. Mat. 16. 24. <hi>If any Man will come after me, let him deny himſelf and take up his Croſs and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me.</hi>

'Tis impoſſible in the Nature of things and by the Conſtitution of the Goſpel, that Chriſt's Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects ſhould live in Sin. Rom. 6. 16. <hi>Know ye not, that to whom ye yield your ſelves Servants to obey, his ſervants ye are to whom ye obey; whither of Sin unto Death, or of Obedience unto Righteouſneſs.</hi> Therefore we muſt renounce our Luſts if we wou'd join ourſelves to the Lord.

There are many that profeſs to <hi>Kiſs the Son,</hi> yet cleave in Love to their Luſts. Many from Cuſtom or blind Affection <hi>call him Lord, Lord,</hi> whom he will treat as wicked Servants; not as Subjects, but as Rebels, becauſe they do not the things that he has commanded them. Mat. 7. 21. <hi>Not every one that ſaith unto me, Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, but he that doth the Will of my Father which is in Heaven.</hi>

            <p n="6">6. Once more Sixthly, <hi>To take Christ as our King to reign in us, will ever accompany Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to him.</hi> He has given us Laws enough to ruin us, if he does not bow our Wills and encline our Hearts to obſerve them. The

Kingdom of Chriſt is <hi>ſpiritual, 'tis within us.</hi> He reigns in his People, as well as rules over them: Otherwiſe we might become an eaſie Prey to our Luſts &amp; ſpiritual Adverſaries.

Hence we may ſay with the Prophet, Zech. 12. 8. <hi>He that is feeble ſhall be as David.</hi> Senſible of his own weakneſs, and taking hold of the ſtrength of the Lord, ſhall conquer; becauſe <hi>greater is he that is in us, than he that is in the world,</hi> 1 Joh. 4. 4. Such a King becomes us, who is able to fulfil in us all the good pleaſure of his Goodneſs, and the work of Faith with power, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 11. We now proceed to the <hi>Second</hi> General Head.</p>
            <p>II. To ſhew that Subjection to Chriſt <hi>is the Rulers truest Wiſdom.</hi> And this point I ſhall conſider, and eſtabliſh <hi>only</hi> with reference to their advanced State among Men, as they are God's Officers; from the five following Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe Subjection to our Lord is <hi>the moſt eſſential &amp; uſeful Qualification in a chriſtian Magiſtrate;</hi> and that which adds a Glory to all his other Gifts &amp; Endowments. When King <hi>David</hi> drew near the end of his Days &amp; Reign,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:006131_0020_1027F0DD35375250"/>
he aſſembles together the Princes of the Tribes and Captains, and in their Preſence and for their Benefit, he gives this <hi>Charge</hi> to <hi>Solomon</hi> who was to ſit on the Throne after him; A <hi>Charge</hi> that peculiarly reſpected him as he was to be Ruler and Head of Iſrael, 1 Chron. 28. 9. <hi>And thou, Solomon my Son, know thou the God of thy Father, and ſerve him with a perfect heart and a willing Mind.</hi> Other Qualifications there are which beautifie &amp; adorn a Prince, but <hi>this</hi> of a <hi>heart devoted</hi> to God is <hi>chief</hi> of all; and will appear ſo under the apprehenſion of Death and Judgment, when our Thôts are fixt, and moſt likely to weigh things in an equal Balance.</p>
            <p>This Qualification is moſt pleaſing to God and beneficial to Men; and therefore challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges the firſt &amp; chief Attention of our Rulers, whether of a <hi>Legiſlative</hi> or <hi>Executive</hi> Capacity. This is the main Ballaſt in a tempeſtuous Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the beſt Friend &amp; help to ſtability &amp; faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs under all Temptations, when courted by the Flatteries of Fawners, or reproached by the Tongues of Male-contents. This renders Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers true and upright in their reſpective Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations, to purſue the great <hi>End</hi> of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is the <hi>general Good</hi> and Benefit of <hi>Subjects.</hi> To <hi>protect</hi> the righteous, and <hi>puniſh</hi> the wicked: to countenance and ſupport Men in the free Exerciſe &amp; practice of Religion, that <hi>they may lead quiet &amp; peaceable lives in all God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs

and Honeſty,</hi> 1 Tim. 2. 2. And to ſecure to them their perſonal Rights &amp; Properties againſt all Injury &amp; Violence, <hi>that they may ſit down every Man under his own Vine, and under his own Fig-tree, and that there may be none to make them afraid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Devotedneſs to God is directly oppoſite to that ſelfiſh Principle which reigns in the world, which ſends thouſands to Hell, which is the grand Incendiary of Diſcord &amp; Convulſions in Church &amp; State, which has overturn'd Kingdoms on Earth, and rooted out the Rulers of them.</p>
            <p>Magiſtrates in making Laws, as they are God's Officers they <hi>ought,</hi> as they are his loyal Subjects they <hi>will</hi> conſult his word, make that the Man of their counſel, and frame all their Laws in agreement with <hi>his,</hi> which are the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Standard: And in executing Laws, they will regard the End &amp; Meaning of them more than the Letter, that they may do Juſtice and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And they will not dare from Favour or Affection to diſpenſe with thoſe Laws which their Oath and Office oblige them to Execute. They will puniſh thoſe Tranſgreſſions with moſt Rigour which the divine Law is moſt ſevere againſt, and in thoſe Caſes where the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Law exceeds it, they will incline to mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and acquittal.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Fear of the Lord</hi> which is on theſe his Subjects, will deliver them from the <hi>Fear of
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:006131_0022_1027F0E05579F878"/>
Man which brings a Snare;</hi> and ſhut their Ears from hearing of Lies &amp; falſe-hoods; and <hi>cauſe them to deſpiſe the Gain of Oppreſſions, and to ſhake their Hands from holding Bribes,</hi> Iſa. 33. 15 Yea, this religious Principle will direct them to promote Men of Truth &amp; Integrity to places of publick Truſt. <hi>In their Eyes a vile perſon is contemned, but they honour them that fear the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 15. 4.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A Life of true Piety or Devotedneſs to the Lord is the Rulers trueſt Wiſdom, <hi>on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the mighty Influence their Example has upon the common People.</hi> Nothing is more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious than this, from the Reigns of the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah:</hi> Often is it ſaid of their wicked Princes, that <hi>they ſinned and made Iſrael to Sin;</hi> Not that they forced them to it, but they led and Encouraged them in it by their own bad Examples and Counſels. And when good religious Princes ſat on the Throne of David, who ſerved the Lord God of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers with all their hearts, they recovered the People from idolatrous worſhip, to the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe and Practice of true Religion, which is the main Pillar and foundation of publick Peace &amp; Proſperity. Agreeable hereto is that Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the wiſeſt of Kings, Prov. 20. 8. <hi>A King ſitting in the Throne of Judgment ſcattereth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all Evil with his Eyes.</hi> The Example of Rulers is <hi>a living Law.</hi> And as to matters of
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:006131_0023_1027F0E58C7F5B28"/>
               <hi>pure Religion,</hi> it has a much greater tendency and power to direct and Influence the People, than all the Laws they can make, and all the Sanctions they can add to them. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and Threatnings of temporal Rewards and Puniſhments can reach only Mens outward Actions, but a holy Life carries that Majeſty and ſweetneſs in it, which tend at once to awe the Conſcience and gain the Affection &amp; Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Obſervers. May our Rulers in this ſenſe be the <hi>Salt of the Earth</hi> to ſeaſon a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Age, that all may more and more <hi>ſavour the things that be of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I may add here, that it is the Rulers wiſdom to live <hi>Godlily,</hi> with regard to thoſe <hi>Murmurers and Complainers</hi> whom the Apoſtle <hi>Jude</hi> writes againſt, as the troublers &amp; corrupters of Church and Common-wealth. Men of ſuch a perverſe and rebellious Spirit were not peculiar to his day, but our own times have brôt forth many of them, whoſe Practice, not to ſay their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, has been, <hi>to deſpiſe Dominion, to ſpeak evil of Dignities and revile the Rulers of God's People.</hi> 'Tis eaſie then to ſee the advantage of a divine Life in Rulers, not only as it will lift you up above all Fear of their Terror, but may ſink them into ſhame and Confuſion; and prevent the Minds of others being leavened with their corrupt Principles, and thro' the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Mercy to them, <hi>they may by your good

            <p n="3">3. 'Tis the wiſdom of Rulers to be pious, <hi>as this wins from the people a more hearty Reſpect and chearful Obedience.</hi> Not but the beſt of Kings may have ſome of the worſt of Subjects. David had a Rebel and a Traitor in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom &amp; family; Yet ordinarily 'tis otherwiſe. Even bad Men have a Reverence for Religion, and reſpect them that bear God's Image and Likeneſs. <hi>Power</hi> when alone creates <hi>Fear. Wilt thou not be afraid of the Power?</hi> Rom. 13. 3. And this Fear of the Ruler, without a perſwaſion of his Piety, often begets perpetual Jealouſies &amp; Uneaſineſs in People: And theſe are ſtrengthened from the many Inſtances wherein Power without Goodneſs has degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated into Tyranny &amp; Oppreſſion, and Wiſdom into Craft and Deſign. Hence that in Prov. 28. 15, <hi>As a roaring Lion, and a ranging Bear, ſo is a wicked Ruler over the poor People.</hi> He is a Terror to them.

               </gap>. 28.</p>
            <p n="4">4. To be religious is the Rulers wiſdom, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God often metes out Mercies or Judgments to a People, on the account of the good or bad behaviour of thoſe that rule them.</hi> Many ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable Inſtances of this Nature are in the word of God, of his viſiting the Iniquities of Kings upon their Subjects, and of his ſhewing Kindneſs to them for the Piety of their Princes. Becauſe <hi>David</hi> ſinned in numbering the People, many of them were deſtroyed with the Plague. Becauſe <hi>Saul</hi> put the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> to Death con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his Oath with them, the Lord ſent three years famine among his People, even after his Death, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21. 1. And yet in theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of Providence there is no Unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with God, becauſe he never ſends heavier Judgments on a People, <hi>than are meet</hi> for their own perſonal Offences; and he may take what Occaſions his Wiſdom thinks fit to puniſh them; And his taking ſuch Occaſions, is an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of real wiſdom in Kings &amp; Rulers not to be wicked, if they wou'd conſult the Repoſe and Safety of their People: Yea, if they had

And their wiſdom in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance riſes ſtill higher, if we conſider that the Lord rewards their Piety and good behaviour with many Bleſſings upon their People; with reſpect to this good Rulers are juſtly ſtiled the <hi>Shields of the Earth,</hi> Pſal. 47. 9.

People are apt to envy them their Dignities &amp; Honours; but if they felt the weight of their Burden, underſtood the Difficulties &amp; Dangers of their Office; Conſidered the awfulneſs of that Charge which lies upon them, that <hi>they Judge not for Men, but for God,</hi> and as thoſe that muſt give an Account; They wou'd not malign and Envy them, but pray to God for them; <hi>That he wou'd Confirm and ſtrengthen them in all Goodneſs, and put within them a ſpirit of Wiſdom and Underſtanding, a ſpirit of Counſel and might, a ſpirit of Knowlege and of the Fear of the Lord,</hi> Iſa. 11. 2, 3.

            <div type="part">
               <head>The Application follows.</head>
               <p>I. What hath been ſaid may afford <hi>Light</hi> with regard to the Magiſtrates power <hi>in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Conſcience and eternal Salvation.</hi> If Chriſt is King in <hi>Zion,</hi> if we are to receive him as the <hi>One Law-giver,</hi> to be Subject to his Laws <hi>only,</hi> in matters of Faith and chriſtian Practice; then no humane Authority has power to make Laws to bind Conſcience &amp; oblige Judgment; <hi>(to our own Maſter we ſtand or fall)</hi> But every Man is left to act his own Conſcience &amp; Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:006131_0028_1027F0F22504A770"/>
what upon ſerious and humble Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation he believes to be moſt agreeable to the Laws of the Redeemer's Kingdom. And this Principle is the Foundation of all acceptable Worſhip and true Religion, which always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult from the honeſt Enquiries &amp; ſincere Choice of Men. This was the main <hi>Bulwark</hi> of the Reformation from Popery, this is the <hi>Glory</hi> of <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and the only <hi>Baſis</hi> of a Cure for the Errors and Superſtitions, that ſtill remain in the chriſtian Church.</p>
               <p>The Power and buſineſs of the civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate reſpect the Peace and Order of <hi>this</hi> World, the publick Good &amp; perſonal Property of every Subject within his Juriſdiction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And whoever acts injuriouſly to theſe, becomes liable to paenal Correction, thô he may plead that he acted according to his Conſcience. For as the Magiſtrate has no power to <hi>bind</hi> Conſcience in matters of Religion, ſo neither has he Power to <hi>looſe</hi> it in matters of State; to tolerate any actions that break the Peace and deſtroy the Conſtitution of that Government over which he preſides.</p>
               <p>To direct and Judge of Conſcience belongs to the <hi>Lord</hi> of Conſcience, the founder of our Religion; but to direct and judge of Actions and external Behaviour belongs to the earthly Ruler and Judge: And he has <hi>Right</hi> to puniſh thoſe Actions which are hurtful to the publick

Good, or private Rights of Subjects, without conſidering from what Principle theſe Actions proceed, or whether a man's Conſcience is for or againſt them. For internal Principles, or Pretences of Conſcience are not the ground and rule of Judgment in civil Courts; for this plain Reaſon, becauſe perverſe Spirits may uſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience as a Cloak of Stubbornneſs, Luxury, Pride and Covetouſneſs.</p>
               <p>II. We may improve what has been offered to <hi>direct</hi> the Members of a Community into <hi>that Obedience</hi> which they owe <hi>to their lawful Rulers.</hi> That in faithfulneſs to <hi>Zion's</hi> King, they are in Duty bound to ſubmit to them in the Exerciſe and Execution of that Truſt and Authority which is repoſed in them. Subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Chriſt does not beget in Men Diſregard to thoſe who are appointed to rule over them: So far from this, that the more heartily we are devoted to the Lord, the more freely do we pay Reſpect &amp; Submiſſion to thoſe Powers he has ordained. The Laws of Chriſtianity bind Men to this, Rom. 13. 1. <hi>Let every Soul be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the higher Powers.</hi> And 1 Pet. 2. 13, 14. <hi>Submit your ſelves to every Ordinance of Man for the Lord's ſake: whether it be to the King, as ſupreme; or unto Governours, as unto them that are ſent by him.</hi> This Submiſſion the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle argues from their Regard to Chriſt, <hi>For
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:006131_0030_1027F0F66540D1C8"/>
the Lord's ſake;</hi> for the honour of his Perſon and Authority, for the Credit of his Religion. Theſe Commands were given to Chriſtians, when their Rulers were Heathen, and enforced upon them with awful Sanctions. Rom. 13. 2. <hi>Whoſoever reſiſteth the power, reſiſteth the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of God: And they that reſist ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to themſelves Damnation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some thro' the Ignorance that is in them fondly oppoſe the Peace &amp; Order of this world, to the <hi>Kingdom of Christ which is not of this world:</hi> Theſe ought to conſider that here is no Oppoſition; that as Chriſt's Kingdom is pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpiritual, ſo it ſtands oppoſed <hi>only</hi> to the Kingdom of Sin and Satan: thoſe <hi>ſpiritual wickedneſſes</hi> that are within us. It moleſts not the State, it is <hi>not hurtful to Kings &amp; Provinces,</hi> it claſhes not with the Power of Princes; it is no Enemy to the publick Peace, to the well-ordering of the State, but a Friend to them. Hence that Advice to the Children of Iſrael in their Captivity, <hi>Seek the Peace of the City, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I have cauſed you to be carried away cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, and pray unto the Lord for it; for in the Peace thereof ye ſhall have Peace,</hi> Jer. 29. 7.</p>
               <p>III. This Doctrine may Excite all to <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs</hi> in the Diſcharge of the <hi>relative Duties</hi> of Life. Providence fixes the Relations of Men, the Goſpel determines the Duties of theſe
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:006131_0031_1027F0FA50D32100"/>
Relations, and Grace diſpoſes to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of theſe Duties. Our King does not break theſe <hi>bands</hi> aſunder, nor caſt away theſe <hi>Cords</hi> from us, but makes them <hi>ſtrong.</hi> Men of proud and aſpiring Minds too often grow weary of the Yoke of Religion, of doing the work it aſſigns them, of walking in their own Line; They muſt lift up themſelves into the Place of Others, and ſo make void the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God reſpecting themſelves, their Station and Capacity. 'Tis not the Spirit of Chriſt that moves perſons to act out of their Sphere which God has placed them in: for his Spirit meekens them to a Behaviour ſuitable to their State: Pſal. 131. 1. <hi>Lord, my Heart is not haughty, nor my Eyes lofty; neither do I exerciſe my ſelf in great Matters, or in things too high for me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IV. Let all <hi>Examine</hi> into the Reality of their <hi>Subjection</hi> to Chriſt. There are multitudes that pleaſe themſelves with the Thôts of being ſaved by the Death of Chriſt, who refuſe to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by the Laws of Chriſt. They think to par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ake of the Privileges of Chriſtianity, but neglect the Duties of it. They call Chriſt, Lord, Lord, but do not the things that he ſays. The Scripture cuts down all ſuch hopes flat to the ground, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6, 9. <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 2, 6. Come then, let us ſearch and ſee, whether we are ſubjected to Chriſt; let us bring the matter home to our
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:006131_0032_1027F0FE1B5EBE90"/>
Conſciences, and deal impartially; for our King <hi>cannot be deceived, and will not be mocked.</hi>—'Tis not <hi>viſibly</hi> to own Chriſt as our Prince and Saviour, to pray to him, and attend his Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, that will denominate us <hi>his.</hi> But we muſt in <hi>Spirit</hi> call him <hi>Lord,</hi> have our Wills broken, and bowed to him, and hearts brought into Subjection. Is it thus with us?—Do we as his Subjects war againſt Sin, renounce the World, the Fleſh &amp; Devil? Do we hate Sin, and not regard Iniquity in our hearts? Do we love that Command which forbids our Sin? Are we pleaſed with the Purity of the divine Law? Do we agree to the ſelf-denial Terms of the Goſpel, and ſtand ready to part with our lawful Liberties &amp; Delights, rather than deſert our Lord? Be we Imitators of our Prince? Are we like to Chriſt, have we put on the Lord Jeſus in heart and Life? Do we feel that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety which is in us to his holy Nature and Will, and find the need of his gracious Aids and Influences? Do we heartily truſt in him to ſtrengthen us, and carry us on in our chriſtian Courſe, that we may ſo run as to obtain?—He that lacketh theſe things is not purged from his old Sins. But if theſe things be in us, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound, we may aſſure our hearts before God, that we have an Intereſt in his Favour, that we are the People of his Choice; that he will cauſe us to approach unto him, and will own us for

his in the Day when he ſhall come to make up his Jewels.</p>
               <p>V. Let all ſuffer the word of <hi>Exhortation</hi> which our Text directs me to bring you at this time. <hi>Kiſs the Son</hi> by way of Loyalty &amp; Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection. Let every Soul be Subject to this <hi>high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Power.</hi> I ſtand here this Day to proclaim Chriſt <hi>your King,</hi> to aſſert his Right to rule you, as he is your Maker, Preſerver and Redeemer. <hi>We are not our own but his, for he hath bought us with a Price. Worthy is the Lamb that was ſlain to receive all Honour, and Love and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</hi>—We can't ſerve a greater nor a better Maſter; nor be governed by more wiſe and beneficial Laws: We can't deſire a more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Employment than we are invited to, nor a more glorious Reward than is promiſed us, if we are faithful. Let us upon theſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives come in, ſubmit our ſelves to God, and reſolve every one for himſelf and his houſe, that we will ſerve the Lord. Let his Subjects be renewedly and more heartily devoted to him, and now vow Allegiance to their King. <hi>God is the Lord, who hath ſhewed us Light, bind the Sacrifice with Cords, even unto the Horns of the Alta, Pſal</hi> 118. 27.</p>
               <p>Let the Counſels of this Day be acceptable to all Orders of Men among us, and to thoſe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled in this houſe; To the chief of our <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,</hi> the Holy Ghoſt in the firſt place ſpeaking

               <p>'Tis with great Pleaſure, <hi>Much honoured Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> that we obſerve your profeſſed Subjection to Jeſus Chriſt and his Goſpel; that we can meet you at his <hi>houſe,</hi> and his <hi>table,</hi> and can have <hi>fellowſhip</hi> together with him; that under your Countenance and encouragement, we do preach the Doctrines of his Grace, Publiſh and preſs on Men the Laws of his Kingdom.

Conſider, That as Chriſt is Lord of all, ſo you are his Vice-gerents on Earth, commiſſion'd and ſent to defend his Cauſe, and do his work. Thô it is beyond the force of humane Laws to bind the Conſcience and change the heart of Man: Yet it is in your power to oblige Men to many things, that are profeſſedly agreeable to their Conſciences; and to ſupport &amp; encourage thoſe Inſtitutions which Chriſt himſelf has appointed to enlarge and build up his Kingdom.</p>
               <p>And here ſuffer me with all freedom to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend a few things to you, which greatly need and loudly demand your attention, <hi>in point of chriſtian Loyalty.</hi>

given to maintain, and that we may not doubt of the Truth of this, it is no more than God himſelf hath ſaid of it, Mal. 3. 8. <hi>Will a man rob God? yet ye have robbed me; but ye ſay, wherein have we robbed thee? In Tythes and Offerings.</hi> And what is the gain of this Robbery we may ſee in the next verſe, <hi>Ye are curſed with a Curſe.</hi>

               <p>I can't but think the with-holding from Chriſt's Miniſters, their juſt and honeſt dues, is one of the <hi>crying</hi> Sins of our Land, that has provoked Almighty God to ſend down Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon us, and righteouſly to withhold the Increaſe of our flocks and fields, and to multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply Debts upon them, who have kept <hi>his</hi> Dues in their own hand. In this caſe it was, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

'Tis likely that ſome perſons will be diſpleaſed with me for this open &amp; plain deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and tax me with <hi>Self-ſeeking;</hi> however for
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:006131_0040_1027F113A548E818"/>
my part I can ſay, that I would gladly have ſpared my ſelf, and you this trouble, cou'd I have done it conſiſtent with the <hi>Fear of God,</hi> and my Character, as <hi>Preacher of Righteouſneſs.</hi> If it was only our Perſons that ſuffered, we wou'd be ſtill and not open our Mouths: But it is the cauſe of Juſtice, and the Intereſt of the chriſtian Religion that ſuffer, therefore we ought to cry aloud, and not ſpare.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) The next thing, Honourable Sirs, which needs your Attention is near akin to that alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy mentioned, and reſpects thoſe <hi>Lands,</hi> which have been <hi>ſequeſtred</hi> by our pious Predeceſſors, for the <hi>Support</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel Miniſtry.</hi> Whether it is agreable to the Law of God, that ſuch Lands are ſold, admits of Diſpute.<note n="‡" place="bottom">
                     <p>Upon a further Conſideration of this matter, I Conceive that there is no Diſpenſation in the word of God, for Alienating, Exchanging or converting into another Species Lands ſeparated to a pious Uſe. From the 27th Chapter of Leviticus we may Obſerve,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Among the Jews things devoted were not to be ſold or redeemed, <hi>ver.</hi> 28. Things devoted were given to God by perſons obliging themſelves under a <hi>ſolemn Curſe</hi> not to Alienate them to any other purpoſe: And this was the Difference between devoted things, and things meerly Sanctified. <hi>Hen. in Text.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. As to purchaſed Lands none of the Tribes had power to <hi>dedicate</hi> them beyond the Year of Jubilee, (for then their right of Poſſeſſion ceaſed) becauſe by a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Law they were to return to the family from which they were purchaſed, <hi>ver.</hi> 24.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. As to Lands that came to a Man by Deſcent, which were called <hi>the Field of his Poſſeſſion,</hi> becauſe they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to his family from the firſt Diviſion of <hi>Canaan.</hi> When he had <hi>ſanctified</hi> any of them, he had the Right or power of redeeming them before the return of the Jubilee, giving for them the Prieſts Valuation, with an addition of a fifth part of the ſame, <hi>ver.</hi> 19. But if he redeemed them not before the Jubilee, they were then to remain as devoted Lands without any Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>ver</hi> 20, 21. The <hi>Field, when it goeth out in the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilee ſhall be holy unto the LORD, as a field devoted: The Poſſeſſion thereof ſhall be the Prieſts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is but juſt &amp; equal, that this Law ſhould Operate with Reference to Lands ſequeſtred to pious Uſes in this Age, ſo far as Circumſtances agree The Reaſon of Redemption (which was that every Tribe might poſſeſs the Inheritance of their Fathers) now ceaſes. And what is given to the Lord, ought not to be given with a Power of Revocation or Exchange. (And our Sequeſtrations have no ſuch Reſerves, but in ſtrong terms hold forth the contrary) For what may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked or Exchanged, may be made null and void. If any then <hi>Adventure</hi> to exchange or convert <hi>dedicated</hi> Land<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

And if there is no Proviſion for the recovering of ſuch Lands to their priſtine State and uſe; Yet is there not the ſtrongeſt Obligation lying upon theſe <hi>Adventurers</hi> to maintain in real Value what ſuch Lands ſold for? And does not this Affair need and demand the Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Interpoſition of the Legiſlature?</p>
                  </note> But whether it is
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:006131_0041_1027F1152DF58C78"/>
agreable thereto, to keep the monies good in Value, for which they are ſold, ſeems to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Diſpute. For if this is not done, what
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:006131_0042_1027F116CE515820"/>
hinders but that the <hi>Guilt of Sacrilege</hi> muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue? 'Tis well known, that in many of our Towns, theſe Lands have been converted into Paper Bills, (not lawful Money) the Value of which has ſunk ſo faſt, that the <hi>Lord's Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> is in great part waſted, and come to No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. And as to this thing, many Pariſhes are ſo circumſtanced, that they need the help of the Legiſlature, not only your Wiſdom to direct them, but your Authority to Oblige them to do that which is right. For the <hi>Self-interest</hi> of ſome, who have theſe Monies in their hands, and their Influence upon others, is like to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue this growing Evil, unleſs you Interpoſe. To my knowlege, in one of our Towns, three thouſand pounds in paper Bills, or thereabout, have been ſunk within five years paſt. And if no Remedy is provided, theſe things may Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion great Expence, and trouble in the Law in a few Years.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) The <hi>Third</hi> thing, which we Commend to your Wiſdom, Compaſſion and Juſtice, is the deſolate &amp; oppreſſed State of <hi>Widows</hi> and <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans;</hi> who have no Remedy in their power. The worldly Subſtance of poor Orphans, (as to their moveable Eſtates,) has about two thirds diminiſhed in fifteen years laſt paſt, thro' the calamitous Depreciation of our paper Currency.

I'm perſwaded, that Guardians muſt be deeply wounded for the wrong, that poor Orphans ſuffer, that are under their Care; and ſad is their Caſe, and the Caſe of all others who are guilty of this wrong; if they expect a Cure from the Law of Man, without applying to the Goſpel of Chriſt.</p>

Providence ſeems to fight againſt our Enemies by ſending a great Dearth among them, and ſo to put a favourable Opportunity into our hands, to bring them to think ſoberly as they ought to think; and it may be to comply with juſt and reaſonable Terms of Peace: And why ſhou'd any in Diſloyalty to King GEORGE, and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience to the King of Heaven, counterwork Providence, Aid and comfort our Enemies, and furniſh them to diſtreſs us in our lawful Trade? Surely this ariſes from want both of Wiſdom and Honeſty; and juſtly deſerves the Royal Diſpleaſure, and Rebukes of Heaven.</p>
               <p n="5">(5) Once more <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Let me Obſerve to you, that, notwithſtanding all your Care to have the <hi>Lord's Day</hi> ſanctified, and <hi>worſhip</hi> in his houſe attended, theſe are ſtill awfully profaned and neglected in the midſt of us. So that in many Places, we can't ordinarily meet with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove half of the People, that might comfortably attend. And as the <hi>manner of ſome is,</hi> they forſake the aſſembling of themſelves for Months together. Sure am I that this is not the way to gain Subjects to Chriſt, but to looſe them;

and to cauſe others to be cold in his Service, if not to diſlike it. We wou'd rejoice to ſee ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual Care taken in this matter, that we might have publick Opportunities to ſhew to them the way of Salvation by Jeſus Chriſt, to invite them to <hi>Kiſs the Son, lest he be angry, and they periſh in the way,</hi> and by cogent and perſwaſive Arguments, <hi>Compel them to come in, that his Houſe,</hi> his Kingdom <hi>might be filled.</hi>

                  <hi>This</hi> wou'd direct you in all Cauſes, to aſſiſt the Jury, to Inform their Judgments, and not blind their Eyes, that the righteous may depart your Courts with Joy, and the wicked with ſadneſs. <hi>This</hi> wou'd U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite you to the ſpeedieſt Iſſue of the Caſes you Undertake, that you might not do Injuſtice, by Delays of Juſtice, and oppreſs your Clients, by creating needleſs and extraordinary Charge to them. <hi>This</hi> wou'd teach you that the <hi>Law is good, when a Man uſes it lawfully,</hi> and then only; and influence you in all things, to <hi>quit</hi> yourſelves like <hi>Men,</hi> who wait for the appearance of the Judge of all, and Expect then to receive a righteous and irrevocable Judgment.</p>

Now nothing daunts them, nothing makes 'em afraid; the Language of their hearts is like that of proud Pharaoh, <hi>Who is the Lord that we ſhou'd obey his Voice?</hi> But how will they be amazed and tremble when King <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſhall appear with his mighty Armies, when they ſhall hear the Voice of the <hi>Arch-angel</hi> &amp; the Trump of God, as thô the whole Hoſt of Heaven were now ſummoned to fight the Lord's Battles, to fall upon the King's Enemies &amp; deſtroy them; having this Commiſſion, <hi>Thoſe mine Enemies that would not that I ſhould reign over them, bring them hither, and ſlay them before me.</hi> Thus know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Terrors of the Lord, we are to perſwade Men, perſwade 'em to lay down the weapons of their Rebellion, and ſubmit themſelves to Chriſt Our King, <hi>to Kiſs the Son, lest he be angry.</hi> Let us continue faithful in theſe things, in this Day of Trouble &amp; Rebuke, under all the Trials, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches &amp; Oppoſitions we meet with, <hi>and we ſhall rest, when the Lord Jeſus ſhall come to be Glorified in his Saints, and to be admired in all them that believe,</hi> and ſhall ſhare the Joys and Triumphs of that Day.</p>
               <p>VI. And laſtly, Is it wiſdom in all to Kiſs the Son, <hi>what glorious Times ſhall we then have when this wiſdom ſhall be encreaſed!</hi> When Chriſt ſhall reign among us <hi>indeed</hi> in the Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of his Grace, when the Laws of his Kingdom

ſhall Enlighten the Eyes, influence the Hearts, and direct the Lives of this People. <hi>Then Truth will ſpring out of the Earth, and Righteouſneſs will look down from Heaven.</hi> And as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſpeaks, Iſa. 40. 4, 5. <hi>Every Valley ſhall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted, and every Mountain and Hill ſhall be made low; and the crooked ſhall be made ſtraight, and the rough places plain, and the Glory of the Lord ſhall be revealed.</hi> Then Pride ſhall be humbled, and Paſſion meekned, wrath turned into Love, and Contention ſwallowed up in Peace. The carnal Mind ſhall become ſpiritual, and the Idols of this world fall at the Preſence of the Lord, as Dagon before the Ark. If Men wou'd re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Chriſt Jeſus the Lord, and walk in him, in all lowlineſs of Mind, in meekneſs &amp; holy O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, no ſuch Miſeries, as are now complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of, wou'd be heard among us. <hi>The Wolf ſhall dwell with the Lamb, and the Leopard ſhall ly down with the Kid. They ſhall not hurt, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy in all God's holy Mountain. Zion ſhall put on her Strength, &amp; Jeruſalem her beautiful Garments,</hi> Iſa. 52. 1,—<hi>Then will the Lord be, not as a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in our Land; not as a way-faring Man that turneth aſide to tarry for a night, But he will dwell with us, &amp; rejoice over us to do us Good, &amp; will think Thôts of Peace towards us, of Good &amp; not of Evil, to give us an expected End of our Troubles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea, our Subjection to the Lord wou'd raiſe &amp; ſtrengthen our Faith in him, and Dependance upon him, &amp; comfort us in all our Tribulations.

For if he lives, we ſhall live alſo. <hi>The Lord reigneth, we will therefore rejoice.</hi> Many indeed are our troubles, our Fears &amp; our Enemies, but the Lord is above them, and can remove them. Many are propheſying &amp; wiſhing Deſtruction to our Churches and this People, like to that which befel <hi>Babylon</hi> the great for her Sins, but all their pleaſing Thôts ſhall be like the Dream of a night Viſion, which the Prophet elegantly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes, Iſa. 29. 8. <hi>It ſhall even be as when a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry Man dreameth, and behold he eateth; but he awaketh, and his Soul is empty: Or as when a thirſty Man dreameth, and behold he drinketh; but he awaketh, and behold he is faint, and his Soul hath appetite; ſo ſhall the Multitude of all the Nations be that fight against Mount Zion.</hi> So ſhall the many be that diſturb, divide &amp; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to deſtroy the Churches of Chriſt in <hi>New-England;</hi> that <hi>Mount-Zion</hi> which the Lord does love, and will Eſtabliſh (we truſt) for Ever. Their Thôts ſhall be empty &amp; Vain. The Lord bringeth the Counſel of the Heathen to nought, he maketh the Devices of the People of none Effect. For <hi>bleſſed are all they that put their truſt in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now let God ariſe, let his Enemies be Scattered, let all them that hate him flee before him: Let him govern the Nations upon Earth, and advance the Kingdom of his Son among all People and Languages, 'till <hi>every Knee ſhall bow at the Name of Jeſus, and every Tongue confeſs that Jeſus Christ is Lord, to the Glory of God the Father.</hi>
