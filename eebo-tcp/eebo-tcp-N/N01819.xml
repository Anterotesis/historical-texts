            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The Extream <hi>want</hi> of <hi>that,</hi> the love whereof is the root of all Evil, is the univerſal Complaint among us: So that there is hot talk that our Salary-Men, who (particularly the Eccleſiaſticks) have hitherto had an Honourable Support and ſuitable to their Character, muſt <hi>lower their Top-ſails,</hi> and be Content to take their pay in the <hi>produce of the Iſland.</hi> The blood and vital Spirits of the Body-politick, (I mean the Medium of Exchange) is ſo near exhauſted as portends a <hi>Certain,</hi> &amp; <hi>Speedy</hi> diſſolution.</p>
            <p>The greateſt part of the paper Credit, which is yet out-ſtanding, is fallen into the hands of a few <hi>wretched Miſers,</hi> (whoſe <hi>deſires are Enlarged as Hell,</hi>) who li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>In what prodigious Shoals do Men flock to Uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers to <hi>hire</hi>! and perhaps when they have waited at their Gates as long as King <hi>John</hi> did at the Pope's Legat's, they may obtain admittance; and thoſe who poſſeſs Eſtates in Lands worth 500l. may pawn them for 94 <hi>for the Intereſt must be paid before they receive the Principal</hi>; and beſides that, there muſt be a <hi>gratuity</hi> proportionable to the urgency of their wants, before they can come off ſo well.</p>
            <p>Among the innumerable exorbitant Miſchiefs which
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:002153_0003_0FBC784A21EFD208"/>
ariſe from the want of of ſome proper Medium of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, theſe are not the leaſt: The <hi>Trade,</hi> by which our Iſland chiefly ſubſiſts, is <hi>wofully embaraſs'd</hi>; and many a noble Project (and profitable to the Publick) <hi>ſadly retarded</hi>; a Multiplicity of <hi>Law-Suits,</hi> to the enriching a few <hi>luxuriant Cut-throats,</hi> and reducing many honeſt, frugal, induſtrious Familys to <hi>Beggary,</hi> and <hi>many more</hi> to the very precipice of Ruin, unleſs ſpeedy Relief intervene.

And have we not great reaſon to fear a more <hi>tragic Scene</hi> will open before we are aware? But on whom muſt we Father all this <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of Miſchiefs</hi> (to which a multitude more might be added) when the black <hi>Master-roll</hi> comes to be made up? Is it not an Argument, that <hi>thoſe</hi> who <hi>reject,</hi> and <hi>hiſs</hi> at <hi>all</hi> propoſals (even the moſt fair and promiſing) which are made by <hi>others,</hi> and <hi>propoſe nothing at all</hi> themſelves, would have nothing at all <hi>DONE</hi> that might conduce to our Relief &amp; advantage?</p>
            <p>Our Expectations of Redreſs the <hi>laſt Seſſion</hi> (the <hi>Expence</hi> and <hi>Damage</hi> whereof has not been much leſs than that of <hi>broken Conventions,</hi> with which we were threatned, if the former were not managed according to <hi>ſome men's minds</hi>) have been greatly raiſed, and the Repreſentative Body of the Iſland carried on things with great Prudence, as far as poſſible; and I need not tell you where their Concluſions met with a reſolute Repulſe.</p>
            <p>The Oppoſition which the Emiſſion of more Paper Credit has met with, has afforded various matter of Speculation among us; and many have been the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures about it, it being ſomething unnaccountable what Men ſhould be driving at, who (like <hi>Water-men</hi>) <hi>look one way,</hi> while at the ſame time they <hi>now the contrary</hi>; inſomuch that many (who are willing to think the beſt) are apt to fix them with the Carcaſs of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> between Heaven and Earth; or with <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> the Atlas of the Papal Cauſe, to whom

Nature, in the production of Gold (as one ingeniouſly obſerves) ſeems to have preſaged the <hi>Miſery of her Lovers,</hi> by making the place where it grows barren of Herbs,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:002153_0005_0FBC785000693D68"/>
Plants, &amp;c. intimating thereby that in the Minds where the <hi>Deſire</hi> of this Metal ſhall <hi>take Birth,</hi> no Sparks of <hi>Honour</hi> or <hi>Vertue</hi> ſhall remain.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Envy</hi>: Which is a <hi>Diabolical Paſſion,</hi> that renders thoſe in whom it is predominant <hi>Emphatically the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Devil.</hi> It ſtirs up in Men a <hi>pining</hi> at the good of others, and <hi>gnaws</hi> their <hi>Hearts</hi> with continual Torment. How do ſome <hi>vex</hi> and <hi>frett</hi> themſelves, at the proſperity and good of <hi>Others</hi>? And how would they (if they could) <hi>Ahab</hi>-like, hook in their fair Eſtates? that they may <hi>join Houſe to Houſe, &amp; lay Field to Field,</hi> &amp;c. tho' there is a terrible W O denounc'd againſt them, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 5. 8.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Pride.</hi> Pride and Envy are Siſters of the ſame Complexion and Shape, and equally pernicious in their <hi>Effects.</hi> Ambition is a <hi>raviſhing Paſſion,</hi> that eaſily glides into the Soul, but makes an unwilling Retreat.

            <p n="4">4. <hi>Hypocriſy.</hi> And of <hi>all</hi> the foregoing evils, this is not to be eſteem'd the leaſt. For <hi>hereby</hi> (as a moſt Reverend Divine obſerves) <hi>Religion</hi> is made a <hi>Stalking-Horſe</hi> whereby <hi>ſome Men</hi> ſerve the moſt vile and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Ends; cloaking their Deſigns of <hi>Covetouſneſs, Ambition,</hi> or <hi>Revenge,</hi> with pretence of <hi>Conſcience</hi> and <hi>Zeal</hi>; and under the ſpecious Umbrage hereof, the moſt <hi>execrable Villanies</hi> have been acted. This lurking Evil has ſlain it's <hi>Ten Thouſands,</hi> and done more miſchief in he World than open Impiety and Infidelity.</p>
            <p>Theſe are ſuppos'd to be the four <hi>main Springs,</hi> from whence the Oppoſition to more Bills, (tho' emitted on never ſo good a Foundation) proceeds. And is it any wonder, that a few <hi>Muck-worms,</hi> who have <hi>monopoliz'd</hi> vaſt Hoards of Bills ſhould <hi>oppoſe</hi> it; ſeeing they have ſo fair a proſpect (as they think) of raiſing their Eſtates,

and building up their <hi>Names</hi> on the <hi>Ruins</hi> of their Country? Tho' hereby their Memory will be a <hi>Stench</hi> in the Noſtrils of Poſterity.

            <p>There has been a great Buſtle and Whiſpering of late about our <hi>Constitution</hi>; &amp; rais'd Expectations among <hi>many,</hi> (whoſe Endeavours have not been wanting) that <hi>thoſe glorious Days for Lawyers and Gentlemen,</hi> which were propheſied of and wiſh'd for, <hi>January</hi> 12. 1703, 4, were making a near approach to us. But as hitherto the united attempts of Earth and Hell which have been formed againſt it have proved <hi>unſucceſsful</hi>; ſo we hope that He who rules in the Kingdom of Providence, will <hi>deride</hi> their ſecret Counſels, <hi>defeat</hi> their Deſigns (tho' laid as deep as Hell) and <hi>cloath them</hi> with Shame and Confuſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sir,</hi> It is no <hi>News</hi> to you (I preſume) that the great DON-DAGO, the <hi>Primate-wou'd-be</hi> of our Iſland, (like the famous Dr. <hi>S—l</hi> has long ago <hi>burst his Orb, and become Eccentrick.</hi> And as for the Old <hi>Itch of Scribling,</hi> (tho' plung'd in the profound <hi>Atlantic</hi>) it is not yet extinguiſh'd.</p>
            <p>Some time ſince we ſaw the Meteor call'd <hi>Aurora-Borealis</hi>; which is a forerunner of <hi>News</hi> from the <hi>North,</hi> and not long after we heard of a <hi>venomous Epiſtle,</hi> that
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:002153_0007_0FBC78546BA5EF58"/>
has been ſent to <hi>your Parts,</hi> (with which the World may be favoured, if it can find a place among <hi>Tom Brown's</hi> Letters, the next Impreſſion) wherein the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (as he has formerly convinc'd the World of his <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite Knack at daubing with untempered Mortar</hi>) has given us to underſtand, that he is Maſter of the Art of <hi>enviouſly detracting</hi> from the worth of good Men, (<hi>Gentlemen of known Integrity</hi>) by throwing dirt, to ſully their Reputation, and blacken their Character. Moreover, he has repreſented a <hi>loyal</hi> and <hi>peaceable</hi> Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as <hi>Factious, Turbulent, and worſe than the Savage Monsters of Africa.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some of our Eccleſiaſticks of late, (for want of <hi>Diſcretion,</hi> without which <hi>Learning</hi> is <hi>Pedantry,</hi> and <hi>Wit, Impertinence,</hi>) have been guilty of <hi>too officious</hi> a meddling with <hi>State Affairs.</hi> The great ſubſtantial Duties of <hi>Faith, Repentance,</hi> and a <hi>good Life,</hi> are what they <hi>may</hi> and <hi>ought,</hi> with utmoſt Warmth and Energy to <hi>Inculcate</hi>; but whatever is not compris'd in theſe, is <hi>beſide the Text, foreign to their Province, and another Goſpel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To ſee a Clergy-man (<hi>Commedian</hi>-like) ſtand <hi>bela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring his Cuſhion</hi> and intermixing his Harrangue with THUNDER-BOLTS, while he is entertaining his <hi>peaceable Congregation</hi> with things whereof he is almoſt as <hi>Ignorant,</hi> as I am of the <hi>Saddle</hi> Balaam <hi>rode on</hi> when his Aſs ſpoke, and exhorting them to <hi>beware of a mutinons, mobbiſh Spirit, of ſiding with this or that Party and Intereſt</hi>; How <hi>ridiculous</hi> is the Sight and the Sound? How <hi>nauceous,</hi> and like a <hi>Parable in the Mouth of Fools</hi>? An empty noiſe, like <hi>ſounding Braſs,</hi> or a <hi>tinkling Cymbal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How do ſuch Degrade their <hi>Sacred Function,</hi> and expoſe themſelves to <hi>Contempt</hi> and <hi>Mimickry,</hi> and to be <hi>Burlisqu'd</hi> by every Pamphleteer? And how high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meritorous is this of a <hi>Staff</hi> and Pair of <hi>Shoes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, is not the Crime exceedingly aggravated, when any of that <hi>Order</hi> ſide with <hi>Parties,</hi> and foment <hi>Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences</hi> THEMSELVES? When in their <hi>private Viſits</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:002153_0008_0FBC7856CD103D00"/>
and at <hi>Gentlemens Tables,</hi> they take the Licence to <hi>revile, backbite</hi> and <hi>ſlander,</hi> endeavouring to <hi>widen</hi> the Differences between Men of <hi>high Station</hi> and <hi>Character,</hi> whoſe Influence is likely to affect the whole Iſland? Does not this render them <hi>vile,</hi> and miniſter juſt Occaſion to ungodly Men to <hi>deſpiſe their Offerings</hi>? Does not this tend to <hi>harden</hi> Men in <hi>Atheiſm, Impiety</hi> and <hi>Infidelity,</hi> and to deem all <hi>Religion</hi> as a piece of <hi>Prieſt-Craft</hi> and <hi>State-Policy,</hi> to keep the World in Awe? And is it not the moſt certain and expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous way to effect their <hi>own Ruin</hi>?</p>
            <p>But I muſt not be further tedious to you, becauſe I hope in a ſhort time to ſend you a more particular Account of things: In the mean time, recommending you and yours to the Care of the Divine Providence,</p>
