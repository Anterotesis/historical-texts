            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <q>FOR promotion cometh neither from the eaſt, nor from the weſt, nor from the ſouth: But God is the Judge; He putteth down one, and ſetteth up another.</q>

               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Y the light of reaſon and nature, we are led to believe in, and adore God, not only as the maker, but alſo as the governor of all things. In the ſame way we may be ſatisfied that
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:011289_0005_0F869E2923D93348"/>
it is agreeable to the divine will, that civil government be eſtabliſhed among men, on principles equitable in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and conducive to the common good. But in theſe points, revelation comes in to the aſſiſtance of reaſon, and ſhews them to us in a clearer light than we could ſee them without it's aid. This is done by many paſſages of ſacred ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and by that which I have now read in particular; which, without a critical examination of it's connexion, or any labored comment on it, may lead us to conſider — God's approbation of civil government — His agency in putting men into, and removing them from places of power—what views perſons ſhould have in ſeeking and accepting a part in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment—what rules ſhould be obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in introducing men into office—how thoſe that are promoted ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have towards the people—and how the people ſhould behave towards them. The two former of theſe heads of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe lie plainly in the words of my text; the others are natural inferences from them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:011289_0006_0F869E29B9C7ABF8"/>THE FIRST thing to be conſidered is God's approbation of civil government among mankind. This might be argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the diſpoſitions and capacities which he hath implanted in human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. By theſe men are adapted to ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, and inclined to aſſociate together; and by aſſociating, the happineſs of each individual may be greatly improved.</p>
            <p>By forming into civil ſociety, men do indeed give up ſome of their natural rights; but it is in proſpect of a rich com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, in the better ſecurity of the reſt, and in the enjoyment of ſeveral ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional ones, that flow from the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of government, which they eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh. Individuals agreeing in certain methods, in which their united force and ſtrength ſhall be employed for mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al defence and ſecurity, is a general idea of civil government. Theſe methods of defence being lawful and right in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, muſt be agreeable to the will of God "who loveth righteouſneſs:" They muſt pleaſe him who is "a God of order and not of conſuſion;" as they tend to prevent "confuſion and every evil work,"
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:011289_0007_0F869E2D70D7EBE8"/>
which otherwiſe would prevail, without reſtraint, among ſuch imperfect creatures as we are.</p>
            <p>THE ſtate of things in our world is evidently ſuch, as to render civil go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment neceſſary: But for this, life, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and property would be expoſed to fatal invaſion. The luſts of men, from whence come wars and fightings, would not be under ſufficient reſtraint. Their conduct would be like that complained of in Iſrael, when they had no king: "Every one did that which was right in his own eves.<note n="*" place="bottom">Judges xvii.6.</note>" Men would reſemble the fiſhes in the ſea, the greater devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the leſs. This ſtate of things as fully determines the will of God, who delights in the happineſs of his creatures, in favor of civil government, as it could have been done by an expreſs revelation. The voice of reaſon, in this caſe, is the voice of God.</p>
            <p>BUT the will of God, as to this thing, is not only deduceable from theſe reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: His word of revelation declares it. "The powers that be are," expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:011289_0008_0F869E2D7B36D810"/>
ſaid to be, "ordained of God." Civil rulers are called "the miniſters of God." And "he that reſiſteth them" is ſaid to "reſiſt the ordinance of God."<note n="§" place="bottom">Rom xiii.1, 2, 4.</note>
            </p>
            <p>BUT though God's approbation of civil government is ſo evident; yet he hath not ſeen fit to point out any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar form of it, in which all men are obliged to unite. This is left as a matter of free choice and agreement. Men have a natural right to determine for themſelves, in what way, and by whom they will be governed. The notion of a divine indefeaſible right to govern, veſted in particular perſons, or families, is wholly without foundation; and is, I think, as generally exploded at this day, by men of ſober minds, as that of uninterrupted ſucceſſion in eccleſiaſtical office, from the apoſtles of Chriſt, in order to the validity of chriſtian admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations.</p>
            <p>
               <q>THE moſt impartial diſquiſitions of this matter, faith an anonymous writer, founded on the common ſenſe and practice of mankind, have long ago
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:011289_0009_0F869E2E52E9ACC0"/>
convinced the wiſe and unprejudiced, that no individual, however nobly born, has a right over the perſon or property of another, except only from mutual compact, entred into for gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral benefit; the conditions of which, are as obligatory on the governing, as on the governed parties. No man, in the nature of things, is any way ſuperior or inferior to his fellow citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, but on ſuch conditions, as they are ſuppoſed to have mutually conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to. It is only to prevent the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion which riches, intereſt, or ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion might create, among perſons equally qualified, that the ſovereignty hath been ſettled in particular families. It is in regard only to conveniency, that the ſucceſſion ſhould remain unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted, as long as it can be conſiſtent with the good of the whole. But where this is infringed, diſpenſed with, ſuperſeded, the obligation is cancelled. The people are free, and may either chooſe a new form of government, or put their old, into other hands.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:011289_0010_0F869E2EFACA3778"/>ALL nations have not choſen the ſame form of government: Nor can we deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine that any one would be beſt for all. The different genius, temper and ſituation of nations and countries, may make different conſtitutions of civil policy eligible, as different temperaments in human bodies, and the different climates in which they are placed, require different methods of regimen.</p>
            <p>THE Theocracy of the Jews doth not diſprove this natural liberty of choice. That was no doubt a ſignal favor to that people, while it continued; and it was ungrateful in them to be ſo ſoon weary of it. Other nations were left to their liberty, to chuſe ſuch a form of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as they might think would beſt anſwer the end of all government, the public welfare; whether that of Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, Ariſtocracy, or Democracy; or a mixture of theſe. It is a mixture of theſe that our nation hath fixed upon: And this we are ready to think the happieſt that can be. We may poſſibly be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced in favor of it, becauſe it is our own. Indeed we have leſs reaſon to
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:011289_0011_0F869E302A4AEB68"/>
think we are, ſince we have ſo many teſtimonies of ſtrangers to it's excellency. Beſides theſe teſtimonies, we have had ſuch proofs of it's goodneſs, as are moſt convictive, thoſe of experience. By it "we have enjoyed great quietneſs, and important favors have been done to our nation."</p>
            <p>IN this form of government, <hi>power</hi> and <hi>privilege</hi> are happily united. They are wrought into it's foundation, ſo that they cannot be ſeperated, but by pulling down the pillars of it. Magiſtrates can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not exerciſe their power, without main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the rights and privileges of the people: And people cannot enjoy their rights and privileges, without aſſerting and ſupporting the power of magiſtrates. We have reaſon to be thankful to the great Founder of civil government, that under his influence, our nation hath agreed in this conſtitution, which hath already contributed ſo much to it's hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs; and the important bleſſings of which, we hope, will flow down to the lateſt poſterity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:011289_0012_0F869E307A1A8EB8"/>INDEED the beſt form of government will not render a people ſafe and happy, without a good adminiſtration. More depends on places of public truſt being properly filled, than barely on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. A people may perhaps, for a ſeaſon, be tolerably happy, under the moſt exceptionable form of government; but can ſcarcely be ſo, under the beſt, when adminiſtation is groſly corrupt. Their rights and privileges are very near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affected, by the character and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of their rulers. The advancement of perſons to places in government, is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a moſt intereſting affair. It requires the ſerious attention of all, who have a hand in it: And it will lead every man of religion, to implore the favor and influence of the ſupreme ruler, <hi>who put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth down one, and ſetteth up another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This leads me,</p>
            <p>SECONDLY. To conſider the agency of God, in putting men into, and remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them from places in government.</p>
            <p>PROMOTION, faith the penman of my text, <hi>cometh neither from the eaſt,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:011289_0013_0F869E314AA8B6C8"/>
nor from the weſt, nor from the ſouth.</hi> We cannot (as one remarks on the words) "gain it, either by the wiſdom of the men of the <hi>eaſt</hi> or by the numerous forces of the <hi>weſtern</hi> iſles; or from thoſe of <hi>Egypt</hi> or <hi>Arabia,</hi> which lie <hi>ſouthward</hi> of <hi>Judea.</hi> The reaſon why the <hi>north</hi> is not mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed may be becauſe the ſame word which is rendered <hi>north</hi> ſignifies God's <hi>ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place</hi> or counſel, from whence promotion doth come." Perhaps no more is inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by this poetical expreſſion, than that the moſt favorable concurrence of ſecond cauſes, will not prevail to advance per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in government, without the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the firſt. A truth which none can diſbelieve, who admit God's ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendency over all human affairs. A truth, in the faith of which, our own obſervation may have been ſufficient to confirm us. Have we not known ſome, ready to compaſs ſea and land, and to go from eaſt to weſt, and from north to ſouth, in purſuit of honor? And yet have they not found it like a ſhadow, in this reſpect, as well as in ſome other, that it hath fled before them with a motion as ſwift as that with which they have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed

it? While they have tried every promiſing method to climb the ſlippery hill of honor, all their attempts have been blaſted, and blaſted in ſuch ſecret and unexpected ways, as could not be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for, but by the agency of him "who diſappointeth the devices of the crafty, ſo that their hands cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their enterprise."<note n="*" place="bottom">Job V.12.</note>

It is not only ſafe but happy for the world, that abſolute and uncontroulable power ſhould be poſſeſſed by a being of infinite wiſdom, invariable juſtice and boundleſs mercy.

            <p>GOD <hi>is the judge</hi> of men's qualifications for government, and his "judgment is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways according to truth." He knows whom to promote and whom to depoſe, in order to anſwer the wiſe plan of his univerſal providence. This power God doth not uſually exerciſe in an immediate way, but by the intervention of ſeveral ſecond cauſes; and theſe are united and combined together in ſuch a manner, as could be done by no underſtanding but one that is infinite. Sacred, and other hiſtories furniſh us with inſtances hereof. The advancement of Joſeph to great dignity and power in the Egyptian court, is a remarkable one. A variety of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>connected cauſes operated to bring this about, unconnected in themſelves, but united by him, "whoſe kingdom ruleth over all." It was by the agency of God, that king Saul was diſgraced, and David advanced; an event, to which it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, our text has ſpecial reference. By

               <hi>this</hi> it came to paſs, that proud Haman was hanged on the gallows he had made, of fifty cubits high; while Mordecai the Jew, for whom he had prepared the ſame, was promoted: By <hi>this,</hi> that haughty Nebuchadnezzar was turned a grazing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the beaſts, to teach him that "the heavens do rule:" By <hi>this,</hi> that boaſting Herod was eaten of worms, becauſe he did not conſider that he was one himſelf.</p>
            <p>THE influence of the ſupreme gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of the world, in bringing about ſuch events, in later ages, is not leſs real, though perhaps leſs evident and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate. It muſt be acknowledged in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down ſome, and ſetting up others, in our own nation and land. The fall of that unhappy and miſguided king, <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt, was an inſtance of it. So was that ever memorable event, ſo happy in it's conſequences to GREAT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BRITAIN, and to theſe COLONIES, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the REVOLUTION, when king <hi>James</hi> the ſecond abdicated the throne, and KING WILLIAM and QUEEN MARY, of glorious memory, were advanced to it; which made way for the preſent hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:011289_0017_0F869E34393660A8"/>
eſtabliſhment in the houſe of HANO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VER. The people of this province, not only ſhared in common with their fellow ſubjects, on the other ſide of the Atlantic, in the advantages ariſing from this great change in government, but were parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly happy, in being delivered from the oppreſſive and tyrannical adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Sir Edmund Andros.</hi> The agen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of heaven in theſe events, doth not determine the innocence or guilt of thoſe, who were the voluntary inſtruments of bringing them about. "Thou couldeſt have no power at all againſt me," ſaid our Saviour to Pilate, "except it were given thee from above:"<note n="*" place="bottom">John XIX.11.</note> Yet this did not prove him innocent, in "condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that juſt one."</p>
            <p>THE promotion of men to places of power and truſt, who either have no talents for government, or are diſpoſed to uſe thoſe that they have, to wicked purpoſes, is an event, which may ſeem hard to be accounted for. "God's judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are a great deep." This however muſt be a ſettled principle with us, "that the Judge of all the earth doth right."
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:011289_0018_0F869E354250AAA8"/>
His providence is by no means to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached. The moral evils which take place, in conſequence of ſuch promoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, are not to be charged on him. He may permit ſuch things, to puniſh a bad temper, either in the perſons promoted, or in the people over whom they are ſet, or in both. We ſhould conſider it as the primary deſign of ſuch puniſhment reform them; but if they remain incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigible under it, a fuller diſplay of God's rectoral juſtice and hatred of ſin, will be made in their ruin. "The ſcripture ſaith unto Pharaoh, even for this ſame purpoſe have I raiſed thee up, that I might ſhew my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth.<note n="†" place="bottom">Rom. IX.17.</note>" In judgment to Iſrael, Saul, and ſeveral wicked kings, were ſet over them. "There is (ſays Doctor Tillotſon) a kind of moral connexion and communication of evil and guilt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween princes and people; ſo that they are many times mutually rewarded for the virtues and good actions, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed for the ſins and faults, of one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:011289_0019_0F869E35B9AE5798"/>GOOD men, who have excellent ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents for government, and a diſpoſition to uſe them for the public advantage, are ſometimes kept out of place, or ſuddenly ſtripped of that civil power with which they had been cloathed. This is a chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the book of providence hard to be explained. In this way, we have reaſon to think, God ſometimes deſigns to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh a people's ingratitude to him for a good adminiſtration, which they have enjoyed; their unſubmiſſiveneſs to it, and abuſe of it's bleſſings. He may alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the advantage of the perſons thus diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed, by a diſpenſation generally grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous enough to them. He may behold their virtue endangered by their elevati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: He may foreſee that they would not be proof againſt the temptations of it; and that they would neglect, what to them, as well as to others, is "the one thing needful," the care of their ſouls. Many have loſt ground in religion by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement, and recovered it by a return to private life.</p>
            <p>HAVING remarked on the agency of God in advancing and depoſing men, I go on,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:011289_0020_0F869E3907827088"/>THIRDLY, TO conſider what views they ſhould have in ſeeking and accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing places in government. I here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>ſeeking places,</hi> for I do not imagine that all kinds and degrees of this, are to be condemned; though the character of <hi>ſeekers,</hi> in general, is a very odious and invidious one. Importunity in a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didate for promotion is a preſumptive evidence, that he is unfit for it. Men of the beſt qualifications have generally diſdained thoſe low arts and intrigues, by which ſome have made their way into places of power. It is hard to ſay what can be more baſe and wicked, than the conduct of thoſe, who attempt to riſe by the help of adulation and bribes, unleſs it be that of thoſe who hearken to them, and become the tools of their pride and ambition. That temper, however, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves to be denominated a falſe modeſty, which makes men always decline preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when it comes in their way; or avoid thoſe offices which require great abilities, when they know themſelves to be poſſeſt of them. Hereby they may be chargeable with hiding talents which they ought to improve for the public good.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:011289_0021_0F869E3A3283AFB8"/>BUT all mens endeavors to riſe in government ſhould be ſuch, as they have reaſon to think God approves; ſuch as they can with ſincerity recommend to his bleſſing, and wait on him to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed. If this is not the caſe, they are in effect fighting againſt God. They ought not to ſeek, nor even to accept, ſuch offices as they know they cannot diſcharge, in a good meaſure anſwerable to the nature and importance of them.</p>
            <p>GOD <hi>is the judge</hi>—You ſhould be able to look up to him in confidence, that he approves every ſtep you take in the way to poſts of honor; and with a willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to be diſappointed, if in his unerring wiſdom he ſees you to be unfit for them; and that your ſucceſs would ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate either to the damage of the public, or of yourſelves. Such a ſerious regard to God, as the fountain of all power, would ſhame men of virtue and modeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, out of thoſe baſe methods, by which, it is to be feared, ſome are ſeeking after promotion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:011289_0022_0F869E3A4159D340"/>MEN indeed are generally partial to themſelves: They think their accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments greater than they are. Under the influence of this partiality, ſome may with honeſt ſimplicity ſolicit, and enter into, ſuch departments in government, as they can by no means fill with digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and to the ſatisfaction of the public. This evil is to be guarded againſt by thoſe, whoſe part it is to introduce men into office.</p>
            <p>The rules to be obſerved by ſuch is the</p>
            <p>FOURTH thing to be conſidered. They ſhould act with great fidelity and caution. This fidelity and caution is neceſſary, both in ſuperior magiſtrates, in their appointments, and in the people, who chooſe perſons into office. The buſineſs is of a very intereſting nature; in doing it they ſhould conſider themſelves as inſtruments in the hand of God, and therefore bound to conſult his will, and to govern themſelves by it. This teaches them to promote men according to their apparent merit; and not to be influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced by private connexions, and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:011289_0023_0F869E3B4BB4BFF8"/>
of perſonal advantage. The public proſperity greatly depends on your faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful diſcharge of your duty in this reſpect. You are accountable to God for the manner in which you diſcharge it. You are bound as you will anſwer it to him, to conſider the qualifications of candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates, for places in government, and to promote ſuch, and ſuch only, as you think in ſome good meaſure poſſeſſed of them.</p>
            <p>WHAT theſe qualifications are, I have not time particularly to conſider. Two of the moſt eſſential, and in which moſt others may be included, I ſhall briefly mention—<hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No ſmall degree of wiſdom and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is neceſſary to conſtitute a good ruler, whether he fills a place in the legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative, or executive part of government. Solomon when advanced to be king over Iſrael, prayed for a wiſe and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heart: God approved his petition as ſeaſonable, and gave a gracious anſwer to it. Wiſdom is not only neceſſary for kings, and for perſons in the higheſt ſeats
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:011289_0024_0F869E3BEE513168"/>
of government, but proportionable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of it, for thoſe who hold ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate places. Rulers are compared to <hi>light,</hi> which, by a familiar metaphor, ſignifies knowledge. "The heads of the tribes of Iſſachar," choſen to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent their brethren on a certain important occaſion, are expreſsly ſaid to be "men, that had underſtanding of the times, to know what Iſrael ought to do."<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Chron. XII.32.</note>
            </p>
            <p>GOVERNMENT is by no means ſafe in the hands of weak and ignorant men, how good ſoever their intentions may be. When ſuch men have the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our public affairs what can we expect, but that they run into confuſion and diſorder?</p>
            <p>NOR is it every kind of knowledge that will qualify a man to govern. He muſt be acquainted with men, as well as things; otherwiſe he will be in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual danger of being impoſed on, by the ſubtilty and addreſs of deſigning men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round him. He will confide in thoſe who are not to be truſted, and make thoſe his counſellors, who will take pains
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:011289_0025_0F869E3C77DF2190"/>
to lead him aſtray. It is the character of the ſupreme ruler, that, "He is a God of knowledge, by whom actions are weighed."<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Sam. II.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> Rulers among men, ſhould have ſkill to form a due eſtimate of the actions of perſons, under all that coloring which they lay on them. If they have not, how can they approve and reward thoſe that have a ſalutary influence on the public? How can they diſapprove and counteract thoſe of a contrary nature?</p>
            <p>RULERS ſhould not only be acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the natural rights of the people, which are the ſame under every form of government, but alſo with thoſe which originate from the conſtitution of the country where they live; that they may be tender of both, and able to defend both. They ſhould know how to ſtate the bounds of their own authority, and of the rights of the people; that while with firmneſs they aſſert the former, they may not infringe on the latter. Wiſdom is neceſſary to direct them in all that va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of buſineſs, to which their ſtations call them; which variety I cannot now further conſider.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="unknown:011289_0026_0F869E40E0722ED0"/>RELIGION is the other qualifications which I mentioned, as neceſſary to the character of a good ruler. He muſt be a man of religion, who diſcharges the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of magiſtrate with fidelity. By a man of religion, I mean one that is a true fearer of God, one that is in a good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſantified by his grace, formed to the temper recommended by the goſpel of Chriſt, and ſincerely endeavors to act up to thoſe rules of piety and virtue, which are therein preſcribed.</p>
            <p>PIETY towards God is the only baſis, on which a proper conduct towards men, can ſtand firm and ſteady againſt thoſe blaſts of temptation, to which all men are expoſed; and which beat on thoſe, that are in elevated ſtations, with peculiar vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, as ſtorms do on a houſe that ſtands on an eminence. "He that fears not God, will not regard man," will not regard him, with that tender concern for his proſperity, and that ſincere endeavor to promote it, which the laws of religion require. True patriotiſm (for ſuch a thing no doubt there is, though many may be ſtrangers to it, who are fond of
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:011289_0027_0F869E41A78A2970"/>
the name) hath it's foundation in religion. A vicious man hath no ſettled principle of action. He is ruled by ſelfiſh paſſions. To gratify theſe, he will ſacrifice his conſcience; he will trample on law, when he can do it with impunity; he will betray his friends; he will ſell his country; having firſt "ſold himſelf to work" all theſe kinds of "wickedneſſ."</p>
            <p>DIRECTLY the reverſe of this, is the tendency of religion, when it is pure and undefiled. It regulates the paſſions; it enlarges the mind; it fills it with noble, and benevolent deſigns; it leads men to enterprize great things for the public good; it drives away the miſts of preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice and temptation, which are ſo apt to obſcure the path of duty; it inſpires a noble fortitude and reſolution to purſue the end of government, though it ſhould lead through a ſcene of painful oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; though the beſt intentions ſhould be miſconſtrued, and the moſt important ſervices go unrewarded.</p>
            <p>Now thoſe that are concerned in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting men to public ſtations, are bound
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:011289_0028_0F869E41C8DDE1D8"/>
to have great regard to their virtue and religion. "For the God of Iſrael ſaid, the Rock of Iſrael ſpake to me—He that ruleth over men muſt be juſt, ruling in the fear of God."<note n="*" place="bottom">2 Sam. XXIII.3.</note> King David deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to act on this principle in calling men to office under him. "Mine eyes ſhall be upon the faithful in the land: He that walketh in a perfect way he ſhall ſerve me."<note n="†" place="bottom">Pſal. CI.6.</note>
            </p>
            <p>GOD who <hi>is the judge,</hi> and who never errs in judgment, hath plainly intimated the neceſſity of the two leading qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for rulers, which I have mentioned —and not barely mentioned, but a little enlarged upon, as this head of diſcourſe hath a particular aſpect on the public tranſactions of this day. And are you not under the moſt ſolemn obligations to regard the will of God in promoting men? When you do ſo, you are workers toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with him in the matter: When you do not, you ſet yourſelves in oppoſition to him; and if he ſuffers you to ſucceed, it will no doubt be in judgment to you, and to the land.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="unknown:011289_0029_0F869E42A61C64B8"/>FIFTHLY. THIS ſubject inſtructs thoſe who are advanced to places of power and truſt, how they ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have, and preſſes fidelity on them by the moſt ſerious motives. They are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider themſelves as promoted by God, and accountable to him for their conduct in public life. <hi>God is the judge: He putteth down one, and ſetteth up another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>RULERS ought always to look on their authority as derived to them. They are not originally poſſeſſed of any. This conſideration ſhould make them humble. It ſhould give a check to a proud and haughty ſpirit; if, at any time, they find ſuch an one ready to prevail. It ſhould guard them againſt an overbearing ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical behaviour. They ſhould fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently make the reflection of the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle; What have we that we did not receive? And if we received it, why do we boaſt?</p>
            <p>THEY ſhould conſider their authority alſo as limited by the author of it; and that, both as to degree and continuance. God <hi>putteth down,</hi> as well as raiſeth up.
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:011289_0030_0F869E43D604DF10"/>
The triumphing of wicked rulers, who abuſe their power in ways of pride and oppreſſion, is generally ſhort. To one of this character, the remark of the antient ſage concerning a hypocrite may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied; "Though his excellency mount up to the heavens, and his head reach unto the clouds, yet he ſhall periſh forever:— They that have ſeen him ſhall ſay Where is he"?<note n="†" place="bottom">Job XX.6, 7.</note> When a virtuous people are oppreſſed, they may carry their complaints to God, in humble confidence, that he will not long "ſuffer the rod of the wicked to reſt on the lot of the righteous."<note n="‡" place="bottom">Pſalm CXXV.3.</note>
            </p>
            <p>THE conſideration that their promot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion cometh from God, ſhould make rulers careful to improve it in a way, the moſt agreeable to his will, that they can. They do this, when they faithfully purſue the ends of government; when they ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly imitate the ſupreme ruler of the univerſe, "the ſceptre of whoſe king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is a right ſceptre." Legiſlators do this, when they are ſolicitous that all the laws they enact, be juſt and good, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent to thoſe of the ſupreme Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver. And thoſe that execute the laws,
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:011289_0031_0F869E440C9947E0"/>
when they act in their offices, with ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs and impartiality, that they may be a terror to evil-doers, and a praiſe to them that do well. All thoſe who are veſted with authority do this, when they have a tender concern for the rights and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges of the people, and endeavor to preſerve them entire and inviolate—when they feel for them under all their burdens; and "in all their afflictions are afflicted"—when they conſtrue their conduct into the moſt favorable ſenſe it will bear—when they are ready to paſs by, and excuſe as many faults and offences, as will conſiſt with the regular ſupport of government—when they are willing to loſe ſomething of the ſeverity of the magiſtrate, in the tenderneſs of a father—In a word; when in their adminiſtration, "mercy and truth meet together, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and peace kiſs each other."<note n="*" place="bottom">Pſalm LXXXV.10.</note>
            </p>
            <p>RULERS ſhould uſe their influence in, an eſpecial manner to promote religion. This they ſhould do, not only by reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing virtue, and puniſhing vice; but by what is often more influential, their own pious and good example. People in the
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:011289_0032_0F869E44EF8D1498"/>
lower claſſes in life, have a peculiar fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to imitate thoſe that are in ſtations of eminence and dignity. This would operate for the general good, were "great men always wiſe," virtuous, and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, in their converſation. The morals of a people are greatly affected by thoſe of their rulers. Religion flouriſhed or declined in Iſrael very much according to the diſpoſition and practice of their kings. Solomon obſerved that "if a ruler hearken to lies, all his ſervants are wicked."<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

                  </gap>
               </note> Vices receive a currency from the example of princes, as money doth, from their image and ſuperſcription. If magiſtrates are eminently pious and good, they are lights in the world, which ſhining before others induce them to "glorify our Father who is in heaven," by a correſpondent practice of piety and goodneſs. But if they are vicious, they are like baleful comets, that ſpread plagues and deſolations through a land, by their malignant influences.</p>
            <p>GOD <hi>is the judge,</hi> ſays our text. Rulers ſhould always conſider him in that cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. To him they are accountable for
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:011289_0033_0F869E4588560C68"/>
their conduct. I ſay not indeed that they are not, in ſome ſenſe, accountable to men. The power of government is by God, the original ſource of it, lodged in the people. By them it is delegated, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der divine providence, to certain of their brethren, to be improved for the common good. When therefore they proſtitute it to oppreſs and enſlave, in direct con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to the ends of government; the people have a right to call them to, account, and to take out of their hands the power which they have ſo abuſed.</p>
            <p>BUT they are eſpecially to conſider themſelves as accountable to God. They ſhould remember that he now acts the part of a judge, ſo far as by his impartial eye to ſurvey all their counſels, deſigns, and actions. They ſhould conſider him, as always preſent with them; and that their moſt ſecret purpoſes and ſchemes, are "naked and opened to the eyes of him, with whom they have to do"<note n="*" place="bottom">Heb. IV.13.</note>; whoſe "eyes are as a flame of fire<note n="‡" place="bottom">Rev.

               <pb n="35" facs="unknown:011289_0034_0F869E4648FA66A0"/>A SOLEMN ſenſe of God in this tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendous character, cultivated in the minds of rulers, would baniſh a thouſand temptations to venality and corruption. It would lead them to a humble review of their paſt behavior, that the errors of it may be repented of, and ſimilar ones avoided, for time to come. It would make them afraid to indulge to any ſelfiſh and ſiniſter deſigns, which militate againſt the public welfare, though they were ſure to conceal them from the eye of men. The fear of God would check the fear of man, and prevent it's prevailing on them, ſo as to enſnare them. They would not fear loſing their places, by faithfulneſs in diſcharging the duties of them. They would conſider, it is the favor of God that makes their mountain ſtand ſtrong; that their times are in his hands; the date of their political, as well as natural life.</p>
            <p>RULERS ſhould look forward to that approaching day, when they muſt appear before God's auguſt tribunal, and give account of all the talents he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to them. They ſhould endeavor
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:011289_0035_0F869E4A08374198"/>
to bring that day near in their meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. It is apt to appear more diſtant than it really is, and ſo leſſens to the eye of the mind, as objectd do by their diſtance to that of the body. The word of revelation aſſures us, that "it is appointed for all once to die, and that after death is the judgment;<note n="*" place="bottom">Heb. IX.27.</note>" and that "every one ſhall give account of himſelf to God,<note n="†" place="bottom">Rom. XIV.12.</note>" who is no reſpecter of perſons; but will render to every one according to his deeds. It is an invariable rule, according to which God will proceed in the judgment, "that unto whomſoever much is given, of him ſhall much be required."<note n="‡" place="bottom">Luke XII.48.</note> Rulers have much committed to them; unfaithfulneſs in the uſe of it, will render their guilt very great, and their doom very dreadful. If they are now conſcious of being ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitually and allowedly unfaithful, they may well tremble, as a wicked governor once did, upon hearing of a judgment to come.</p>
            <p>BUT a proſpect happily different from this—a proſpect as bright and glorious as this is dark and gloomy, opens upon that ruler, who cultivates in his heart the
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:011289_0036_0F869E4AD3612E80"/>principles of undiſſembled piety and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and forms his conduct upon them; whoſe governing aim is to comply with the will of God in all things, and to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure his approbation. He can look for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to that important day, in which God will judge the ſecrets of men by Jeſus Chriſt, with calmneſs and comfort. He then ſhall receive the plaudit of his Judge, before aſſembled worlds of angels and men—"Well done good and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſervant; thou haſt been faithful in a few things; I will make thee ruler over many things; enter thou into the joy of thy Lord!"<note n="*" place="bottom">Matth. XXV.21.</note>
            </p>
            <p>FINALLY. Our ſubject ſuggeſts the duty of a people to their rulers. Rulers and ſubjects are correlate terms; they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſubſiſt ſeperately. If God ſets ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the place of rulers, and inveſts them with a power to govern; He certainly appoints others to the place of ſubjects, and makes it their duty to ſubmit to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. People are bound to regard the will and agency of God In clothing perſons with civil authority. When they do ſo, they will obey "not only for
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:011289_0037_0F869E4B8098E4A0"/>
wrath, but alſo for conſcience ſake;"<note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. XIII.5.</note> and treat them according to the nature and deſign of their offices, and their fidelity in the diſcharge of them.</p>
            <p>IT is incumbent on a people chearfully to ſupport civil government. This is not to be viewed as the part of charity and generoſity, but of juſtice. The ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of thoſe, who employ their time and talents to ſerve the public, ſhould be made eaſy and honorable. Thoſe who diligently attend to the duties of their ſtations, have care, labor and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xiety enough: People ſhould not increaſe theſe, by withholding from them an adequate reward for their ſervices. This would tend to diſhearten them, and to weaken their efforts for the public good.</p>
            <p>A RESPECTFUL treatment of their rulers is alſo the duty of a people. It is an apoſtolical injunction, that we "render honor to whom honor is due."<note n="†" place="bottom">Rom. XIII.7.</note> It is due to thoſe, who are raiſed to important ſeats of government. We ſhould pray for them. We ſhould treat their perſons with veneration and eſteem. We ſhould
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:011289_0038_0F869E4C5226F518"/>
ſpeak of them, and to them, in decent and reſpectful language. To act contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to this, is to weaken the ſprings of government, and to encourage thoſe to "ſpeak evil of dignities," who are alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy too much inclined to do it. "It is written, thou ſhalt not ſpeak evil of the ruler of thy people."<note n="†" place="bottom">Act, XXIII.5.</note>
            </p>
            <p>A PEOPLE are in duty bound to ſubmit to their political fathers, in every thing lawful. If they refuſe this, they fruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate the deſign of God and men, in cloathing them with this character; and government is at an end. Submiſſion is injoined on a people, by ſeveral of the inſpired writers. The paſſages in which it is ſo, have been often quoted, on occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions ſimilar to the preſent, and are I truſt too well known to need repeating at large.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Rom. XIII.1, —7.</note> They have by ſome been made to prove too much. They are no doubt to be underſtood with ſome limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. "He is the miniſter of God to thee for good," ſays St. Paul, of the civil magiſtrate. This implies, that ſo far as he purſues the end for which God placed him in office, he is to be obeyed.
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:011289_0039_0F869E4D82649068"/>
Nor ſhould ſmall inſtances, in which we imagine he fails of this, be looked upon ſufficient ground for refuſing ſubmiſſion. Tneſe may ariſe rather from human frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, than any ſettled diſpoſition in him to abuſe his power. But when he uſes his authority for purpoſes juſt the reverſe of thoſe for which it was delegated to him— when he evidently encroaches on the natural and conſtitutional rights of the ſubject—when he tramples on thoſe laws which were made, at once to limit his power, and defend the people—in ſuch caſes they are not obliged to obey him. They are guilty of impiety againſt God; and of injuſtice to themſelves, and the community, of which they are mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, if they do: for his commands inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere with thoſe of the ſupreme ruler, and overthrow the foundations of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which he hath laid. "We muſt obey God rather than man."<note n="*" place="bottom">Acts V.29.</note>
            </p>
            <p>THE doctrine of paſſive obedience and non-reſiſtence, which had ſo many advocates in our nation, a century ago, is at this day, generally given up, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſenſible, and voted unreaſonable and
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:011289_0040_0F869E4DC69E4660"/>
abſurd. The unreaſonableneſs and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity of it, hath indeed been proved by ſome of the greateſt reaſoners of our age.</p>
            <q>WHERESOEVER law ends (ſays the great MF.LOCKE) tyranny begins, if the law be tranſgreſſed to another's harm. And whoever in authority ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds the power given him by law, and makes uſe of the force he hath under his command, to compaſs that upon the ſubject, which the law allows not, ceaſes in that to be a magiſtrate; and, acting without authority, may be oppoſed as any other man, who invades the right of another.—Here, 'tis likely, (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues he) the common queſtion will be made, who ſhall be judge, whether the prince or legiſlature act contrary to their truſt? This, perhaps, ill-affected and factious men may ſpread among the people, when the prince only makes uſe of his juſt prerogative. To this I reply: The people ſhall be judge; for who ſhall be judge whether his truſtee or deputy acts well, and according to the truſt repoſed in him, but he who deputes him, and muſt, by having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:011289_0041_0F869E4E91F6C910"/>
him, have ſtill a power to diſcard him, when he fails in his truſt? If this be reaſonable in particular caſes of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate men, why ſhould it be otherwiſe in that of the greateſt moment, where the welfare of millions is concerned; and alſo where the evil, if not prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is greater, and the redreſs very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, dear, and dangerous?</q>
            <p>THERE may indeed be danger that ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſed men—men diſaffeted to govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in general, will "uſe this liberty," which the God of nature hath given us, "for an occaſion to the fleſh," to gratify the diſorderly luſts of it; and ſo to diſturb the peace of the ſociety, of which they are members. But this is not a ſufficient reaſon why we ſhould diſcontinue our claim to it.</p>
            <p>SUBJECTS will, however, find it to their advantage to ſuffer great inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences, rather than to riſe up againſt men in authority. They are not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect an adminiſtration without faults. Small faults ſhould not be remarked on with bitterneſs, or mignified with all
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:011289_0042_0F869E4F5D482B88"/>
the power of invention. This would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the burden of government, already heavy enough on thoſe, who are faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in diſcharging the duties of it; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>end to diſcourage thoſe from taking a part in it, who are beſt qualified. A generous readineſs to make every kind allowance for what may be amiſs in others, is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps one of the rareſt qualities in the world: It is however a very neceſſary one, in the ſeveral connexions of ſociety, and particularly in that between rulers and people.</p>
            <p>IF any thing hath been ſuggeſted in this diſcourſe, which may ſerve to lead rulers, or people, into a better underſtanding of their duty, and to ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate them to diligence and fidelity in diſcharging it, the deſign of our aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling in this houſe of worſhip is not loſt. I will ſuppoſe you poſſeſſed of every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive ſentiment that hath been ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, if any ſuch there hath been, and therefore ſhall not make a recapitulation of what hath been ſaid, in the way of particular addreſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="unknown:011289_0043_0F869E4FF84A9178"/>INATTENTION to the duties of their ſtations is inexcuſable in all orders of men. It becomes criminal and dangerous, in proportion to the importance of theſe duties. The public welfare greatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on the fidelity and vigilance of civil rulers.</p>
            <p>IT is I hope with ſincere gratitude to God, that we ſee this anniverſary. The public tranſactions of it, <hi>Honored Fathers,</hi> we look upon to be very intereſting to this people. We have been ſeeking to the fountain of wiſdom, for guidance and direction to be afforded to you, in them. To day you exerciſe an important pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege of our happy conſtitution, that of chooſing Gentlemen to ſit at the Council board; who are not only to conſtitute one branch of the legiſlature, but <q>to the beſt of their judgment, at all times, freely to give their advice to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, for the good management of the public affairs of this government.</q> This is a privilege on which the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this people not a little depends. It was always dear to our fathers, and is ſo to us. By it we have the great ſatiſfaction
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:011289_0044_0F869E539A2DA900"/>
of ſeeing the Council conſiſt of men from among ourſelves, whoſe inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt is the ſame with that of the people; and who are under all conceivable obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations to ſeek their welfare. This is a privilege ſecured to us by <hi>royal charter</hi>; on which ſecurity, I truſt, under God, we may depend, for the continuance of it down to the lateſt poſterity. A privilege which we have not forfeited; and God forbid we ſhould, in any future time, be guilty of ſuch conduct, as might render it juſt to deprive us of it.</p>
            <p>WHAT we injoy by charter, is not to be looked upon barely as matter of grace; but, in a meaſure at leaſt, of right. Our fathers faithfully performed the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, on which charter privileges were granted. To do this they paſſed through a ſcene of hardſhips labors and ſufferings. Theſe were productive of great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages to the mother country. Our char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter privileges are thoſe of Engliſhmen; thoſe of the Britiſh conſtitution; as our form of government, in this province, is an image in miniature of that of our nation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="unknown:011289_0045_0F869E54304350F0"/>THE appointment of the Governor, and commander in chief, is by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince charter, which we wiſh never to ſee vacated, reſerved to the crown. In this we acquieſce: We indeed conſider it as preferable to annual elections by the people.</p>
            <p>BOTH the other branches of the legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature, we have the liberty of chooſing. We hope the good people of this province have acted, with due conſideration, in the choice they have made of perſons to repreſent them, in the preſent aſſembly; and that all who are to be concerned in the elections of this day, will be influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced by motives, truely religious and patriotic. It is not wealth <note n="*" place="bottom">WHEN L. Quintius Cincinnatus was created Dictator, riches were not by the generality of the Roman citizens thought neceſſary to preferment. His eſtate was a farm conſiſting only of four acres of land: He was at plough when the deputies came to him from the Senate, to acquaint him of his promotion. Wherever wiſdom and virtue were found in a perſon, though deſtitute of a fortune, he ſtood fair to be advanced. And yet there were a few a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Romans even in that day, as there is a greater number among us in this, who are well deſcribed by Livy, when he ſays — <q>Operae pretium eſt audire, qui omnia prae divitiis humana ſpernunt; neque honori magno locum, neque virtuti putant eſſe, niſi eſfuſe affluant opes.</q>
               </note>— it is not family—it is not either of theſe alone, nor both of them together tho' I readily,

allow neither is to be diſregarded, that will qualify men for important ſeats in government, unleſs they are rich and honorable in other and more important reſpects. This province hath had men, and ſuch I doubt not there are ſtill among us, in whom all theſe qualities are happily united. But in the firſt place, and before all other things, you ſhould regard wiſdom and integrity, underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and religion, as qualifications for the buſineſs of government. If you aim to chooſe men thus qualified, you are "workers together with God," who is the fountain of all promotion. If you give your ſuffrages for thoſe, whom you know to be of a contrary character, you are chargeable with nothing leſs than a voluntary oppoſition to the will of heaven. A ſerious thought, with which, we wiſh to have your minds deeply impreſſed.</p>
            <p>IT is always important to have wiſe and faithful rulers. It is peculiarly ſo, when the ſtate of a people is difficult and perplexed. None can doubt our's being ſuch, at the preſent day. All muſt agree

in this, however different their ſentiments may be, as to the immediate occaſions of our troubles. Mutual confidence and affection, between Great-Britain and theſe Colonies, I ſpeak it with grief, ſeems to be in ſome meaſure loſt. I truſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of our loyalty to the beſt of Kings, or of our readineſs to yield obedience to the <hi>due</hi> exerciſe of the authority of the Britiſh Parliament, is loſt. People indeed generally apprehend ſome of their moſt important civil rights and privileges to be in great danger; and that ſeveral of them cannot be enjoyed under the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of certain acts, lately paſſed in the Parliament of Great-Britain. How far theſe apprehenſions are juſt, is not my province to determine. Nor ſhall I pretend fully to point out the political cauſes of our unhappineſs; or the ſteps which are neceſſary to be taken, for the redreſs of our grievances.</p>
            <p>THIS matter more immediately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to you, our honored Fathers. If we ſuffer by being miſrepreſented to our moſt gracious Sovereign, or to his miniſtry, 'tis your part to remove the

hurtful influence hereof, in ſuch ways, as you ſhall think moſt proper and decent. 'Tis your's, to ſet the temper and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of this people, in a juſt light before the throne. 'Tis your's, to carry their cries, and tears, and humble petitions thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. 'Tis your's, to plead their cauſe, with "right words," which "are force<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able," and "words of truth," which muſt, which will prevail.</p>
            <p>THE Miniſters of religion will unite their endeavors, to inveſtigate and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, the moral cauſe of our troubles. We ſhould endeavor, my reverend Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Brethren, and I truſt we have been endeavoring, to direct the eye of our people to the hand of God, in the evils which are come upon us, and which threaten us. "Is there any evil in the city, and the Lord hath not done it?" <note n="*" place="bottom">Amos.

and reformation, as the only way, in which we can expect the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of our difficulties? It hath probably been the fault of this people, in theſe days of darkneſs and doubtful expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that they have fixed their thoughts too much on ſecond cauſes, without duly regarding the firſt—that they have been too ready to cenſure the conduct of others, without making proper reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on their own. Hath not God rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to complain of us, as he did of Iſrael, in a day of calamity; "I hearkened and heard, but they ſpake not aright.

            <p>THE proſpect at this day is indeed dark: The darkeſt part of it ariſes from the decay of religion, and the prevalence of wickedneſs among us. Is it not too evident to be denied, that "iniquity greatly abounds," and that "the love of many" to God and religion, "is waxen cold?" Muſt we not own that by our ſins, we have forfeited all our privileges, into the hands of God; though I truſt not, into the hands of men? And are

Is it poſſible a people ſhould be happy, when pride, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagance, luxury, and intemperance abound among them? Will not poverty and diſeaſe, uneaſineſs and contention, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally ſpring from theſe vices? Doth not the providence of God loudly call on all orders of men, to unite their moſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous endeavors, to check the growth of the ſins which I have mentioned, and of others which might be named; ſuch as the profanation of God's name,<note n="*" place="bottom">If God's holy name is, at this day, too frequently and ſometimes irreverently invoked, even in a judicial man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, every ſincere friend to virtue and religion muſt wiſh to have this practice, ſo affrontive to the <hi>Deity,</hi> and ſo deſtructive to the morals of the people, diſcontinued.</note> and day; uncleanneſs; and acts of violence, injuſtice, and oppreſſion We confide in the wiſdom and fidelity of our rulers, to make and execute good and wholſome laws for the ſuppreſſion of theſe vices; and for the encouragement of induſtry, frugality, and temperance, and all thoſe virtues which conſtitute and adorn the chriſtian character; and to add life and energy to law, by their own good exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.

            <p>Be this the object of our principal hopes, and deſires! Let us continue patient in the ways of well doing; ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for glory, honor and immortality; till, through the riches of God's grace in Chriſt, we be crowned with eternal life.</p>
