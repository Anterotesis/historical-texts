            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>WHEN I wrote the following diſcourſe, I was indifferent about its being prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; but as it has been miſunderſtood by ſome, the partiality of my friends perſwaded me to ſend it abroad into the world to ſpeak for itſelf. And I beg leave to obſerve to the reader by way of preface, that my capital deſign in this ſermon was to do honor to the military character, without keeping up thoſe dividing names, or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty diſtinctions of <hi>Britiſh</hi> and <hi>American</hi> when applied to a general character; and that I might revive the true martial ſpirit, which is ſunk in this province much too low, for the preſent day.</p>
            <p>IN illuſtrating the importance of the mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary character, I conſider the troops raiſed in <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>America</hi> as joined in one <hi>Britiſh</hi> victorious Army,—enliſted under one head,— engaged in, and purſuing one common cauſe,—the mutual intereſt and ſafety of the whole.</p>
            <p>WHEN I ſpeak of the ſkill or courage of any <hi>European</hi> troops or commanders, I do not mean to derogate any thing of the military honors of my dear country-men, or any of his Majeſty's troops raiſed in <hi>America</hi>;—their native courage has been too often tryed to leave any room to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute it, or to doubt of its being equal to any that can be found throughout the <hi>Britiſh</hi> dominions; and their improvement in the military arts, has
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:012044_0006_0F896F08C74B5328"/>
been as great as could perhaps be expected, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the infancy of the country;—the vaſt demand of labourers in the arts of agriculture and trade; — and the very little uſe we ever had for regular troops on this continent, till the laſt war.</p>
            <p>WHEN I ſpeak of the preſervation of the public tranquillity, as connected with the military character, well ſupported,—I do not mean to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate as if I thought the keeping an armed force, within our thick inhabited towns or cities in a time of peace, was either ſafe or neceſſary to the preſervation of the public peace: But that the ſtate ſhould be able on every emergency to ſend an army of well-diſciplined troops, men of valour, expert in war, either into the field, or to the ſea-coaſt or frontiers, to withſtand or repel a foreign enemy, or if need be, aid, under the direction of the Laws, the civil powers at home, when the public peace is endangered or diſturbed by the ſons of violence.</p>
            <p>IT is a hard queſtion, how wars became neceſſary? — But inſtead of puzzling our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves about the origin of war, let us unite in ardent prayers to the Prince of peace, that he would haſten the happy time, according to the prophecy and the promiſe, when he ſhall erect one univerſal kingdom of peace under the whole heavens, and reign from ſea to ſea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth.</p>

            <head>AN Artillery-Election Sermon.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <q>
                  <bibl>
                     <hi>EXODUS XV.3.</hi>
                  </bibl>
                  <p>The Lord is a man of war, the Lord is his name.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>WAR is a political evil, which is become neceſſary, upon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction of natural and moral evil: And will remain neceſſary ſo long as <hi>they</hi> are allowed to prevail in this degenerate world: Therefore the <hi>man of war</hi> is become an intereſting and important character:—And though <hi>it</hi> connects a train of very gloomy ideas, in the human breaſt, eſpecially when inſpired with the genius of the goſpel, yet, from its importance, and the noble principles by which alone it can be ſupported, it is become truly honorable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:012044_0008_0F896F0A38D95458"/>THE honor of this important character, cannot riſe higher, nor gain an attitude more ſublime, than <hi>that</hi> which it aſſumes in the ſtyle of my text. <hi>The Lord is a man of war, the Lord is his name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>FROM which words I ſhall endeavour to vindicate the dignity and importance of the military character.</p>
            <p>AS the words are found in that celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſong of Moſes, which he inſcribed to the Lord, who triumphed gloriouſly over Pharaoh and his hoſt at the red-ſea; ſo they are to be underſtood poetically. And the divine perſonage, who is called a man of war, whoſe name is Jehovah, is probably the bleſſed Meſſiah, then in the form of God, under whoſe ſpecial protection and guidance, as the conſtituted Lord of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, Iſrael paſſed from a ſtate of bondage in Egypt, through the red-ſea, ſafe, as on dry-land, while Pharaoh's chariots, and his purſuing hoſts ſank amidſt the cloſing bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows to the bottom, as a ſtone, and were drowned in the mighty waters.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:012044_0009_0F896F0AF867E548"/>THE military character, in this connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſtands in a very amiable, as well as eminent point of light.</p>
            <p>THE dignity and importance of this character, has, I know, been the common profeſſed ſubject of this day; yet, I will not ſay, it has been exhauſted: For the dignity originates in <hi>him</hi> whoſe perfections are infinite, and, its importance keeps pace with life, liberty, religion and happineſs.</p>
            <p>THE ſubject remains inexhauſtible, and furniſhes ſtill, with new matter to ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, direct and facilitate the duties of this <hi>Anniverſary:</hi> And will continue to do ſo, till the bleſſed <hi>Millennium</hi> ſhall take place, when the nations ſhall, with one conſent, beat their ſwords into plow-ſhares, and their ſpears into pruning hooks, and ſhall learn war no more; but form under the gentle reign of the Prince of peace, one grand univerſal Monarchy of harmony and love.</p>
            <p>TO be like our Father who is in heaven, or to reſemble the bleſſed <hi>Immanuel,</hi> in thoſe characters which he aſſumed for our
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:012044_0010_0F896F0BB86721F8"/>
inſtruction and imitation is the higheſt honor, and the trueſt felicity we can aſpire to.</p>
            <p>AND tho' the divine Being ſeems to glory in the title, <hi>God of love and peace</hi>; and tho' the bleſſed Jeſus, his incarnate ſon is emphatically the "<hi>prince of peace,</hi>" and came to make peace, and has left it in command, as the leading precept of chriſtianity, "follow peace with all men:" Yet ſin having entered and fired the paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men, and bid luſt, ambition and fell diſcord, ſpread wild diſorder through theſe regions of mortality;— ſince ſtern ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny and cruel oppreſſion, twin-brats of hell, extend their iron bands to enſlave the free-born mind, ſaying, "bow down your ſouls that we may go over you;" —the God of peace ſounds an alarm and calls to arms! —to arms! And his divine Son, the meek and lowly, aſſumes the character in my text, the <hi>man of war.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND as a mighty Prince of meek majeſty, he places himſelf at the head of his nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous hoſts, and girds on the ſword upon his thigh, with his bow and crown he
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:012044_0011_0F896F0C77D1C798"/>
marches on, conquering and to conquer. And to his enemies he proclaims
<q>What have I to do with peace! I am not come to ſend peace but a ſword, and curſed be he that doth the work of the Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfully, curſed be he that with-holdeth his ſword from blood:—Bleſſed are they who do to their enemies as they have done to them—bleſſed is he, who taketh and daſheth their little ones againſt the ſtones.</q>
—I ſhudder at theſe laſt expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:—I would not miſrepreſent the ſacred text; nor do I mean to repreſent the Divine Being, as laying aſide the amiable character of the God of love, or as if he ever acted in oppoſition to it; or as if the compaſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Jeſus, that friend of mankind, delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in blood and ſlaughter: An idea this, moſt abhorrent of the Deity, and infinitely remote from the character, or from being any eſſential part of that character I mean to honor. But when war becomes neceſſary, through the luſts of men, God for the vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of his own honor, and the defence of his peoples rights, conſecrates the ſword to religion, and
<q>his right hand takes hold on vengeance;</q>
—and having commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned his eternal Son, to do all his dreadful
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:012044_0012_0F896F0D38894FF8"/>
work of judgment; He, as captain of the Lord's hoſts, takes the field, and connects the man of <hi>war,</hi> with the chriſtian <hi>Hero,</hi> and makes the fidelity of the good ſoldier, an eſſential part of that religion which is founded on the immoveable baſis of moral virtue and chriſtian grace—a part of that religion which unites love to God with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence to men.</p>
            <p>THIS divine perſonage aſſumed and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported the military character, eſpecially in the theocracy of the Jews, his own people, to whom he ſtood in a political relation, as their Prince and governor, as well as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer and Savior.</p>
            <p>AND that he might ſtrengthen their faith, animate their courage, and ſecure to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf their allegiance, he ſtipulated with them the Sinai-covenant, and under the oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of that covenant frequently appeared to them in human form, to anticipate his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture incarnation.</p>
            <p>AND He choſe to appear ſometimes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the military character, that he might ſupport its dignity, as in that remarkable
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:012044_0013_0F896F0DF67A9050"/>
inſtance, to Joſhua, near the well of Jericho. For
<q>it came to paſs when Joſhua was by Jericho, he lift up his eyes and looked, and behold their ſtood a man over againſt him, with a drawn ſword in his hand: and Joſhua went unto him, and ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, Art thou for us, or for our adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries? And he ſaid, Nay, but as captain of the hoſt of the Lord am I now come. And Joſhua fell on his face to the earth, and did worſhip, and ſaith unto him, What ſaith my Lord un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his ſervant? And the captain of the Lord's hoſt ſaid unto Joſhua, looſe thy ſhoe from off thy foot, for the place whereon thou ſtandeſt is holy; and Joſhua did ſo.</q> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <p>Now that this was a divine Perſonage who appeared to Joſhua is obvious to all: He could not be a good Angel, for he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſly required a token of ſubmiſſion;—put off thy ſhoe,— and urged it with this conſideration, that the ground on which he ſtood was holy—conſecrated by his preſence; and he admits of an act of religious homage, "for Joſhua fell on his face to the earth, and did worſhip," which a good Angel would neither have required, or admitted. He could not be an evil Angel; for the appearance was in favor of Joſhua, and his military operations, and ſo Satan would be divided againſt himſelf, contrary to his ſettled principles of policy:—He could not be one of the human race, for his appearance was ſupernatural, and his aſpect wore ſuch evident marks of divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity that Joſhua does not heſitate to call him his LORD (<hi>Heb.</hi>) ADONAI,—ſupreme governor of all things.</p>
                  <p>AND it is equally evident, that this divine perſon was the Son of God; for he not only aſſumes the title Jehovah, but the leader and conductor of all the hoſts of Jehovah, eſpecially the armies of Iſrael, whom he had taken under his peculiar care and protection; for he is conſtituted head over all things, eſpecially thoſe that pertain to his Church and Kingdom;— and the Apoſtle Paul expreſſly ſays, that he who conducted Iſrael through the wilderneſs, and ſupported them in their wars with the Canaanites was Jeſus Chriſt, 1 Cor. 10.4.</p>
                  <p>AND he frequently appeared to others on great and ſpecial oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, as to Abram, when he was about to call him from a ſtate of idolatry, and to conſtitute him head of the faithful— to Jacob when he was in danger of being ſwallowed up by his envious brother;—to Moſes in the burning buſh; — and after his reſurrection and aſcention, to Saul in his way to Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſcus;—and to his diſciples when in great fear of the Jews, &amp;c.</p>

               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:012044_0014_0F896F0EB6DA7B00"/>AND as captain-general of all the hoſts of heaven and earth, He muſtered martialed, and marched them to the field of battle, when he pleaſed, for the defence and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of his choſen people:—And under him they always proved ſucceſsful, and came off more than conquerors; for he formed viſible or inviſible guards round about them that feared him, or were faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in their allegiance to him.</p>
            <p>AS captain of the hoſts of the Lord, he promiſed his people that he would fight all their battles for them, ſo long as they ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily adhered to him:—He would be as a
<q>wall of fire round about them, and the glory in the midſt of them:</q>
He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore forbid them making thoſe war-like
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:012044_0015_0F896F10400CF850"/>
preparations which otherwiſe would have been abſolutely neceſſary for their defence and ſafety.</p>
            <p>UNDER this character he has all nature at command;—no clerk of the muſter-roll can call over the liſt of his forces: for the number of his armies is countleſs. The heavenly hoſts:—the angelic legions are his choſen troops: — The chariots of the Lord are twenty thouſand; thouſands of Angels. If but one of theſe take the field under the direction and commiſſion of his divine leader, the camp is ſpread with more than an hundred and eighty thouſand ſlain:— Next to theſe the ſtarry legions, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to his alarm-liſt, muſter, march, and fight in their courſes, under his command, and diſcomfit the enemies of his people. The clouds, winds, ſtorms, tempeſt, thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and hail, are but different battalions, and compoſe his army of obſervation, which he "reſerves againſt the day of battle and of war."</p>
            <p>AND there is not an element, inſect or reptile, but, when commiſſioned by him, who is the Lord of hoſts, may ſtyle itſelf
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:012044_0016_0F896F1108CED260"/>
God's hoſt, and become "terrible as an army with banners:" As that reptile and inſect-army did, the grand and figurative deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of which, we have in the 2d Chapter of Joel.—The prophet Habakkuk deſcribes the military manoeuvres of this mighty warrior in a ſtyle peculiar to himſelf:—
<q>He came from Teman, and the holy one from mount Paran, and he went forth for the ſalvation of his people. He marched through the land in indignation;—He threſhed the heathen in his anger;—the ſtubborn nations were cut in ſunder—the everlaſting mountains were ſcattered, the immoveable hills bowed,—the river's ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid ſtream paſſed on in ſilence,—the deep uttered her voice:—the ſun ſtood ſtill, amazed:—the moon hid her pale face:— the pillars of heaven ſhook for fear, and the earth trembled to her center, while the God marched on in martial pomp, and diſplayed the honors of the man of war.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THOUGH this divine man of war, has long ſince droped the political relation which he bore, as a prince or political Father to the Iſraelitiſh nation, which
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:012044_0017_0F896F11B6B4D648"/>
relation terminated with the Sinai-covenant, yet he continues to ſuſtain the military character with equal dignity, under the milder diſpenſations of the covenant of grace. Here indeed he appears under the form of a ſervant;—the gentle Lamb of God: And in his general deportment he breathed nothing but love; and peace, and goodneſs; yet ſuch rays of meek majeſty broke forth through the cloud of humanity, as proclaimed him the
<q>Son of God with power—the King of Zion, who had more than twelve legions of Angels at com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and all nature obedient to his will.</q>
            </p>
            <p>WHEN he was about to cloſe up the viſion, and to make an end of prophecy, he ſhewed himſelf to his ancient apoſtle John, under the moſt magnificent titles of a victorious commander:—In one point of view, we behold him mounted on a war-horſe, with his bow and with his crown, to denote his martial ſkill and royal dignity, and he rides on victorious, from one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt to another; imparting the enſigns of victory to his faithful followers. In ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther point of light, he is repreſented as leading forth the armies of heaven againſt
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:012044_0018_0F896F1278CFE648"/>
the enemies of his church, while on his robe and on the ſword upon his thigh, is wrote "<hi>King of Kings and Lord of Lords;</hi>" to ſignify univerſal empire over all princes and potentates in earth and heaven.—Thus he raiſed the military character to the higheſt dignity, which was the firſt thing I had in view:—The next, is to illuſtrate the utility and importance of this character to public happineſs.</p>
            <p>THIS point is eſtabliſhed by the former: For if the military character is of ſuch dignity, that, the incarnate Redeemer,
<q>who is the brightneſs of the Father's glory,</q>
has ſeen ſit to aſſume and act under it, through the varying modes of the theocracy, when in the form of God, and ſupported it through the ſtate of his incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, when in the form of a ſervant, and ſtill continues to honor it, as the Lord of Sabaoth, and will, till he has gained the final conqueſt over all the powers of earth and hell, when he will
<q>reſign the kingdom unto the Father, and God ſhall be all in all;</q>
then certainly, it muſt not only be a character of the higheſt honor, but of the greateſt utility and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:012044_0019_0F896F1337D61910"/>
to public happineſs: For happineſs is the great <hi>good;</hi>—to inſure and promote <hi>this,</hi> was the beneficent deſign of his miſſion, and the leading characters he aſſumed and acted under;—the grand point in view was, that he might defend the rights of his people, and bleſs the world with peace and happineſs. But that I might animate your hopes and invigorate the true principles of heroiſm implanted in your generous breaſts, give me leave to point out to you, a few particulars, wherein public happineſs ſtands connected with the military character, well ſupported.</p>
            <p>AS the military, is not an original cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter;— it became neceſſary and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant upon the introduction of ſin; ſo it muſt be uſeful and important as long as ſin corrupts the world;—fires the paſſions of men, and diſturbs the public tranquility.</p>
            <p>IT is neceſſary and uſeful for the defence of our lives, our liberties, property and peace. If theſe are dear and important, the military character is ſo, as by <hi>that,</hi> theſe, under God are defended and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:012044_0020_0F896F13F8737E08"/>IT is neceſſary, to withſtand the powers of hell;— to reſiſt the boundleſs ambition of tyrants;— to curb the lawleſs pride of nations, and the impetuous luſts of men. To theſe, where the military character has been wanting or not well ſupported, life and liberty, ſtates and kingdoms, have fell, devoted victims.</p>
            <p>IT was the military character well ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, that contributed very much to raiſe ancient <hi>Rome</hi> to her glory and opulence; and the want of <hi>this</hi> expoſed the world to the ravages of the <hi>Pompies,</hi> the <hi>Caeſars</hi> and the <hi>Alexanders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT was ſkill in arms, and the well im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements of that ſkill, which gave the appellation of the "<hi>thundering Legion</hi>" to the chriſtian battalions in defence of their natural rights, when invaded by the powers and malice of the infidel world. In ſhort, it is this, under Providence, which has ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>Great-Britain</hi> more than once, from impending ruin; and tranſmitted down to us both our civil and ſacred rights.</p>
            <p>AND we can not ſo ſoon forget of what
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:012044_0021_0F896F14C05A1E50"/>
importance or how uſeful the military cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter has been to us, <hi>Britiſh-America,</hi> eſpecially in the late war when the Britiſh arms were made to triumph over more than half the globe:—From Lake <hi>Superior</hi> to the <hi>Manillas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHAT diſtreſs were the Britiſh Colonies in, ſoon after the opening of the laſt war, when we ſaw a potent, ſubtle and treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous enemy at the head of almoſt all our commanding waters, aided by ſavages, the hardy ſons of the wilderneſs, whoſe tender mercies are cruelties.</p>
            <p>WE attempted to repel force by force, but the want of a thorough acquaintance with the art military, obſtructed the councils of war at home, and the want of diſciplined troops, who were bred to war, and who could well ſupport the military character in the field, rendered our firſt attempts abortive;—the conſequence of this was, we ſaw our fortreſſes, taken from us;— our frontiers were depopulated and burnt, our wives raviſhed and then butchered;— our daughters deflowered and led away captive, and our children confined in
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:012044_0022_0F896F15760D72B8"/>
ſavage dens;—our brethren ſlain in the encounter, and left ſcalped, mangled, unburied, food for ſavage beaſts as well as footleſs worms, and their bones to this day whitening in the ſun:— Horrid ſcenes! I forbare. —We cried to God, and the Lord of hoſts heard, and ſent us aid—but choſe to honour the military character; and the Britiſh troops, veteran, diſciplined troops, bred to war, when joined with thoſe of the colonies, were the inſtruments of our deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance and ſafety.—The Britiſh troops croſſed the Atlantic with their heavy artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, under the command of gentlemen who were not wanting in military ſkill, yet unacquainted with the genius of the enemy they had to oppoſe, and therefore did not ſucceed at firſt to their wiſhes and our ſanguine hopes, yet put a ſtop to the progreſs of the enemy till the cool, but intrepid AMHERST came, who was a man of war from his youth, and to whom heaven decreed the principal honor of our ſalvation.</p>
            <p>HE, happy man! entered at once into the genius of the enemy; — acquainted himſelf with the exact ſituation of thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:012044_0023_0F896F16F9578508"/>
in which he deſigned ſhould center his future capital operations; and from his conſumate ſkill in arms, and the art mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, he ſo diſpoſed of the main body of his army and their ſeveral detachments, as entirely fruſtrated the deſigns of the enemy, and conſpired to general conqueſt. What a croud of victories attended in cloſe ſucceſſion, and crowned the military opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which took place under the direction of this able General! —<hi>Cape-Briton, Nia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gara, Ticondaroga, Crown-point, Quebec, Montreal,</hi> in ſhort, all <hi>Canada</hi> and her dependants. <note n="†" place="bottom">BY mentioning Mr. AMHERST as chief, under whoſe general direction the above conqueſts were obtained, I do not mean to detract from the honor of that indiſputable Hero, Major-General WOLFE, under whoſe immediate command, <hi>Quebec,</hi> the metropolis of <hi>Canada</hi> was reduced, in ſuch a manner, in the face of every danger, and in ſpite of all the difficulties that nature and art could throw in the way, as did the greateſt honor to that gentleman, whoſe bravery nothing could exceed, and whoſe ſkill and refinements in the arts of war equalled any of his rank and experience. Nor do I mean to overlook Sir WILLIAM JOHNSON who had the honor of reducing <hi>Niagara,</hi> attended with ſuch circumſtances, as in point of proweſs and preſence of mind placed this gentleman on a level with European general officers:—But after all Sir JEFFERY AMHERST muſt be allowed to be peculiarly formed for the ſervice to which he was apppointed in <hi>America:</hi> Hiſtory, I dare ſay, ſcarcely affords a more extraordinary co-incidence of Providence, or a more ſtriking inſtance of excellent military conduct, a clearer foreſight, or ſounder judgment than was demonſtrated by the meeting of the three armies before <hi>Montreal,</hi> which had, under his direction, taken different routs, through a dangerous and difficult country, where it was hardly poſſible to keep up any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication between each other, till they nearly reached, the main object in view:—The general with that part of the army which he ſaw fit to take with him, made the long and arduous tour of Lake <hi>Ontario</hi> and <hi>Iſle Royale,</hi> ſo fell down the River <hi>St. Lawrence,</hi> till he reached <hi>Montreal,</hi> where he landed in good order, on the ſixth of September, 1760. Brigadier General MURRAY, with a part of the garriſon of <hi>Quebec,</hi> and a Naval force, came up the river and joined him the next day. Col. HAVILAND and the corps which he commanded, who took the way of <hi>Champlain</hi> and the <hi>Iſle du Noix,</hi> joined the main body, the day following; ſo that if General AMHERST had been favoured with the intire government of Providence, he could not have timed things better, or more to his advantage.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:012044_0024_0F896F17EA108E00"/>FAIR victory held out her honors to this her favourite ſon, while ſhe proclaimed through all America the dignity and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of the military character. This character will always be important and uſeful, till that religion, which is firſt pure and then peaceable, gains an univerſal influence over the hearts and lives of men, and ſubjects mankind to her gentle and benign precepts: Then, and not till then, will wars ceaſe;—then, and not till then, will the military character ceaſe to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant and uſeful.</p>
            <p>AND as the preſent ſtate of things is, and ſo long as divine providence preſerves its ordinary courſe, the public tranquillity cannot be long preſerved, peace maintained at home, or our ſacred and civil rights and liberties ſecured from foreign invaſion of ambitious and unreaſonable men, without

               <p>I SHALL not ſo far forget my own cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter as to point out to you the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar duties of yours.

               <p>IT is my department to recommend, and to urge in his name who is a man of war, the practice of his religion which gives virtue to the military character; without which its true honor and dignity can never be ſupported, and its uſefulneſs and importance muſt in a great meaſure be loſt; and what is worſe, without religion it will degenerate into an engine of infamy, and prove moſt deſtructive of public hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.</p>
               <p>THAT the knowledge and practice of the religion of the bleſſed Jeſus, is eſſential to the honor and uſefulneſs of this character

               <p>I WOULD not intimate that every good chriſtian is of conſequence a good ſoldier, — an accompliſhed man of war; but this I will venture to ſay, there cannot be a good ſoldier, an accompliſhed man of war, deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titute of the principles and practice of chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity. The good ſoldier, whether officer or private, whoſe mind is formed upon the genius of the goſpel, and life, upon the model of the doctrines and precepts of chriſtianity, while at home, in the city or village, will behave himſelf as a good citizen, in ſtrict conformity to the laws of the land, lead a
<q>peaceable life in godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and honeſty,</q>
in adherence to that chriſtian precept, "<hi>be pitiful, be courteous,</hi>" and under the auſpices of magiſtracy, will always be ready, to ſuppreſs riot, tumult and ſedition, which endanger the ſtate and diſturb the public tranquillity: — When called to jeopard his life in the high places of the field, he will play the man for his God, for the cities of his God, and for his country. He conſiders that not a ſparrow falls to the ground without the knowledge of his heavenly Father; and is therefore
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:012044_0027_0F896F19F854BB08"/>
not afraid, with any amazement of ten thouſand of the people, and though a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand fall at his right hand, and ten thouſand on his left, yet he knows that ſo long as life is a bleſſing, the deadly ſhot ſhall not come nigh him:—So that in the midſt of the horrors of claſhing arms, and of gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments rolled in blood, he remains intrepid: the thought of dying for his country in the cauſe of truth and duty, and living with his God and Saviour in a better world, animates and imboldens him to encounter the moſt hazardous enterprizes.
<q>By faith he waxes valiant in fight—eſcapes the edge of the ſword, and puts to flight the alien army.</q>
               </p>
               <p>YOU ſee, Gentlemen, the dignity and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of the character you ſuſtain. It is truly honorable,—'tis very ancient,—'tis almoſt as old as the creation, and as impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant as life and liberty, as public peace and happineſs. I know, Gentlemen, you mean to ſupport the dignity and continue to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the laudable end of your original inſtitution:—a ſeminary of the art of war:— a nurſery of heroes for the field. Be then religious, liſt under your Captain-general, who ſtyles himſelf a man of war—the Lord

is his name. And while you act the ſoldier, act the chriſtian, emulate the example of your divine leader. Breath his ſpirit, and form upon his model:—this will preſerve from that horrid abuſe of arms, which has too often detracted from the true dignity and utility of the military character, and enſtamped an infamy that the brazen pen of time can ſcarcely eraſe. * This will render you the honor of human nature, the guardians of our deareſt rights, and the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Britiſh-America,</hi> "The chariots of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and the horſe-men thereof."—May all your military improvements and operations be always under the government of theſe generous, manly, noble and virtuous prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.—And we truſt your eye will be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways upon Gentlemen for your officers who will ſupport the dignity, and perpetuate the importance and utility of the character you inveſt them with, by uniting the chriſtian hero with the man of war: In this you will have the patronage of him, who has the honor, and we the happineſs of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing appointed Captain-general and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor in chief; whoſe extenſive knowledge, great abilities, unblemiſhed vertue and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive love of his country, will lead him to protect, ſupport and favour a character which

looks with ſuch a promiſing aſpect on pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic happineſs.</p>
               <p>BUT to conclude, may what we have heard of the honor and uſefulneſs of the military character, ſerve to revive a true martial ſpirit, and inſpire with a lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble zeal, not only to improve but excel in the art military; that the native courage which has always diſtinguiſhed <hi>Britiſh-America,</hi>—eſpecially the ſons of the <hi>Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſets,</hi> may appear to the beſt advantage, and produce future heroes, who may vie not only with <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> but even with <hi>Great-Britain.</hi> And may all my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of the field be exhorted to act with honor and fidelity, as the ſervants of the moſt high God, the diſciples of his divine Son, and friends to mankind: Then I have the honor and pleaſure to aſſure them that they ſhall not only be eſteemed by men as guardians of our deareſt rights, but ſhall be finally crowned by the ſupreme Leader as conquerors, and be ſeated on triumphal thrones of glory, when they will lay aſide the harneſs, and drop the military character, and ceaſing from the fatigues of war,— will reſt in everlaſting peace, harmony and joy.</p>
