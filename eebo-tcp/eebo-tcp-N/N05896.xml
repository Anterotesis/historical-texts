            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The Houſe of Repreſentatives in the Grant Yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day made to a Committee of the Houſe, to defend the Priviledges of the Repreſentative Body of this Province, ſenſible of the Attempt made againſt the Right of the People of this Government in the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of their Repreſentative Body, to commit for a Contempt to them, voted a Sum of Money for the Defence of this fundamental Priviledge, and ſent this Vote to the honourable Board to be concurred or non-concurred, neither of which they did, but were pleaſed to ſend it back with Alterations. Whereupon the Houſe declare it to be their clear Opinion, that the Grant of any Money by this Court to be raiſed by the People, muſt not only originate with the Houſe, in Conſequence of their repreſenting the People, but that ſuch Grant cannot, in Conſequence of this their ſingular Right, be any Way ſubject to the Alteration of any other Branch of the Government; and that the Amendment made Yeſterday by the Board in the ſaid Grant, is a Violation of the Priviledge of the Houſe, upon a Vote made for the Support of their Priviledges; which they are determined thoroughly to defend and maintain againſt all Attempts and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments whatſoever.</p>
               <p>Read and accepted, and <hi>Voted,</hi> That the foregoing Meſſage be ſent to the honourable Board.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Ordered,</hi> That Col. <hi>Quincy,</hi> Mr. <hi>Tyng,</hi> Mr. <hi>Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hawk,</hi> Mr. <hi>Vaſſall, Nath. Ruſſell,</hi>

The ſaid Meſſage is as follows, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Board have no Inclination to engage in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy with the honourable Houſe on any Point whatſoever, at a Juncture when Affairs of ſuch vaſt Importance are depending, and although the Board have been in the conſtant Practice of leſſening Grants made by the honourable Houſe, ever ſince the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, yet they do not deſign to enter into any Diſpute on this Point at this Time: Before the Meſſage from the honourable Houſe of this Day, the Board had abſolutely non-concur'd the Vote of the honourable Houſe, which had firſt been amended by the Board, but upon a Non Concurrence of the honourable Houſe, was again ſent up to the Board.</p>
               <p>The Board are deſirous of keeping up the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony that has ſubſiſted between the ſeveral Branches of the Legiſlature, and are neither for extending their own Priviledges nor abridging the Priviledges of the honourable Houſe, and are willing to come into any Expedient, that may preſerve the Rights of each Houſe.</p>
               <p>The Board would have no Exception to a Vote, effectually ſecuring the Payment out of the publick Treaſury, of every reaſonable Expence, that may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend or be the Conſequence of the Actions referred to: but they apprehend that many Inconveniences may ariſe from the granting any determinate large Sum for this Purpoſe, and that all the Ends propoſed by the Vote of the honourable Houſe may be fully anſwered without it.</p>
               <p>The ſaid Meſſage was read again.</p>
               <p>The Meſſage from the honourable Board of this Day was read again; and after ſome Debate thereon,

               <p>It was not with any Diſpoſition to Controverſy, the Houſe ſent their Meſſage on Saturday laſt to the honourable Board, but entirely from a Perſwaſion that it is no more in the Power of the honourable Board to leſſen a Sum of Money granted by the Houſe, than to make a Grant or augment the Sum; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' the honourable Board have ſaid they have been in the conſtant Practice of leſſening Grants made by the Houſe, ever ſince the Charter, the Houſe conſider this as a ſudden Aſſertion, and impoſſible to be proved.</p>
               <p>The Houſe are very ſenſible of the Importance of the Affairs now depending in this Court, and are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous that the Harmony which has hitherto ſubſiſted between the ſeveral Branches of the Legiſlature may continue; they are at the ſame Time ſenſible of the Attempt made abroad againſt a Priviledge, without which the Houſe cannot ſubſiſt, and conceive it to be their Duty to take Care of their own Being, for the Sake of that Harmony which is neceſſary for the public Weal at this Juncture.</p>
