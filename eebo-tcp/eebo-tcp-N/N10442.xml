            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>DEDICATION TO THE YOUNG MEN OF THE FIRST PARISH IN FALMOUTH.</head>
            <p>IT is fit and reaſonable that I devote and dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the following Sermons to you; becauſe they are already your own, in ſeveral reſpects. And though I wiſh them to ſerve the beſt intereſts of other ſorts of perſons, as well as other perſons of your ſtanding, it is confeſſed you have by far the greateſt intereſt in them.</p>
            <p>THOUGH it is poſſible that the ſubject of them might have been handled, even by me, in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner leſs exceptionable to the learned, if I had expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed they would ever have had the opportunity to criticiſe on them: yet as all who are candid, when they perceive the deſign to be evidently laudable, will be diſpoſed to overlook ſmall faults, and to ſpeak as favourably as poſſible of greater ones; I have, after ſerious deliberation, determined to give them to you and to the publick, without any mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial alterations, additions or amendments: becauſe
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:013238_0003_0F90452960C413A8"/>I ſhould otherwiſe have given you an opportunity to charge me with unfairneſs, in not granting in fact the thing you requeſted of me, a copy of the ſermons I preached to young men.</p>
            <p>THE method and ſentiments are as entirely my own, as it is poſſible for you to conceive: and yet it is highly probable I may have ſaid the ſame things, in my poor manner, which many excellent writers have favoured the world with, in a moſt elegant and pleaſing dreſs. For I ſuppoſe it is impoſſible to treat this ſubject with any tolerable propriety, or ſo as to be any ways uſeful, without ſaying many things that have often been ſaid before; and next to impoſſible to ſay any thing very pertinent that is new. I have neither followed, nor knowingly ſhunned, in any degree, thoſe who have gone before me; nor could I have done either, if I had been ſo diſpoſed, as I had no book of this ſort by me; nor near me that I knew of. But very ſeriouſly and in the fear of God, I delivered to you, without any ſtrict regard to method, what was prompted by an heart anxiouſly concerned to promote your happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and much devoted to your ſervice. And this not with any deſign or view of recommending my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the publick, as I had not any expectation, when I compoſed theſe diſcourſes, of their becoming more publick than once preaching would make them: but with a pure intent, I hope I may ſay, to ſerve your ſpiritual and eternal intereſts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="v" facs="unknown:013238_0004_0F90452987EA2750"/>
I AM aware that many will be ready to call me raſh and unadviſed, for venturing this imperfect performance abroad in the world, after the many excellent publications upon ſubjects nearly the ſame: and eſpecially, after an extraordinary genius, of our own country, has publiſhed a great number of ſermons upon the very ſame text. But as the books I ſpeak of are not in your hands, and perhaps never will be; this is, at once, a reaſon why you have requeſted it, and an apology to the publick for my conſenting to yield to your requeſt of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication of this work; eſpecially as none can blame me for my diſpoſition to gratify you in every thing that is reaſonable. The zeal you have ſhewn in this matter, makes me entertain a pleaſing hope, that you will ſeriouſly attend to the very important re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious truths, which are here laid before you; and thereby, with the bleſſing of God, gain ſome real and laſting benefit from them. If this end can but be anſwered, I am the leſs concerned for my repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation as a writer.</p>
            <p>IT is often ſaid, and perhaps not without reaſon, that the world is already too much filled with books of divinity. But this ſaying chiefly refers, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, to thoſe which are ſpeculative and polemical; of a nature and tendency very different from this; in which diſputed principles and theological niceties are avoided. But if the multiplication of books upon practical ſubjects will be a probable means of
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:013238_0005_0F90452ADC00E648"/>increaſing practical religion, which is ſo much wanted among us, who will be againſt multiplying them? And if the oftener young men are exhorted to attend to the important affairs of their ſouls and eternity, the more ground of hope there is that they will do ſo, who can think any miniſter's endeavours to this purpoſe needleſs? And that this little book will be diligently peruſed by you, becauſe of the unmerited regard I find many of you have for the author, I have doubtleſs good reaſon to expect.— As alſo, that you will be diſpoſed to do all in your power, to cauſe others to give ſome attention to it. And it is ſtrange, if even an unprejudiced attention to the matters herein contained will do you no good. If theſe diſcourſes may, among the other means of grace that you enjoy, contribute any thing towards making ſerious and laſting impreſſions on you, and other young perſons into whoſe hands they may come, I ſhall think my labour well ſpent. For no man has a deeper ſenſe than I of the neceſſity of early piety, and of the importance of the riſing generation. And with regard to you, my dear friends, in particular, I may ſay as the Apoſtle Paul did to the Philippian Chriſtians, <q>God is my record, how greatly I long after you all, in the bowels of Jeſus Chriſt.</q> And that none of you may "fail of the grace of God," is the fervent prayer of</p>

                     <p>Young men likewiſe exhort to be ſober-minded.</p>
                  </q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>THIS Epiſtle was ſent by the apoſtle Paul, to Titus, a miniſter of the goſpel and evangeliſt, then in Crete, to direct him, not only how to conduct himſelf towards the Judaizing teachers; but more eſpecially how to behave in his miniſtry; both in ordaining church-officers, and in preaching the goſpel.</p>
               <p>IN the paragraph where our text is inſerted, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections are given to Titus, in what manner to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort ſeveral ſorts of perſons; that ſo he might <q>rightly divide the word of truth, and give to every one his portion in due ſeaſon.</q> In the firſt place, he is directed how to addreſs himſelf to the aged men; then to the aged women; and nextly, in our text, how to exhort the young men.</p>
               <p>BY young men, I make no ſcruple, the apoſtle meant all men under middle age. For it is moſt likely, as he mentions old and young men near to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that he meant to include all the men under
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:013238_0008_0F90452C93C87018"/>theſe two kinds. If otherwiſe, it would follow, that ſome of the men Titus is not directed here to exhort at all; which appears highly improbable, when we conſider how many different ſorts of people are mentioned as the ſubjects of his particular addreſſes. Therefore I ſhall conſider myſelf, in the following ſermons, as ſpeaking to all the males of the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, who are arrived to manhood, and are not yet come to what is commonly eſteemed the middle of life. But I ſhall have, all along, a more ſpecial regard to thoſe who are yet in their youth; and who are, in common ſpeech, denominated young men.</p>
               <p>THE Cretan young men, you ſee, were to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted by their miniſter to be ſober-minded.— Doubtleſs then it is the duty of every miniſter of Chriſt, in like manner, to exhort all the young men, who are under their paſtoral care. And it is equally the duty of young men, in every Chriſtian ſociety, candidly and ſeriouſly to hearken to ſuch exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The former infers the latter; for to what end are miniſters to exhort, if they are not to be attended to? While they exhort according as they are directed in God's word, their exhortations ought to be received, "not as the word of man, but as the word of God."</p>
               <p>BUT I hope none of my readers will think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unintereſted in the enſuing exhortations. For religion is ſubſtantially the ſame in all perſons; and it is impoſſible to teach young men their duty as Chriſtians, without teaching, at the ſame time, the duty of all perſons. I muſt eſpecially be allowed to hope for the ſerious attention of young women;
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:013238_0009_0F90452D441E90C0"/>for I know of no argument I can uſe, to perſwade young men to be ſober-minded, that does not hold good why young women ſhould be ſo too.</p>
               <p>THE method I propoſe in diſcourſing on this ſubject is,</p>
               <p>FIRST. To ſhew what is to be underſtood by being ſober-minded.</p>
               <p>SECONDLY. To exhort and perſwade young men to be ſo, by ſeveral arguments and motives. And</p>
               <p>THIRDLY. To direct thoſe what methods to take, who deſire to obtain and cultivate inward ſobriety.</p>
               <p>FIRST. I am to ſhew what is to be underſtood by being ſober-minded.</p>
               <p>THE original word, which is here rendered ſober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded, is ſophronein. The meaning of which is, to be ſober, or to have a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> mind. But</p>
               <p>SOBRIETY, according to the uſe of the word in ſome paſſages of ſcripture, means the oppoſite to all ſinful luſt, of which, by the way, it is likely young men are, upon the whole, in greater danger than other ſorts of perſons. Appetite in them is very ſtrong; and reaſon, wherewith they ſhould curb and reſtrain their appetites, is not yet arrived to its higheſt pitch.</p>
               <p>To be ſober, as the word is uſed in the firſt verſe of the context, means, at moſt, to avoid all thoſe ſins, irregularities and exceſſes, into which our ſenſes and natural appetites are apt to hurry us; or it is avoiding gluttony, drunkenneſs, concupiſcent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs, luxury, and the like. And this is the moſt common and familiar ſenſe of the word.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="unknown:013238_0010_0F90452E0C579F48"/>
BUT avoiding theſe, and all other outward acts of ſenſuality, is not alone ſufficient to denominate a man "ſober minded." They who would deſerve this character, muſt have a frame and temper of mind habitually correſpondent to external ſobriety. They muſt not only avoid all outward debauchery; but they muſt be chaſte and moderate in their tho'ts and meditations. The man who cheriſhes unclean and ſenſual deſires, deſigns and affections in his heart, ſins againſt the laws of ſobriety, as really, though it may be, not ſo groſsly and heinouſly, as if he had committed the outward acts. For our bleſſed Lord has told us, <q>whoſoever looketh on a woman to luſt after her, hath committed adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery with her already in his heart.</q> And we are thus cautioned by the wiſe king Solomon, <q>look not thou on the wine when it is red, when it giveth his colour in the cup, when it moveth itſelf aright;</q> that is, avoid thoſe things, which tend to excite an inordinate appetite in you, for wine or any other ſtrong drink. A mind that dwells much upon forbidden pleaſures of ſenſe, is not a ſound mind; but a mind ſadly diſordered, and full of corruption; and ſo it is directly the reverſe of what is required of young men in the text.</p>
               <p>AND if the heart muſt be regulated, ſurely the tongue muſt alſo, which is the index of the heart. If the tongue is full of "filthineſs, fooliſh talking and jeſting," which the apoſtle cautions us againſt; or even taken up with inquiring "what we ſhall eat and drink," or how the ſenſes are to be immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately indulged, in any reſpect; it will but too
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:013238_0011_0F90452EE2B52D78"/>ſurely prove that the heart is debauched, and that we are deſtitute of internal ſobriety; for <q>out of the abundance of the heart the mouth ſpeaketh.</q> All this, at leaſt, is comprehended in the duty of internal ſobriety.</p>
               <p>BUT ſobriety is often uſed in ſcripture, in a more large and extenſive meaning. To "think ſoberly," Rom. xii. 3. is to think diſpaſſionately and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially. To "be ſober," 1 Pet. v. 8. is to have not only our appetites, but our paſſions under ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection. To "live ſoberly," Titus ii. 12. certainly means more than barely reſtraining the ſenſual ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites and inclinations; even the due regulation of all our appetites, paſſions and affections. And I am much inclined to think the word ſober, in our text, ought to be taken in this latitude; for, as I ſaid before, the original word is conſtrued, to be of a ſound mind. And I ſee not how barely avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſenſuality can intitle a man to this character; for it ſeems to me, that pride, anger, malice, covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and diſcontent, which vices are diſtinct from ſenſuality, are as inconſiſtent with ſoundneſs of mind as any of the ſenſual luſts are. For what is ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of mind, unleſs it be the healthy and regular ſtate of the ſoul? Or, in other words, the due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity of all the lower faculties, appetites, paſſions and affections?</p>
               <p>ANOTHER thing, that makes it appear probable that the word is to be underſtood in this large ſenſe, is that this is all the apoſtle directed Titus to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort young men unto. Therefore it is more likely that this one word is a word of large and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:013238_0012_0F90452F804C5EC8"/>meaning, containing a great number of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in it. Other ſorts of perſons, Titus is directed to exhort to ſeveral things, in ſeveral expreſſions; it ſeems therefore the more unlikely, that young men were only to be exhorted to avoid ſenſuality. For though this is a ſin that more "eaſily beſets" them than others, they are alſo as liable to commit other ſins, as other perſons are.</p>
               <p>ACCORDINGLY, I ſhall treat the ſubject in the largeſt latitude; as if young men were to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted to get and keep all their appetites and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, paſſions and affections under the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of reaſon and religion. This is a duty of vaſt extent, comprehending in it all the internal part of true Chriſtianity. For to be ſober-minded, with reſpect to the ſenſes, includes an averſion to glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony, drunkenneſs, and uncleanneſs; as well as to extravagance in garb and furniture, and whatever other exceſs the ſenſes are apt to lead men into:— And on the other hand, an habitual diſpoſedneſs to uſe a juſt and reaſonable moderation, in all theſe things. They who have attained to this virtue have ſubdued and mortified thoſe evil propenſities, which are called in ſcripture, <q>the luſt of the fleſh and the luſt of the eye.</q> And</p>
               <p>To be ſober-minded, with reſpect to the paſſions and affections, is to have our iraſcible paſſions ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited at nothing, but at what ought to excite them; and to have them raiſed, when occaſion offers, only to ſuch degrees as reaſon and religion allow and juſtify. And alſo to have our concupiſcible affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions placed on none but ſuitable objects; and on
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:013238_0013_0F90453097538EC0"/>them, only in due and warrantable meaſures. So that this kind of ſobriety includes in it a ſupreme love to God and Chriſt; the greateſt delight in the ſervice of God; hating nothing but ſin; an humble, an abaſed opinion of ourſelves on account of our ſins; grieving more for our ſins, than for our ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings; deſiring grace and glory more than worldly good things; loving our ſouls more than our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; eſteeming and loving our fellow-creatures, in proportion as the moral image of God appears in them, and according as they ſtand in need of our love; rejoicing in nothing ſo much as in ſpiritual bleſſings; hoping for nothing ſo much as for the favour of God; fearing nothing ſo much as to offend him; acquieſcing in all the allotments of the divine providence; walking by faith, rather than by ſight; looking at eternal, with greater emotions of heart than thoſe, with which we look at temporal things; and having an anxious concern, deſire and endeavour to avoid all ſin and tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to walk "in all the ordinances and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of the Lord blameleſs."</p>
               <p>THESE are the principal things included in the good regulation of the appetites, paſſions and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. And it is eaſy to demonſtrate that this regulation contains in it the whole vital part of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Inſomuch that he who has this ſoundneſs of mind, this healthy ſtate of the ſoul, cannot live in the commiſſion of any known ſin, nor in the omiſſion of any known duty. He cannot be covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, unjuſt, uncharitable, wrathful, cruel, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeful. He cannot be habitually intemperate in
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:013238_0014_0F90453203764AA0"/>any ſenſitive, animal pleaſures. He cannot be profane, unſubmiſſive to the divine will, regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of the favour of God, nor careleſs and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent of eternal things: Becauſe his heart is right with God; the corrupt bias of his mind is taken away; his ſoul is renewed after the divine image: ſo that his "good heart," like "a good tree," cannot but "bring forth good fruit."</p>
               <p>IT is this religion of the heart that young men are to be exhorted to, by the miniſters of Chriſt; for this it is to be ſober-minded. It is the ſame, in one word, as to be inwardly and heartily religious; or under the prevailing influence of right and holy principles.—Let me therefore, as I propoſed, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſufficiently, though briefly, explained this duty, proceed,</p>
               <p>SECONDLY. To exhort and perſuade the young men of this flock to be ſober-minded, or heartily religious.</p>
               <p>I COME to you this day, my young friends, on no other errand than that, on which I am ſent of God. Conſider me therefore as the meſſenger of God to you, however unworthy of this high employment. I am going to lay before you ſeveral unanſwerable arguments and reaſons why you ſhould now receive religion into your hearts, and become wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to the fear and ſervice of God. My errand is chiefly to thoſe of you, who are not yet ſober-minded; but place your happineſs in "ſerving divers luſts and pleaſures." And to thoſe, who, though they have had ſome ſerious impreſſions, have not yet heartily given themſelves to God, but have
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:013238_0015_0F9045327B9A7028"/>prevailing irregularities in their affections. I have the more confidence and hope of ſucceſs in addreſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing myſelf to you, becauſe you are yet young, as it may well be ſuppoſed your hearts have yet ſome natural tenderneſs. You have not had ſo much time as other ſinners, to ſin away all your ſenſibility of conſcience; ſo that it may be hoped that none of you are hardened in ſin beyond a poſſibility of recovery.</p>
               <p>As to ſome of you, I would fain hope you have already received this divine gueſt, religion, into your hearts. But if you have, I am ſure you ſtill need exhortation and inſtruction. And it may be good for you to hear an exhortation adapted to the caſe of thoſe, who are of a worſe character: for, alas! I know of none of you who appear to have made ſo great proficiency in the divine life, as you might, and ought to have done. I might well addreſs you all, therefore, with the exhortation to be ſober-minded; for every one of you need it, more or leſs; becauſe you all need, either to become ſo, or to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more ſo. I ſhall endeavour to perſwade you all, by a variety of arguments, and</p>
               <p n="1">I. BY this conſideration, that God has ſent you into this world, not to take your pleaſure, and give a full ſwing to your appetites and paſſions, thoſe inferior principles of your nature; but, by hearty religion and holineſs of life, to prepare for happineſs in the approaching eternal ſtate.</p>
               <p>CAN you entertain any doubt, whether the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate is a ſtate of probation for another and a better world? Your innate deſire of immortality, together with your experience of the unſatisfactory
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:013238_0016_0F90453339CF29F0"/>nature of all preſent enjoyments, ſufficiently evidence, that the preſent life is only a preface or introduction to another life, which is to be happy and eternal.— And if you read your bibles, every page almoſt will ſhew you that you are, at preſent, candidates for glory and immortality. If this is not the caſe, why are the means of grace inſtituted? Why are the holy ſcriptures given you? which are profeſſedly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to ſhew you the way to eternal happineſs, and make you "wiſe unto ſalvation." Why are miniſters ordained and commiſſionated to preach faith and repentance, and univerſal holineſs? Why does the holy ſpirit of God ſtrive with you? And why does conſcience demand it of you, that you ſeek and ſerve God continually? You are aſſured in ſcripture, that you ſhall receive in the eternal world, "the things done here in the body." Surely then, the work God allots for you to do here, is to prepare for an happy futurity. And he has ſhewed you, in his word, what preparation is neceſſary.— "Without holineſs," you are told, "no man ſhall ſee the Lord." And you are required to <q>cleanſe yourſelves from all filthineſs of the fleſh and ſpirit, perfecting holineſs in the fear of God</q>—It is not external holineſs only, or principally, but heart-holineſs that is here meant; even the ſame that is required of you, in the text. External holineſs is neceſſary; but you muſt not be all outſide in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and content yourſelves with making <q>a fair ſhew in the fleſh.</q> You muſt not be like painted ſepulchres, which appear beautiful to the eye, while they are within full of bones and rottenneſs. To
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:013238_0017_0F9045344F73DF20"/>ſuch your Saviour ſaid, <q>how can ye eſcape the damnation of hell?</q> And he has aſſured you, that, <q>except your righteouſneſs exceed the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees, ye ſhall in no caſe, enter into the kingdom of heaven.</q>
               </p>
               <p>ATTEND therefore, my friends, to your proper work and buſineſs; and let it not be ſaid of you, that you live in vain, and do not anſwer the end of your preſent exiſtence. It is never too early to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin upon the buſineſs of life. Let not your oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of preparing for eternity, be like <q>a price in the hand of a fool to get wiſdom;</q> who has "no heart" to improve it. As you ſee all other creatures live up to the deſign of their creation, and anſwer the end of their being, be aſhamed to do otherwiſe yourſelves; for why ſhould birds and beaſts, why ſhould ſtocks and ſtones <q>riſe up in judgment againſt you?</q>—But,</p>
               <p n="2">II. ANOTHER argument, which I muſt be allowed to inſiſt much upon is, that now is the beſt time for you to endeavour to become truly and heartily religious. The youngeſt of you are ſo arrived to maturity of reaſon and underſtanding, that you may well be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to avoid childiſhneſs and enthuſiaſm, in your religion. So that it is full time for you to begin in good earneſt; and if you neglect it any longer, it will be the worſe for you upon many accounts.— You have all the real advantages for becoming holy now, that ever you can reaſonably expect; and if you let ſlip the preſent ſeaſon, it will be attended with ſo many diſadvantages, that it will, moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probably,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:013238_0018_0F904534BAF70438"/>be the means of your everlaſting damnation. Be perſwaded now therefore, to <q>ſtrive to enter in at the ſtrait gate</q> of holineſs, without any longer delay.—For</p>
               <p n="1">1. YOUR affections, which muſt be engaged in religion, have now ſome tenderneſs. You have not yet, it is to be hoped, hardened yourſelves in evil courſes. You can feel ſome good motions within you, when you hear or read an awakening and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious diſcourſe. But if you go further on, in the "paths of the deſtroyer," your hearts will gradually grow harder and harder, your minds blinder and blinder, and your conſciences more ſeared and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pified. For ſinners do not remain at one certain pitch of wickedneſs. The word of God aſſures us that "evil men ſhall wax worſe and worſe;" and this is confirmed by our obſervation. If you go on to "fill up the meaſure of your iniquities," you will arrive to ſuch a pitch of wickedneſs, and hard-heartedneſs, that the terrors of the Lord will no more affright you; the thunders of the law will not terrify you, and the grace of the goſpel will not melt and ſoften you. And is it not eaſier, think you, for you to become holy now, than it will be then? At this time of life, you would find it eaſy indeed, if you had but a will to endeavour after it, with the ſame zeal and aſſiduouſneſs, with which you ſtrive to gain this world's advantages. But <hi>then</hi> it will be next to impoſſible. <q>Can the Ethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opian change his ſkin, or the leopard his ſpots? Then may ye alſo do good, who are accuſtomed to do evil.</q> Jer. xiii. 23. At your time of life,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:013238_0019_0F90453870D46978"/>you can hardly commit any great ſin, without ſome reluctance: but if you are ſuffered to grow old in iniquity, you will come to commit it with greedineſs, and without bluſhing or remorſe. If you ſhould live to old age, in your ſins, it is much to be doubted whether you would then have any inclinations to repent: But if you ſhould, you will not find in your hearts to go about it. Men are not wont, at that period of life, to engage in any new under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking; eſpecially in any thing ſo oppoſite to their own long continued practice. It is to be feared therefore, on this account, that your delaying to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come holy in youth, will be the means of the irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trievable perdition of your precious ſouls.— For it is ſaid, and not without reaſon, that by far the greateſt part, that ever are ſavingly converted, are converted before they have got beyond your age.</p>
               <p n="2">2. THE ſcriptures give greater encouragement to you, than to older ſinners, that your endeavours to return to God ſhall be crowned with ſucceſs.— David ſaid to his ſon Solomon, when he was a youth, <q>if thou ſeek him, he will be found of thee; but if thou forſake him, he will forſake thee.</q> And the words of wiſdom to this purpoſe, in the Proverbs, are theſe, "they that ſeek me early ſhall find me." How precious, O young men, ſhould theſe promiſes appear to you? You may depend on it that it is now a finding time. If you now <q>ſtrive to enter in at the ſtrait gate,</q> with all poſſible zeal and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs, you will aſſuredly enter. And will you not be prevailed with, to enter while you may? The bare poſſibility of ſucceſs is enough, in all
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:013238_0020_0F904539D2977DB0"/>reaſon, to put you upon all poſſible endeavours after things which are of eternal conſequence to you; how much more the abundant encouragement that is given you, equal, to all valuable intents and purpoſes, to a full aſſurance of ſucceſs. Will you not aſk, when it is but aſk and have? But chooſe to diſregard and ſlight ſo important a bleſſing till hereafter, when God gives you little encouragement to hope that the moſt ſtrenuous endeavours will prove ſucceſsful? If this is not folly and madneſs, it is impoſſible to ſay what is ſo. As long as life continues, indeed, it is thought there is ſome ground of hope; at leaſt in common caſes. For the whole of life is a time of probation, with the generality of ſinners. But how many inſtances can you find in ſcripture, of the efficacy of late endeavours?—Will you mention the penitent thief, who had the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to die with Chriſt, as an inſtance? His re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, though late in his life, does not appear to have been in old age. And you ſhould conſider that he took, for ought that you know, the firſt opportunity he had of embracing Chriſt and his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; and that he gave himſelf to Chriſt on a croſs, whereas you reject him on his throne. So, there were probably ſome aged ſinners among the multitudes, converted by the firſt preaching of the Apoſtles; but then you ſhould remember, that they had not become ſo, under the light of the goſpel.— How ſlender grounds of dependance then have you, if you neglect your ſouls concerns till old age, and then begin to ſeek, that ever you ſhall find mercy? Seize therefore, I pray you, if you love your ſouls,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:013238_0021_0F90453B1179CCF8"/>the happy moments of your youth: employ and uſe them to the important purpoſes of religion; leſt you hereafter go down to your graves, and to hell, ſeeking and crying out in vain, for that mercy and grace, which you now diſregard, or put away from you. <q>Seek ye the Lord, while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near,</q> Iſai. lv. 6.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As you have no aſſurance given you that late ſeekers ſhall find grace, ſo the reaſon of the thing renders it doubtful; and therefore it is dreadfully hazardous for you to poſtpone your ſeeking to a late ſeaſon. As grace is very freely offered, in God's word, to all who will accept of it, it ſeems to follow as a juſt inference, that there is ſome time of life, in which men, if they are not ſlack in their endeavours, may find grace. Youth is pointed out to be ſuch a ſeaſon; is it not therefore very doubtful, whether age is a ſeaſon to become holy? Beſides, God, you know, deſerves to be ſerved with your beſt; that is, with the flower and bloom of life. Your beſt vigour and activity are moſt juſtly his due.— Dare you then entertain one thought of putting him off with the dregs of life, after you ſhall have ſpent all the beſt of your days in vanity and ſin? Can you flatter yourſelves that he will ſtand ready to accept ſo miſerable and worthleſs a ſacrifice at your hands? If you will ſerve ſin and ſatan, 'till you can ſerve them vigorouſly no longer, what virtue will it be in you afterwards, to conſent to ſerve God? This may well be thought to be offering a groſs affront to your Creator, who commands you to "remember" him "in the days of your youth."—
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:013238_0022_0F90453B9866D768"/>Do you think he will take up with the world's leavings, and with the Devil's leavings? If you depend upon this, you are madly preſumptuous.— Be perſuaded then to mind religion now, before it is too late; before you ſhall have ſquandered away that time and ſtrength, which God has given you for no other end, than to be employed in his ſervice; and before you ſhall have provoked him to <q>ſwear in his wrath, that you ſhall not enter into his reſt.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. THE preſent time is beſt, as it is the only time you are ſure of. Time preſent you may call your own; but not ſo that which is future. A certain opportunity is better than a precarious one, in which to tranſact any propoſed buſineſs of indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſible neceſſity. Let this then be another weighty motive with you, to be ſpeedy in admitting religion into your hearts. That which you know you muſt do, you had better do at preſent, while you may, than leave to the mercy of future contingences. I ſuppoſe you have, at leaſt reſolved, or promiſed yourſelves that you will become truly holy and heavenly, before you leave the world. You could not have kept your conſciences ſo eaſy as you have kept them, without making ſome ſuch reſolves and promiſes, from time to time. But are you not aware of the dreadful fallacy of this? Will you not ſeriouſly conſider, that time and opportunity may fail you? And that if it ſhould ſo happen, you are as much loſt and undone forever, as if you had never had one ſerious thought of ever returning to God.</p>
               <p>O that I could once convince you how impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, how preſumptuous and dangerous it is, to
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:013238_0023_0F90453C398EECA0"/>procraſtinate the vaſt work of preparing for eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity! Millions of ſinners have been daſhed to pieces againſt this rock; and yet, oh the ſtupidity! it makes but little impreſſion on the reſt. Thouſands are going to hell every day, who promiſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as you do, that they would repent and live to God, ſome time hence. Sinners ſee ſuch of their comrades dying around them, as they cannot but know die in their ſins; and yet they are ſo loſt to all prudence and forecaſt, that they promiſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves it will be ſoon enough to repent, ſome time hence. This is the trap, by which Satan gets the greateſt numbers of ſouls from among mankind.— And it is not a concealed ſnare; for every one might ſee it, if they pleaſed. Men are like thoſe filly fiſh, that will bite at the bare hook. They have reaſon enough, if they would but uſe reaſon, to ſhew them the madneſs and folly of delaying the great, and infinitely important work of religion.— But ſinners wilfully ſhut their eyes againſt the cleareſt light; they will not be ſo wiſe as to <q>number their days,</q> and "conſider their latter end."</p>
               <p>YOU can ſee, my dear friends, the danger and folly of procraſtination in others. Alas! why can you not be ſenſible of it in yourſelves? If you hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to ſee a fellow-creature labouring under a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal diſtemper, or even in the lateſt decay of age, thoughtleſs of eternity and profane, doubtleſs it ſhocks you. You are ready to lament over him, and to ſay, <q>how can this wretch, with one foot in the grave, be ſo ſtupid and unconcerned?</q> But pray, how much better is the part you are acting
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:013238_0024_0F90453CF752BC28"/>yourſelves? Have you any more aſſurance of the continuance of life another day, than ſuch an one has? You know you have not. You could tell, with no certainty, which would go firſt into eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, you or he.</p>
               <p>THE moſt florid youth, the higheſt health and vigour, you may eaſily aſſure yourſelves, are no ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity againſt the ſtroke of death. If perſons of your age, and in your condition are more likely, in general, to continue in life, than the ſick, the aged and infirm; ſtill individuals have no ſecurity at all of it. It would not be thought by ſurvivors a very ſtrange event, if the youngeſt and healthieſt young man among you ſhould be a corpſe before to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow. Now a bare poſſibility of your dying to-day, you muſt allow, to be a ſufficient reaſon for your not poſtponing your preparation till to-morrow. Will you ſay it is impoſſible, O young man, that to-day ſhould be the laſt day of your life? No, you are ready to confeſs you are every day mortal: every hour liable to be called off the ſtage of life. Yea, you all confeſs, not only this liableneſs, in your ſerious moods, but that nothing is more uncertain and precarious than the continuance of your lives. Will you then be ſo unaccountable, and inconſiſtent in your conduct, as to riſk your eternal happineſs in ſo uncertain a bottom? Will you dare to let your ſouls hang over the bottomleſs pit any longer, by ſo brittle a thread as the preſent life is? What raſhneſs and fool-hardineſs can you be guilty of, equal to this?</p>
               <p>METHINKS you could not dare thus to hazard the eternal intereſt of your ſouls, if you did but ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:013238_0025_0F90453DD3BC0850"/>conſider and lay to heart what you pretend to be convinced of, the great uncertainty of your lives. The truth is, you are not practically con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced. You feel ſo much life and gaiety: you have ſuch a briſk flow of animal ſpirits, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you confeſs with your mouths, you are not apt to realize in your hearts, that you ſhall ever die. Your gay minds tell you, <q>to-morrow ſhall be as this day.</q>—Let me entreat you to be a little more converſant with ſuch melancholy ſcenes, as will be apt to put you upon conſidering <q>your latter end.</q> Go to the houſes "of mourning;" for it will be "better" for you, than to <q>go to the houſe of feaſting;</q> becauſe <q>by the ſadneſs of the countenance the heart is made better.</q> Attend, as often as you can, the funerals of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons nearly of your own age; for you have often opportunity of ſo doing, and even of attending the funerals of thoſe who are younger than yourſelves. Viſit young men of your acquaintance, who have been your play-fellows, when they lie languiſhing on their death-beds; and ſee if ſuch ſpectacles will not give you a more affecting ſenſe of things, than ever you had before; try if they will not ſet you about mortifying your luſts, and living to God in earneſt. The poor languiſhing creatures may ſay ſomething to you, that will ſerve to awaken you: but if not, their not being able to ſay any thing, their groans, their aſpect, their panting breath, their faultering limbs are enough to do it. And when you ſee how loth they are to die, and how dreadful and tormenting their thoughts of eternity
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:013238_0026_0F90453E8CBB3B48"/>are; or hear them lamenting the paſt folly and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of their lives, conſider what a wonder of divine mercy it is, that you are not in the ſame, or a worſe condition. If by theſe, or any other means, you could but keep your frailty in view, nothing would be more likely to ſet you to <q>working out your ſalvation with fear and trembling.</q> Such ſolemn ſcenes as theſe, are more effectual than preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on them can be, to convert and ſave you.</p>
               <p>BUT after all, ſome harden themſelves, amidſt the moſt awakening providences, by promiſing themſelves that they ſhall have leiſure on their death bed, to repent and prepare for futurity. This, I muſt tell you, is the moſt forlorn hope that any poor ſinner can venture his ſoul upon. What! will you hope to do the greateſt work at a time, when you are unfit for ſo much as the leaſt?—But you are far from being ſure that you ſhall have this opportunity. You cannot rationally expect that God will give it you, when you ſhall have lived in rebellion againſt him all your lives. You ſee that many die by violent accidents, ſo inſtantly that they have not time to make one ſingle prayer to God for his grace.—And among thoſe who are brought to their end by lingering ſickneſs, how few are ever fully ſenſible of their danger, while they have any reaſon and underſtanding left? How often are they flattered with the hopes of recovery, by their phyſicians and friends, in the beginning of their diſeaſe, that their ſpirits may not ſink; 'till at once, all comes to be too late, and nothing can be done for ſoul or body, to keep the one from the grave,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:013238_0027_0F90453F50FCF7F0"/>or the other from hell?—But ſuppoſing you ſhould be ever ſo much alarmed at the near approach of death, and ever ſo attentive to the things of your peace, in your laſt ſickneſs, it is but little that you can do, amidſt the various aches, uneaſineſſes, medical applications and viſitings, that will then take up your attention, and diſtract your medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Upon the whole, the hazard of your truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a death-bed preparation is ſo great, that it is next to taking up a reſolution, that you will never take any care of your ſoul at all. It is almoſt as fatal, as if you ſhould now leap headlong into eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal burnings.—I will not aſſert the utter impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of a death-bed preparation. But I believe, not one in a thouſand, among thoſe who neglect religion till then, is enabled truly to repent on his death-bed.—But ſuppoſing what is ſo very unlikely ſhould take place, in any of you; that you ſhould become new creatures, in this laſt extremity; you would have no reaſon to expect, in ſuch a caſe, that you could gain any comfortable evidence of it. And if not, you muſt expect to die in the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme horror. The fear of dying ſuch a death, if this were all, you muſt allow to be alone ſufficient, in reaſon, to perſwade you to enter immediately upon an holy life. For who can tell how ſoon you may be laid upon a bed of ſickneſs? upon a bed of death? And what would you not then give, think you, for ſuch a bleſſed opportunity as you now have in your hands?</p>
               <p>THE preſent, O young men, is your beſt time to become ſober-minded, as you have more reaſon
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:013238_0028_0F90454012EDEAB0"/>now to hope for the abſolutely neceſſary aſſiſtances of the divine Spirit, than you will have hereafter.— I hope you are ſenſible, that without him, you can do nothing to a ſaving purpoſe; and that if he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts from you, all your own ſtrivings will leave you deſtitute of grace and ſalvation. <q>No man can come unto me,</q> ſaith Chriſt, <q>except the Father draw him.</q>—You will conſider alſo, that the bleſſed Spirit does take an everlaſting flight from ſome ſinners, while they remain in this world.—For we read of ſome, whom <q>God gave up to vile affections,</q> and "to a reprobate mind." And our Lord mentions the ſin "againſt the holy Ghoſt," which ſhall never he forgiven. Accordingly the apoſtle Paul ſpeaks of ſome, whom <q>it is impoſſible to renew again unto repentance;</q> one reaſon of which is becauſe <q>they crucify to themſelves the Son of God afreſh, and put him to open ſhame.</q> As you would dread, therefore, to be forſaken of the Spirit of God, be convinced that now is your time to receive religion into your hearts. Can you expect that the Holy Spirit will always ſtrive with you? Is it impoſſible for you, by continuing in ſin, ſo to grieve him as to make him utterly forſake you? Do you not fear you ſhall ſo quench him, that he will never kindle any more holy deſires in you?— This divine gueſt is now knocking at the doors of your hearts; moving you to let him in, that he may take up his abode there. If you will ſuffer him he will enter, and thence forward abide in you, and enable you to <q>cleanſe yourſelves from all filthineſs of the fleſh and ſpirit,</q> and to perfect
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:013238_0029_0F904540DD2C1038"/>"holineſs in the fear of God." But if you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to withſtand, or neglect his motions, or refuſe to concur with his operations, he will be more and more grieved, until he leaves you to yourſelves. And if this ſhould come to be your caſe, your damnation will be as inevitable, as if the ſentence, "go ye curſed," were already pronounced againſt you.— Will you not be arouſed by the danger of this that you incur, by continuing in ſin? Or can you flatter yourſelves that God will not ſoon give you over? He is indeed rich in mercy; but it is <q>to them that call upon him.</q> He is ſaid to be <q>long-ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſlow to anger;</q> but has not his patience been already lengthened out towards ſome of you, even to long ſuffering? Judge whether it is fit and reaſonable, and whether you have any right to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that he ſhould continue his bleſſed motions on your hearts, after you have been, year after year, oppoſing all his ſtrivings. If the Holy Ghoſt were as eaſy to be offended, as one of the moſt benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent of men, you have, many of you, done enough already to provoke him to take his final leave of you. Where is the man, that will always perſiſt in offering you a great favour, after you have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in refuſing it, ſo much as you have perſiſted in grieving and oppoſing the ſpirit of God?— Eſpecially when you add the greateſt affronts and indignities to your refuſal?</p>
               <p>THUS I have ſhewed you, O young men, two of the many powerful motives there are, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade you to become ſober-minded, or heartily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, while you remain young men.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="unknown:013238_0030_0F90454186FF4668"/>
THESE arguments, if they had their due weight with you, would be ſufficient to over balance all your preſent averſion to holineſs.—But I ſhall fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther purſue my preſent deſign of exhorting you to internal ſobriety, as ſoon as it ſhall pleaſe God to give me another opportunity.</p>

               <p>MINISTERS are concerned to comply with this exhortation: for in it Titus, and through him all ſucceeding miniſters of Chriſt, are directed to exhort young men to be ſober-minded, or heartily religious. As this flock contains many young men, I hope I ſhall not be thought tedious, if in a long addreſs to them, I urge them by a variety of motives, rational and ſcriptural, to do the work and buſineſs they are ſent into the world to do, while the beſt, and I had almoſt ſaid, the only ſeaſon for their doing it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues.</p>
               <p>IN the preceeding diſcourſe, after I had explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the nature of the duty to which young men are to be exhorted, I endeavoured to perſuade them to get and cultivate internal ſobriety, by ſhewing them,</p>
               <p n="1">I. THAT God ſent them into the world, that by hearty religion and holineſs of life, they ſhould prepare for happineſs in the approaching eternal ſtate.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="28" facs="unknown:013238_0033_0F904543E3149B28"/>
II. THAT now is the beſt time, upon many ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, to ſet themſelves about the great work of religion.</p>
               <p>I AM now to go on farther with the ſame gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral exhortation, by urging ſeveral other motives upon them; that if poſſible, they may feel the weight of ſome or other of them; or at leaſt, that by the force of them all in conjunction, with the concurrence of the ſpirit of grace, they may be made willing to part with all their luſts, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſober-minded. To proceed then,</p>
               <p n="3">III. CONSIDER farther, my beloved young friends, that your becoming religious in your youth will render you greatly uſeful in the world, and make you bleſſings to mankind.</p>
               <p>THE beſt that can be ſaid of an irreligious and wicked life is, that it is uſeleſs, in compariſon with an holy and virtuous one. All the wicked are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nuiſances and peſts in ſociety, or elſe they ſtand almoſt like ciphers, and anſwer few valuable purpoſes; unleſs it be accidentally and undeſigned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. This may well be expected to be the caſe, when we conſider that worldly ſelf-love is their predominant principle. I will not ſuppoſe you at preſent to be ſo far gone in wickedneſs as to be ſcourges to mankind; though if you will not be perſuaded to be religious, you may ſoon become ſo: for the way of ſin is down-hill. But you are to be conſidered as almoſt void of uſefulneſs, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon with what you might be, and as anſwering not many valuable purpoſes, by your exiſtence. Conſider this, I beſeech you, that you may awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:013238_0034_0F90454485E041D8"/>an holy ambition in yourſelves, and ſo engage in the ſervice of God, that you may become great bleſſings to your fellow-men. Even the youngeſt of you are now arrived to thoſe years, in which you might be very uſeful, if God's grace had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance into your hearts. And ſince God has put it in your power to be rich bleſſings to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, this is a ſufficient reaſon why you ſhould be ſo. If you have any philanthropy, any true benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence in you, you will think it is time to exert yourſelves, according to the dictates of religion, in doing good to all around you. To what purpoſe are all the noble powers and faculties of body and mind, with which God has endowed you? unleſs you uſe them as he directs you. Why has he ſuffered you to eſcape all thoſe fatal accidents, to which childhood and early youth are obnoxious, and help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you thus to ripen into manhood? It is not that you ſhould live wholly unto yourſelves; but partly that you ſhould anſwer valuable purpoſes to the community, with which you are connected. God has aſſigned each one of you your ſtation; and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like Chriſtian ſobriety will enable you to act your parts well.</p>
               <p>THE religious and virtuous man is a benefit to all around him, by his governing his own appetites, paſſions and affections according to the will of God, and the dictates of conſcience. For theſe lower principles are not ſuffered to ſtand in the way of his doing thoſe duties to his fellow-creatures, which God requires him to do. He is charitable to the indigent and miſerable; juſt and righteous
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:013238_0035_0F904548E0339B48"/>towards all men; unkind and injurious to none; extending his benevolence to his enemies, and the whole human race. He allures his obſervers to virtue and piety, by his good example. He ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains bleſſings on the community by his prayers. His righteouſneſs prevents impending judgments falling upon a ſinful people. So that he is, on ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral accounts, an important advantage to the publick.</p>
               <p>HAVE you no ambition, my young friends, thus to become publick benefactors? It is glorious to love your country. It is faſhionable to profeſs this love. It is neceſſary that you abound in it, in the preſent diſtreſſed and alarming ſtate of our pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick affairs. You can no way ſo much befriend your country, I am ſure, as by your being truly religious. It is "righteouſneſs that exalteth a nation." Your goodneſs may extend to more coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries than that of your nativity. You may thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come like gods on earth, without any expenſe, or trouble, only by being and doing what is beſt for yourſelves. You cannot reaſonably refuſe, or withhold ſo cheap a ſacrifice to the publick welfare.</p>
               <p>This leads me to ſay,</p>
               <p n="4">IV. A religious life is more pleaſant and happy, than a life of ſin and vanity: and this I would urge upon young men as a motive to perſuade them to be ſober-minded.</p>
               <p>If I could convince you, my young friends, of the pleaſantneſs of religion, I am perſuaded you would ſoon embrace it; for you are no way defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient in loving pleaſure. You have a quick taſte
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:013238_0036_0F90454A4AF1E528"/>for pleaſure; and you would be glad to feel hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, every remaining day of your lives. Let me then put you into the moſt likely way to obtain the thing you deſire. That I may do this, you muſt permit me to convince you of the truth of the roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al preacher's obſervation, that religious <q>wiſdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</q> and for this reaſon, becauſe it is ſo much greater a ſource of preſent pleaſure and happineſs.</p>
               <p>YOU cannot be happy, ſo long as conſcience is vexing, galling and ſtinging you. Conſcious guilt is enough to keep you continually uneaſy; and it really robs of their repoſe all who are going on in the ways of wickedneſs. But an approving conſcience is a conſtant ſpring of peace. The Pſalmiſt ſays, <q>great peace have they that love thy law, and nothing ſhall offend them.</q> Yea, it is a foundation of continual rejoicing. <q>Our rejoicing is this,</q> ſays the apoſtle Paul, <q>the teſtimony of our conſcience, that in ſimplicity and godly ſincerity, not with fleſhly wiſdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation in the world.</q>
               </p>
               <p>THE wicked and licentious endeavour to put on the appearance of happineſs; and ſome of them are often boaſting that they enjoy themſelves better than the ſober and preciſe. But this is always falſe, and often feigned. They are certainly uneaſy in their own company, though they would have it thought they are men of pleaſure. Therefore it is that they cannot abide ſolitude, nor be eaſy with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out frequent diverſions and amuſements. They
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:013238_0037_0F90454B95DC3100"/>find they muſt do ſomething to drown thought, and ſilence the clamours of conſcience; therefore they ruſh into ſcenes of gaiety, or into revelling and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery.—But the ſober-minded can be happy, without the help of ſuch violent amuſements. They cannot only bear to converſe with themſelves; but they can enjoy great pleaſure in ſolitary meditations, and in ſelf-recollection and reflection. While the minds of the <q>wicked are like the troubled ſea, whoſe waves caſt up mire and dirt;</q> the ſouls of the righteous are like pure and healing foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, or rivers of pleaſure.</p>
               <p>WICKED men, I confeſs, have joys: but they are impure, ſudden, too violent to laſt, and leave ſtings behind them. Even <q>in the midſt of laughter, their hearts are often ſad.</q> But the godly and virtuous enjoy pleaſures ſincere and refined: ſuited to the nature of the ſoul. They are of an even tenour, and ſuch as can be reflected on with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. What is the pleaſure of a riot or debauch, to compare with the pleaſure of communion with God, or with the pleaſure of reſembling him in temper and conduct? The former is baſer than the happineſs of a ſwine; the latter reſembles that of the bleſſed angels. If the bleſſed are happier than the damned, it follows that the virtuous are more happy than the vicious, in this life; for the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heaven is the natural fruit of holineſs, and the torments of hell are created by ſin.</p>
               <p>MEN cannot but think of God ſome times; for all things around us declare his being, perfections and providence. But the wicked cannot ſeriouſly
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:013238_0038_0F90454C18200E50"/>think of God, without horror and dread; whereas the righteous have great pleaſure in meditating on his nature, attributes and works. The former cannot be quiet within, until they baniſh him out of their minds; the latter have ineffable pleaſure in retaining the idea of him. The former can take no pleaſure in addreſſing themſelves to him; the latter have heavenly joys, in their hours of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him.</p>
               <p>ETERNITY will ſome times force itſelf into the minds of ſinners, in ſpite of all their endeavours to prevent it; and as often as it does ſo, it fills them with a panick; as well it may. But the godly look forward to that ſtate with pleaſure; for it is there that they place their happineſs. It is there that they expect to enjoy God fully, after all their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral joys and ſorrows are ended. The former, when they look forward to that ſtate, ſee nought but trouble and darkneſs; an horrible and amazing proſpect, which robs them of their preſent repoſe and pleaſure: The latter ſolace their minds with an anticipation and fore-taſte of thoſe joys, which are prepared for them in the upper world. And this ſooths all their cares, abates their griefs, and enables them patiently, and therefore more eaſily than others, to bear the unavoidable evils of life.</p>
               <p>THE righteous are more happy than the wicked in their temporal enjoyments. They are more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with that portion of worldly good things, which they poſſeſs; and hereby they become more happy; for our preſent happineſs does not bear proportion to the degrees of our wealth, but to the
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:013238_0039_0F90454CC963E670"/>degrees of our contentment. So that <q>the little that a righteous man hath is better,</q> more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducive to happineſs, <q>than the treaſures of many wicked.</q>
               </p>
               <p>ALSO, whatever good things they enjoy, it is a ſatisfaction to them that they have reaſon to believe God ſends them in love, and that the divine bleſſing attends them. But the wicked, amidſt all their worldly good things, have reaſon to apprehend that the curſe of God attends them; that they are like bullocks fatting for the ſlaughter, and that their "proſperity" will contribute to "deſtroy them" eternally. The righteous have the promiſe of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral proſperity, ſo far as ſhall be for the glory of God, and their own everlaſting good; and more than this they cannot, in reaſon, deſire. <q>Wait on the Lord, and keep his way,</q> ſays David, <q>and he ſhall exalt thee to inherit the land; when the wicked are cut off thou ſhalt ſee it.</q> And the apoſtle Paul aſſures us, that <q>godlineſs is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable unto all things, having the promiſe of the life that now is.</q>—But the ungodly have no ſuch promiſes to rely upon.</p>
               <p>So that you may ſee, religion is every way pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of preſent happineſs. As you love happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs then, my young friends, be perſuaded to admit religion into your hearts and live by its dictates.</p>
               <p>YOU have ſuffered yourſelves to be prejudiced againſt a religious life, by ſuggeſtions that it will be contrary to your preſent eaſe and happineſs.— You have abuſed yourſelves with ſuch an opinion, which is as falſe as any of Satan's ſuggeſtions can
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:013238_0040_0F90454D99F11918"/>be.—Religion does not require you to part with any manly and rational pleaſures and enjoyments. It only requires you to refrain from thoſe indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences and exceſſes, which are contrary, and a ſcandal to your rational nature; and in return gives you the nobleſt intellectual pleaſures: and theſe latter are as much above the former, as heaven is above the earth. If you muſt give up the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you enjoy in the ſociety of your wicked com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, you will obtain the ſociety of the wiſe and good, which is more than a balance. If you deny yourſelves the gains of wickedneſs, you will find "godlineſs is gain," as the apoſtle aſſures you, and an incomparably more beneficial kind of gain.</p>
               <p>I AM ſenſible there is no making you realize, that the pleaſures of religion exceed thoſe of ſin, 'till you learn it from your own experience. But let me prevail with you to pay ſome regard to the authority of God, who declares this to you. And I beſeech you, give ſome credit to that which expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced Chriſtians tell you they have found, by long trial. Be ſo far influenced by theſe things, at leaſt, as to make the experiment whether it is not as I tell you. If you were once to taſte the ſweets of holineſs, I am perſuaded nothing could induce you afterwards, to abandon them for the pleaſures of ſin. For you would find that <q>in keeping the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God there is a great reward;</q> as well as an infinite reward in reverſion.</p>
               <p>THIS life is not ſo happy, at beſt, that you need to deny yourſelves the higheſt pleaſures that are to be enjoyed in it; as indeed you will, if you neglect
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:013238_0041_0F90454E51EC0340"/>the pleaſures of religion. If you deſire to enjoy all the pleaſures that is poſſible here, you muſt become holy in early life. You have loſt ſome of your time already, in ſin and vanity. Many of you have gone ſo far in the ways of ſin, that you cannot but have obſerved its pleaſures are unſatisfactory and vexatious. Squander away no more of your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious moments, I beſeech you, <q>leſt you mourn at the laſt;</q> for the time is coming, when you will think all the time loſt, and worſe than loſt, which you have not ſpent in the ſervice of God. You are yet ſo young that you have a bleſſed opportunity for enjoying much of the pleaſure of religion: for accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the courſe of nature, you have more time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you to exerciſe yourſelves in holineſs, than many others. And beſides, your affections have not yet loſt their ſpring; ſo that you are capable of the moſt lively and ſenſible joys of religion. Theſe are advantages for happineſs, that are peculiar to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of your age: but they will abate and diminiſh, as you advance in years. Seize this golden ſeaſon therefore; and ſo ſecure the higheſt, and moſt dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able pleaſures you are capable of, on this ſide heaven.</p>
               <p>O THAT you could have ſuch a view of theſe things, as they have, who begin to be religious in the afternoon of life! Could you but know the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret they feel, on account of their having miſſed the delights of religion in their youth, you would now ſpring forward without delay, and ſerve God with all your might. You would give your luſts and corruptions quarter, not a moment longer.— Believe me, my friends, you will, one time or other,
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:013238_0042_0F90454F0FFBFEC8"/>lament it bitterly, if you devote not your early days to God. There is a dreadful probability that you will have to lament it forever, when it is too late to do you any good.—Not only will religion promote your preſent happineſs, but,</p>
               <p n="5">V. NOTHING elſe can be ſo much for your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and reputation in the world, as to be ſober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded, or heartily religious in your youth.</p>
               <p>YOU are doubtleſs deſirous of honour, and would be glad to be much reſpected, and highly praiſed by your fellow-creatures. For the love of fame is truly ſaid to be an univerſal paſſion. Youth is the time of life when ambition commonly riſes higheſt; and it is a laudable ambition, to deſire to be in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and repute for piety and virtue. You may be allowed to indulge this deſire, to a certain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree; only you muſt take care that you love not "the praiſe of men, ſo much as the praiſe of God;" and that, whenever they come into competition, you are governed by the latter.</p>
               <p>SUFFER me to take hold of your ambition, as a handle to lead you into the paths of holineſs. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how much eminently holy men are reverenced and celebrated, by all who have any taſte for moral beauty. Obſerve how reſpectfully they are ſpoken of, in almoſt every company. See the veneration ſhewed them, where they are preſent. Hear the encomiums that are paſſed upon them, in their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. Then aſk yourſelves if you would not gladly ſhare in their honours.</p>
               <p>IT is true, that ſome few of the moſt profane and abandoned love to ſpeak againſt holy men, and
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:013238_0043_0F90454FB708C690"/>endeavour to deſpiſe them in their hearts. But there are very few, even of the wicked, who do not venerate them in their minds, and even wiſh, at ſome ſeaſons, to be like them. But all whoſe praiſe is any honour, are unanimous in praiſing all who appear to be truly religious and virtuous. And they will praiſe them the more in proportion as they approach nearer to perfection, in all the amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble graces of Chriſtianity. If you are truly reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, all the good will eſteem and ſpeak highly of you; yea, and the greater part of the wicked will do the ſame. For but few are ſo abandoned as not to perceive and approve what is good.—And even thoſe of the wicked who hate you for your good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, will hardly dare to do otherwiſe than ſpeak well of you; becauſe it will be unpopular, and apt to hurt their own credit.</p>
               <p>THE eminently holy and virtuous, of every age and ſtanding in life, are honourable: but eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pious and ſober youths commonly receive dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble honour. It is ſo rare a thing to ſee young men abound with grace, that thoſe who evidently do ſo are ſingularly celebrated. Moſt perſons are often ſpeaking in their praiſes and mentioning their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments with admiration. They ſeldom fail to become famous, not only in their own times, but in ſucceeding ages. Yea, ſome ſuch obtain an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delible and everlaſting reputation. Thoſe holy young men, Samuel and Joſiah, Shadrach, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhech and Abed-nego, Daniel and Timothy have their extraordinary piety recorded in deathleſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſters; and their ſame ſhall be handed down,
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:013238_0044_0F904550CF980120"/>through all the remaining generations of the world. Will not a conſideration of the fame of theſe pious youths inſpire you with an ardent zeal to follow their bright examples? Imitate their virtues, and you may obtain ſimilar honours. Many will <q>riſe up and call you bleſſed,</q> while you live, and your names ſhall be had <q>in everlaſting remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="6">VI. IF you love to excel and ſhine in any buſineſs that you undertake, enter upon a religious courſe now, that ſo in that moſt important buſineſs, you may make great proficiency.</p>
               <p>YOU will never, it is probable, arrive to great attainments in religion, unleſs you begin betimes. Can you be willing to grovel as long as you live, and never attain to any extraordinary degrees of holineſs? It is likely you intend to get, ſome time or other, religion enough to fit you for heaven.— But is it not deſirable to exceed the lower forms of Chriſtians? Is it not worthy your ambition to aim at the higheſt improvements in the divine life? I would fain ſuppoſe that you think ſo. It is high time, therefore, for you to begin your journey heaven-wards. For the way to do extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary ſervice for God, is not to ſpend the firſt, and beſt of your time in idleneſs. If you would be before others, you muſt ſtart earlier than others; becauſe religion is a progreſſive work. I never knew any very improved Chriſtians, who were not religious from their youth. But if you begin in youth, you will have all poſſible advantage for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more than others. Thus you may come to be
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:013238_0045_0F9045522CB39698"/>grown men and ſtrong, while many of your ſeniors are but babes in Chriſt. You may arrive to the full aſſurance of faith, while they are ſtruggling in the narrows of regeneration. You may come to be filled with <q>joy and peace in believing, while they remain in bondage, through fear of death.</q> If you did but realize one half of the advantages of high attainments in grace, you would devote your early days to God, leſt you ſhould never arrive thereunto.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. CONSIDER whether you are not bound by the ſtrongeſt and moſt indiſpenſable ties of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to God to devote your youthful days to him.</p>
               <p>GOD is your creator. His almighty fiat bro't you out of nothing into being, and furniſhed you with all your powers of action, both corporal and mental. And who ſhould you ſerve, but him who made you? You owe him all that you are and have; and you cannot be too early in giving him his own, eſpecially as he demands it of you. If you do not ſpeedily devote all your powers to his ſervice, where is your gratitude. Is it not a ſhameful thing to deny him any of your time? Refuſe him not then your youth, in which you can ſerve him beſt.</p>
               <p>HE has alſo fed and cloathed you, <q>nouriſhed and brought you up as children.</q> Yea, he has been doing this, while you have been forgetting and forſaking him; or elſe affronting and provok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, with horrid rebellion againſt his ſacred authority. Inſtead of deſtroying you, according to your deſerts, he has been loading you <q>with his benefits.</q> Will you then perſiſt any longer in
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:013238_0046_0F9045530B2754D8"/>making ſo vile a return for his goodneſs, as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny him your ſervice? He obſerves your conduct; he takes notice how you requite him, and highly reſents your ingratitude. He calls heaven and earth to witneſs to the ingratitude of ſuch as you have hitherto been. "Hear, O heavens," ſaith he, <q>and give ear, O earth! for the Lord hath ſpoken: I have nouriſhed and brought up chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, but they have rebelled againſt me.</q>
               </p>
               <p>WHERE then can words be found to expreſs your ingratitude, if you continue in ſin, when you know that Chriſt died an ignominious and moſt painful death, to <q>redeem you from all iniquity, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify you unto himſelf a peculiar people, zealous of good works?</q> Titus ii. 14. Has he died on the croſs to obtain pardon for all true penitents, and will you not repent? Has he ſuffered the curſe, that he might ſend you the ſanctifying Spirit, and will you not improve his aſſiſtance? If this is your caſe, no other kind of ingratitude is fit to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with your's.</p>
               <p>YOUR glorious Prince has died in your ſtead; becauſe his infinite compaſſion towards you would not permit him to ſee you ſuffer the deſtruction to which you were obnoxious. And will not this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with you, to make you throw down the arms you have taken up againſt him? If not, your guilt will riſe beyond all parallel. You will be ranked with thoſe, who are ſaid to <q>crucify the Son of God afreſh:—no more ſacrifice</q> will be admitted for your unmeaſurably aggravated ſin; <q>but there remaineth a certain fearful looking for
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:013238_0047_0F9044800C451530"/>of judgment and fiery indignation, which ſhall devour</q> you. You muſt expect a far <q>ſorer puniſhment,</q> than the deſpiſers of the law of Moſes underwent, who were put to death <q>without mercy,</q> without redemption or reprieve.</p>
               <p>THE more means God has uſed, and the greater expenſe he has been at to bring you to himſelf, the more atrocious is the guilt of your unthankfulneſs. If you had never heard of Chriſt, the ingratitude of your ſins would have been really inexcuſable; for the heathen nations are truly ſaid to be <q>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out excuſe,</q> Rom. i. 20. But how much more ſo are you, who have the free offer of ſalvation by Chriſt, and live under the cleareſt light of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel? You have, in this land, all poſſible advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of grace. You enjoy a degree of religious liberty, which is denied to far the greater part of Chriſtendom. You are generally taught, in your childhood, the principles of religion; and your miniſters are continually wooing and beſeeching you to "be reconciled to God." Let not all the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour that is laid out on you be loſt; for if you will not after all be perſuaded, you muſt expect a moſt aggravated damnation. For Chriſt has ſaid, <q>that ſervant which knew his Lord's will, and prepared not himſelf, neither did according to his will, ſhall be beaten with many ſtripes.</q> The people of Sodom and Gomorrah, though their crimes were ſuch as you abhor, will have a lighter doom than you in the day of judgment, unleſs you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent. O let theſe alarming conſiderations prevail with you to make a ſpeedy ſurrender of yourſelves to God.</p>
               <p n="8">
                  <pb n="43" facs="unknown:013238_0048_0F9044811F508A60"/>
VIII. You muſt alſo conſider, that early piety is the means of advancing the glory of God moſt effectually; therefore that you ſhould now become ſober-minded.</p>
               <p>IT was for the manifeſtation of his glory that you, and all other creatures and things were cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated. Surely you ſhould make that a deſign of your actions, which was God's deſign in giving you power to act. The promoting his glory, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſhould be an abiding and powerful motive to duty with you. If, by early religion, you can beſt promote this deſign; let the deſire of this engage you to be religious, while your youth continues. And that this is really true, I hope to convince you.</p>
               <p>"HEREIN is my Father glorified," ſays Chriſt, "that ye bear much fruit." But you cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to bear much, if you remain barren trees in God's vineyard, until you begin to wither away. Let the fruits of internal ſobriety and holineſs, then, be found upon you in youth, as ever you hope to be <q>filled with the fruits of righteouſneſs and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, which are by Jeſus Chriſt, to the glory and praiſe of God.</q>
               </p>
               <p>BY early piety you will not only glorify God in your own perſons, but be the means of its being done by others. "Your light" will <q>ſo ſhine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men, that they may ſee your good works;</q> and this will excite them to endeavour to follow your bright example, and thereby <q>glorify your Father which is in heaven.</q>
               </p>
               <p>YOUR truly religious conduct will be ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual reproof of the careleſs and irreligious lives of
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:013238_0049_0F904481960DC468"/>your ſeniors, that it will be one of the moſt effectual means to awaken their conſciences, and bring them into the way of holineſs. It is highly probable they will be hereby led to reflect, and conſider how ſhameful it is, that they are ſo backward in their preparation for eternity, when they ſee young per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſo forward; and that the neceſſity is great that they begin the great buſineſs of life, without any longer delay, as they are probably ſo much nearer than you to the end of their probation ſtate.—But you will not be apt to leave them wholly to their own reflections. You will modeſtly remind them, as you have opportunity, of the evil of ſin, and of the unreaſonableneſs and danger of neglecting their moſt important concerns, and of living as "with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God in the world." And the idea of your youth, if you reprove and exhort wiſely, will give a peculiar force to ſuch applications.</p>
               <p>ALSO, you will be likely to become the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of reclaiming your equals to religion and virtue Your good examples will have an almoſt irreſiſtable influence upon them; and you can hardly fail of doing them much good. You will do much to ſhame them out of their vices, and to allure them into the way, in which they ſhould walk. For young perſons are much influenced by examples, and ſeldom fail to become like their companions. Therefore if you deſire that God ſhould be glorified in the converſion of your acquaintances, begin to ſerve the Lord betimes. If the young men who are here preſent would become as exemplarily religious as they ought, I ſhould expect it would be the
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:013238_0050_0F904485C70AA490"/>means of a general revival of religion among us.— You have it in your power to do much in this way for the honour of God. Do it then, becauſe you can do it. This is a ſufficient reaſon; for you are obliged to do all you can for the honour of him, who is the owner of your bodies and ſpirits, and the giver of all your time and talents.</p>
               <p>MOREOVER, they who have the honour of God and the welfare of religion at heart, will be ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiced to obſerve your early piety, that they will not ceaſe to give thanks, to praiſe and glorify the name of God, for his grace appearing in you. As the churches of Judea "glorified God in" the apoſtle Paul, when they heard of his converſion to Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity; ſo will Chriſtians glorify God in you, or on your account, when they perceive your converſion to holineſs.</p>
               <p>CHRISTIANS will bleſs God, not only for what you are, but for the proſpect he gives them in you, of much good to the riſing generation. Our at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention is turned upon you, my young friends; for we cannot but look upon you, as upon perſons that are to be of great importance in years to come, when our own day is over. It lies much with you, whether the cauſe of religion is to revive and flouriſh, or farther to ſink and decay. The youngeſt of you, if God ſpares your lives, are ſoon to be heads and governors of families. And how thankful ſhall we be, if we can ſee reaſon to believe that you and your houſes "will ſerve the Lord?"—But on the other hand, it will depreſs our ſpirits to ſee you riſing up to be the chiefs and leaders of a careleſs
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:013238_0051_0F9044870C0B2CF8"/>and ungodly generation.—How do you think your aged Chriſtian friends can die in peace, ſo long as they have too much reaſon to think their places will be ſupplied with young men who <q>caſt off the fear of God?</q> Be religious therefore in mercy to them, leſt you <q>bring down their grey hairs with ſorrow to the grave.</q> You cannot think how thoſe of you who are moſt evidently ungodly, wring the hearts of your good parents, and other pious Chriſtians. As you know not what high pleaſure and ſatisfaction you would give them, by an early walking in the ways of God: ſo you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conceive how you pain them by your contrary practices.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. As you would lay a foundation for an happy cloſe of life, be perſuaded to mind your main con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern in your early days.</p>
               <p>THAT is a true ſaying, <q>a well-ſpent life makes a pleaſant old age.</q> Be real Chriſtians from this time forwards; and if you ſhould live to the other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe cheerleſs days of age, you will then have the beſt comfort, when other comforts loſe their reliſh; the delights of virtue and communion with God, exerciſes of the ſoul a-kin to heavenly bliſs, and a comfortable retroſpect on a life well-ſpent. Theſe will be moſt important ſupports to your ſpirits, which you cannot well be without, when your "fleſh and heart" is failing, and you feel yourſelves tottering on the brink of a fathomleſs eternity.— You canot conceive what a relief it will be to you, if you are able then, like Hezekiah, to look up to God ſaying, <q>remember now, O Lord, I beſeech
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:013238_0052_0F9044878D651B90"/>thee, how I have walked before thee in truth, and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy ſight.</q>
               </p>
               <p>IN your ſerious moments, you are doubtleſs ready to pray like Balaam, <q>let me die the death of the righteous, and let my laſt end be like his.</q> Let me remind you, that in order to obtain this favour of God, you muſt live a life of evangelical holineſs. The oracles of God point out no other way. Live like the righteous, and then you may hope, thro' the mercy of God in Chriſt, that you ſhall die like them. —You may die ſafely indeed, if you ſhould enter late upon an holy life; but it will be ſtrange if you ſhould die cheerfully. You cannot die comfortably, unleſs you attain to a full aſſurance of your gracious ſtate: and this is not to be expected, becauſe not ordinarily obtained, but as the fruit and reward of a long courſe of holy living. How inexpreſſibly dreadful muſt it be, to be forced away to the tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of God, without any firm aſſurance of the ſafety of your ſtate? This may be called dying the death of the wicked, whether you are the children of God, or not. As you would ſhun ſuch an exit, let me prevail with you to embrace your preſent happy opportunity of beginning a godly life. For the ſooner you begin, the more likely it is that you may obtain "the full aſſurance of hope," which is ſo neceſſary to enable you to face "the king of terrors."</p>
               <p n="10">X. AND laſtly, I ſhall propoſe to you, my young friends, one motive more, to perſuade you to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify your luſts and be ſober-minded. It is the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of higher degrees of glory in heaven, which
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:013238_0053_0F9044885F901400"/>the more eminent and improved ſervants of God ſhall obtain.</p>
               <p>IT is very plain from ſcripture, that the greater our degrees of grace are here, the greater will be our rewards in the upper world. And, as I have ſaid before, the earlier you begin to ſerve God, the greater improvements it is likely you will make in religion, and the greater meetneſs for glory will you obtain. It follows, that by early piety you may hope to be laying up extraordinary treaſure for yourſelves in heaven. Each day you ſpend in your warfare againſt luſt and ſin, will ſerve to enhance your glorious reward. Every hour you ſpend in ſerving God, you will find the benefit of to all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. All that you do more than others will add, proportionably, to your "eternal weight of glory." For though you are not to be rewarded for your work, as you can merit nothing of god; ſtill you are to be rewarded, <q>according as your work ſhall be,</q> Rev. xxii. 12. Each degree of increaſed glory is to be conſidered as an eternal benefit: who will then be ſo fooliſh as to refuſe to begin early in his Lord's work, when the reward annexed, thro' grace, to every part &amp; portion of his work, is eternal?</p>
               <p>PERHAPS you will ſay, the loweſt place in heaven is the utmoſt of your deſire. I grant that the loweſt ſaint in heaven will be completely happy, as all his deſires will be ſatisfied. But ſince there are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent degrees of glory, why ſhould you not aſpire after the higheſt? And why is this made known to you, in the word of God, unleſs it be his will to excite an holy emulation in you. I am ſure you
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:013238_0054_0F90448924D31BD8"/>are not capable of a more glorious piece of ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than to aim at obtaining the higheſt rewards of grace; though you ſhould always remember they are "of grace," and that you will always be unworthy of the loweſt.</p>
               <p>BUT, by what was ſaid in the firſt diſcourſe, it appears to be very doubtful whether you obtain any place at all in heaven, unleſs you ſeek it in your youth. I may therefore exhort you to ſeek the higheſt, that ſo you may be ſure of ſome place in the manſions of the bleſſed. God's children think they cannot ſtand too high in his favour, nor receive too many marks of it. As it is their temper, to preſs forward to the higheſt improvements in grace, can it be thought they have no deſire of the greateſt tokens in heaven of God's love &amp; kindneſs to them?</p>
               <p>YOU ſee, my young friends, what a long exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation I have given you, in a cheerful compliance with the requirement in my text. An exhortation chiefly adapted, as the text is, to the caſe of thoſe of you who are yet unregenerate; but not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to be attended to by every one of you. I might have uſed ſeveral other motives with you; particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, I might have repreſented to you all that the ſcripture teaches of the joys of the bleſſed, and the torments of the damned. But as theſe motives are often preſented to you in addreſſes to people in general; and as they are not ſo peculiar to perſons of your age as the moſt that I have uſed, I have not diſtinctly urged them. But enough has been ſaid to leave you without excuſe, if you remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reclaimed. If you reject this exhortation, I ſhall
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:013238_0055_0F904489F97EE710"/>have too much reaſon to ſuſpect that you will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be reclaimed. Let me not, I beſeech you, loſe this labour upon you, as I have reaſon to fear I have loſt much heretofore. Muſt I return and ſay, "Lord, who hath belived our report?" Muſt I leave you with the melancholy proſpect that this earneſt addreſs will not move, but harden you? And dare you run the venture of its riſing up in judgment againſt you at the laſt day, and aggravating your condemnation? This, alas! will be the event, if you cannot be perſuaded to <q>turn and live.</q>
               </p>
               <p>BUT I hope better things concerning ſome of you. I obſerve with pleaſure, that ſome of you ſeem to be endowed with very amiable, and I hope truly gracious qualities. Several of you have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionably begun to be ſober-minded: I would hope others are now reſolving that they will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſo. Theſe have need of direction and aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, that they may keep what they have gotten and go forward.—On this head you may have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to hear me ſoon. In the mean time think of the ſerious truths you have now heard, "and the Lord give you underſtanding."</p>

               </epigraph>
               <p>IN the two preceeding diſcourſes, I explained what it is to be ſober-minded; and then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted our young men to become ſo, with a variety of arguments and motives, which were chiefly adapted to perſons of their ſtanding, and eſpecially to thoſe who are not yet in a ſanctified ſtate. I flatter myſelf that ſome of them have ſo felt the weight of theſe arguments, either before or at this hearing of them, as to be inclined to give up themſelves to the ſervice of God, and begin a warfare againſt their luſts and corruptions.—But as young perſons are commonly much at a loſs how to demean themſelves, when they begin to be ſeriouſly affected with the things of religion, it was propoſed,</p>
               <p>THIRDLY. To give young men directions what methods to take, if they deſire to obtain and culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate inward ſobriety.—This therefore is what I ſhall, depending upon divine aſſiſtance, apply my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to at this time.—And,</p>
               <p n="1">I. LET me direct you, my young friends, to
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:013238_0058_0F90448C4649B208"/>avoid evil company, and aſſociate as much as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible with good and virtuous perſons.</p>
               <p>I MENTION this firſt, becauſe it appears to me to be of the greateſt importance. A young man will not only be eſteemed to be much the ſame as thoſe he is moſt familiarly acquainted with; but it is moſt likely, if he is not ſo at preſent, he will ſoon really be ſo. Young men are pliable; thoſe of the beſt natures not leſs ſo than others, but often more; ſo that they will eaſily take the impreſſion that is given them, by thoſe with whom they moſt frequently converſe. Inſomuch that, as good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany will be likely to do them the greateſt good, ſo evil company will probably do them the greateſt hurt. Solomon was fully convinced of this, which made him ſay, in general terms, <q>he that walketh with wiſe men ſhall be wiſe; but a companion of fools ſhall be deſtroyed.</q> Take notice how thoſe improve in goodneſs, who conſort with holy men; and how faſt thoſe "wax worſe and worſe," who are familiar with ſinners; and you will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the truth of this ſaying, from your own obſervation.</p>
               <p>LET me inſiſt upon it therefore, that you im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately break off all unneceſſary familiar ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with thoſe who have not the fear of God before their eyes; unleſs they will now turn with you into the right ways of the Lord. Your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſouls will be in the greateſt danger from ſuch connexions. Therefore your all-merciful God, who deſires not your deſtruction but your ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, has repeatedly warned you in his word, againſt
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:013238_0059_0F90448CD8ADF288"/>keeping ſuch company. The divine cautions are ſuch as theſe; <q>walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot from their path, Prov. i. 15.</q> Go from the preſence of a "fooliſh," that is, a wicked <q>man, when thou perceiveſt not in him the lips of knowledge,</q> Ch. xiv. ver. 7. <q>Make no friendſhip with an angry man, and with the furious thou ſhalt not go, leſt thou learn his ways, and get a ſnare to thy ſoul,</q> Ch. xxii. ver. 24, 25. <q>Be not thou envious againſt evil men; neither deſire to be with them,</q> Ch. xxii. ver. 1.</p>
               <p>ATTEND, I beſeech you, not only to theſe cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but alſo to the conduct of holy David; who ſays, <q>I have not ſat with vain perſons, neither will I go in with diſſemblers. I have hated the congregation of evil doers; and I will not ſit with the wicked.</q> Take notice alſo of his promiſes and reſolutions, in this reſpect. "I will not know," ſays he, <q>a wicked perſon;—he that worketh deceit ſhall not dwell in my houſe; he that telleth lies ſhall not tarry in my ſight.</q>
               </p>
               <p>YOU had better be quite ſolitary, than have none but wicked companions. You had better dwell alone in a wilderneſs, than aſſociate with thoſe who fear not God. But, thanks be to the grace of God, this is not the doleful alternative; either to converſe with wicked companions, or abandon ſociety.— There are ſome, I hope a good number, even in this wicked place, who are fit companions for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Chriſtians, and whoſe intimate acquaintance will not hurt you, but do you good. Since men are made ſociable creatures, and you find ſomething
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:013238_0060_0F90448D8E0A8738"/>in you ſtrongly demanding a friendly and familiar intercourſe with your fellow-creatures, the refuſing to gratify which will be attended with great morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and real diſadvantage, be perſuaded to ſeek the acquaintance of thoſe who are truly religious. The example of David it is beſt you ſhould follow; who ſays, <q>I am a companion of all them that fear thee, and of them that keep thy precepts.</q>
               </p>
               <p>CHANGING of old acquaintance for new will doubtleſs be attended with ſome difficulty; but this can be no ſufficient reaſon for your paying ſo little regard to your own ſpiritual intereſt, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs commands of God, as to neglect doing it.</p>
               <p>YOU may be even ready to think it impracticable, in many caſes, becauſe of your neceſſary buſineſs and connexions. But I am ſure you had better let any temporal buſineſs ſuffer, if one or the other muſt be, than riſk an intimacy with the profligate and ungodly. This duty however, is not ſo to be underſtood, as if you muſt have no ſort of dealing and communication with ſuch perſons. For it is obſervable, that where the apoſtle warns the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians <q>not to company with fornicators,—of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters,</q> he makes this exception, <q>yet not altogether;—for then ye muſt needs go out of the world.</q> He did not require them ſo entirely to ſhun ſuch wicked company, as not to do needful buſineſs with them, and interchange common civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities. You may be friendly and courteous to the worſt of men, and even religion requires you to be ſo, without holding any intimacy with them, and chooſing them for your boſom-companions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="unknown:013238_0061_0F90448E8FBDD4B8"/>
THE greateſt difficulty in this caſe will probably ariſe from relationſhip: for the want of intimacy with relatives, eſpecially with thoſe of the ſame houſehold, will be apt to breed uneaſineſs and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy. But you ſhould quit the houſes of wicked relatives, and even of wicked parents, if you are not in your minority, and under their lawful command; unleſs you can prevail with them to forſake their practices; excepting in ſuch caſes, where their need of your help renders it a work of piety to abide with them.</p>
               <p>LET me ſeriouſly adviſe thoſe of you, who are at liberty to chooſe your places of abode, to enter, if poſſible, into families where religious orders are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved; and where the morning, and evening ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices are not neglected. This will be a means of keeping up in your ſouls a wakeful ſenſe of divine things. Avoid prayerleſs houſes as you would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected ones: for ſuch families, it is to be feared, are not in the way of God's bleſſing. You may well fear God's judgments, if you dwell in ſuch places: for divine fury, you may juſtly expect, will be pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, ſooner or later, <q>on the families that call not on his name.</q>
               </p>
               <p>YOU can hardly conceive how much depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your making a wiſe choice of your moſt intimate companions. Religious friends will be continually guarding you againſt temptations; reminding you of the unreaſonableneſs, vileneſs, and odiouſneſs of ſin; prompting and quickening you to the practice of every holy duty, and Chriſtian virtue.</p>
               <p>AND of all companions, chooſing a boſom friend
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:013238_0062_0F90448F1E5B83D0"/>of the other ſex for life, is a matter of more ſerious importance than moſt young men ſeem to imagine. Let thoſe of you who have this yet to do, be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to do it conſiderately, and prayerfully, in the fear of God, and with an eye to the welfare of your ſouls. For if you ſhould form this dear connexion with ſuch as are not governed by religious principles; with ſuch as affect every thing in faſhion, let it be never ſo unreaſonable and ſinful; with ſuch as have no command over their appetites, and paſſions, fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well to all your ſerious impreſſions. Whatever pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous reſolutions you have formed, they will be likely to vaniſh as the morning cloud. But if you chooſe thoſe who are actuated by the love and fear of God, and whoſe ornament is "a meek and quiet ſpirit," they will help you forward in religion, guard you againſt ſin and temptation, and ſweetly attract you to the love and practice of univerſal holineſs.</p>
               <p>THE great apoſtle Paul did not think it beneath him, to direct and exhort men on this head. <q>Be not unequally yoked, ſays he, with unbelievers:</q> and elſewhere, <q>let him that marrieth marry in the Lord.</q>—And I ſhould think it adviſable for you to chooſe to match, other things being equal, with thoſe who are, by education or choice, of the ſame denomination of Chriſtians with yourſelves: becauſe doing otherwiſe has often proved to be the means of great inconveniences, if not of the alienation of affections.</p>
               <p>THOSE of you, my young friends, who have been left to lead apparently wicked lives, may be in ſome doubt, whether religious perſons will
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:013238_0063_0F90448FD9FE8A80"/>ſuffer you to become their intimates; becauſe they are warned againſt an intimacy with the wicked. But they are obliged to avoid you no longer than you remain wicked. If you repent, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge your ſorrow for your ſins, they are welcome, yea, they are obliged to "reſtore" you to their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, "in the ſpirit of meekneſs." And they will be ſo rejoiced, when they ſee you <q>bring forth fruits meet for repentance,</q> that they will love and careſs you as much as if you had been ſerious from your cradles: perhaps more; for a remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able change in your conduct, and that humility which appears in your condemning your own form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er courſes, will be conſidered as additional proofs of your ſanctification, beyond what thoſe who are ſanctified from infancy can produce. So that you need not doubt being able to form as large, and as intimate an acquaintance with religious perſons, as will be advantageous to you.</p>
               <p>I MUST not cloſe this direction, without recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending to you a practice which young men ſome times go into, of aſſembling in ſome private place, to aſſiſt and edify one another with exerciſes of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion. I cannot but think that an evening ſpent, now and then, in this manner, would be of ſome ſpiritual advantage to you. It would, at leaſt, help to wear off that ſhyneſs and baſhfulneſs concerning religious matters, which is ſo common among you, and hurtful to you. You would be likely to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage and ſtrengthen one another to perſiſt in your good reſolutions; and it would ſerve as a ſchool to prepare you to carry on the worſhip of God in
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:013238_0064_0F904490ACD8CA08"/>your own families. On this laſt account, I have known ſome, from their own experience, give a frank and full teſtimony in favour of this practice; who were perſuaded they never ſhould have been brought to perform family prayers, had they not been members of ſuch a religious ſociety. It would rejoice the hearts of many, if ſome of our young men would engage themſelves in ſuch a deſign.</p>
               <p n="2">II. THE next piece of advice I would give you, in order to your obtaining and cultivating hearty ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety, is, that you be conſtant and fervent in your ſecret devotions.</p>
               <p>SECRET prayer is ſo ſtrictly inſtituted, or plainly commanded, by the divine perſon who died for you, that you can have no reaſon in the world to think yourſelves true Chriſtians, ſo long as you live in the neglect of it. He bids you <q>enter into your cloſet, and when you have ſhut the door, pray to your father which is in ſecret.</q> And the motive he adds, to encourage you to this duty, is ſo full of grace and goodneſs, that it ſeems ſtrange that ſuch needy, impotent creatures as men are, can ever chooſe to neglect it. <q>Pray to thy father which is in ſecret, and thy father which ſeeth in ſecret ſhall reward thee openly.</q> Matth. vi. 6. Such a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of God's hearing your prayers will render your neglect of praying in ſecret a fooliſh, and inexcuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble piece of diſobedience. You cannot but know that you want to receive of God many good things, both for ſoul and body: and yet, when you can have them for aſking, will you neglect to aſk? Can you deſire to have your wants ſupplied, upon any eaſier terms?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="unknown:013238_0065_0F9044914C7BC918"/>
Is not this the higheſt honour and privilege that can be vouchſafed you? If you might have a ſecret interview with your earthly ſovereign, as often as you pleaſed, and were aſſured that he would grant you any thing you ſhould requeſt of him, would you not value yourſelves upon it? Would you need any other motives to make you accept of ſuch a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour? You would be thought madmen, if you did. How much worſe than mad are you then, if you ſlight, and neglect ſuch an intercourſe with the King of kings? eſpecially as he will puniſh you with eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal deſtruction, if you neglect it.</p>
               <p>I SUPPOSE few, or none, of you wholly neglect ſecret prayer: but I would have you conſtant, and fervent in it. You ſhould have your daily, ſtated times for this duty, and let no ſmall thing ever put you by: and you ſhould be as much in earneſt, and as affectionate as poſſible in your addreſs to God. This is the right way of praying: the only ſure way to obtain what you aſk. You muſt <q>continue in prayer, and watch in the ſame,</q> Col. iv. 2.</p>
               <p>As it is not in your own power to become hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily religious, you muſt go to God to make you ſo. Fervent and perſevering prayer is the moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant and likely means to obtain this neceſſary favour of God. There is a good old ſaying that you ought to conſider, <q>praying will make thee leave ſinning, or ſinning will make thee leave praying.</q> This is doubtleſs true, if we underſtand fervent and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate praying. So that you muſt not abate the frequency, nor the fervency of your prayers, if God does not immediately, or if he does not for a long
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:013238_0066_0F904492064DB560"/>time, grant the things you pray for. God will ſend an anſwer in the fitteſt ſeaſon, and that ſeaſon may not be at hand. Sometimes God ſees it is fit that your patience and perſeverance ſhould be tried, before your requeſts are granted. Chriſt <q>ſpake a parable to the end that men ought always to pray, and not to faint;</q> in which he gives you reaſon to expect that unceaſing importunity will finally prevail. Take heed then that you do not faint in this duty; but let God's delaying to bleſs you make you more and more importunate For if you give over, your good beginnings will end in deſtruction: but if you perſiſt, the work of grace will doubtleſs be wrought.</p>
               <p>CRY mightily to God then, and do not deſpond. Reſolve as Jacob, that you will not let him go till he bleſſes you. Cry as David did, <q>create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right ſpirit in me. Caſt me not away from thy preſence; and take not thy holy ſpirit from me.</q> Say un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, Lord, ſubdue the luſts and corruptions that are in me. Take away that bias to evil that has hitherto governed me; and make me a partaker of the divine nature; that ſo, for the future, I may live ſuch a life as becomes a rational creature.—The greater variety of expreſſions you uſe, in your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes to God for renewing grace, the more likely you will be to affect yourſelves with your need of it, and the higher will your deſires after it ariſe: and, in proportion, you will be the more likely ſoon to obtain it.</p>
               <p>Is there any need of my adding this caution, that
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:013238_0067_0F904492F65CF630"/>when you find God has changed your hearts, you are not to lay aſide prayer? It is to be expected that you will then have your hearts ſo engaged in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, that you will continue in it of your own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord. Prayer is the very breath of the regenerate. Saul was no ſooner converted, than it was ſaid of him, "behold he prayeth."</p>
               <p>BUT the regenerate have their dull frames, when prayer appears burdenſome: they are therefore to be reminded of their conſtant need of this holy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe. It is as neceſſary for their improvement, and perſeverance in holineſs, as for their beginning in it. As long as you are needy and dependent, ſo long will prayer be neceſſary for you: and that will be as long as you live. As you will always need ſupplies of grace, you muſt always go to the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain-head for them. Religion is a continued war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare; and you are not to expect you ſhall conquer your ſpiritual enemies, unleſs you repair to the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of your ſalvation, that you may <q>receive of his fullneſs.</q> You muſt go to him for daily aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance in your daily conflicts with Satan, the world, and luſt.</p>
               <p>ONE thing is to be remembered in your ſecret converſe with God; which is, whenever you pray, to make confeſſion of your ſins to God, a part of your addreſſes to him. This is the way to make you modeſt and humble in your requeſts for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies: it is agreeable to ſcripture-examples of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and it will make you ſenſible of the propriety, and neceſſity of putting up all your petitions in the name of our glorious Mediator.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="unknown:013238_0068_0F90449759F60AB8"/>
YOU ſhould alſo, in your prayers, give thanks for mercies received. This is the more effectual method of begging. You will always have abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant reaſon for thankſgiving, before, as well as after your real converſion to holineſs. And if you appear ungrateful, or forgetful of paſt mercies, how can you expect to obtain new ones? The apoſtle Paul directs men to join thankſgiving to petition in their prayers. "In every thing," ſays he, <q>by prayer, and ſupplication, together with thankſgiving, let your requeſt be made known to God.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="3">III. IF you deſire to attain to true ſobriety, guard, as much as poſſible, againſt faſhionable vices. When vices become faſhionable, they ceaſe to appear fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and alarming to inexperienced and unſuſpecting youth. If you hear of a crime in any, that is but ſeldom committed within your knowledge, you are immediately ſhocked; and your hearts riſe with ſuch deteſtation of it, that you are in little or no danger of following the example. But vices that are commonly practiſed before your faces, gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally appear leſs and leſs diſguſtful, 'till you loſe ſight of the deformity of them: and then you are in immediate danger of falling into the practice of them. Or elſe, if you have ſeen them practiſed from your infancy, they never ſhocked you at all. Here it is that your greateſt danger lies; here then you have need of the greateſt caution.</p>
               <p>NOTHING can ſuperſede the neceſſity of your keeping a conſtant guard againſt vices of this kind; unleſs no vice were become faſhionable. But this
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:013238_0069_0F904498D12C31C8"/>is ſo far from the truth, that it is not to be queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned. It is lamentably true, that ſome vices are practiſed by ſo many, that they muſt be called fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhionable, though there are many who avoid them: juſt as ſome modes of dreſs are faſhionable, though there are many who will not run into them.— Under this head, I muſt caution you,</p>
               <p n="1">1. To be upon your guard againſt all profane ſwearing and curſing; uſing the ſacred name of your Maker with irreverence, and other ways of ſpeaking that are evidently contrary to that ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of ſpeech, which our bleſſed Saviour enjoins. The tongue is ſo active a member, that it will be apt to run into profanity, with very little temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if it is not ſtrictly guarded. And indeed, it ſeems there is as little temptation to commit this ſin, as any that is practiſed. It is ſhocking to think how much of this horrid language is to be heard in our ſtreets; and how many of our dear young peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have learnt to profane the holy and awful name of the great God, without remorſe. As you would guard yourſelves againſt this, remember thoſe aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful words delivered by God upon mount Sinai, <q>Thou ſhalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain; for the Lord will not hold him guiltleſs that taketh his name in vain.</q> Profane perſons are abſolutely ſhut out from mercy, while they remain unreclaimed; ſhut out both by law and goſpel. God "will not hold them guiltleſs:" even the blood of Chriſt, through which penitent ſinners are held guiltleſs, will not avert the wrath
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:013238_0070_0F904499150CA818"/>of God from profane perſons, nor remove their guilt, till they ceaſe to be what they are. God will not conſider it as a ſin of infirmity, which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible with a ſtate of grace.—Conſider alſo how your bleſſed Lord has explained this command, in his ſermon on the Mount: where he makes it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit ſwearing either by God, or any of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, in common converſation, as well as falſe ſwearing and breach of vows: and how he guards this commandment, by ſaying, <q>Let your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication be, yea, yea; any, nay: for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is more than theſe, cometh of evil:</q> that is, content yourſelves with uſing a repeated arfirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, or negation, in your common intercourſe with one another; for all beyond this is wrong. The due conſideration of this will make you careful, not only to avoid falſe and profane ſwearing; but all profane interjections and exclamations; all need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and irreverent mention of the names and titles of the ſupreme being, or what relates to him; all light ſpeaking of ſacred things; all pawning of your faith, ſouls, ſalvation, word, or honour; and whatever other ways of ſpeaking evidently bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering upon profaneneſs, and tending to lead to it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. ANOTHER ſin I would here warn you againſt, is that deceit which is too commonly practiſed in converſation: particularly, againſt backbiting, on the one hand, and flattery, on the other; which are ſome of the moſt faſhionable ſins of the tongue. A ſort of perſons that are very numerous, are ſuch as will be ſo fair and bland to your faces, that you
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:013238_0071_0F90449993356778"/>are ready to think them your beſt friends; but ſay ſo much againſt you, behind your backs, that others take them to be your worſt enemies. I mention theſe two vices in conjunction, becauſe they are commonly found in the ſame perſons, and both are founded in deceit. Flattery is a deteſtable vice, not only as it ſhews a bad mind, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſome ſelfiſh, baſe deſign, but as it produces baneful effects. We are not ſo apt to deteſt our flatterers as our ſlanderers; though the former will probably do us as much miſchief as the latter. But both are evil workers, and both are condemned in God's word. Pro. xvii. 15. <q>He that juſtifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the juſt, even they both are abomination to the Lord.</q>— As you would keep clear of flattery and detraction, make it your rule to praiſe the good in their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, rather than in their preſence; and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the bad, rather in their preſence than when they are abſent. Or, to ſay no evil of any perſon behind his back, that you would not more willingly ſay to his face: and to ſay no good of any to his face, that you would not rather ſay behind his back.</p>
               <p n="3">3. EXCESSIVE drinking is another too faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able vice, of which I would here warn you, my young friends, to beware. For this is ſo much practiſed, that you will be often in the way of its temptation.</p>
               <p>I HAVE the pleaſure to think, that but few of you have been groſsly faulty in this matter hitherto. It is not common, for thoſe who are very young, to go any great length in this wickedneſs. But as you
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:013238_0072_0F90449A42BB8DF0"/>grow older, your danger from this quarter will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe. Cultivate then, I beſeech you, ſuch an early abhorrence of it, and keep at ſo great a diſtance from all temptations to it, that, as you grow older, its allurements may not be likely to endanger your virtue. Believe me, this is one of the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſively deſtructive of all vices: as well as moſt directly contrary to that Chriſtian ſobriety, to which I have been exhorting you. If you once get into this way, you will ſee an end of all your religious impreſſions, and good reſolutions: it will transform you into the moſt vile of all irrational creatures: it will deaden all the ſenſibility of your conſciences: it will unfit you to ſerve God, your brethren, or your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: it will lay you open to a multitude of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations; and it will be deſtructive to your eſtates, reputations, health, families, bodies and ſouls. This, as well as all other ſins, may be forgiven up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on repentance: but it renders repentance more hopeleſs than almoſt any other ſins; for but very few, who have gone far in this way, are ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed. They are generally, <q>led captive by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan at his will,</q> till they are plunged into reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dileſs ruin.—As you love your ſouls then, let me perſuade you to keep at the utmoſt diſtance from this ſin, and fly all occaſions and temptations there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto: for you are aſſured in God's word, that "drunkards ſhall not inherit the kingdom of God."</p>
               <p>I WILL proceed no further with this head of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, leſt ſome may be tempted to think me cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorious, in repreſenting too many vices as faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:013238_0073_0F90449B0CD85480"/>I wiſh I could ſay, There are no others nearly as much ſo, as theſe which I have mentioned: but from theſe, and all the reſt, I would hope my young hearers will keep themſelves, through the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining and aſſiſting grace of God.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. I WOULD adviſe you, my dear youths, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to beware of thoſe vices, to which youth is eſpecially prone. Men are moſt inclined to ſome particular ſins in one ſtage of life, and to others in another. Youth, middle age, and old age have their peculiar vices. It is incumbent upon you to be moſt upon your guard where your danger is greateſt: that is, againſt thoſe enormities, into which it may be feared your youthful blood will be apt to hurry you. Whatever you do, you muſt ſee that you "flee youthful luſts:" the apoſtle Paul thought it neceſſary to give this exhortation to young Timothy, tho' he was an eminently religious youth. You will not therefore be offended, if I think it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to urge the ſame upon you. And here,</p>
               <p n="1">1. THE ſins of uncleanneſs may be allowed to ſtand foremoſt in the catalogue of youthful luſts. Againſt theſe therefore, in every kind and degree, too abominable to bear a diſtinct mention, I muſt be allowed, with the greateſt zeal and concern, to warn you. Flatter not yourſelves that you are in no danger: for many who have thought themſelves as ſecure as the beſt of you can think yourſelves, have been overcome and deſtroyed by luſt.</p>
               <p>REMEMBER that theſe ſins are dangerous ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to your ſouls. You are therefore commanded
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:013238_0074_0F90449D289D85A0"/>to <q>abſtain from fleſhly luſts, which war againſt the ſoul.</q> Numberleſs young men have fell down wounded and ſlam by them.</p>
               <p>CONSIDER that your bodies, as well as your ſouls, are redeemed by the blood of Chriſt: and that your bodies are deſigned for "temples of the Holy Ghoſt." —You are therefore exhorted to <q>poſſeſs theſe veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels in ſanctification and honour. Know ye not,</q> ſaith the apoſtle Paul, <q>that your bodies are the members of Chriſt? Shall I then take the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſt, and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid.</q>
               </p>
               <p>IF you burn in the fire of luſt here, you ſhall burn in the fire of Hell hereafter, unleſs a deep and thorough repentance intervenes. God's word aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures you <q>that no whoremonger, nor unclean per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon—hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Chriſt, and of God:</q> and that <q>for theſe things ſake, cometh the wrath of God upon the children of diſobedience.</q>
               </p>
               <p>As you would ſhun all groſs acts of uncleanneſs, be upon your guard againſt every thing that leads thereunto. Avoid that "filthineſs" of converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, "fooliſh talking," and obſcene <q>jeſting, which is not convenient;</q> and which is condemned by the apoſtle as unfit, becauſe it kindles the fire of luſt, and leads perſons to acts of uncleanneſs.</p>
               <p>ESPECIALLY avoid, as you would avoid the worſt contagion, the company of perſons of light converſation, and juſtly ſuſpected virtue. Fly from the lap of Delilah. <q>Her feet go down to the
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:013238_0075_0F90449D5BF253D0"/>dead,</q> as the wiſe king Solomon tells you, <q>and her ſteps take hold on hell:—her houſe is the way to hell, leading down to the chambers of death:—the dead are there, and her gueſts are in the depths of hell.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. LET me intreat you to guard againſt that ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reverence towards parents, and other ſuperiours, which young men are too apt to fall into. Youth is commonly a great deal too forward, aſſuming, ſelf-conceited, and ready to deſpiſe their ſuperiours in age and ſtation; and accordingly to treat them with diſreſpect. You are not to imagine irreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence towards ſuperiours a venial fault: for it is a downright piece of immorality, and rebellion againſt God. It is contrary to reaſon, and nature. The fifth commandment forbids it, ſaying, <q>Honour thy father and thy mother.</q> Only parents are inſtanced in the command; but, as the decalogue comprehends the whole ſyſtem of morality, ſo this command muſt be underſtood to require all that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, honour, and reſpect which we owe to our ſuperiours, whether parents or others. If you would do your duty in this reſpect, conſider the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon God has annexed to the command; namely, <q>that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.</q> So that you ſee, if you honour your ſuperiours, you may hope for long life, and proſperity in the world, ſo far as it ſhall be for the glory of God and your own good. But in caſe you do contrary to this duty, you are underſtood to be threatened with the contrary of
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:013238_0076_0F90449E558E8A18"/>this promiſe; namely, to be cut off by an untimely death. And this you are the rather to fear, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of a remarkable inſtance of it, that you find on ſacred record; of a company of children who were devoured by wild beaſts, becauſe they mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a prophet of the Lord, ſaying, <q>Go up thou bald-head, go up thou bald-head.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. As the volatility of youth often makes them averſe to cloſe application; to diligent employment, either of the head or hands; you ſhould be ſure to be upon your guard againſt idleneſs. Idleneſs will not only hurt your temporal intereſt; but it will be the greateſt enemy of your ſouls. If you do not keep out of idleneſs, you will not keep clear of ſin: for the bare waſting of your precious time is a ſin that you muſt give a ſtrict account of in the day of judgment. And idleneſs will expoſe you to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs temptations. He that is idle has nothing to do, but to ſerve Satan: and if you are idle, he will ſoon employ you in his buſineſs. Keep yourſelves therefore diligently employed, in doing ſomething or other for your ſouls or bodies; for the good of yourſelves, or your fellow-creatures. This will be for your honour and your intereſt; and it will be an hopeful means of making you ſober and religious.</p>
               <p n="4">4. BEWARE of angry reſentments, and revenge. Youthful blood is generally too apt to be thrown into a ferment, on receiving an affront, or any real or ſuppoſed injury. You cannot be ſober-minded ſo long as your angry paſſions have the dominion over you, and the guidance of your conduct. This
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:013238_0077_0F90449ED37771B8"/>is as oppoſite to it as any thing can be. True Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian ſobriety very much conſiſts in the government of the paſſions, not only the concupiſcible, but the iraſcible.</p>
               <p>TO indulge anger againſt your fellow-creatures, is the way to make yourſelves very unhappy at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: not only as it is an uneaſy and painful agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſpirits, but as it is apt to hurry men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the perpetration of raſh and violent deeds, which make work for a bitter repentance.</p>
               <p>INDULGED anger gratifies your grand adverſary, and gives him great advantage againſt you. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you are thus exhorted, <q>Let not the ſun go down upon your wrath, neither give place to the Devil.</q> Inſtead of ſuffering anger to rankle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hatred, you ſhould take care to make up all dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences ſpeedily. To perſwade you hereunto, you ſhould often conſider how contrary anger and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge are to the example of your Saviour, which you are bound to follow; <q>who, when he was reviled, reviled not again, but ſubmitted himſelf to him that judgeth righteouſly;</q> and who poured out his dying breath, in apologizing and praying for the forgiveneſs of his blood-thirſty perſecutors.</p>
               <p>YOU ſhould alſo remember how contrary theſe paſſions are to the ſpirit, and genius of Chriſt's Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; in which you are commanded <q>not to reſiſt evil; but to overcome evil with good,</q> with kind and charitable deeds: to "love your enemies" to ſuch a degree as to "feed" them, when they are
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:013238_0078_0F90449F89C05E50"/>"hungry," and to "clothe" them, when they are "naked;" to ſtand ready to do good, at all times, "to them that hate you;" and to "pray" for the beſt of heaven's bleſſings, even pardon, grace and glory, to be beſtowed upon <q>them that deſpitefully uſe you, and perſecute you.</q>
               </p>
               <p>LET me remind you, that <q>a meek and quiet ſpirit is, in the ſight of God, of ſo great price,</q> that he will not diſpenſe with the want of it. If you do not ſhew "mercy" to your fellow-creatures, you will "have judgment without mercy" from God. <q>If you forgive not men their treſpaſſes, neither will your father which is in heaven for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give your treſpaſſes.</q>
               </p>
               <p>LASTLY, Avoid ſinful ambition: for it is one of the moſt deſtructive things to your preſent happineſs, as well as an effectual bar in the way of your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming ſober-minded. I ſay ſinful ambition, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there are kinds and degrees of ambition, that are laudable and beneficial. But aſpiring after too high things in the world will make you continually diſcontented with your ſtation, let it be what it will: it will make ſlaves of you: it will prevent your uſing the means of grace with proper attention and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence: it will draw you into an imitation of the vices of the great; and it will make you ſtick at no kind of ſecret wickedneſs to advance yourſelves. If you love either preſent or future happineſs, avoid this luſt, and be ſatisfied with the ſtations, which God has allotted you in the world. Your ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſchemes, with which you are apt to amuſe your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:013238_0079_0F8FB552B11EBCD0"/>in your youth, will moſt probably be fruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated: but if you ſhould attain to the height of your wiſhes, you would not increaſe your happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by it. For he that is not contented with a middling ſtation, will not be ſatisfied with the higheſt.</p>
               <p>FOLLOW theſe directions, my young friends, if you deſire to attain to, and improve in Chriſtian ſobriety. Several more I propoſed to give you; but they muſt be left till another opportunity.</p>

               <p>IN the laſt diſcourſe I delivered upon this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, I began to give the young men of this congregation directions what methods to take, if they deſire to become ſober-minded, or heartily religious. I ſhewed them,</p>
               <list>
                  <item>I. THAT they muſt avoid evil company, and aſſociate with the virtuous.</item>
                  <item>II. THAT they muſt be conſtant and fervent in ſecret devotions.</item>
                  <item>III. THAT they muſt guard, as much as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, againſt faſhionable vices. And,</item>
                  <item>IV. That they muſt eſpecially beware of thoſe vices, to which youth is moſt prone.</item>
               </list>
               <p>THESE directions were given them, on the ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition that they were almoſt perſwaded to be Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians; or at leaſt, that they had begun to have ſome inclination to give themſelves up to the ſervice of God. If I may now have their ſerious attention, I ſhall cheerfully go on to give them ſome further directions, the obſervance of which will be of great advantage to their ſpiritual intereſt.</p>
               <p>The next thing is,</p>

V. To direct you to beware of enthuſiaſm. By enthuſiaſm I would be underſtood to mean, the fervour of an over-heated and extravagant imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, miſtaken, either for divine revelation, or an extraordinary intercourſe with the ſpirit of God. Enthuſiaſm, in this ſenſe, will be allowed by all, to be an enemy to religion. And I am ſure, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be more inconſiſtent with internal ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety. As it conſiſts in the irregularity of the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, it is intemperance; and as it is miſtaken for miraculous communications from heaven, it is of a very dangerous tendency. For perſons of an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſtick turn are in danger of placing religion, almoſt entirely, in extacies and rapturous feelings, in high flights of the imagination and ebullitions of the paſſions. The conſequences of which are, that they overlook and neglect the eſſentials of Chriſtianity, which mainly conſiſt in uniform, prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical godlineſs, or evangelical obedience; are ready to fall into deſpair, when they are moſt calm and compoſed, becauſe they cannot find thoſe agitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſpirit in themſelves, in which they imagine religion conſiſts: and are apt to condemn all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as carnal and unconverted, who have not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced their irregular flights; and ſo become wanting in that charity, which it is the principle deſign of religion to promote.</p>
               <p>THIS diſtemper of mind is oftentimes miſtaken for holy zeal: and the moſt zealous perſons, other things being equal, perhaps are the moſt likely to run into it. True zeal is an important virtue;
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:013238_0083_0F9044A22050FAD0"/>and it is impoſſible to be too zealouſly engaged in religion, ſo long as our zeal is guided and tempered with prudence. But enthuſiaſm is ſo hurtful an excreſcence of religion, that you have need to be upon your guard againſt it.</p>
               <p>YOUNG perſons, under their firſt religious awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, are more in danger of this, than any other ſort of perſons: for they have not much religious knowledge to ballaſt their minds; and they have ſtrong paſſions, which like too much ſail, hurry them into this vortex, and into many extravagances and dangers. If any of you, my young friends, are now juſt beginning to be religious, be watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful even over thoſe motions of your hearts, which ſeem to be religious ones; leſt through the artifice of Satan, who can transform himſelf <q>into an angel of light,</q> you fall into wild and viſionary frames; which may make your caſe worſe than it was before. You ſhould bring all your opinions, your impreſſions and ſuggeſtions to the touchſtone, "to the law and to the teſtimony;" and not raſhly take it for granted, that you are ſo guided by the Holy Ghoſt that you cannot err.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. THE next error I would warn you againſt, is ſpiritual pride: which is nearly related to enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſm, and often attends it.</p>
               <p>WHEN you have formed ſome good reſolutions; and in any meaſure, have reformed your careleſs and vitious lives; the next thing that Satan will endeavour to tempt you to, will be to draw up an haſty concluſion that you are ſavingly converted: That ſo you may give over your endeavours, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:013238_0084_0F9044A29F5DB578"/>that all is well with you; ſo much better than the ſtate of others, that you may be puffed up with pride. Spiritual pride is oppoſed in holy writ, to ſobriety; therefore I may pertinently here warn you againſt it, in the language of Paul to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans; <q>not to think more highly of yourſelves, than you ought to think; but to think ſoberly.</q>
               </p>
               <p>WHILE you are in an unrenewed ſtate, I ſuppoſe it is hardly poſſible for you to have too low an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of your own goodneſs. For you are odious and deteſtable in the ſight of God, and more vile than the beaſts that periſh. God compares ſinners to the moſt loathſome and deteſted things in nature; and the more conformable your opinion is to his, the more juſt it is. Therefore you ſhould "abhor" yourſelves, "and repent in duſt and aſhes;" con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing that you deſerve no good, but every evil at the hand of God.</p>
               <p>AND after you find that you are renewed, you muſt ſtill "put on humbleneſs, of mind." For you may then well ſay "what have we that we did not receive? Surely it is no reaſon why you ſhould value yourſelves highly, that you have received more undeſerved mercy than others; but on the contrary, the poſſeſſion of ſuch gifts is, in reaſon, a conſtant call to humility and ſelf-abaſement. The apoſtle Paul ſays to ſome who were too much elated, on account of ſome ſpiritual advantages, <q>who maketh thee to differ from another? And what haſt thou that thou didſt not receive? Now if thou didſt receive it, why doſt thou glory as if thou hadſt not received it.</q> Since it is <q>by the
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:013238_0085_0F9044A6C15602B0"/>grace of God,</q> that his children are what they are, they are ſhut out from all boaſting, and ought to entertain a low opinion of their own worthineſs, even although they had got nearer to perfection, than ever any did before.</p>
               <p>BUT another reaſon for humility is, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the grace of God that may appear in you, you are far from a total conformity to the will and law of God. Your falls into ſin are ſo frequent, after the great change is wrought, and your defects in duty ſo many and great, that you may well ſay with David, <q>if thou Lord ſhouldeſt mark iniquities; O Lord, who ſhall ſtand?</q> A ſenſe of theſe things ſhould keep you ſo low in your ſelf-eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as to direct the eye of your faith in Chriſt, and make you truſt in his merit and worthineſs, for acceptance with God.</p>
               <p>YOU are chargeable with ſpiritual pride, when you are inſenſible of, and unhumbled for your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects in duty; when you aſſume to yourſelves the honour of what is gracious in you; and when you think you are poſſeſſed of more goodneſs than you really are. Againſt all which you cannot be too much upon your guard; for pride is a ſin that ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily beſets moſt men; and none are more in danger of it than young perſons, who have juſt begun to be religious. This made the apoſtle give that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection to Timothy, concerning the appointment of a biſhop, <q>not a novice, leſt being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the Devil.</q>
               </p>
               <p>LET your ſeriouſneſs, and religious improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments be what they may, in early youth, it would
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:013238_0086_0F9044A81A8D41A8"/>be beſt for you to conſider yourſelves as but babes in Chriſt; that ſo you may not grow indolent and inactive in the work of God, being ſwollen with a fond conceit of your high attainments: But <q>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting thoſe things that are behind, and reaching forth unto thoſe things which are before, preſs</q> forward, as the apoſtle did, <q>toward the mark, for the prize of the high calling of God in Chriſt Jeſus.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="12">VII. IF you would obtain and cultivate true ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berneſs of mind, let me adviſe you to give your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves much to reading.</p>
               <p>READING is abſolutely neceſſary for the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of young minds; and eſpecially to ſtore them with a neceſſary fund of religious knowledge. The apoſtolick advice to young Timothy was to give himſelf, among other things, "to reading." It is not only needful for a young miniſter as Timothy was; but more or leſs ſo for every young Chriſtian, let him be in ever ſo private a ſtation. For they who wholly neglect it are found to be deplorably ignorant of things that concern their ſalvation.</p>
               <p>THERE are none of you, my young friends, but have ſome leiſure for this profitable exerciſe: at leaſt upon the Lords's days, and during ſome other intermiſſions of buſineſs and labour.</p>
               <p>I DO not mean to encourage you to read all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of books that come to hand, whether good or bad. There are many extant, conſiſting of profane and obſcene plays and romances, or looſe poems and ſongs; the reading of which tend to corrupt, vitiate and deſtroy young perſons; and the publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them has done infinite miſchief in the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="unknown:013238_0087_0F9044A881F41F40"/>
IT may be well for thoſe of you who have much leiſure, to read hiſtory, civil and eccleſiaſtical; and ſome books that treat on the various arts and ſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; eſpecially on thoſe which will be moſt likely to be beneficial to you, and fit you to ſerve your ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration the better, in your particular ſtations of life.</p>
               <p>BUT thoſe of you who have little leiſure, had better confine your reading chiefly to books on di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and religious ſubjects. And among theſe, it will not be beſt to ſpend much of your time on thoſe which are controverſial; unleſs you had time to read, and judgment to canvaſs all that is ſaid on both ſides of the queſtion. I accept only thoſe controverted points immediately relating to practice, of which you ſhall not be ignorant, and concerning which you muſt be determined.</p>
               <p>BOOKS of practical divinity ſhould chiefly take up your attention, which teach you how to demean yourſelves towards God and man, and which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct, aſſiſt and excite you to the performance of your duty as Chriſtians. Among theſe I would heartily recommend to you the writings of Baxter, Doddridge and Watts, which ſeem to me to breathe the true ſpirit of primitive Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p>BUT after all, the holy bible muſt be your prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal book of devotion. Other books may poſſibly miſlead you, as all uninſpired writers are infallible.— The bible is, by way of eminence, the book of knowledge. It is able to inſtruct you to the beſt purpoſes. Be obedient therefore to your Saviour's command, who bids you <q>ſearch the ſcriptures daily.</q> If you neglect it, you will be inexcuſably
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:013238_0088_0F9044AA6C339510"/>guilty. God has been at great expenſe, if I may ſpeak ſo, to give and confirm to you the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Will you then be ſo ingrateful, as not to ſtudy them diligently? Unleſs St. Paul was miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, <q>they are able to make you wiſe unto ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, through faith in Chriſt.</q> They ſhew you how you may obtain everlaſting bleſſedneſs; ſo that I may ſay, God is infinitely merciful in giving them to you, and they are of inconceivably great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to you. How unwiſe for yourſelves will you be, if you will not carefully peruſe the ſacred vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume? The bible will be loſt upon you, if you neglect the peruſal of it: for what good can it do you, until you find out what it contains? And how can you be acquainted with the contents of it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out frequent reading it. Your attendance on the preaching of the word, and your ſpiritual conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation with Chriſtians, will not be enough to make you knowing in the ſcriptures, unleſs reading be added. All theſe ways are no more than is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. Let no day then paſs over you, without your ſeriouſly and carefully reading ſome portion of God's word, with a view to the benefit of your precious ſouls.</p>
               <p>THERE is ſo much contained in the bible, that it will be neceſſary to give it your attention, for a long time, before you can be ſufficiently acquainted with it. You can hardly be expected to be <q>mighty in the ſcriptures,</q> in your youth; but you may be like Timothy, who <q>from a child knew the holy ſcriptures.</q> Though you cannot be expected to be thoroughly acquainted with the ſacred writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:013238_0089_0F9044AACCEDFB78"/>while you are very young, yet you may know as much of them as is indiſpenſably neceſſary to your ſalvation.</p>
               <p>AND now is the time that you ought, above all others, to abound in this ſtudy. The knowledge of your duty muſt be prior to the practice of it; for you cannot change the natural order of things. How can you know in what manner to employ yourſelves in God's ſervice, before you have learned from his word what it is that he requires of you? You are not to expect you ſhall be immediately in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired with religious knowledge, without any care or labour of your own. If God had deſigned to do this for you, he never would have inſpired holy men to write his will in the ſacred oracles. It is in the uſe of the ſcriptures that you are to look for ſupernatural illumination.</p>
               <p>BESIDES, youth is the happieſt and beſt time to ſtore your minds with all ſorts of uſeful knowledge. More eſpecially with religious knowledge, which muſt by no means be delayed; becauſe you know not how ſhort your time is. Your memories are more tenacious now, than they will be when you are advanced in years; and your minds are leſs taken up with the cares of the world, than it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable they will be, in the future ſtages of your lives. Upon theſe accounts, you have now the happieſt opportunity that ever you are likely to have, to puſh your enquiries in religious matters.</p>
               <p>BE perſuaded then to be conſtant and zealous in the ſtudy of your bibles. Attend to the ſenſe of what you read, as if it were for your life. It is
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:013238_0090_0F9044AB9BEB3398"/>more than for your life; it is for the life of your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſouls. Your daily bread is not of half the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to you, that it is to have your ſouls <q>nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed up,</q> as the apoſtle ſpeaks, <q>in the words of faith and good doctrine.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="8">VIII. YOU muſt be moderate, and bounded by religion, in your recreations.</p>
               <p>IF you are not ſo, you will not appear to be ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-minded. And to be much addicted to pleaſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and to fill up your lives with ſporting and gaiety, ſeems to be as diametrically contrary to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety as any thing can be.</p>
               <p>THERE are ſome kinds of paſtime and recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in uſe, which as Chriſtians, and indeed as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable creatures, you ought wholly to avoid. Such as are hurtful or dangerous to life, limbs, or health; and ſuch as are diſguſtful to the religious and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout: together with ſuch, the lawfulneſs of which appears to be doubtful, you ſhould keep yourſelves from intirely. You had better appear ſingular, and incur the reproaches and emnity of the gay part of the world, than uſe thoſe recreations which will be apt to offend weak conſciences; or give good men an ill opinion of you; or lay a foundation for doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in your own hands, whether you have been do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what God approves.</p>
               <p>As to what is called gaming, I muſt inſiſt upon your ſhunning it, in every kind and degree. For I cannot think it is agreeable to the mind of God, that men ſhould ſo trifle with the ſubſtance which he has given them, and intruſted them with as his ſtewards, to do good withal, as to riſk it, or any
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:013238_0091_0F9044AC48DEFF00"/>part of it, in a meer bet, or game. The time that is thrown away; the uneaſy paſſions that are often, and almoſt unavoidably excited by gaming, and other evils attending it, if duly conſidered by you, will be enough to convince you of the unlawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it.</p>
               <p>SOME gameſters comfort themſelves, that tho' deep gaming is unjuſtifiable, they never ſtake more than a trifle. But if this diverſion is ſinful in kind, as appears evident from what has been already hinted; it will follow, that it is as really wrong to play for ſhillings and ſix-pences as for farms and houſes. For both are trifling with the ſubſtance which God has given us, and both may be likely to excite uneaſy, wicked and dangerous fermentations of the ſpirits. Though the one is more wrong than the other, both are really ſo; and the loweſt degree of gaming tends to lead men on to the higheſt. If we once begin the practice, it is impoſſible for us to know where we ſhall end.</p>
               <p>I HAVE not been warning you, my young friends, againſt this kind of diverſion, becauſe I ſuppoſe you to be much guilty of it. I am thankful I know of none of you who are addicted hereunto; and I hope once warning will be ſufficient to guard you againſt all the temptations and enticements to gaming, that you may meet with hereafter.</p>
               <p>THERE is a plenty of other recreations for you, which are confeſſedly harmleſs: and far be it from me to debar you, if I could, from all of every kind. But even in the moſt innocent, you muſt be cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned againſt exceſs; becauſe in the moſt innocent
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:013238_0092_0F9044AD2549B720"/>exceſs is criminal. Your recreations will be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive, when you ſpend too much precious time in them; when they indiſpoſe you for the duties of religion; when they are ſo expenſive, as perſons of your ſtation cannot well afford; when they diſable you to pay your juſt debts, and hinder your doing good to the poor and diſtreſſed; and when they engage too much of your attention and zeal, and keep out good meditations. They will alſo be exceſſive, if you uſe them any farther than is bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial to refreſh and invigorate your powers, and fit you to do the moſt poſſible ſervice for God and your generation. If you pretend to be ſerious Chriſtians, you muſt <q>rejoice as though you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiced not;</q> be very moderate in your diverſions; not abounding much in them, nor ſetting your hearts upon them; but making them ſubſervient to the glory of God, and your own moſt important intereſts.</p>
               <p>THAT you may perſuade yourſelves to uſe a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable moderation in your recreations, you ſhould conſider, that you muſt ſhortly give an account, at the bar of Chriſt, how you have ſpent every hour of your time; what unlawful recreations you have uſed, and how you have exceeded your limits in all the reſt. Thoſe words of inſpiration ſhould be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways freſh in your memories, to regulate your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct in theſe reſpects; <q>rejoice, O young man, in thy youth, and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thy heart, and in the ſight of thine eyes: but know thou, that for all theſe things God will bring thee into judgment.</q> You ſhould indulge to pleaſure no
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:013238_0093_0F9044ADC7F7A088"/>farther, than your conſciences tell you that you ſhall be able to juſtify, at the tribunal of God.—God allows you to rejoice and be cheerful, in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of worldly good things. He allows young men, whoſe volatile minds cannot bear too long and cloſe an attention to ſevere duties and labours, a variety of pleaſures ſuited to their various taſtes; and in theſe they may indulge themſelves, ſo far as is conſiſtent with the rules of religion, and with that awful ſcrutiny which ſhall be paſſed upon all their actions, in the approaching day of judgment. But farther than this they are not permitted to go.—Be careful, then, O young men, to take your pleaſure no farther than conſiſts with the ſtricteſt regard to religion, and with an affecting view of the ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of future and eternal things. If you do this, I am ſure you will be very ſparing and moderate in your recreations. You will not, like too many of your ſtanding, live a life of pleaſuring and diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but your chief amuſements will be to go from one work and duty to another.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. I WOULD earneſtly exhort you to ſanctify the Chriſtian Sabbath.</p>
               <p>IT is very obſervable, that wherever the Lord's day is not ſtrictly obſerved, religion declines, and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs gains ground. And where will you find a very ſober-minded perſon, who allows himſelf in profaning this day? Or where will you find one of a contrary character, that pays any great regard to this holy time?</p>
               <p>I DO not mean to inſinuate that you ought to be tied up to Jewiſh ſtrictneſs, in the obſervation of
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:013238_0094_0F9044AE98734318"/>theſe days: among which people God made it a crime, puniſhable with death, to do ſome things on the Sabbath, which we call works of neceſſity; ſuch as picking up ſticks to kindle a fire, and the like. The Jewiſh ſeventh-day Sabbath is aboliſhed, and the Chriſtian firſt-day Sabbath introduced in its ſtead, by the founders of Chriſtianity; who ſet apart this day of the week, for holy and devout ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes; and by their example, have taught us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to exerciſe ourſelves in thoſe duties, which are immediately beneficial to our ſouls. As the former was to celebrate the creation of the world; ſo the latter is to celebrate the redemption of mankind, by the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; a no leſs wonderful work of God; a proof of the completion of which was, on this day of the week, exhibited to us in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of Chriſt from the dead. So that if it was fit and proper to keep the Jewiſh Sabbath holy, there can be no reaſon given, why the Chriſtian Sabbath ſhould not be kept holy alſo. The apoſtles and primitive Chriſtians were wont to aſſemble on the firſt day of the week, for religious exerciſes.— It is therefore a day to be ſo ſpent in holy exerciſes, as is moſt beneficial to us upon ſpiritual accounts.</p>
               <p>YOU muſt not therefore allow yourſelves in any worldly meditations, or diſcourſe, on this ſolemn and conſecrated day; unleſs it be in caſes of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity and mercy. Much leſs is it allowable for you to walk the ſtreets, or viſit your friends for recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, or amuſement. Leaſt of all is it lawful to ride in a journey, or to do any other of your ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary work, and worldly buſineſs, in this holy time,
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:013238_0095_0F9044AF5100D820"/>excepting in ſuch caſes as the before-mentioned.— Our Lord reminded the Jews, that mercy was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſacrifice, when he would abate their ſeverity, and over ſtrict regard to the Sabbath. But where this rule cannot be pertinently applied, you muſt keep yourſelves from all ſecular buſineſs.</p>
               <p>AND, on the other hand, you muſt fill up the whole time with publick and private exerciſes of religion. For though it is a day of reſt, it is not a day for idleneſs. You are to reſt from temporal buſineſs, that you may be employed in ſpiritual. While you are at home, your time ſhould be taken up with reading, religious meditation and prayer. And while you are at the houſe of God, your whole ſouls ſhould be engaged in the publick exerciſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> devotion. Eccl. v. 1. <q>Keep thy foot, when thou goeſt to the houſe of God, and be more ready to hear, than to give the ſacrifice of fools.</q> If you are inattentive, or indevout, you <q>offer the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of fools,</q> that is, "of the wicked," which you have reaſon to fear will be <q>abomination to the Lord.</q> You muſt neither dare to <q>forſake the aſſembling of yourſelves;</q> nor let your hearts wander, like "the eyes of a fool," to <q>the ends of the earth,</q> when you are preſent before the Lord.</p>
               <p>IF your friends and neighbours tempt you to profane the Sabbath, and though your ſeniors and ſuperiours ſhould ſet you the example, dare to be ſingular in this reſpect. Rather follow apoſtolick example, than "follow a multitude to do evil." Keep the laws of the land reſpecting the Sabbath, rather than follow a thoughtleſs multitude in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faning
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:013238_0096_0F9044B06DC861F8"/>it; for you are commanded to <q>ſubmit to every ordinance of man, for the Lord's ſake.</q> Tread in the ſteps of your pious anceſtors, in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Sabbath, and not in thoſe of the preſent apoſtatizing generation.</p>
               <p>THOUGH it may not be eaſy to determine exactly, with what degree of ſtrictneſs the Chriſtian Sabbath ought to be ſanctified; it is certain that ordinary labour and recreations are to be laid aſide, and the time employed in religious exerciſes; becauſe it is a day ſet apart for the worſhip of God, and the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of our ſouls. It is ſafer for you to deviate, in this caſe, towards ſuperſtition, than towards li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſs. For the more ſtrictly you obſerve and keep the day to holy purpoſes, the more uſeful it will be to you, and the more you will honour God in it. You never knew any upon a death-bed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of keeping the Sabbath too ſtrictly; but many have been heard to lament their profanation of it, and cry out againſt themſelves, for the miſpenſe of holy time.</p>
               <p>ALL the truly godly and ſerious lament to ſee how frequently the Lord's day is profaned among us. It lies much with you, my dear young friends, whether this day ſhall be leſs and leſs honoured, until it comes to be conſidered as common time; or whether the ſtrict obſervation of it ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived. Do that which, in your ſerious moments, you judge to be moſt for the advantage of religion, and the benefit of your own ſouls: this is all I aſk of you. If you will be perſuaded to do this, the Sabbath will be better ſpent for the future; and with
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:013238_0097_0F9044B0EC6E4868"/>the revival of Sabbath-keeping, you may expect to ſee a revival of religion and virtue among us.</p>
               <p n="10">X. IF you live wicked and careleſs lives, I muſt exhort you forthwith to break off all your ſins and vices, and engage in the practice of every duty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of you, from ſuch motives as you are at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent able to be influenced by.</p>
               <p>IT is not doubted but you are able to do this, by the aſſiſtance of common grace. And though this is not holy, evangelical obedience, it is evident to common ſenſe, that it is greatly preferable to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of duty and vitiouſneſs: and it is one of the means, in the uſe of which you may hope to attain to true holineſs of heart. Conſcience, as well as God's word requires this of you. <q>Ceaſe to do evil, learn to do well,</q> Iſa. i. 16. You ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways remember, it is better to do well, even from the loweſt principles, than to do evil from principles as low. If you do the former you will be leſs odious in the ſight of God, or more lovely, than if you do the latter. When a young man came to our Saviour, who was able to ſay he had kept all the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, though it is certain he was deſtitute of ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace, it is ſaid, <q>Jeſus beholding him, loved him,</q> Mark x. 21. Though he could not love him with ſuch complacency as he had in his true diſciples, yet he loved him more than he did profli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate ſinners. In like manner, you may hope God will love you, when he ſees you engaged in reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your lives, and keeping his commandments: And you will not then be ſo far from the kingdom of God, as you are at preſent. But you muſt take
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:013238_0098_0F9044B5D8004598"/>care, that you miſtake not this reformation for a ſaving change.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. BUT if you deſire to be heartily religious, you muſt make a ſolemn dedication of yourſelves to God, and lay hold on his covenant. You muſt become his indented ſervants, if you mean to be faithful ſervants.</p>
               <p>THE moſt of you were born of profeſſedly Chriſtian parents, which gave you a right to the covenant of grace. You had a federal holineſs by your birth, 1 Cor. vii. 14. Accordingly, you were publickly and ſolemnly devoted to God by baptiſm, in your infancy. This lays an obligation upon you to renounce the fleſh, the world and the Devil: and you ought early to recognize this obligation, by explicitly and openly devoting yourſelves to God, and engaging to live as your baptiſm obliges you, or as becomes the diſciples of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>CONSIDER how Chriſt requires you to "confeſs" him "before men;" and how he cautions you not to "deny" him, on pain of excluſion from heaven, Matth. x. 32, 33. Remember how the churches of Macedonia "gave themſelves firſt to the Lord," and then "unto" his people, "by the will of God." Think of St. Paul's words, <q>with the heart man believeth unto righteouſneſs, and with the mouth confeſſion is made unto ſalvation.</q> Conſider theſe things, and how all adults were required to profeſs their faith in Chriſt, before the apoſtles would initiate them into the church of Chriſt, and you will be convinced that God requires you to make an open profeſſion of Chriſtianity. The
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:013238_0099_0F9044B7C342ABC8"/>churches of this land have been convinced of it; and their practice is founded upon this conviction.</p>
               <p>THIS requiſition is not only ſcriptural, but evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently reaſonable; for how can you expect that your baptiſm will avail to entitle you to the bleſſings of the covenant of grace, when you was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to your own baptiſm, and will not declare that you take the obligation of it upon yourſelves. You are to fear that your baptiſm will become as no baptiſm to you, if you neglect, or refuſe to take the bonds of the covenant upon yourſelves, by your own voluntary act. If no adults are to be admitted into the viſible church, without an open confeſſion, as appears to be the caſe, from the acts of the apoſtles; does it not follow, that thoſe who are baptized in infancy ought to make this confeſſion, as ſoon as they are able to chooſe the religion of Chriſt, in order to their being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as regular members of his church?</p>
               <p>A PUBLICK profeſſion of Chriſtianity is not only ſcriptural and rational, but it will be greatly helpful to you, in promoting the intereſt of religion in your ſouls. When you ſhall have thus publickly and explicitly bound yourſelves, it may be expected that you will not dare to <q>go back, or alter the thing that is gone out of your lips.</q> It will help you to reſiſt temptations; for you will be able to ſay, when they beſet you, how can I comply conſiſtently with my ſolemn engagements to God, and to the church? You will alſo be more under the watch of your Chriſtian neighbours; and this will afford you a farther advantage for holineſs of life.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="98" facs="unknown:013238_0100_0F9044B91FC68968"/>
LET me entreat you, my young friends, as you have any deſire to ſerve God, thus to give up your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to God in covenant, now in your youth; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you can find in your hearts to come to the Lord's table at preſent, or not. If you are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of this duty, comply with it preſently, or give up your pretenſions to holineſs. For the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual neglect of any one known duty will be fatal to your ſouls. Either renounce all hopes of advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage from your baptiſm, or elſe own the obligations of the covenant which it ſeals.</p>
               <p>IT may be, that ſeveral of you are now ſaying within yourſelves, we would comply with this duty, if it were faſhionable for perſons of our ſtanding, and if we did not fear we ſhould be tho't ſingular. Is this then your caſe, that you fear men more than God? the worſt ſort of men, their blaſphemous banter and profane ridicule, more than the wrath of the King of kings? If ſo, you have need to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what your Saviour and Judge has told you, Matth. viii. 38. <q>Whoſoever ſhall be aſhamed of me, and of my words, in this adulterous and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful generation, of him alſo ſhall the Son of man be aſhamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father, with the holy angels.</q> This threatening ſhould come with the greater weight upon the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent generation, becauſe we can profeſs Chriſtianity, without hazarding our lives, or eſtates, or liberties. For if Chriſt will reject thoſe who did not dare to profeſs his name, in a time of perſecution, how much more will he reject thoſe who will not do it, when they can with ſafety? Will you then be able, in the
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:013238_0101_0F9044BB385E7B20"/>day of God, to hold up your heads, and ſay, <q>we would have confeſſed thee before men; but we were young and baſhful, and afraid of what the wickedeſt part of the world might think, or ſay of us?</q> If not, confeſs your faith in him now, in the moſt publick and explicit manner, while you have opportunity. The unfaſhionableneſs of it is no better reaſon for your neglecting it, than there being few to be ſaved is, why you ſhould refuſe to belong to that little flock.</p>
               <p>MISTAKE me not here, as though I were urging you to make a profeſſion of Chriſtianity, whether you can do it with ſincerity, or not. I would not be guilty of perſuading you to act ſuch a piece of hypocriſy, as to profeſs a religion you have not embraced in your hearts.—But what I would urge upon you is, to covenant with God firſt in private, and then nextly in publick. Conſider ſeriouſly how your duty and intereſt oblige you to make a ſolemn ſurrender of yourſelves to God in Chriſt. Revolve theſe things in your minds, until you find yourſelves inclined to renounce all your ſins, and to enter in earneſt, upon a courſe of piety and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obedience. Then in your cloſets, with all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible earneſtneſs and ſolemnity, addreſs yourſelves to God, in ſome ſuch expreſſions as theſe.—<q>I am heartily ſorry for all the ſins I have committed againſt thee, my beſt friend and benefactor; and for my careleſs and wicked neglect of my duty towards thee. Therefore I now devote myſelf to thy will and pleaſure, in all things. I heartily reſolve that I will love thee, and live to thee, by
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:013238_0102_0F9044BB6A8CAF58"/>the help of thy grace, as long as I live in the world. I chooſe thee as my eternal portion, and place my happineſs in the enjoyment of thee. I truſt in the merits of thy Son for pardon and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance with thee. I promiſe to walk in all thine ordinances blameleſs; and that I will give up myſelf henceforth to the guidance of thy bleſſed ſpirit; reſolving that it ſhall be my moſt delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful work to ſerve and glorify thee here below; and that it ſhall be my higheſt hope to enjoy thee forever hereafter.</q>—When you have thus devoted yourſelves to God in Chriſt, as I hope many of you have done already, you may ſafely make that public profeſſion of the Chriſtian religion, which is required of you. And let me remind you my friends, that if you neglect the one or the other, it is at the peril of your ſouls.—I look upon myſelf obliged, in faithfulneſs to God and to your ſouls, fully to preach this duty to you, though you ſo generally neglect it, that I have reaſon to fear I ſhall get little thanks from you for my pains. I am afraid I ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with but few of you, as you are ſo apt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to the cuſtoms of a vain and wicked world. But the day is coming when you will remember, with remorſe, how earneſtly I exhorted you to your duty;—and it is too probable that ſome among you will eternally lament that you did not take the advice I have now given you, agreeable to the word of God.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. AND laſtly, I muſt add one important piece of advice more to all young men who deſire to be ſober-minded: which is, that you forthwith
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:013238_0103_0F9044BC19FED8A0"/>examine yourſelves and diligently endeavour to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for taking the Lord's ſupper; that ſo you may honour Chriſt in your youth, by ſhewing forth his death in that holy ordinance; and at the ſame time promote the life of God in your ſouls.</p>
               <p>How do "the ways of Zion mourn," that ſo few "come to the ſolemn feaſt?" Is it not the ſhame of a Chriſtian ſociety, who pretend to be governed by goſpel-rules, that by far the greater part of them turn their backs upon this inſtitution, and neglect ſo eaſy a duty and ſo bleſſed a privilege, as to eat and drink in a devout and thankful remembrance of Chriſt? Shall it be ſaid, that they who are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der indiſpenſable obligations to remember the dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing love of their Redeemer, ſeem to chooſe to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get him, by avoiding an action which he has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to perform, on purpoſe to revive and continue the affecting remembrance of him? Shall creatures who owe all they have, are, and hope for to Chriſt, refuſe to obey a command of his, which is ſo plain and indiſputable?</p>
               <p>THE heavieſt part of this reproach falls upon you, our dear young men: for you, more generally than any other ſort of perſons among us, live in the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of this duty. What a diſgrace is it, that not ſo much as one in ten of you has ever yet obeyed this kind, and reaſonable command of your dear Saviour? And how ſad a thing is it to conſider, that thoſe of you who have any inclination to do it are deterred from it, by the idea of its being an uncommon thing, in perſons of your age?</p>
               <p>LET me perſuade you to a compliance with this
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:013238_0104_0F9044BCD54AA730"/>duty, and an acceptance of this privilege, by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the great utility of it, in aſſiſting you to cultivate holineſs of life; as it is only in this view that my ſubject leads me to conſider it. It is wiſely adapted to beget and promote ſeveral of the moſt important and neceſſary graces in you. As you have here the Lord <q>Jeſus evidently ſet forth as crucified</q> before your eyes; the bread repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting his body bruiſed and broken, and the wine his blood poured out for your redemption; you muſt be dreadfully ſtupid, if it does not warm you with love and gratitude towards him. So, if any thing can give you a lively ſenſe of the inexpreſſible evil of ſin, it muſt be to ſee, as it were, the Creator of the world enduring the tortures of a moſt cruel execution, to make atonement for it. And, if any thing can make you ſorry for your own ſins, give you an hatred of them, and make you abhor your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on account of them, it muſt be the ſight you may behold at the celebration of this ordinance.— Alſo, if any thing will induce you to renew your holy reſolutions, and put you upon the ſtricteſt watchfulneſs againſt all manner of temptations, it muſt be, one would think, your partaking of the ſymbols of the body and blood of Chriſt. If any thing, moreover, will ſerve to ſtrengthen your faith, it muſt be to have the principal object of it thus made familiar to you, by the help of ſenſible objects. Upon theſe and other accounts, an attendance on this ordinance will, through the bleſſing of God, be greatly helpful to your ſpiritual welfare. And are not theſe moſt weighty motives, to perſuade you to this duty?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="103" facs="unknown:013238_0105_0F9044BDA984F7A0"/>
YOU often ſay, and ſome of you ſay it with too little concern, you are not prepared to come to ſo ſolemn an ordinance. If this is true, I muſt tell you that you are certainly unprepared for death, judgment and eternity. And how dare you to live a day longer in ſuch a condition, when you know not but you drop to-day into everlaſting burnings? —But there is no abſolute need of a full aſſurance of your good eſtate, in order to your ſafely coming to the Lord's table. Examine yourſelves whether you live outwardly blameleſs and exemplary lives; whether you have gained a competent knowledge of the nature and deſign of this ordinance; and whether you have ſincerely and without any wilful reſerve, devoted yourſelves to the fear and ſervice of God, and have reſolved to accept of Chriſt, as the prophet, prieſt and king of your ſalvation. If you find that you have done, or do theſe things, you may ſafely approach the holy table; and you ſhould not dare to ſtay away any longer. In the uſe of this, and other means of grace, you may hope to obtain that aſſurance, which the beſt of you are now ready to complain of.</p>
               <p>THUS have I cautioned and directed thoſe of our young men who deſire to obtain, and improve in Chriſtian ſobriety, what courſes they muſt take.— The whole of which amounts to this, that they muſt uſe all the means of grace, and ſeek to God for his bleſſing upon them. Theſe are the only methods pointed out in ſcripture; and they are ſo hopeful methods, that men have need of no greater encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, to put them upon ſtriving after grace, than thoſe which God has annexed to them.</p>

AND may "the God of all grace" ſo open the hearts of my young friends, that they may attend diligently to theſe "things of their peace."—Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe even "Paul may plant, and Apollos water" in vain; how much more may I teach and exhort to no purpoſe? May he ſo diſpoſe them to uſe theſe inſtrumental duties, or means of holineſs; and ſo follow them with the effectual influences of his ſpirit, that they may not only obtain the renewal of their minds; but grow and increaſe in holineſs, until they ſhall receive the <q>end of their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation;</q> even the ſalvation of their ſouls with eternal glory.</p>
