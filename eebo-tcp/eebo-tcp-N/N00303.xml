            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

There are times when the Churches have rest, are edified, and multiplied: and there are times when iniquity abounds, and Persecution ariseth, and Gods People are scattered. What these times are into which we are now fallen is obvious to him that will not shut his eyes It is the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness of the true fearers of God, that he hath provided them consolations strong enough to hold up their heads above water when the waves rise

highest, and the raging billows make the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est noise. When the Earth and all in it will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford us no comfort, then heaven can. And as it is our wisdom to be laying up treasures beyond Death and the Grave, out of the reach of time and change, so it is our interest to be strengthening our faith, and corroborating our hope by such things as all the malice of Men and Devils can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pluck away from us. The time is coming when every mans foundation shall be tryed, he only that is built upon the Rock shall then stand. To be able in an evil day to sit still with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted courage and calm serenity upon our spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, is a great felicity: The only way to do this is to be able to trust in the Lord, and with all grounded confidence to rely upon his Power, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and fidelity: This is no common thing, but the priviledge only of a few, and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To be of this number is to be happy indeed: to know our selves so, is a beam of light so full of refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that nothing but heaven and glory can afford any more satisfying. Could we draw all the water out of this Well, it would make us
<pb facs="unknown:000380_0004_0FA502BDA7E63BC0"/>
to think our selves in Heaven before we come there. But the Well is deep, and our line too short, and bucket too shallow, whence they are but sips and small draughts we here obtain. Some of these you may possibly find in the ensuing discourse, And had my skill answered my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, and the excellency of the subject, hey had been far larger and more refreshing: Yet I trust (God affording his blessing with them) they may not be altogether fruitless: And, may they but perswade, either strangers, to labour af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter son-ship, or Children to be more comforted and strengthned to all patience, by the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their wonderful relation to the great God, I shall not have laboured in vain. Think not that I have hyperbolized in any particulars; no, the one half is not told you, nor can by the tongue of man here: and because I was not able to pourtray, I have but drawn a vail upon this glorious priviledge: think it to be infinitely more excellent than all that is said of it, and live ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly. Of the following Sermons, I shall only say thus much: They were (through grace) profitable to some in the preaching, whose desire and hopes of their being further profitable, if Printed, gave occasion to the Publication of
<pb facs="unknown:000380_0005_0FA502BE7AB1C5A8"/>
them, which that they may so be, and that the Author may be serviceable in his generation, to the glory of God, and good of Souls, your Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are earnestly requested to him from whom eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good and perfect gift descends.</p>

                  <p>NOt to seek far for the coherence of these Words, we may only take notice of thus much, that the Apostle having in the latter part of the foregoing Chapter, warned those he writes to of Antichrist; declared that there were many even at that time in the World, and given such a Character of them, as might se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="2" facs="unknown:000380_0007_0FA502BFE96DD1D8"/>
(further to quicken and encourage them so to do) he adds divers Arguments by way of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; one of which is taken from the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of their Adoption, presented and pressed in the three first verses of this Chapter in the urging of which Argument, he,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Presents it to their consideration as an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument and Demonstration of Gods inexpres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible love to them, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. <hi>Behold what manner of love</hi>; and such love requires great fidelity in those that partake in it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Obviates an Objection which might be framed against it: <hi>viz.</hi> if we are such, and so beloved, how is it then that we are so contemned and trampled upon by the World, as those that are of no value, but a meer off-scouring? he gives a satisfactory reason for this, because of the ignorance of the Men of the World, they know not God, and therefore they do not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge his Children: if they knew him, they could not but see his Image in them; but because they do not, therefore are they not competent Judges, nor are we to be discouraged though they reject and persecute us, <hi>ver.</hi> 1.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Asserts their Son-ship notwithstanding this: Text: wherein he tacitly insinuates that if we would make a true judgement of our stare, we must not then cal in sence to umpire it, but conclude according to the Rules of Faith.</p>
                  <p>Hence,</p>

Shews that the Sons of God are at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent under a disguise, and look not like them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, but withal hints that there is a time com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when they shall: Text.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Urgeth the hope of such a discovery or manifestation of the Sons of God as a sufficient Argument to press us to piety and purity, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. <hi>Every man that hath this hope in him,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>q. d.</hi> this hope hath enough in it to settle us and keep us from shaking.</p>
                  <p>The words of the Text are a fixt Conclusion against all the misgiving Objections of Flesh and Blood, establishing the truth of our present state of Adoption, without any doubting or questioning of it.</p>
                  <p>The Emphasis of the assertion lies in the word [Now] and it looks either backward to the words foregoing, or forward to these that follow: it stands between two dark Clouds, and scatters them both. He had told them of this great dignity, and glorious title, but sence seemed to contradict, and say,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If we are Sons, why then are we not known? are not the Children of a Prince ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by the Subjects? but the World tramples us into the dust, and persecutes us unto death, and would God suffer this, if he was our Father? well, saith he, they neither do know you nor him, and a Princes Son is of no repute with him that know him not from a Peasant, but
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:000380_0009_0FA502C16A932F68"/>
for all this you are Sons; and your Father knows you, though the World doth not, and that may satisfie you: But,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If we were Sons we should be in a more happy condition, whether the World knew it or no: but we live in the midst of sorrows and sufferings both of body and mind; we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compassed and almost overwhelmed with mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and is this the portion of Sons? do Kings wont to neglect their Children, and suffer them to live in misery? well, but still this shakes not the conclusion: for, although the happiness we are entituled unto, appears not as yet, yet now we are Sons, and there shall a time come, when we shall be made to look like such.</p>
                  <p>We may first take the assertion it self into our consideration, <hi>now are we the Sons of God,</hi> and from hence we may observe this;</p>
                  <p>Doct. <hi>The poorest and most despised Believers in the World are now the Sons of God.</hi> The Apostle speaks of such as had received the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ointing of the Spirit, <hi>Cap.</hi> 2.27. of such as had known the Father and believed on Christ, <hi>ver.</hi> 13, 14. and these are they whom he pronounceth owners of this happy title.</p>
                  <p>In the opening of this <hi>Doctrine</hi> we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider: 1. What is meant by being the Sons of God? 2. How we come to be his Sons? 3. What is the profit or advantage coming to

                     <hi>A.</hi> The Title of a Son is a title of Relation, and hath a Father for its correlate: God is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to assume this Relation to himself, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it between him and his Creatures, that so he may express his love and goodness to them, by such things as may carry, to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, the greatest evidence or demonstration; Father and Son among Men are relates standing very near one to another, and have such consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations and respects in them, as very nearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble that Covenant relation which there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and his People: Hence it is Anolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gically expressed: the same affections and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements that Fathers bear to their Sons, the same doth God to his People; the same interest that Children have in their Fathers love and care, the same have Believers in God.</p>
                  <p>Now among Men persons come to bear the denomination of Sons in two wayes; <hi>viz.</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by natural Generation, or voluntary Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption. After the former of these wayes God hath but one Son, begotten by an eternal and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>declarable Generation: after the latter he hath many Sons, <hi>even as many as believe in the Name of Christ,</hi> Joh. 1.12. So that by the Sons of God we are to understand all those of the Children of Men, who, by Gods free Adoption are made
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:000380_0011_0FA502C323693F20"/>
to bear the relation, title and priviledges of his Children. It is a word borrowed from the customs among Men, who when they Adopt one to be their Heir, do give him the title of their Son, and although it differ from that in two main points, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. That God was not put upon it thus to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopt any because of the deficiency or want of a natural Son, which is the main incentive to it among Men, that so they may have one to Heir their Estates: nor yet because his Son had given him any just provocation to reject and disinhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit him, for which Men do sometimes abdicate their own Children, and adopt a Stranger: No, God had an only begotten Son, in whom he placed his delight from all Eternity, who had never given him any displeasure in the least, but had afforded him everlasting satisfaction; yea, then when his Father put him upon the highest proof of filial obedience, calling him to do and die for sinful man, he cheerfully replied, <hi>Lo I come to do thy will Oh God:</hi> Psal. 40.7. this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption therefore was an effect of his abundant overflowing Grace, that it should be the good pleasure of his Holy Will to joyn poor Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers unto, and admit them to be made coheirs with Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.17. <hi>Joynt Heirs with Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That God doth not do it to make them inherit by way of succession, which is the case
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:000380_0012_0FA502C67A2CB340"/>
among men; and the ground and design of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Adoption, being because man is mortal, and must in a short time die, and leave all his earthly possessions and name behind him; hence, that they may have one to bear up the their name, and possess their livings, which they can no longer in person enjoy, they substitute one in their room: so that as long as the Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter lives, the adopted is kept out of possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and must be content to wait for his portion, till the other goes off, and is often in the mean while put to many and hard shifts: whereas God lives for ever, and yet Believers are not entituled to, but have actual participation in all the good things of God, according to their present state and capacity, immediately after their Adoption, and eternally. Men say, when I die you shall inherit, but Christ saith, <hi>because I live you shall live also.</hi> I say, although in these things it dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers (and evermore the antitype is something more glorious than the Type) yet in the main notions of Adoption they agree: <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. As that, so this makes an absolutely free choice of the subject: if men do, much more God may take a liberty to do with his own what he pleaseth: the Adopted could have laid no claim to his Title if it had not been freely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon him, he can give no other reason for it, but the good will of him who chose him unto it; if he had left him out, and named
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:000380_0013_0FA502C7C4C252A0"/>
another in his will, he could not have charged it as any wrong done unto him. Gods Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is an act of free Grace, and a discovery of his greatest love. Context <hi>ver.</hi> 1. <hi>Behold what manner of love,</hi> &amp;c. it is said there to be a love <hi>given,</hi> or <hi>bestowed,</hi> and how free it is will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. From the antiquity of the Foundation of it: it was founded in Gods eternal Decree, where we were chosen to this priviledge, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving predestinated us to the Adoption of Children in Jesus Christ,</hi> &amp;c. when the creature had no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and consequently could have no deserving more then the other possible Beings, or his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-creatures, who were left out of this Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, then God resolved upon it, and writ it down in his Book of life, who they were that should be his Children and Heirs: then he took down their Names, and wrote them for the inheritance of Glory.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. From the condition of those who are made partakers in this Grace, at such time as they are admitted unto it: Adoption came in upon effectual vocation; and when God comes to call sinn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> home to himself, he finds them strangers from God, and from the Covenant, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.12. <hi>at that time ye were aliens from the Common-wealth of Israel, and strangers from the Covenant of promise</hi>: they were also worthless creatures; they must all say as the returning
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:000380_0014_0FA502C82821DD60"/>
Prodigal, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15.21. <hi>I am no more worthy to be called thy Son,</hi> they have nothing in them to render them more amiable or desirable in the eyes of God, when God looks on them with an eye of Fatherly pity, he finds them rowling and wallowing in their own blood, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.5. <hi>When thou wast in thy Blood, I said unto thee live.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. From the meritorious and procuring cause of this Adoption <hi>viz.</hi> the Redemption of Jesus Christ: for although Christ did not merit that God should purpose to Adopt us; Gods Decree being absolutely and every way free, and the Redemption of Christ being a part, and not a meritorious cause of that Decree; yet Christ merited our actual Adoption for us: it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reckoned among the fruits of his Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4..4, 5. <hi>God sent his Son to redeem, that we might receive the Adoption of Sons</hi>: had man had any desert of his own, yea had he not been laden with indesert, there had not needed the intervention of the great price paid for his ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some from the Law, before he could be actually made a Child.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. From the way in which it comes, <hi>viz.</hi> by receiving Christ, and believing on him, <hi>John</hi> 1.12. <hi>As many as received him to them he gave power</hi> (or priviledge) <hi>to become the Sons of God, even to as many as believed on his Name.</hi> Now Faith it self is a free gift, and every part of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:000380_0015_0FA502C8E6FB9D40"/>
that comes with it, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.8, 9. <hi>By Grace are ye saved through Faith, and that not of your selves, it is the gift of God</hi>: yea the very or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining and ordering of Gospel priviledges to be introduced by Faith, is on purpose for the declaration of Gods free Grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.4, 5.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As that, so this bestows the Relation and Title of a Child: he hath both the denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and propriety of a Child in respect to the person adopting of him: see the words of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> concerning <hi>Manasseh</hi> and <hi>Ephraim,</hi> Gen. 48.5. <hi>as Reuben and Simeon they shall be mine</hi>: he bears the Adopters name, and hath from him such affections as if he were his own Child: thus are Believers; the Name of God is called upon them, and they have the condition no longer of Enemies, nor yet of Servants, but of Children, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.7. <hi>Wherefore thou art no longer a Servant, but a Son.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. As that, so this gives to him that is adopted the priviledges of a Son by natural Generation: what such an one may chalenge as his Birth-right, the same may this person chalenge by vertue of this choice: Believers have not a bare empty Title, but a Title which brings benefit along with it to him that receiveth it: they have all the priviledges, immunities, and advantages which belong to such a Relation, as far as they are capable, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.17. <hi>Joynt heirs with Christ,</hi> Gal. 4.7. <hi>If a Son then an Heir of God through

Christ.</hi> What these are will follow afterwards.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>How we come to be his Sons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> That we are his by Adoption we heard in the former: here therefore we are to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the way in which we are brought to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take in this Adoption: for although this (as eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry other Grace) is rooted in the Decree of God yet it is communicated to us in his special Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, andparticularly in the work of Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. Here therefore let us observe in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, that when God bestows the Grace of Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption upon any, he doth, in order to it, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with it, put the heart of a Son into him; which is more than Men can do for such as they chuse, who can do no more then express their kindness to them in external things, and in this respect, although, to express the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Relation which Christ, and which Believers have unto God, it is represented under the notion of Adoption; for Believers are not, as Christ is, his Sons by eternal Generation; yet as to the way in which they are brought to a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation in this priviledge, it is resembled by natural Generation, whence they are not only said to be Adopted by, but also to be born of God, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.4. <hi>Whatsoever is born of God,</hi> John 1.13. <hi>Which were born</hi>: to <hi>be</hi> begotten, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.18. <hi>Of his own Will he begat us</hi>: and this is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Regeneration or the new-birth, <hi>John</hi> 3.3. <hi>Except a Man be born again,</hi> which, how it is
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:000380_0017_0FA502CA831F4D18"/>
wrought, the Apostle briefly tells us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.26. <hi>Ye are all the Children of God by Faith in Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi>: and we may take up a guess at it in these three particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Our Son-ship is properly an act of our Communion or Fellowship with Christ: hence we are said to be <hi>joynt Heirs with him,</hi> Rom. 8.17. and it must needs be so, for he was firstly appointed by his Father to be <hi>Heir of all things, Heb.</hi> 1.2. Now, inasmuch as the whole Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is his by his Fathers donation; hence if we do inherit, it must needs be in partnership with him: the Title of Sons and Heirs doth not pass from him to us, by way of alienation, in ceaseth not to be his by becoming ours, and therefore it must needs be in a way of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Our union with Christ is the true and proper ground of our Communion with him in all his benefits: the Title can in no propriety of Speech be said to be both his and ours too; but as he and we are some way to be looked upon as one: and upon this account it is, that the Scripture also expresseth our Son-ship under the relation of our Marriage to Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so that by becoming his Spouse, in that way also we are made the Children of God: Hence that <hi>Hos.</hi> 2.19, 20. <hi>I will betroth thee to mee,</hi> &amp;c. and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2. <hi>I have espoused you to one Husband,</hi> which Relat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>on of Marriage, brings the party so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:000380_0018_0FA502CB6E92B6D8"/>
into actual Communion in all that belongs to the Husband.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This Union is the fruit and effect of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation: For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Faith is the Bond of this Union on our part: it is that whereby we give up our selves to Christ, and to him alone, utterly renouncing our interest and trust in all other things: it is that whereby we cleave unto him with full pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of heart, to be for him, and for no other: this is in the very nature of justifying Faith; and hence we shall find it frequently exprest in the Scripture under such phrases as these are, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that are synonimical.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This Faith is the true and proper product of the Spirit in our Regeneration: that which is begotten and brought forth in us, is Faith: all that is before it in the Soul, is onlie preparatory unto it; all that is concomitant with it, is deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated from it; all Grace in us, is called Faith in Scripture, because that is the principal Grace wrought in us. Gods Elect are by nature dead, but the Spirit quickens them, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. <hi>beginning.</hi> and how doth he so? why by causing them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve: for the life of Regeneration is properly a life of Faith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. <hi>I live by the Faith of the Son of God</hi>; so that when by the operation of the Spirit in him, a man is made to believe, he is then and not till then born of God, he is then also married to Christ: Christ marries with
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:000380_0019_0FA502CCCF34F1C0"/>
none that are dead; he finds them indeed spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually dead when he comes to them; but he first quickens them by his Grace, causing them to believe, and so to live, and as such he takes them into this nearness of relation to himself, and so they are together and at once born of God, and espoused to Jesus Christ.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. What is the profit and advantage coming by this Relation?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The Apostle <hi>John</hi> using it as a present Argument to engage us to constancy in times of Antichristian Tyrany, thereby intimates that it is a relation of infinite worth, and would have us therefore to consider of it, and take a large view of its worth and eminency; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there is so much in it as we may lose our selves in the contemplation: all the good which is wrapt up in the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>omise, is made over to, and becomes the propriety of the Believer in and by his Son-ship; I cannot rehearse all, but the choice advantages of Adoption are such as these that follow.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Name and Title it self is a great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit and advantage: it is a dignity, an honour, to be called the Children of God: the Apostle seems to place much weight upon the denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation it self, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. <hi>What manner of love, that we should be called the Sons of God? Jacob</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured <hi>Joseph's</hi> two eldest Sons, when he willed that his name should be called upon them; so
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:000380_0020_0FA502CD65E74710"/>
doth the great God the Children of Men, when he is pleased that his Name should come into their Title; that those who were before by way of Disgrace called <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sons, and Children of Hell, Children of Wrath, Children of the Devil, should rise, and be henceforth called the Children of God: this very Title declares these to be made noble by their new-birth, who by their natural birth were ignoble. It is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men accounted an high thing to be the Son of some King or Emperour, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.23. <hi>Seemeth it to you a light thing to be a Kings Son in law</hi>? what is it then for God to call us his Sons and Daughters, and to give us leave to call him our Father? as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.18, <hi>I will be to you a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and you shall be my Sons and Daughters saith the Lord God Almighty</hi>: and Jer. ult. 9. <hi>we are called by thy Name.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. They are taken into Gods Family, and that not as Servants but as Children, there to abide for ever, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.35. <hi>The Servant abideth not in the House for ever, but the Son abideth not for ever.</hi> Believers therefore are all one Houshold, called the <hi>Houshold of Faith,</hi> Gal 6.10. and they are of Gods Family after another manner then wicked Men and inferiour creatures: God after a more common way, and by a more general provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence looks after the World and all the affairs of it; all creatures come under his care, and for that reason the whole Creation is his great Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily:
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:000380_0021_0FA502D0FA658620"/>
but these Children are under his special inspection and care, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.7. <hi>Casting all your care upon him, for he careth for you.</hi> In sum, they being Children have him for a Father: And hence,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He will certainly provide for them, and they need not to puzzle their minds, or distract their thoughts about any such thing; for he will consider all their wants, and send them relief; they shall have whatsoever they stand in need of, and they shall have it as they need it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.31, 32. <hi>take no thought,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for the Heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knoweth that you have need of these things</hi>: if others in a Family suffer want, and be pincht with difficulties, yet the Children shall certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be taken care for, as long as there is any thing to be had: they are hard times indeed when Children are denied that which is needful for them: Hence that <hi>Psal.</hi> 34.10. <hi>Young Lions are brought to want, and suffer hunger, but they that fear the Lord shall want for no good thing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. He will protect them from all harms and injuries: and that both by defending of them from their Enemies, and also by righting of their wronged cause: and at all times, and in all cases whatsoever, they may with greatest safety, and without any fear leave it with him, and in it he will not leave him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5, 6. <hi>He hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee, so that we may boldly say, the Lord is my helper, and I will
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:000380_0022_0FA502D215DC40A0"/>
not fear.</hi> It is hard for earthly Parents to desert their Children, and when they see them wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, to hold their peace, and neither say, nor do any thing to right them: it is certain God will not, nay he cannot, <hi>Psal.</hi> 27.10. <hi>When my Father and my Mother forsake me then the Lord will take me up.</hi> Jer. 2.2. <hi>All that devour him shall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, evil shall come upon them saith the Lord,</hi> Zech. 2.8. <hi>He that toucheth you toucheth the apple of mine eye.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. He will uphold them from falling: he will take them by their hand, and stay their steps for them, sustein them, keep them from undoing themselves; hence those promises, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Ye are kept by the power of God,</hi> Psal. 91.11, 12. Gods Sons in this life are like little Children, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes tripping, and stumbling, and falling, and so weak that they could never get up again but for him: but by reason of his hand that is upon them, his everlasting Arm that is under them, hence if they fall at any time through incogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancy, or by stumbling at any thing that lies in their way, or through that weakness that attends them, or by Satans malice thrusting at them, he will lift them up again.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He will counsel and direct them: they are tender and foolish in themselves, they have not wisdom enough of their own to order and direct their way; and are therefore easily seduced and cheated by the adversary, who is subtle, and
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:000380_0023_0FA502D2B02A1018"/>
watcheth all advantages against: but he is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes giving them his Fatherly advice, warning them of their danger, shewing them a way how to escape it: they have the voice of his Spirit behind them, telling them this is the way, <hi>Isai.</hi> 30.21. they have the guidance of his most wife counsel to keep them in the right way unto glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>Psal.</hi> 74 24.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. He will assist and strengthen them, he will lend them an helping hand to carry them through all their difficulties, temptations, straits that they are engaged or involved in, in their Christian course, and the discharge of their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in all of them, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.17. <hi>The Lord was with me, and strengthened me</hi>: they have a great work to perform to serve God in their Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but his Grace standing by them, becomes their sufficiency: a Fathers love draws forth his helping hand, to assist his Son, and carry him well through all that is before him.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. He will Correct and Chasten them for their Faults. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.6. <hi>He chastneth every son whom He receiveth.</hi> They (like foolish Children) may now reckon this for their damage; but it is indeed none of the least of those benefits which the Children of God do enjoy. God lets wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men alone to go on in their pernicious wayes: They have their wills in the world, that they may be destroyed for ever: But God here afflicts his Children, that their souls may be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

in the day of the Lord, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.32. <hi>We are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. He will commend and encourage them when they do well: see what an high commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation he gives <hi>Abraham</hi> for his love, and what a precious promise he gives him upon it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.16, 17. the poorest services which they do, being done in sincerity to him, if it be but a cup of cold water given to one of his Disciples, in that Name, shall not lose its acceptance and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: yea such is his Fathers respect, that he owns and crowns the very good will, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses, as much as if they really performed them: <hi>David</hi> doth but resolve to build an House to his Name and Glory, and God takes it kindly, and promiseth richly upon it, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. these things belong unto them as they are Children in the Family, and carry Consolation in the very men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning of them.</p>

King, entituled to a Kingly estate: yea they are constituted Heirs of all things: God is theirs, Christ is theirs, the Throne and Crown that are prepared, and the exceeding eternal weight of Glory are theirs: and though for the present, during their nonage and minority here in this life, they seem but little different from servants to the observation of others, their Inheritance being as yet in reversion, and they mean while under manifold exercises of their graces, yet ere-long, when they are made perfect men in Christ, and (having finished the work set them to do in this World) shall be brought to take full pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of their own, it shall then be known what happy ones they are.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. For the evidence of the Doctrine, or wherein it appears that they are now the Sons of God, notwithstanding their present despicable condition: here take only two Conclusions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There is nothing in their present mean and despicable estate, but what is well enough consistent with their Sonship: though they are hated, despised, persecuted, afflicted, and every way as low and mean as is to be imagined: For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the World hates them is rather an evidence of their Sonship, than any Argument against it; as being an exercise, and discovery of that enmity which God hath put between the seed of the Serpent &amp; of the Woman. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, who is the Father of ungodly Men, is Gods
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:000380_0035_0FA502E11B48E4D0"/>
great Enemy, and the ringleader of Rebellion against him; and no wonder, since he cannot touch God in his Being, if Hell rise up against him, and oppose him in his Children: It is true that wicked men do not know them to be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the Children of God, <hi>for the world know us not,</hi> ver. 1. but they know them to be other kind of men from themselves, and for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son they hate and persecute them: our Saviour foretold his Disciples, that they must expect to meet this measure from the World, and gives the reason, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.22. <hi>Ye shall be hated of all men for my Name sake</hi>: it is for the profession which they make, and the glory of God which they are bound for, that they are hated and scorned in the World.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That God suffers the World to afflict and persecute them, denies not his fatherly care of them; for in this very thing he makes men and devils to serve them: there is no Saint that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was, or ever shall be a loser by all that Gods and his Enemies shall do against him: and that because what they intend for harm, God ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, by a powerful over-ruling providence, turns for their good: his Graces are hereby tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and made to shine forth, and that trial proves to be much better than that of God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.7. God hereby puts an advantage into his hands to glorifie him, and testifying his love and sincerity to him, in chearfully suffering all
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:000380_0036_0FA502E1A9E839C8"/>
things for his Name: and Faith at such a time, teacheth him to rejoyce that he may be counted worthy for this, so did the Apostles when scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged before the Council, <hi>Act.</hi> 5.41. and when wicked men have done their worst to the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, they do but prepare for them a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Chariot to ride home in tryumph to the City of God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That they are low and mean in the world is not because God loves wicked men better than he loves them, whom he suffers to flourish, and abound in all delights, to live at ease and die without bands; but because such a condition in this life is usually best for them: and still when they are most distressed, poor, and bare, they are his chosen, they are rich, because God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self is their portion, and a Kindom is prepared for them, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.6. as long as they are here they are from home; they are Strangers and Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims, and it is safest for them to be so, and still that remains to be a great truth, <hi>Psal.</hi> 37.16. <hi>A little that a righteous man hath, is better than the riches of many wicked</hi>: better because it is his own, and he hath it with Gods favour and love.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That God is often angry with them, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts them, and withdraws the light of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance from them, and puts them to grief, is not because he loves them not, but because it is that which their present condition requires: they
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:000380_0037_0FA502E2AB94D470"/>
are but Children, and childish, and foolish, and if they were not sometimes chastened, they would grow wanton, and careless of Duty: a Fathers love is evidenced as well in correcting a wanton child, as in providing for him: God doth it to shew his love, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.6. <hi>Whom he loves he corrects</hi>: he doth it for the saving of their Souls, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.32. <hi>Ye are judged of the Lord, that ye may not be condemned with the World</hi>: when the time comes, that all their sin is done away, then they shall sorrow no more: so that in all this way, how dark soever it seems to be, God is guiding them by counsel that he may bring them to glory.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In this mean and despised estate of theirs, God is pleased to be giving of them many te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies and clear evidences of their Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. As,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Their fellowship with Christ in his suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings: this was one thing that <hi>Paul</hi> desired to know, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.10. and this the Children of God do know, inasmuch as they suffer for his Name sake, and in his cause, and that the Name of God may be glorified in their sufferings; and also because he supplies them with patience and constancy therein, for that they do not disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him, and hereby they come to know that blessedness is theirs, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.12. <hi>Rejoyce and be glad, for great is your reward in Heaven; for so persecuted they the Prophets which were before you.</hi>

It may then teach us what a dangerous thing it is for any to go about to do them any injury or wrong The ignorant world seeing the Saints of God so low and despicable, to have so few friends here below to take part with them, and to be so poor and disregarded among men; they are hereupon ready to think they may do their pleasure against them, there is no danger is like to arise upon it, but they abide secure, though they slander, revile, persecute, and do them all manner of imaginable wrong: They have none to take in with them, none to plead their Cause for them, none to stand up in their defence: And be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

had better take a Bear by the tooth, a Lyon by the Paw, than meddle with that least, meanest, obscurest and most seeming contemptible Saint of Christ, to do him any their least injury. If an earthly Father see his Child abused or misus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a stranger, how will his fatherly affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on stir, his bowels boile, and put him upon it to vindicate that wrong? How much more will God do so for his Children, who are to him as the apple of his eye, and to whose mercys the bowels of most affectionate Parents are not to to be compared? God may possibly seem to wink and keep silence for the present, and men may take encouragement therefrom to vent their spite and malice, but he will not do so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, but a time shall come, and that quickly, when he will call them to an account for all, and a dreadful account it will be when it comes: God doth many times in this world testifie to his displeasure upon this very account, and there are several remarkable instances in Scripture of his severity upon the malicious adversaries of his Saints, enough to put a dread upon any such, would they but consider of it.

But supposing that they should escape here, (and God doth not alwayes presently let fall his hand upon the Persecutours of his People) yet is the time a coming, when the Persecutors of the Saints shall be made to know that they persecuted Christ, and shall find how hard a thing it is for them to kick against the pricks: when God shal render tribulation to the troublers of his Children, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1.6.

How eagerly do you grasp after the worlds honours? How pleasing are high titles to the Children of men? But lo! here is a title, against which if all the honours and gloryes which the world owns were set, they would weigh no more than the light dust in the ballance, and yet how cold and remiss are men in pursuing after it?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Consider how excellent a priviledge, how desireable a benefit this is. Believe it to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed an advantage; yea, ponder upon it, and see if it be not really so: enquire then, and say whither there be any thing that can come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the reach of your desires, that is not to be found included in it: For,</p>

Are the Children of earthly Princes accounted noble, and all respect shown to them? How honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble then are the Children of the great King, whose Dominion is an everlasting Dominion, and to whom all the Kings and Potentates in the world are Vassals? How excellent must they be that can claim the nearest relation to the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign of the whole world? that are able to call the everlasting Jehovah Father? this is an honour indeed, and he that hath it, may, with <hi>Moses</hi> trample on the highest gloryes of the world, and look upon them all with an eye of contempt. This honour have all his Saints.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Would you have Riches? and these the grasping desires of the sons of men are greatly carried after; this is the only way to come by them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.17. <hi>If Sons, then Heirs, heirs of God, and joynt heirs with Christ.</hi> And can a man be such an heir, and be poor? The things which this world calleth riches, are poor things, if com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with those which believers are made to possess: And if they count such men rich, who enjoy a small part of this earth (which is it self but a spot) and a few of the perishing things of this lower world, is not he then rich indeed, who

truly, and without vanity, call the whole world his own? what then shall we say of him who hath the wealth and treasures of two worlds to make use of, and a never failing title to them both? such you may be by Faith, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. <hi>Godliness hath the promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.</hi> You are now poor and in straits, plotting and toyling to vanquish this poverty of yours, turning every stone, and trying all conclusions, and all to little purpose; but there is no plot like unto this, it is a design that cannot miscarry; get Faith and you are owners of more than heart can wish.</p>
                  <p n="3">3: Would you have a free use of the Creature? and this well thought of might be a prevailing motive: Consider but upon what account un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate sinners stand in reference to all the good things of God which they do make use of, turning of them by their ill improvement of them, into so many treasuries of wrath and vengeance, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.5. So much as they do enjoy of God's goodness, so many witnesses there are against them, to accuse and condemn them before him: Every meals meat, every draught of drink, every garment which they wear, all the contentment that they enjoy in this life, will add to, and make their torments so much the greater in hell. With what trembling doth the awakened sinner eat and drink, and make use of all the comforts of life? and this because he now is made to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand

that in all he doth but encrease his guilt, and render his account more fearful. But lo, here is the way to be delivered from the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of these tormenting thoughts, and to be able truly to rejoyce in the goodness of God: Get Christ to be yours by faith, and then these will be no longer stollen comforts ending in bitterness, but you may be able to rejoyce in the Lord and in his goodness, having all coming to you as new Covenant mercyes, sanctified by the blood of Christ.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Would you enjoy Divine Protection? this I am sure you stand in need of, whose precious lives then are so many that seek to deprive you of who ly open every moment to so many op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing evils. Consider the world we live in, the awful dangers that are before us, and daily passing over our heads, the danger that we are continually obnoxious unto; the poor helpless state of man in himself: now to be left to your own care and keeping, to be turned out into the midst of so many evils alone, is a sad thing: But believe in Christ, and now are you the Sons of God, and then you are secure: They that harm you must first strike through his Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. Consider, <hi>Psal.</hi> 91. throughout, and what have you to say to all these things? Can you still strengthen your selves in unbelief? are you still unwilling to come to Christ, or do you begin to say, <hi>Happy they whom the King of Glory
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:000380_0047_0FA502ECEFCDBB60"/>
shall admit to this honour</hi>? Will Satan, will the World; yea, can they invest you with such a dignity? Is it not better to be a Child of God than a Child of the Devils? Do not then reject this so fairly proffered priviledge.</p>

                     <hi>USE.</hi> III. For Exhortation to believers: As this great Truth affords you encouragement and comfort, to think that though the World de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise and reject you, yet God owns you; though they count you abject and base, as the very off-scouring of the earth, yet that he looks upon you as his Children, having adopted you as his own, and put his Name upon you; so it may teach you these Lessons.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Love God with a filial affection: He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves your best love, who hath shewen you such love as this is: <hi>Context, vers.</hi> 1. <hi>Behold</hi>! It calls for attention, observation, and admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: <hi>What manner of love</hi>? It is a love which your hearts cannot comprehend, it is so great, so strange, that ever sinners should be taken so near to the great God: Let your love meet it:</p>
                  <p>Hence.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Love his Honour and Glory: Nothing can grieve a Child more than to see his Parents vilified, and hear them evil spoken of, and their names traduced: How then should it grieve the Children of God, to see and hear what woful dishonour is cast upon his glorious Name by the profane lives and speeches of wicked men?

this was <hi>David</hi>'s overwhelming grief, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.136. <hi>Rivers of tears run down mine eyes, because men keep not thy Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Love fellowship or communion with him: Love to draw near him in all those wayes in which he reveales himself, and holds correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with his own People: Take delight in Ordinances and spiritual Duties; value one day in the house of God better than a thousand else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where; be willing to go through all difficulties, and (if called to it) endure calamities that you may enjoy the presence of God: Get to be able sincerely to make <hi>David</hi>'s prosession, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119 136. <hi>Lord, I have loved the habitation of thine House, and the place where thine honour dwelleth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Love his Image wheresoever you see it: We look often and with great content upon the Pictures of those on whom our hearts are set: There are those here in the World that are more than Pictures; the Saints are living Images of the Lord, we may see in them, not only the lik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to, but the shining reflection of his commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated perfections: Hence we should love the Saints, as they are Gods Children, and our fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low brethren, so did <hi>David, Psal.</hi> 16.2. <hi>The Saints, in whom is all my delight.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. Love his commands: The dutiful Child loves that his father should be calling for his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and is glad at the heart when any thing that he doth can find acceptance and give con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tent:

How doth <hi>David</hi> love the law? He can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not express it, <hi>Psal.</hi> 110.96. How sweet and precious is it to him? <hi>Psal.</hi> 19.9, 10. Do not reckon it to be your burden, but your priviledge, that your heavenly Father will honour you so much (who needs it not) as to imploy you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout any thing for him: And though it be the meanest service, yet because it is for him, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it honourable: true love will stoop low to express it self to the beloved.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Serve God with a filial subjection: Its the Apostles counsel, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.14. <hi>As obedient Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, &amp;c.</hi> There is a great difference between the service of a Child, and that of a servant: Shew your selves the Children of God.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By hearkening unto him in whatsoever he hath to say unto you: How diligent should Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren be to listen whither their Parents call them or no? And what attention ought they to yeild unto them when they speak to, or command them in any matter? Eye God in his providences, consider what is his mind therein, hear the rod and him that hath appointed it; hearken to him in his word and make a particular application to your own souls of all those counsels and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions which are given in his Ordinances from one time to another.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. Readily embrace his will, and without grumbling or repining, go about every work of God which you are called unto chearfully: It
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:000380_0050_0FA502F26A1D4FA0"/>
is a note of great disobedience of heart, and a thing very grievous unto their Parents, when they see that their Children go about their doing of any thing that they are commanded with an ill will. How acceptable must it needs be unto God, when his Children do their duty so, as in the manner of their doing it, they make it to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that they take great satisfaction in it? Herein we shew our selves to be like Christ our elder Brother, who rejoyced to do his Fathers will, <hi>Psal.</hi> 40.7.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Endeavour in all things so to carry it that such as take notice of you may see and know whose Children you are: Bear alwayes about with you the Image of God, and labour after an evident representation of his perfections in your whole conversation, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. ult. <hi>Be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect.</hi> Remember that as there is a real, so there ought to be a manifest difference between the Children of God and the Children of the Devil, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.9. <hi>In this the Children of God are manifested.</hi> It is therefore your part to be alwayes shewing the difference; And to that end have a care of conforming your selves in the sinful and carnal courses and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms of the world. Be not afraid, no nor asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to run in a stream quite contrary to theirs. And for this be observant of the rules of Gods word, where you may learn to cleanse your way and regulate your lives sutable to your relation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="46" facs="unknown:000380_0051_0FA502F3B62CAED0"/>And hence,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Shew your selves the Children of God by an holy life and conversation, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.15, 16. <hi>As he that hath called you is holy, so be ye also holy, &amp;c.</hi> Live contrary to the worlds filthiness; they love to be wallowing in the mire of fleshly lust, to be polluting themselves with sin; do you abstain from the very appearance of any such thing: God is most holy, and he loves puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and hates filthiness, and when we do so to, and shew that we do so in our practical conversation, then do we shew our selves to be like him. It is a very great shame that the Sons of God should have fellowship with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitful works of darkness; that believers should be overtaken with the like excesses of riot, drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenness, wantonness, &amp;c. with unbelievers; this is a great disgrace to the high and honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble calling of the Children of God; holiness be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes his Saints, let then the shine of his Graces irradiat your loves.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By expressing an holy confidence in God in all the cases and concernments of your lives: In trouble, affliction, Persecution, distress, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to those cares and perplexities of the men of the world, which eat them up, and declare that they have no further to rely upon: we then honour God, and bring credit to Religion, when we can at all times cast our care upon him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in his power and promise in our sorest
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:000380_0052_0FA502F51625D0A8"/>
distress: thus did <hi>David</hi> when he was reduced to the greatest imaginable difficulties, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30.6. <hi>He encouraged himself in the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. By a constant application of your selves to God in all your cases: Children, especially lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Children in their minority, are to have their whole dependance upon their Parents, and so should Believers upon their God: When you are in any strait go to him, thus did <hi>Hezekiah, Isa.</hi> 38.14. <hi>I am oppressed, Lord undertake for me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. When you want any good thing, go to God for it, and no whither else, ask it of him, and not of a stranger: is it a great disparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to Parents, and they take it so, for their Children to go to other houses, to beg or steal to supply their wants, it is enough for Orphans, that have none to care for them, to do so. Have you a Father in Heaven, go then and tell him what it is that you need, he will consider of it; and if you do indeed need it, you shall have it; and if you have it not, you may certainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, it is because his wisdom sees that it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for you to be without it, you would take harm by it if he should gratifie you in it; it is for your good to want it, and therefore be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and do not seek to supply your selves out of his way, for as that would dishonour him, so you may be sure it shall not prosper.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When you suffer and are wronged by any,
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:000380_0053_0FA502F5271F2AD0"/>
content your selves now to go and tell him of it, and do not seek by any indirect course, or undue means to right your selves. It is the duty of Gods Children to leave all their wrongs and injuries to his righting of them, <hi>Psal.</hi> 10.14. <hi>The poor committeth himself unto thee.</hi> God looks upon the recompence of wrongs to be a preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of his soveraignty; and his Children have no reason to fear, but that he will plead their cause, and do them right.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Be alwayes strengthening and encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of your Faith in God, by the frequent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of your Adoption: Be much there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this contemplation, it affords plentiful and soul-satisfying encouragement to a Child of God in every condition that he can be reduced unto.

                  <p n="1">1. Have you not a Father in heaven, and will he not take care of you, or can he not supply you? What is it should give you reason to doubt of it?

Are not the Lillies gorgiously decked by him, and do not we see the Fowles of the air get a living? God doth all this for them, it is his love and care, and doth he not love you better? Such thoughts as these should quicken our Faith from day to day.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Have you not enough to live on? If not, I wish then that you had: Have you not Estates enough to maintein you? Is there not enough in heaven and earth to supply the wants of one poor creature? what if this earth should fail, and all these lower springs should be dryed up (and indeed they may so do, for these are waters that sometimes fail) yet still there is enough to be had in heaven: Is not an Almighty God suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to be your portion? Well then, draw up this conclusion with your selves, if this World will afford me nothing, if I can get no relief here below, yet I will go to heaven for it, and as long as my God and Father is there, I will not dispair.</p>

                  <p n="4">4. When your Sins appear before you with a terrible aspect, and Satan would make you af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to come before God by reason of them: When he represents him to your thoughts as a consuming fire as appearing in his wrath and displeasure, and would perswade you to believe there is no favour for you, that such sins, and so circumstanced as yours are, will find no remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Now reflect; but am I not still a Child? and if so, then I am sure, that though he cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect me (and I deserve it, nor will I refuse to submit my self patiently unto it) yet he cannot

take away his loving kindness from me: I will therefore appear before him, and take the blame and shame of my sins upon my self, and if he be angry, I will bear it because I have sinned: I will yeild my self to his pleasure, and receive his stroaks, and I know they shal be wounds which shal not kill, but heal my Soul: I will confess (and not cover) my sins, and so ly down before him, and let him say what he will unto me, I will still say, good is the word of the Lord, and if he be wroth with me for a little sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, I will wait till it be overpast, because I know assuredly that his love to me shal endure for ever.</p>

it? Did not my dearest Saviour comfort himself with this thought, when he drew near to a most cruel and bitter Death, yet he was going to his Father, and my Father? And am I unwilling to go to my Fathers House, to that Pallace and Court, where I (who have been a stranger all this while in a strange Country, going under a disguise, so as the World I live in knows me not, and therefore despiseth and persecuteth me) shall be set forth and adorned like the Child of a King? And what! Is it a thing so hard to bear, and that which should make me to draw back and fly from it? is to be stript out of these rags of mortality, this dirty defiled garment of flesh, and to receive in exchange for it those Princely Robes of Glory, and be made to appear in such Oriency and splendor, as will out-shine the light of the Sun in the firmament? And is this the thing I am so much afraid of? Is it this at which my thoughts do so much, start and give back? No, no, I will not fear, but make all the hast I can that I may in due season finish my work, and go home: The World is weary of me, and would gladly part with me; and I am as weary of it, and as willing to leave it: And were it not that I have a little work to do for the glory of my God and Father here, I could be content forthwith to be gone: Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, I am willing to tarry on his business, but when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

The Children of God have their joyes and ravishments here, and these strangers have no acquaintance with them.

To be meant of these, and that it is spoken, concerning ungodly men is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident, because he excepts Believers, <hi>vers.</hi> 10. <hi>But God hath revealed them to us by his Spirit.</hi> Those smiles of God's Countenance, those in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward supports of heart, that sweet communion which their Souls have with God in an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, in hearing the Word, at a Sacrament, in their Closets, on their knees powring out of their Prayers and tears into the bosom of their Father: Those holy transports are riddles, and matters of laughter and scorn to them, and if they know not what is, how should they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand that which is to come?</p>

                  <p>It is true,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Word of God hath said a great deal concerning their future Glory. There are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny high and towring expressions, to our appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension, used in the Scripture, worthy descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of that great City and the Inhabitants of it, and if we would study the Scripture more we might know more of it: But yet when we ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at the Kingdom and come once to see, and view, and experience it, we shal say as the Queen <hi>Sheba</hi> to <hi>Solomon,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 10.6, 7.</p>

and first fruits of this Glory here: They are made to tast of those Grapes of which the Wine is made in <hi>Canaan</hi>: They have not only their assurances, but also sometimes their exta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies: They are taken into the Mount, rapt up into the third Heaven, their souls are lifted up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the world, and all that is in it. God is pleased at some times to carry them out so farr in their meditations, and reveal so much of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self and his infinit love to their contemplation, that they are loth to come down, or to have any thing more to do with the sink and puddle of this world: They know so much of that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter state,, that when they are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p n="3">3. A full, clear, and manifest discovery of their happiness, is not made to any of God's People here: They that have seen most of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, while upon this earth, have seen it but in Landskip: They that have had the most ravish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tasts of the love of God, have but imperfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tasted it: All our knowledge, all our sight here is but in part, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.9. <hi>We know but in part.</hi> That which is perfect is yet to come,

The are but dawnings at the most which we have here: what those rayes will be, which shal beam forth from the Sun of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, in the mid-day splendour of Celestial Glory, we now cannot tell, but must be content to wait till we go thither where it is to be seen and enjoyed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For the ground of the <hi>Doctrine,</hi> or reason why it doth not yet appear.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. God makes it not known to the ungodly,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Lest they should be allured by it: All which they hear and enjoy here must therefore be Aenigmatical or obscure to them, lest they should be converted; it is an awful word, but Christ himself hath spoken it, who knew his Fathers, and his own mind and purpose, <hi>Mar.</hi> 4.11.12. <hi>To them that are without these things are done in parables,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Lest at any time they should be Converted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. That they may by Persecutions and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions try the Graces of his Children: There is great use and fruit in this tryal, it is more preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous than that of Gold: And God is pleased to use wicked men as instruments of the tryal: And hence they shall not know who these be, nor what their Glory is; for if they did, they would without doubt suspend, if not in love, yet in fear of them: Christ himself must come in a disguise that so the determined Counsel of God might be fulfilled in him: 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.7, 18. They
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:000380_0070_0FA50306669E2F48"/>
would else never have Crucified him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The reason also why the People of God themselves have no comprehensive discovery of their own future estate,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Because it is too big a sight for their weak eyes to gaze upon: They must be prepared for their Glory, as well as their Glory for them, or else it would swallow them up, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.23.</p>
                  <p>Hence,</p>
                  <p>When Christ is upon the one work in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the Spirit of Christ is on the other he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e. Should a full description of that state be given us, it must be in a Language which we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand not. They are but dark similitudes, dim and dull comparisons, accommodated to our own weak capacity, which the Scripture af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords: The words which <hi>Paul</hi> then heard, when he was in the third Heaven, were ineffable words, and such as were not lawful to utter, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.4. Not unlawful, because forbidden by any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, but because they did out-bid his ability. If the Glory to be revealed, should now be reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us in this our imperfect state, it would o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver oppress and sink us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That they may with more patience abide the time allotted them here, and serve there Generation in the doing of that work which God hath set out for them to do before they go to be possessed of this Glory.

                  <p>
                     <hi>USE,</hi> I. For informations learn we from Hence,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The reason why the Children of God are so little regarded here in the World; it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the World knows not who they are, nor what they are born unto: Their great Glory for the present is within; outwardly they look like other men, they eat, drink, labour, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse in earthly imployments, as others do; the communion which they have with God in all of these, is a secret thing: They are Sick, Poor, Naked, Distressed like other men; those inward supports which they have under all those exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises, are remote from publick view: They dy, and are buried under the Clods, and their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:000380_0072_0FA5030B946C0ED0"/>
putrifie and rot like other men; and none see those joyes that their souls are entred into, nor that guard of Angels which comes as a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy, and carryes them into <hi>Abraham</hi>'s bosom: Nay, they have their sins, their spots, their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections and weaknesses here, as well as other men; but their tears, repentance, secret mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, and renewals of Faith, and restorings to peace and soul-comfort, are secret.</p>
                  <p>And hence,</p>
                  <p>Though the Righteous Man be indeed surpas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>singly more excellent than his neighbour, yet is he not thought so to be: Whereas, did the World see and understand, whose sons they are, what inheritances they are the undoubted heirs of, and what are those Gloryes they shall ere long be made to possess, it would alter their opinion, and make them afraid of them, and not dare to do them any wrong. How fearful was <hi>Abime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lech</hi> of <hi>Abraham,</hi> when God did but tell him he was a Prophet? <hi>Gen.</hi> 20.7, 8.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Here we see the reason why the People of God are often so doubtful, disquiet, discontent, and afraid to dy (I put things together) The ground of all this is because they do not as yet see clearly what they shall be: It would be a matter of just wonderment to see the Children of God so easily and often shaken, so disturbed and perplexed in hours of Temptation, were it not from the consideration, that they at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:000380_0073_0FA5030BA95F3B78"/>
know so little of themselves or their happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: Sometimes their sonship it self doth not appear to them, but they are in the dark, at a loss about the evidencing of it to the satisfaction of their own minds, and from hence it is that many doubtings arise, and their souls are disquieted. Sometimes their present sufferings look bigger in their thoughts, than the conceptions or apprehensions which they enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of their future Glory, these things being near, and the other looked on at a distance, and hence they out-weigh, in their rash judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and now they are disquiet and discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and say with him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 73.13. <hi>I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocency.</hi> And usually in their good frames, they apprehend more of the sweetness of present Communion with God in his Ordinances, than of that blessed immediate communion in Glory; and this makes them, with good <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> to turn away their faces from the messages of death and change: All these things are arguments of the weak sight and dark thoughts which we here have of the things of another world: which yet, it is the holy pleasure of God, that it shall be so a while, for the advancing of his own ends in his Saints.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Learn hence a reason why the present suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of God's Children can neither argue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst, nor yet prejudice their felicity: for the
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:000380_0074_0FA5030C6C960448"/>
time is not yet come wherein they are to appear like themselves: <hi>Joseph</hi>'s prisoned condition, and prison robes set him never the further off from his preferment in <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Court; but were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the very harbingers of it: When the appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted time for the manifestation of the Sons of God shall come, he can fetch them out in hast, change them in the twinkling of an eye, and cloath them upon with all that excellency and splendid Glory, whereby, they who were but the other day lying among the pots, shall with their dazling lustre outshine the Sun in the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It is the Almighty's good pleasure, that their life, for the present, should be hid with Christ in God: But yet he hath his time, and will take his opportunity to reveal and make it known.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. This teacheth us that the Glory of the sons of God must needs be wonderfully and astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly great: For why? Have they not already in hand, that which surpasses the knowledge of all the world, and which is in value transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently more worth than all the Crowns and Kingdoms, and Gloryes of it? Do they not live upon, and satisfie their souls with marrow and fatness here, <hi>Psal.</hi> 63.5. Are they not here reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with the fatness of God's house? <hi>Psal.</hi> 36.8. Who, but he that enjoys it, can declare what an happiness it is to enjoy peace with God, and fellowship with Christ, assurance of his love,
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:000380_0075_0FA5030D4D7023C8"/>
and consolation of his spirit? Who, but he that hath felt it, can tell what it is to have the love of God shed abroad in his heart, and in his Soul to hear the sweet voice of Pardon, and promises of Glory? to ly all night in the bosom of Christ, and have his left hand underneath his head, and his right hand imbracing of him? And yet he that knows all this doth not know what he shall be: These are but the displayes of the outward Temple, or holy place; what then is to be seen in the holy of Holies? These are but drops, and rivulets which come in Pipes, and in little por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; how glorious a thing then must it needs be to dwel at the fountain, and swim for ever in those bankless, and bottomless Oceans of Glory? How happy then are the dead in Christ, who are now seeing, tasting, knowing and experienc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing these things?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>USE,</hi> II. For Exhortation, learn we hence.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Not to judge of our selves, or of our own state by our present sense: It is the delight of Satan to be keeping the thoughts of the Children of God looking, and poring upon their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent sinful and sorrowful condition, that they may be held under discouragement by thinking themselves miserable, but we live by hope, and <hi>Hope that is seen is not hope, Rom.</hi> 8.24. As of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten then as your sense would dishearten you, now betake your selves to, and stirr up your Faith; set your selves to meditate upon the unknown
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:000380_0076_0FA5030EB05DBAA8"/>
Gloryes which are coming; and think them not less but greater, because they appear not; this being one main reason why they do not as yet appear, because they are too big for our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent comprehension.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Think it not hard that God should call you to present sufferings for his Name, but let the consideration of that unseen Glory that is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, arme and animate you for whatsoever Dayes of trouble you may have good reason to think are not afarr off, that when they do come, they may not be burdensome, but may weigh light: Learn therefore of <hi>Paul,</hi> to place the scales right, that you may be able to draw the same conclusion which he doth, when you come to weigh your future felicities, that you have in hope, against all the present sorrows and suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings you are at the present undergoing for Christ, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17, 18.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Wait patiently for your Glory: though you do not now enjoy it, no nor make a full and through discovery of it at the present, yet be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient and wait, and you have those encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments so to do.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The time is not long: It is but when he shall appear, Context. There is a little work for you to do for God here, and then the reward: And as you <hi>have need of patience</hi> for this, that <hi>when you have done the will of God you may receive the reward, Heb.</hi> 10.36. So there is this given
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:000380_0077_0FA5030F8DFE2F10"/>
to animate you in the chearful exercise of it, that it is but a <hi>little while, and he that shall come, will come, and will not tarry, vers.</hi> 47. Christ is but gone to heaven to prepare, and then he will come again for you.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. You have mean while good security for it: There are the many precious promises in the Book of God, engaging his faithfulness, &amp; truth, and power to the performance of it: you have the seal of the spirit for it, <hi>Who hath sealed you to the day of Redemption, Eph.</hi> 4.30. And you have all those earnests which are given in the inchoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive felicity, which you have found, in those tasts that you have had of the love of God in Christ, and all these are built upon a foundation of God, and in an eternal Decree, which must stand sure, and what would you have more?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This glory is worth the waiting for: I am not able to tell you what it is, no, nor, if an Angel should come and declare it to us, are we who dwell in mortal bodies, capable of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing it: But this we may know, that it will recompence all our Faith and Patience, all our sorrows and sufferings; nay, all the sufferings of this present life are not worthy of the Glory that shall be revealed: If it did appear, and our blear eyes could now look upon it without daz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, it would not be so great as it now is, which when it shall appear, will transport us with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting admiration, that shall eccho back in eternal Hallelujahs.</p>
                  <p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Our Apostle having in the foregoing words endeavoured to satisfie those whom he writes unto, in the reason why, Notwithstanding they were sons of God, and consequently great heirs, their condition was at the present so obscure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>viz.</hi> Because the time of their manifestation was not yet come, he proceeds in the rest of this <hi>Vers.</hi> to encourage and strengthen their Faith in the consideration of the Glory which shall in due time be revealed in them: It is <hi>q. d.</hi> Have patience, and tarry but a little while, and then you shall look like your selves, and have Glory enough to declare you unspeakabley happy.</p>
                  <p>The words before us are an assertion concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the future happiness of God's Adopted Children, in which we may take notice of three things that are worthy of our diligent observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. The certainty and evidence of it, <hi>We know.</hi> 2. The time when it shall be; <hi>When he shall appear.</hi> 3. The nature of it, or that wherein it shall mainly consist: <hi>We shall be like him.</hi> We may take up these in their order.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For the certaincy and evidence of it. <hi>We know.</hi> The word [<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>] signifies to know certainly; and the Apostle useth the word in opposition to an uncertain ghuess or conjecture,
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:000380_0079_0FA503110603AC40"/>
by which a man doth but only probably suppose that the thing may be so.</p>
                  <p>Here observe,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The thing which he here asserts to be known, is the future glorious estates of the Sons of God: It is that condition which is reserved for them, and unto which they shall in due time be brought, for his present discourse properly relates unto what they shall be in the great Day.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Concerning this knowledge it is conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That he clearly intimates the object to be a thing knowable, or that which hath its evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, it is <hi>q. d.</hi> though what it shall be appears not plainly to us, yet that it shall be is out of the reach of doubting: Or, though we cannot understand it in its Latitude, yet we may discern its futurity.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That he doth not Monopolize this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to himself and the rest of the Apostles, as though it were a peculiar priviledge to them, coming in a way of extraordinary revelation; but he makes it a common favour bestowed u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Children of God.</p>
                  <p>And hence,</p>
                  <p>Coming by ordinary means: He doth not say, I know it, and give you my testimony of it, which you may credit; but we know: you and I have the evidence of it in our selves, and such
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:000380_0080_0FA50311AA302FA8"/>
grounds of certainty upon which we may safely draw this conclusion.</p>
                  <p>Hence,</p>
                  <p>Doct. <hi>As the future Glorious Estate of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God is a thing certain in it self, so it is that whereof they may also have a certain and infallible Knowledge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though they cannot tell how well it shall be with them, yet that it shall be well, they may know: That their is a remaining Glory, and that that Glory shall be theirs: Not only that their is a number of the Children of Men who shall be blessed in the eternal enjoyment of God in Christ, but that they also in particular are of that number: And this indeed is a main and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential part of a Believers present inchoative hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness. that now he knows, and is firmly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded of it, that he shall be happy for ever.</p>
                  <p>Knowledge is here opposed Negatively, or Privatively to ignorance, disparately to opinion. And in the clearing up of this point, we may, 1. Consider something of the nature of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in general, And then, 2.

                     </gap>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies in things, which the understanding finds out and layes by themselves, and whereby it is furnished for further discoveries: Or else they are compound; when the understanding, disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering a subject, and having found out those simple truths which concern it (or supposing it self so to have done) it puts them together, and makes an Axiom, sentence, assertion, or nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion about them. Now there are various po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures in which the understanding may stand to the things; and various affections in which the things may stand related one to another. I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend not the distinct producing of all that here might be said on this account, but only so far as is to our present purpose.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Referring to the understanding: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it discernes not the ground of the composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or relation of one thing to another.</p>
                  <p>And hence,</p>
                  <p>It can declare or conclude nothing at all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout

it; and this is that which we call ignorance. Sometimes this ignorance is attended with a fond apprehension that he doth see it; mistaking, and confidently concluding it to be that which it is not; &amp; this is properly Errour, which is buil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> upon Ignorance accompanyed with an opinion of knowledge. Sometimes he doth see or discern these differences, and is able to make a true A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorisme, or Declaration about them, and this is called Judgement; which is nothing else but a skill of putting simple Truths together, right as they should be, and according to the natural and genuine relation they have each to the other so as to make them into a true conclusion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Relating to the things themselves: We must consider that the reason of our compounding, or putting Truths together, is, from some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion which there is, and appears to us to be between them: as when I see that there is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion betwen the nature of Man and Reason, my judgement thence compounds and concludes that Man is a reasonable creature. Now these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexions are not all alike, some are tyed of a slip knot, or are so connected as they may easily be separated; such is the Relation between all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent causes and effects, or only probable and conjectural antecedents and consequents: as when we say, the diligent hand maketh rich; here is some rational connexion between dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and prosperity, but yet there are so many
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:000380_0083_0FA503166AC9F6D8"/>
casualties in the over-ruling Providence of God, that may check and over-bear this, that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it falls out that we labour in the fire for very nothing; sow much and bring in little, and when we say it will be a fair day for the evening is red, though this be an ordinary symptom, yet it is no infallible presage, it is oftentimes so, and sometimes otherwayes: Now the judgement of these things is called Opinion, because it is a conclusion that is drawn from reasons which are only probable and contingent. But other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexions are tyed of a fast knot; they flow from the very nature of the things, &amp; are therefore ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily predicated of the subject, and it cannot be without them: Such are all natural Causes and effects, as when we say the Sun shines, Man is a reasonable Creature, &amp;c. And the judgement of these things is that which we call Science or Knowledge: <hi>viz.</hi> When we disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and conclude of necessary effects from ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Causes, &amp; necessary causes from necessary effects; now such as this is, is that Knowledge which a Child of God may have of his future Glory.</p>
                  <p>Hence,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I come to make it evident in particular that our after happiness may be thus known and there will need but these two things to be cleered for the proof of it. <hi>viz.</hi> 1. The hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness of beleevers depends upon necessary cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:000380_0084_0FA50317EC84C638"/>
And</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That their sanctified reason is capable of searching out and discovering the truth of these causes and so concluding infallibly.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the happiness of beleevers depends upon necessary causes: my meaning is, that there is such a connexion between the Causes of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Salvation it self, that they cannot fail to bring it about, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. The immutable will of God purposing and resolving of it: with this our Saviour encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth his Disciples, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.32. <hi>Fear not little flock it is your Fathers pleasure to give you the Kingdome.</hi> The foundation of this happiness was laid in Gods Decree; this is the Book of Life in which their Names were written; here began that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting love, which is the cause and fountain of all the grace afterwards revealed: this is the writing that receives no blots; this is the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord that admits of no alterations; this is the foundation of God which stands sure, having this seal, the Lord knows who are his: Hence we have <hi>Paul</hi> bringing down of this foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge infallibly unto Glory, in that chain of his, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29.30.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Redemption of Christ purchasing and procuring of it for them: eternal Glory is one part of that purchase for which Jesus Christ laid down that great price: and it was sealed up to him in the Covenant of Redemption for
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:000380_0085_0FA503195E87E330"/>
those whom he was to redeem; and this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase is made sure and ratified, and that not only in respect of the purchase it self, for which he hath payed, and of which payment he hath received a full acquittance in his resurrection, and is actually put in possession, being ascended up into Heaven, and there invested with the tenure and possess of the Crown of Glory; but also in respect of the persons for whom it is bought, and on whom it is to be bestowed. Hence Christ, speaking of the Elect, declare that it was for their sakes that he did that work, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.9. And professeth that he had lost none of those whom his Father had given to him, <hi>vers.</hi> 12.</p>
                  <p>Hence,</p>
                  <p>We read of purchased possession, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.14. And an inheritance reserved for us in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. And of Christ willing that all of them should be with him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.24.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Unalterable promises made to them: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers are said to be heirs of the promise: They have great promises, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. Eternal felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty comes within the compass of the promise which is made to them, <hi>Psal.</hi> 84.11. <hi>The Lord shall give Grace and Glory.</hi> Joh. 3.36. <hi>He that believeth hath everlasting life,</hi> and this promise is firm and stable; it is not a mutable thing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is made by an immutable God, and it cannot fail because uttered by the mouth of God
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:000380_0086_0FA5031A17B54660"/>
that cannot lie. And from hence the Apostle argueth the necessity of our felicity, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.17, 18.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Infallible Conditions; such as are necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, not only <gap reason="foreign">

This is a seed which, when sown, is immortal and abiding; these gifts and callings are without repentance.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Powerful and unfailing assistance: They are said to be in God's, and in Christ's hand; and, as it is certain that they will not throw them out, so it is equally certain that no other can pluck them out: There are t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ose indeed who do attempt it, but in vain, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.27, 28. God's Omnipotency is the Garrison or guard to which they are committed, on purpose that they may enjoy Salvation, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Ye are kept by the power of God through faith unto Salvation.</hi> They are given to Christ and he hath commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to the care and keeping of his spirit, and he seals them up to the day of Redemption, <hi>Eph</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4.30.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="82" facs="unknown:000380_0087_0FA5031AABC28B90"/>2. The Believers sanctified reason is capable of searching out and discovering the truth of these causes, and so to conclude infallibly. The evidence of this assertion will then be plain, when we have considered.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That there are such effects of these causes wrought in the souls of all the Children of God, as are peculiar and proper to them, there is that done in and for every Child of God, which is wrought in and for no other in the world. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per effects are undeceiving evidences of their causes. The Apostle speaks of <hi>things that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany Salvation, Heb.</hi> 6.9. There is a faith which is <hi>the faith of Gods Elect, Tit.</hi> 1.1. There is a vocation which is linked fast unto following glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29, 30. There is a knowledge of God in Christ, which is <hi>Eternal life, Joh.</hi> 17.3. There is a sealing of the spirit which confirmes everlasting happiness to us, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.30. There is an earnest now given by which God confirmes the title of the Inheritance to the Souls of his People, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.14.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That these effects are discernable and legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and that not only by special revelation, but also in a rational way of arguing and inferring. If this were not a truth, then all such Scripture-precepts as put us upon this duty, of self exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in respect of our spiritual estate, were in vain, and meerly superfluous. It is true, the law puts us upon duties impossible to fallen man,
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:000380_0088_0FA5031C1A578F90"/>
and this course God useth with us, to make us know our need of Christ: But the Gospel puts Believers upon nothing but what may be done: Now this is made the Believers duty, in divers Gospel-respects, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.28. Nay, why should the Gospel pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Rules of tryal to us, if there were no dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery to be made by the application of them? Of what use is a Touch-stone to us, if by apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, we could not be able to make dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery what Mettle is genuine, and what is deceitful?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That every Child of God is furnished for this discovery: He hath an habitual power in him, and sufficient help afforded unto him for the discerning these effects.</p>
                  <p>For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The effects themselves are manifestly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguishable from the common Graces of Moral Men, and the counterfeit graces of hypocrites, though they may have some resemblance, yet there are differencing notes, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.10. <hi>In this the Children of God are manifest, and the Children of the Devil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Every Child of God hath a conscience whereby he is able to reflect upon himself to take a Survey of his own actions, to see what is in him, and to compare it by the rule, and to judge of it accordingly. Hence,</p>
                  <p>We shall find <hi>Paul</hi> making an appeal to the
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:000380_0089_0FA5031C2DAB1210"/>
Testimony of his own Conscience, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1·12.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Spirit of God dwels in the understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and conscience of every Believer, to illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate it, and to give it a judgement, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning of spiritual things, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.10, 14. and this is a common priviledge of all Believers, they have all of them the indwelling spirit to help them in their work.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Spirit of Adoption is also a witness in a Child of God, to confirm and ratifie the the testimony which his Conscience gives in concerning the premises, whence there are two substantial witnesses to the same truth.</p>
                  <p>Hence,</p>
                  <p>He is said to bear witness with our spirits, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. By the discovery of these present effects he is infallibly assured that he shall inherit Glory hereafter. A state of Grace, and of Glory, have but their gradual differences: Grace is Glory begun, Glory is Grace finished or perfected: Grace is the seed whereof glory is the genuine Fruit: Grace, if it dy not, will bring forth glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry undoubtedly; but it cannot dy, being an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal seed, and abiding. True grace is a spring that never ceaseth flowing till it reach eternal Life, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.14. <hi>Paul</hi> counts it a good argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that the inferrence will hold, that if God hath begun, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

work, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.6. God cannot call back his grace, for it is without repentance, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.29. <hi>Heb</hi> 13.5. The Believer cannot renounce nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject it, for God will not suffer him to depart away from him, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.27. The Devil and all his instruments cannot rob him of it, because they cannot pluck him out of Christ's hand, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.29. And when we have laid all these things together, Judge now whither this doth not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to that which may truly and properly be called knowledge, <hi>viz,</hi> a Judgement of certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty about our everlasting felicity.</p>
                  <p>USE, I. Here we see one Reason why ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Children of God bear all the changes of the life with so much quietness and tranquillity; it lyes here, because they have grounded expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations of future glory. The Men of the World wonder at them; yea, scoff and flout, and take them for mad Men, to feed their fancyes and hopes with unseen things, and therefore (in their opinion) the greatest uncerteintyes. Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if the hopes of the Children of God were grounded in opinion, and depended upon meer contingencyes, I cannot see how their life should not be the most perplexed sorrowful and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable of all men; for if, after they have left all for Christ, it were yet a thing dubitable whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they should ever see and enjoy him in glory, they have indeed nothing left them to lean the weight of their confidence upon: But this is
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:000380_0091_0FA5031DA9BFCA38"/>
their felicity in the midst of all turns, that still their main interest in eternity is secured: And this indeed is the very thing which declares them to be the only happy Men: All other Men live by meer opinion, these only are the men of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: Other men know not certeinly what it is that they labour for, nor what shall be the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent of all their pains and cares; but these men know that their labour is not in vain, and that there will be a good end of all their troubles and pains. As to the things of this life, and with respect to subordinate ends, the Children of God labour under equal uncerteintyes with other men; <hi>Eccl.</hi> 9. begin: <hi>All things fall out alike to all.</hi> And <hi>vers.</hi> 11. <hi>Time and chance happeneth to them all.</hi> They are not sure to prosper in their Estates, to enjoy health, and long life, and ease in this World: But as to their last end, and the concurrent tendency of all means to it, here they have good security, and this makes them patient in tribulation, quiet under sorest afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: Thus we find <hi>Paul</hi> argues himself into pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and chearfulness, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17, 18, &amp; 5.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If Storms; nay, Hurrycanes arise in their Voyage, yet they are not amazed, for they know who is Pilot, and where they shall certeinly Arrive; if they lose all they have in this World, yea and life it self, yet because they cannot lose glory, they are not filled with consternation: For though they cannot tell what that glory shal
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:000380_0092_0FA5031E72E9C488"/>
be, yet they know that it shall be glory, and such as God himself shal give (that God who doth all things like himself) and they are satisfied that this shall be enough to fill them with everlasting joyes.</p>

It is true, if their felicity were grounded in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingency, the Saints enemies might have some probable hopes to undermine and blow them up; but those that fight against the truth shall not be able to prevail. That Rock on which the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness of the Sons of God is built, lyes too deep for all the endeavours of their enemyes to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine: That truth, that no Child of God shal ever be lost, that no weapon that is formed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them shall ever prosper, that the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the World shall sooner be shaken, the Pillars of the Earth faulter, crack, and crumble in pieces, than they fail of eternal felicity is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable, he that will keep a Child of God from Heaven and happiness, must make void the everlasting purposes of an unchangeable God, violate the eternal Covenant of Redemption, disanul Gods firm and undeciveable promises, kill the immortal seed of grace, overcome the Omnipotent Spirit of God: Till all this can be done, the Believers well-being stands secure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

which whiles Men and Devils are contriving and endeavouring, he may stand still and smile at their bold and impossible undertakings; and whiles his hope is built, and his eye fixt upon these strong Pillars, it is as vain for them to think to scare or terryfie him.</p>
                  <p>I confess, if God should hide his face, and with-draw the light of his Countenance, and leave him but a while to combate diffidence and doubting, his Spirit is easily overwhelmed: But if God stand by, and give him the advantage to live in this light, his evidence is so good, and his knowledge so firmly grounded, that all which can be done against him, will but help to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm him. Lightly grounded opinions may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily be confuted, by as probable contradictions; but firmly fixed principles, and clear evidences of Divine knowledge, are not shaken by the greatest contradiction of sinners: Such is the perswasion that a Child of God hath of his love to him, that he is withal fully perswaded that all which can be done against it cannot dissolve it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.37, 38, 39.</p>
                  <p>And hence,</p>
                  <p>Nothing will prejudice them against God and his service; nothing will turn them out of their way of duty and obedience to God, because they are not labouring for uncerteintyes, or looking for things that may not be; they live not upon deceivable hopes, they know whom
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:000380_0094_0FA50324267B4D98"/>
they have trusted, and that he is able to keep that which they have committed unto him to the day of the Lord; and therefore are they not weary nor faint, as those that know that in due time they shal reap if they faint not: and though their enemyes may take away their comforts of Life, deprive them of their Estates, of their good name among men, of their liberty, yea of their lives too, yet, because they know they cannot rob them of their glory, therefore are they resolved in their way, and will be faithful unto death.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>USE.</hi> III. For Exhortation to the Children of God, in two Lessons.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Study much for this knowledge: The wise man's assertion, <hi>Light is sweet,</hi> is true of mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial light, much more of spiritual; and there is never a ray of it which brings more of delight with it, than that which discovers unto us our names written in Heaven: The Philosopher could say, a little knowledge, and that conjectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral (which deserves not the title of knowledge) in heavenly things, is to be preferred before a great deal, and that certein, in earthly things: And yet were his thoughts bounded on this side of the third heaven: But here we have the best and surest knowledge, the clearest and most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrable light is to be had of the things of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity. Man's nature inclines him to love knowledge in general; let grace rectifie nature,
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:000380_0095_0FA5032541239488"/>
and employ you in the disquisition of theirs, the knowledge whereof can be no less than inchoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive happiness. Of all knowledge, that which concerns our selves is the most profitable, and of our selves, that which informes us about our eternity is the most desirable: The souls immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality is discovered by a beam of natures light, the happiness of some, and misery of others in their immortality is evident by Scripture revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the uncerteinty of our present condition here, is known by constant experience: He therefore, and only he can enjoy solid comfort, who hath an hope grounded in knowledge that it shall at last go well with him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Make use of this knowledge to establish your hearts against all the evils, and threatned dangers of this present life. The encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in our <hi>Text,</hi> as we have heard, is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated by our Apostle to the dayes of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, that he might confirm true Believers, by the consideration of their sonship to a resolute standing by the sincere profession of Christ, and maintenance of an holy life. Their Godliness is the great quarrel which the world have against the Children of God: Their present Sonship, and future glory known, is the great relief they have against the Temptations of such an hour: This knowledge is practical, and the strength of the practice is the being much in exercise of Faith, of which the Apostle gives that encomine
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:000380_0096_0FA50325F926AD20"/>
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.

Empire) puts a carnal interpretation upon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny passages in Scripture, and then concludes of Christ's coming in the flesh into the lower world, and setting up a Kingdom here below, bearing date for a thousand years, in which the Saints shal possess the Earth, and, with great outward pomp, carnal pleasures, and voluptuousness, reign over, and have command of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, in which they shall enjoy all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of sensual delights; the very naming of which oppinion is sufficient confutation, it smels so much of the flesh, and savours so much of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: And that it hath found so many abettors in these last ages, is an argument that the world grows old and doting. <hi>Mundus senescens pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur phantasias.</hi> There is another apprehension, which hath gained many learned and Godly Men for its Patrons, who, supposing many <hi>texts</hi> of Scripture to speak without trope or Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory, do thereon conclude it at least probable, that before the Resurrection of the wicked and ungodly, there shall be a first Resurrection of the Just, wherein Jesus Christ, coming to Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, shal openly acquit, and make to reign with him in this lower world, all his Elect and Redeemed ones, for the space of a thousand years; after which shall follow the general Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection of his Enemyes, and the final issue and determination of all those great affairs, when Christ shal return to Heaven and his Saints with

him. Whether it shal be thus or otherwise, the day shal determine: All which I dare say of it, is, that it hath no such evidence in the word of God, as to make it a necessary point of Faith, is attended with so many knots and intricacies, as are hard if not impossible by us at present to be resolved; and whatsoever there is that may be alledged for the supporting of it, is capable of a fair solution according to the Scripture dialect, and thereby reducable either to Christ's first coming in the flesh, the state of the New-Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament in general, or the glorious state of the Triumphant Church in the Eternal Kingdom; as divers learned and Orthodox have judiciously made to appear.</p>
                  <p>But to avoid controversies, and take up with things agreed on: There are two comings of Christ peculiarly celebrated in the Gospel; his coming in a state of Humiliation, and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a state of glory to Judge the World; Which latter is accordingly called his second coming, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.28. <hi>He shall appear the second time.</hi>

                  <p>As Christ was once seen here in great mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and was despised, so he shal be seen even by his Enemies in great glory, and every knee shal bow to him; He shal come in the glory of his Father, and he shal come to Judge the world, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.31. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1. This is the appearing of which our Apostle here speaketh: Christ

was now gone to Heaven, but he was to come again, and when that shal be, then also shal the Saints manifestation be: Of this he speaks, and with it he encourageth them to confidence <hi>Cap.</hi> 2.28. <hi>Abide in him, that when he shall appear we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.</hi>

                     <hi>Ans.</hi> In summe, if we shall be like Christ, there needs no more to make us fully blessed and conspicuously glorious: He cannot be ought less than unexpressibly happy in the great day of Christs appearance, that shall then be like him, for although we can at present no more know what Christ shall be, then we can what we shall be, yet the consideration that we shall be like him, may afford to us these grounds of satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That our happiness shall countervail and more than make us amends, for all the sorrows and sufferings of this life.

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. That our happiness shall be so discovered that our Enemies, and those that scorned and scoffed at us here, shall be ashamed and confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at the sight of it: It shal then appear not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to our selves, but to all the World too, that it was not, as they thought, in vain to serve God, and unprofitable to pray to him: Christ's second appearance shal fill his Enemies with horrid con: fusion, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.7. They scorned him here, and he was made a reproach, but then they shal trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and dread, his glorious presence shal drive them to seek shelter from him, of Rocks and Mountains, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.20, 21. And when we shal appear with him in Glory, then they that said the Saints were unhappy men, shal see and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess that they are glorious: Then Men shal say, <hi>Verily there is a reward for the Righteous, Verily he is a God that Judgeth in the Earth, Psal.</hi> 58.11.

                  <p n="3">3. That our happiness shal be such as shal serve eminently to express the love of God to be like himself. Christ is the Son of his love, and God to testifie that he loved him in our nature hath

made him accordingly glorious: He hath also loved his People in Christ, hence they too must be made to know what that love meaneth: That love with which he loves them is special love, and not common which all his Creatures are made the partakers of, and hence the fruits of it must be special too: It shal be such a Glory, as shal deserve to have a Proclamation made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, and Angels and Men called to turn their eyes and look upon it, to see what were the everlasting thoughts of good will which God did bear to his chosen Ones in Christ.</p>

As he cannot expect to meet with any thing better here, so he can hope for no better hereafter: To be with Christ where he is, and to be like him in the day of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, is as much as the Soul can desire, and will be found a felicity so great, that his most enlarged reaching will not be able to grasp after more.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. That the thoughts of the great Day of Judgement ought to be delightful thoughts to the People of God; for this is the very day where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in being made like to him, they shal look like themselves: This thought that then we shal be like him, may make the expectation of it very precious to us: There are many terrible consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations of that day, awful and amazing, which

may well make the ungodly World to fall a trembling; but the consideration of what they shal be then, may take off all that dread from the hearts of the Children of God: It is the very day wherein Christ comes with great Power and Majesty, and all his Saints shal wait upon him in like Robes of Glory unto them which he shal be adorned withal: Could we but think of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>tion, or prove that we shal be like him; under which is contained another great truth concerning the happiness of the Children of God in another World. As for the force of the Argument, very briefly: It may at first blush seem to argue weakly, at least obscur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to prove our likeness to him, from our vision of him; Devils and wicked Men shal see him, as <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.7. but they will not thence be more like him: I answer, it is true, these shal see a great deal of his Glory, they shal see him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as their Judge, but they shal not see him as
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:000380_0132_0FA4FE39E1BB0280"/>
their Saviour, as the Saints shal: Again, they shal see him with great horror, and fly from his presence, as <hi>Adam</hi> did in the Garden, and as they shal do, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.20, 21. Whereas the Children of God shal see him with great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and satisfaction. Some thinks that <hi>John</hi> argues from the cause, supposing that this Vision will be a transforming Vision, changing us into the Image or likness of Christ perfectly: others suppose him to argue from the part to the whole; the Doctrine of the Beatifical vision being a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Doctrine in the Church, as being the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect felicity of the understanding.</p>
                  <p>Hence,</p>
                  <p>He argues for our whole perfection, for if in one pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>sts in perfect conformity to Christ. But that which seems best to clear the argument, is to look upon him as arguing from the effect or consequent. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us that without Holiness no Man shal see God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12 14. Now Holiness consists in a conformity to Christ.</p>
                  <p>And hence,</p>
                  <p>If we shal have such a sight of him, it inferrs that we are made like to him: If we were not rendred holy, and spiritual, and that perfectly, we then should never thus see him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="128" facs="unknown:000380_0133_0FA4FE3AB186F868"/>But bearing the argument, only with this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition, to warn us that we deceive not our selves, thinking to see Christ hereafter with joy, and yet abhoring conformity to him in holiness, which will be found a piece of undoing presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption at the last. I come to the Words, as they are an assertion, or point of Doctrine; and here also they have their difficulty: Who this [Him] is we have already heard, <hi>viz.</hi> Jesus Christ, though some interpret it of God, but it intends Jesus Christ God-man; it is he who is to appear, and he whom we shal be made like unto when he shal appear. Hence,</p>
                  <p>Doct. <hi>It will be a great part of the happiness of the Children of God, in the other life, that they shall see Jesus Christ as he is.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Our Doctrine treats of the Beatifical Vision, which, as whiles we are in this body we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of enjoying, so are we no less incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of knowing what it is. Many curious wits have beat their brains, and tentered their inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions about it, to no purpose, but to darken coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel with words without knowledge. The School-Men have taken a great deal of pains in it and all but to shew their ignorance. Interpreters generally agree that the expression of <hi>John</hi>'s is synonymous to that of <hi>Paul</hi>'s, of seeing him face to face, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.12. Where there is also
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:000380_0134_0FA4FE3B613309E8"/>
an <hi>Elypsis</hi> of the <hi>Object</hi> as well as in our <hi>Text</hi>: It is sometime called a seeing of God, and is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.8. Sometimes a seeing of Christ, who is God, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.4. <hi>Joh</hi> 19.26. There is a seeing of God here in this life, and there is a sight which shal be had of him in Glory: For happiness is here inchoated, it shal there be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected: Now the great matter of inquiry is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the difference which is between these two Sights: The Apostle, in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.12. makes a very great difference, and so indeed there is beyond our present imagination; but in what things it lyes is hard to tell, the words are (like our present knowledge) Aenigmatical, a Riddle not easily read, and <hi>Augustines</hi> counsel is here good, <hi>That we beware lest whiles we quarrel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the way of seeing God, we forget and miss of Sanctification, by which only he is to be seen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Briefly then,</p>
                  <p>It is the concurrent Judgement of the Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox, that the object seen then and now is the same, and that the difference consists in two things.</p>
                  <p>First, The Manner.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Degrees, both of which are intimated in the forecited <hi>Text.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Manner: That now is <hi>through a Glass darkly,</hi> that then is, <hi>face to face: i. e.</hi> We now see him mediately, whereas we shal then see him immediately; now we have a reflex, then we shal
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:000380_0135_0FA4FE3FE67CD820"/>
have a direct sight of him. Now there are some who think he is here seen by the reflexion of the of his Attributes, and then in his naked Essence, and so make the Attributes a part of the Glass; but this is a flight too high for me to soar unto. It is ce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tain the Attributes are no part of the Glass, but they are the Object that is now refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in the Glass. I know that seeing Christ as he is, intends more than a seeing the Man Christ in his visible Glory, but it doth not therefore necessarily enforce the seeing the Divine Essence. Seeing him face to face, is some transcendent manner of seeing him; and what if it be his good pleasure that we shall not know it till we come actually to see it? We can neither under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand how there should be, nor believe that there is any proportion between an infinite object and a finite created understanding: Should God make a Being able to know him in his naked Essence, he must make one equal to himself. Angels are Comprehensors, yet they are repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented as covering their faces with two of their wings, and that not only by reason of modesty, but of weakness too, lest they should lose their sight in the contemplation. The highest flight of our understanding, is to see things in their causes, but the Divine Essence is without cause. That distinction of seeing comprehensively, and seeing apprehensively hath here no place; in things that have parts, and are divisible, and so
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:000380_0136_0FA4FE40D83FFA30"/>
may partially come into our view it will hold, but the Divine Essence is simple and indivisible, and therefore to apprehend and comprehend it are all one. Nor is the ground of Opposition between Faith and Sight with respect to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject seen, for we heard that is one and the same, but to the manner of seeing him; and it may rather argue the contrary, namely, if it be God in his Attributes that is believed in now, it must be God in his Attributes that must be seen then; Christ saith, <hi>be it to thee according to thy Faith.</hi> We now believe that God is Infinite, Eternal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we shall see and apprehend him to be so then; and as for that notion of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of man naturally reaching to see the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head nakedly, and hence, that it cannot be happy without such a sight, it will easily be found a mistake; for besides that the desires of fallen man grasp after that which if obtained would certainly prove their misery, we may argue here diametrically opposite, <hi>viz</hi> That which can make a man fully happy can answer all his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires; He that knows God to be his God in Christ, and knows him to be infinitely wise, powerful, good glorious, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> knows enough to satisfie him in his object: but besides this, he can know no more and live, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.20. <hi>There shall no man see me and live.</hi> I know many Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters limit this to our present state in this life, but God doth not so do, nor is there any need to
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:000380_0137_0FA4FE41657A8B20"/>
do it. See also 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.16. <hi>Who dwelleth in the light which none can approach unto, whom no man hath seen, nor can see</hi>: Joh. 1.18. <hi>No man hath seen God at any time.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are several Glasses which here repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent God unto us; as the Glass of Creation, and the Glass of Providence, in which his Being, and his Wisdom, Power and Goodness do shine forth: there is the Glass of the Scriptures, the Law and Gospel; the Glass of Ordinances, Preaching, and the Sacraments, in which God and Christ are exhibited to our Faith; but our manner of seeing him through all these is dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and is rather compared to a report or hearing of the ear, than an ocular demonstration; these things bring us the happy news of such an one, and are the means whereby we that have not seen yet do believe: as 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8. This Glass is not a Prospective Glass, which represents things near and plain, and the things themselves, but it is a Looking Glass, which reflects only the rayes and representations of things, and when they have shown us all they can, we must now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="133" facs="unknown:000380_0138_0FA4FE42254FE528"/>
by his Spirit in the means, so then he will do it immediately: we read of the new <hi>Jerusalem, Rev.</hi> 21.22, 23. <hi>I saw no Temple therein, and the City had no need of the Sun, &amp;c. for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof.</hi> And Chap, 22.5. <hi>They need no Candle, nor the light of the Sun, for the Lord giveth them Light.</hi> These things are Allegorical, and refer not to the Church Militant, but Triumphant, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press the nearness we shall there be in unto Christ, and those irradiations which we shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from him, with one Temple, Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Ministry.</p>

The Degree or Measure; the Apostle saith, <hi>Now I know in part, then I shall know even as I am known</hi>: i. e. he shall have a better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with, and a more distinct and perfect view of the Object: the things which we now rather believe than understand, we shall then have a satisfactory discovery of them; all Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections shall be answered, and Doubts cleared: our Knowledge now is most-what negative, it shall then be more positive; we rather see him now as he is not, but then as he is: there is not only at the present a veil upon the Glass we see in, but there are also thick seales upon our eyes; these shall be taken off, as well as the veil removed: the very eyes of our Faith are here sore and tender, but then our sight shall be strong and piercing.

                  <p n="1">1. That a perfect and through knowledge of God in Christ is not to be expected by any in this life: this is a priviledge reserved for glory, and not here looked for, much less presumed upon by any but such as are enfatuated: our Organs are not as yet accomodated to it, nor shall be, till the body of death be laid off: sin remaining in the understanding is so much darkness there: nor are our present means or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to be the deferents of perfect light to us, but are Glasses fitted to our sore eyes, left in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of helping them to see, they should put them out. Believers are not stark blind, their eyes are blessed because they do see, but they are imperfectly blessed for they see but confusedly, men like trees. <hi>Paul,</hi> as a Saint, knows but in part, and as an Apostle, or a glass to give light to others, prophesies but in part, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.9. the air through which the Sun of righteousness beams down his light upon us, is, though dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phenous, yet hazy and thick. There is indeed
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:000380_0145_0FA4FE4B243F9638"/>
enough revealed to direct us in our way, but not so much as to set us down satisfied: Hence the Ordinances, and all helps to the knowledge of God in Christ, will be of use to us as long as we are in this life: and though it should be a comfort to us to think that the time will shortly come when we shall no more need this Glass, when that Oracle shal be fulfilled, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.34. <hi>They shall teach no more every man his Neighbour, for they shall all know me,</hi> &amp;c. Yet except we can be content here to live without any sight of Christ at all, we must not be weary of, nor throw aside the Glass as long as we are here: We must be glad that we may, and thankful that we do see the Sun in his beams, till we come to dwell in the Fountain of Light.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. See here who they be that enjoy the most of Inchoate felicity in this World, <hi>viz.</hi> They that see most of God and Christ; if this vision when perfected, be so great a part of eternal Glory, the beginnings, and irradictions of it here must needs have a degree of blessedness in them. There is indeed a knowledge in this life, which is repleat with misery, and the encreasing of it is but the encrease of sorrow; and indeed mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable objects cannot be expected to do any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to reflect trouble on them that seek acquaintance with them: But could we acquaint our selves with Christ, see him in all, we should be able to pick up crumbs of felicity out of every

thing: Be therefore much in this study and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation; use all helps to get as near unto Christ as you can; get acquainted with him and that shall give you quiet in trouble, satisfaction in all changes: And the way to get a sight of Christ, and fellowship with him, is to get a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Children of God, get to be such as truely fear him, it is to such that he makes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self known, <hi>Psal.</hi> 25.14. <hi>The secret of the Lord is with those that fear him, and he will show th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>USE,</hi> II. For Exhortation to the Children of God, in two things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Be preparing for this glorious sight. The Apostle mentions it as a great Priviledge to be made meet for this glo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.12. And as it is of God to make us worthy through the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiness of Christ, and to prepare us for it by the Sanctification of the Spirit; so it concerns us to be making ready. It is your Marriage-day, in which your Bride-groom will shew himself to you in his glory, you therefore should be diligent in making ready to meet him: Would you then have a full and satisfying sight of Christ, now turn away your eyes from beholding vanity: you
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:000380_0147_0FA4FE4D8ADCEDF8"/>
must labour so to walk as that you may be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of him: What manner of persons should they be who look for such an happy sight as that? The more you love Christ now, the more grateful will the sight of him then be: Labour to make sure of your interest in him, to see him in all his Royalty, with an appropriating sight, and to be able to challenge a title to him as your Saviour, will be the very happiness of his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness. Labour to be found in him, adorned with his Righteousness, filled with his Grace, and waiting for his Kingdome, and so in his light shal you see light.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let this take off the terrour, and sweeten the thoughts of your dissolution. For, though the Apostle mentions this as a priviledge of the great day of Christ's appearance, yet it is an happiness that every dying Believer is immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly admitted unto in respect of his Soul: It is true, the bodily eyes shal see the Man Christ then, which will be a complement of our Glory; but this sight is mainly intellectual: and one would think it should comfort a Child of God in the darkest hour of death to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Christ? I am sure here are many sorrowful sights to be seen, here you may see abundance of sin committed, God's Name greatly disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured; you may see the pride and insolence of the World, and oppression and groans of the godly; in summe, the most that you see here is vanity, madness and folly; these are undesira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble sights, and how oft doth your eye affect your heart in seeing of them, and fill you with grief and sorrow? The best and only happy sight that ever you had here, is to behold God's beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in his Temple, to see Christ in an Ordinance, and to solace your Souls in fellowship with him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 27.4.63.2. And if ever you have been ravished with this, it may then tell you how trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting it must needs be, to see God in his Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace; Christ at the right hand of the heavenly Majesty, and me thinks this very thought should bring you to <hi>Paul</hi>'s Conclusion, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.8. <hi>We are confident, and willing rather to be absent from the Body, and present with the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>USE,</hi> III. For Consolation to the Child<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ren of God in respect of theirs that are departed. Let not your hearts be troubled, mourn not as they that have no hope: Oh, the happy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change that they have made from seeing you to see Christ as he is: Not whose Angels do for them, but who do themselves stand in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the Father.

their hard fate, that I would congratulate their great felicity, and say, Thrice happy souls that have received a blessed discharge from all the vain sights, and soul-disquieting objects of a miserable World, to see and behold him that bought and saved you. Whiles we are here groping in the dark, and looking with purblind eyes, upon imperfect looking glasses, and are fun to take up with transient glances, and shaded representations, you dwel at the Wel-head of light: while we can scarce see enough to estab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish our faith and confirm our hope, you are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing your selves into extasies, and drinking your fill of pure fountain light, beholding his face in glory, seeing him as he is, knowing him as you are known by him: whiles we have our sight of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten intercepted by some cloud of error or unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, you are gotten above clouds and fogs, your fun never sets upon you, but you are refresht with everlasting beams of purest light from the face of Jesus Christ. We dare not envy, we would not call you back from that felicity, who our selves also are waiting for that happy time, and our only comfort and support under all the sins and suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of this present life, ariseth from the hope of ere long enjoying that which you are at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent possessed of. Live happy in seeing of him in whose presence is fulness of joy: &amp; whiles you are living in full fruition, it shal be our endeavour to live in this hope, that <hi>when he shall appear we shal be like him, because we shall see him as he is.</hi>

                  <p>THese Words are one part of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet's mournful lamentation at the Godly Man's Funeral; and may pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly look back to the death of good <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> that pious Prince, which fell out not long before, whose removal was introductive to the sad and miserable condition unto which the <hi>Jewish</hi> Nation was soon after reduced. The <hi>Text,</hi> with the <hi>Context,</hi> so far as is contained in the two first <hi>Verses</hi> of the <hi>Chapter,</hi> doth repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to us,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The common lot wherein the best of Men do share with others: <hi>Righteous and Merciful Dye</hi> yea <hi>Perish; i. e.</hi> (as some interpret it) they may be taken away, not only by a natural, but also by a violent death, thus it befel that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Prince <hi>Josiah.</hi>

                  <p n="3">3. The happy state of the People of God in and at their death: <hi>They are taken away from the evil to come, they rest in their beds,</hi> &amp;c. Though the wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="1">1. A description of the great incogitancy of men under such awful Provi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="2">2. The subject matter about which this inco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitancy is declared or expressed: Which is a sure and evident conclusion that followed from the death of the Godly, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous is taken from the evil</hi> to come. Which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion,
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:000380_0153_0FA4FE54261275C0"/>
being of it self a full proposition, and also here insinuated as a matter worthy of deep meditation, may be the subject of our present discourse. In which Conclusion observe,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The subject, <hi>the Righteous,</hi> or the Just man: Which is not to be understood in a Legal sense, for one that is in all parts compleat, answering the Moral Law in every point, for so the asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were of no comfort at all, since among <hi>Adam</hi>'s Progeny descending from him by natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Generation, there is no such, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 7.20. <hi>There is not a Just Man upon Earth, that doth good, and sinneth not,</hi> Pro. 20.9. <hi>Who can say, I have made my heart clean?</hi> Hence that, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24.16. <hi>A Just Man falleth seven times</hi>: But in an Evangelical, in which Men are said to be Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, partly by the imputation of Christ's Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness.

                  <p n="2">2. The Predicate, <hi>They are taken away from the evil to come.</hi> Where observe,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The thing it self which is predicated of them, <hi>They are taken away</hi>: The word here
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:000380_0154_0FA4FE54F1CA2B88"/>
used doth primarily signifie to congregate, or gather together; and some there be who think it to be a Metaphor borrowed from a Shepherd, who, when he foresees a Storm coming, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon gathers his Sheep unto a place of safety, noting the happiness of the Righteous in their Death, they are gathered to the great Assembly of the first-born.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The end of their Being thus gathered, <hi>from the evil to come</hi>: in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> it is, <hi>From the face of the evil: i. e.</hi> From that evil which is just at hand, and (as it were) stares them in the face. The words of our <hi>Text</hi> are like a folded Picture, which looks pleasantly on the one side, and formidably on the other: If we consider them as they respect the Righteous themselves departed, they speak their great felicity in the very circumstance of their dying, in that they are taken from the evil to come that it may not overtake them; if we note the Aspect they have to the ungodly generation which these once lived among, they speak their great unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness in the loss of the Righteous, they are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the evil that it may come upon the World. Hence,</p>
                  <p>Doct. <hi>The death of the Righteous is sometimes a presaging fore-runner of approaching evil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The conclusion in our <hi>Text</hi> is not to be taken <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> It is not alwayes so: Sometimes God removes the godly without any such presage:
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:000380_0155_0FA4FE57B9196E80"/>
                     <hi>Moses</hi>'s, and <hi>David</hi>'s death (to name no more) were not so: But it is sometimes, and often thus: It was so here in our <hi>Text.</hi> In the Explication there are two things briefly to be considered,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. When it is so: 2. The grounds of it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. When it is so?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Death is a common change befalling all the Sons and Daughters of <hi>Adam</hi>: Hence in the ordinary course of nature the Death of the Godly falls out as well in dayes wherein God is pleased with his People, as in times of displeasure: God will not only have his servants to serve their Generation in this World, but also to have their reward in Heaven: God will sometime remove faithful men, when they have done their appointed work, to bring in their places others that shall be useful instruments in his service. So <hi>Moses</hi> gives place to <hi>Joshua; David</hi> to <hi>Solomon.</hi> These are no ill boding symptoms, when God is ever graciously providing a succession of such for his People, who may do worthily in their time.</p>
                  <p>Hence,</p>
                  <p>There are some circumstances whereby this is to be judged as judicial and calamitous, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. When good men are taken away and leave their places empty: I mean there are not others to supply them that are such as they were; but goodness in a great degree decaves and dies with them; and wicked and ungodly men succeed
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:000380_0156_0FA4FE59068F4688"/>
and fill their room: On this account was <hi>Josiah</hi>'s Death portentous; 2 <hi>King.</hi> 22.16. with 22. Thus also <hi>Jeroboam</hi>'s Son must die, because there was some good thing found in him, that so all evil and mischief might come upon the rest of his ungodly family.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When a People grow degenerate, and God (by his Messengers) denounceth his Judgements against them, and now pious and useful men are taken away, for herein God begins to put his threatnings in execution: This is the Case in our <hi>Text</hi>: He had been threatning of them with Judgements, <hi>Chap.</hi> 56.9. And now he opens a way for them to take place on them, by taking away the Righteous.</p>
                  <p>Hence,</p>
                  <p>After Ministerial warnings of wrath against a People, the death of such persons is to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, not only a preface, but also a main part of Gods accomplishment of it: We shal therefore find, that when God had uttered such threatnings as are menaced in <hi>Isaiah, Chap.</hi> 2. he proceeds in <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. begin. to discover the order and method of these Judgements, which was in the first place attended by the taking off of men of worth and use. <hi>The mighty Man, the Man of War, the Judge,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In the consideration of the grounds of the <hi>Doctrine</hi> we may enquire.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. How farr the taking away of Righteous
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:000380_0157_0FA4FE5A32A3D630"/>

                  <p n="2">2. Why God then takes them away, when he is about to bring evil on a place?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. How far the taking away of Righteous men doth sometimes make way for evil to flow in?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> This will appear in two things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If we consider how much they did, while they were living, contribute to the keeping off evil, &amp; procuring of good to those among whom they were. The very presence of such is a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing: God doth much, bears much for their sakes: Ten Righteous men might have saved <hi>Sodom</hi> when they were so ripe for ruine: God gave <hi>Paul</hi> the lives of all that were in the Ship with him, <hi>Act.</hi> 27.24. The presence of <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaphat</hi> saved three Armies by a miraculous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, when they were just ready to perish, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Lebans</hi> affairs prospered well for <hi>Jacob</hi>'s sake, all the while that he lived with him. God loves to dwel there where his holy and humble ones are: And besides there are two wayes in which they are instruments of keeping evil off the place where they are.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By keeping out a great deal of sin, which oftentimes, when they are gone, breaks in as a Flood, and brings ruine with it. Eminent upon this score was <hi>Jehojadah,</hi> 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 24. Where it is observed how he kept things right, and Religion

                        </gap> right in the sight of the Lord all the dayes of</hi> Jehojadah, but when he was once dead, and scarce cold in his Grave, all went down again, the Temple was neglected, Idolatry restored, <hi>vers.</hi> 17.18. And then misery comes flowing in upon them in an awful manner, <hi>vers.</hi> 23, 24.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By their Prayers and Intercession for a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and provoking People: They do often by pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and earnest supplications stay God's hand; they stand between him and his People, that he can do nothing to them: God had ruined <hi>Israel</hi> in the Wilderness for their sins had not <hi>Moses</hi> stood between and pleaded for them, <hi>Psal.</hi> 106.23. <hi>Therefore he said he would destroy them, had not</hi> Moses <hi>his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath.</hi> But when such are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away; it often falls out that there is none left to intercede, and so way is made to their ruine.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If we consider what usually follows upon the taking away of the Righteous, which tends to hasten a Peoples misery, <hi>viz.</hi> Usually upon this Religion goes to decay, Sin takes the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to raign without any rebuke or check, and men begin to grow impudent, when there are none left to reform them, nor any to avert the sore indignation of God from them. When <hi>Joshua,</hi> and that good Generation that went with him into <hi>Canaan</hi> were dead, then arose a new Generation that knew not the Lord, &amp; what
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:000380_0159_0FA4FE5BA1EAA1E8"/>

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Why God then takes them away, when he is about to bring evil upon a place?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> There may be two especial reasons as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed for this.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. God doth it with a gracious and favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble respect to themselves: Since they could not by all their pious endeavours reclaim a degenerate People, but misery must come, God takes them away that their eyes might not see it: This God promiseth, as a special favour to <hi>Josiah,</hi> 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 34.28. <hi>Thou shalt be gathered to thy Grave in Peace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> neither shall thine eyes see all the evil that I will bring upon this place.</hi> Truly, when ever a Godly man dyes, he rests from his Labour, but when he is taken away from the face of evil, it is a particular blessing to him: How could his ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and pitiful heart have born to look upon all those Calamities which his Country, his Friends, his Children, and Relations must suffer? To see all going to Rack before his eyes, would be a lamentable sight: God therefore in great love &amp; respect takes them home, where they are remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved out of the noise or tumult of all these things, dwelling in the fulness of present Joy and Glory.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. God doth it also that he may have no <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mora</hi> or <hi>Hinderence</hi> lying in the way to stop the
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:000380_0160_0FA4FE5C8AA3BD58"/>
course of his anger. These were they who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore held his hands, we find that he could do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to <hi>Sodom</hi> till <hi>Lot</hi> was out of it: And he is put to ask <hi>Moses</hi> to let him alone, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.10. Godly Men are God's Jewels, he cannot set fire to the Rubbish, till they are secured; they are his tender Ones to whom he hath a peculiar respect, and they must be marked, before the destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Angel executes his Commission: they must be many times housed in their G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aves before he can give full scope to his Indignation: and these are by some supposed to be those Chambers in which God calls his People to hide themselves before such a Day, <hi>Isa.</hi> 26.20. But when once they are gone, now God can shut up his Bowels against a Rebellious Nation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>USE,</hi> I. This truth may afford us help to unfold that Riddle of <hi>Divine Providence</hi>: at the which many are ready to stumble, <hi>viz.</hi> That Godly men are often suddenly and strang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken away, when wicked men are let alone and suffered to live. It is the Wise Man's ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 7.16. <hi>There is a Just man that perisheth in his Righteousness, and there is a wicked man that prolongeth his Life in wickedness.</hi> Let none suppose that God therfore discountenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth his Servants, and approves of ungodly men: no, the one is taken away in mercy to himself, though in judgement to the World, the other is spared to his greater misery, either here or here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after:

The Philosopher saith every thing hath two handles, a right and a wrong, and most men take Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in some cases by the wrong handle; they interpret many dispensations to be Judicial, and so indeed they may be; but their folly is, that they interpret them so to be in respect of the persons suffering them, when as it is indeed to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: when <hi>Solomon</hi> had with some consterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion viewed these things, he recollects himself, and draws this safe conclusion, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 8.12. <hi>Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I know that it shall be well with them that fear God</hi>: and so it shall; but woe to the World when holy Men flo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>USE,</hi> II. This may serve to reprehend their folly who are weary of the company of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men: they think that the World hath been troubled with them even long enough; they look upon them as Enemies, as busie bodies, as
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:000380_0162_0FA4FE6072EF2B58"/>
men that are the troublers of <hi>Israel,</hi> and no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy can be quiet for them (so wicked <hi>Ahab</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly censured holy <hi>Elijah.</hi>)</p>
                  <p>And hence,</p>
                  <p>They take it for certain that it would be much better for the place which they live in, if they were well laid up in their Graves: They wish them in Heaven, as the vulgar note of wicked men is: What do these men do, but in effect wish and imprecate upon themselves a mischief? Should God grant them their desires upon this account, it would but carry the godly to the place of their longing, and bring them home to the house of their eternal rest: But in the mean time when they are gone, who shall plead and pray and mourn for a sinful People? Will God hear wicked sinners? Who shall stand in the Gap to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Assure we our selves that so much of Godliness as goes away from a place, so much of God goes away too, and it may not be long ere the time comes, when those that so earnestly longed for their removal, and were inwardly satisfied and glad that they were taken away; shall as much wish that they had them again, when it will be too late.</p>

                     <hi>USE.</hi> III. For Tryal; is it so sometimes, then it may put us upon the enquiry, whether there be not good ground for us to fear that it may be so with us at this day. I might urge it
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:000380_0163_0FA4FE61C6FF3AB0"/>
more particularly to our selves of this Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from whom God hath of late years taken away many pious and precious Servants of his; and we that are left alive ought to lay it to heart: But I shall take libe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ty to urge it on a more pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick account as it bears respect to this People in general; and here give me leave to further this tryal, by leaving such things as these to consideration.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They are Apostatizing or declining times, by reason of which there is (doubtless) much of provocation offered to the holy Majesty of Heaven: I need not to seek out witnesses for this, <hi>Habemus confitentes reos</hi>; yea, and God himself hath also testified to it in his many awful and amazing providences: It is a thing too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest, that the power of Godliness is now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der great decayes, and many sins begin to look abroad, and dare to hold up their heads: And from hence we may safely conclude that it is a day of rebuke.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The faithful servants of God, who have been called to declare his mind in the most pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, and general Assemblies, have predicted and forewarned us of Judgement coming, except by repentance we prevent it: This hath been a point in which there hath been su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal concurrence, that we have abundant reason to conclude that there hath been much of the presence of God with them in it. They have
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:000380_0164_0FA4FE62B28E2380"/>
from one time to another solemnly warned us of, and called upon us to prepare for these cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mityes.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Since the time wherein God by his servants began to treat us with these warnings, his hand hath bin awfully out upon us in taking away eminent, useful, publique &amp; pious men: God hath since that time seemed to be upon quick dispat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in that busines, our eys have scarcely bin dry for one (though alas! they are too soon dry) but anothers death hath alarum'd us: the ancient pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars on which our foundations once stood strong are almost all gon, yea &amp; also many young ones, and very likely to have bin eminently usefull, to have bin placed in their roomes, and hopefull to have made up the breach have bin pluckt out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen, as it were by force.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is sadly observable, that the spirit of zeal for God, and Holiness, hath died apace with them. We may in a deplorable degree say of our times, not only that the godly men die, but that they cease: we are not now put to it to know whom to employ in our publick concerns in the Magistracy and Ministry, yea, and other places or weight, by reason of multiplicity of choice, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="5">5. Nor is it a little to be lamented, that those men dye in a great measure unlamented; yea, by too many reproached: and this is the sad note of our <hi>Context,</hi> men lay it not to heart, nor consider the hand of God in these things. Now let us lay all these things together, and see if they do not solemnly speak that we have reason to be afraid that God hath removed them in order to some sore and dreadful calamity which he is preparing for us, except he be in time preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and therefore.</p>

The truth of this our Prophet here experienced; who, being sent by God on an unthankful errand (for when men love the distemper, they do by consequence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise the remedy, and hate him that brings it. And I therefore call it unthankful, not from its own nature, for what can be a more obliging courtesie than to give men timely notice of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent dangers, &amp; counsel how to avoid them? But from the disposition of those who were to receive it, whom custom in sin had wedded to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency in it; whose pride and presumption had made them inpatient of all threatnings; and in whom deep rooted impenitence had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed

the reception of every advice calling them to reformation) being thus sent, he faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and clearly opens their state, shews them their hazzards, directs to such duties as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent circumstances required, promiseth them a good issue, if they were so followed, but denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth ruine if they were neglected. And now (as if he had been guilty of Treason, and had joyned hands in some dangerous conspiracy) the Priests, Prophets, and People, in a trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of fury, lay violent hands on him in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Temple, and nothing can satisfie their hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish rage but the Prophets life. The Princes, (who, though possibly they had but little, if any thing more of Religion then the rest, yet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to more civility) enterpose in this fray, and call the matter to a legal hearing; which (by the over-ruling providence of God) determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in his delivery out of their hands.</p>
                  <p>The Principal things observable in this trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action, are, the Peoples Accusation, and <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi>'s Apology. The former is briefly touched in <hi>vers.</hi> 11. in which, while they pretend to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse, they undertake to Judge, and with a full cry pronounce him a man of death. <hi>This man is worthy to dye</hi>; or, <hi>the judgement of death is for this man,</hi> as the <hi>Hebrew</hi> text reads it: Which lest they should seem to have spoken of prejudice, they article against him for sedition: <hi>For he hath spoken against this City</hi>: nor need witnesses be

sought, for they themselves had <hi>heard it with their ears.</hi> We see what different interpretations the words and actions of men ly open unto; how change of times changeth mens opinions of things; how dangerous it is for men to speak the truth in Apostatizing times. <hi>Micah</hi> the <hi>Morast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hite</hi> delivered a more fearful, because a more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive Prophesie, in the dayes of <hi>Hezekiah, Mic.</hi> 3.12. Zion <hi>shall be plowed as a field, and</hi> Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem <hi>shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house, as the high places of the forrest.</hi> And yet was not branded for a turbulent person, nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted as a ring-leader of sedition; but received as a Prophet of the Lord, and his prediction improved to repentance, which averted eminent desolation. <hi>Jeremiah</hi> so threatens calamity, as withal to promise mercy, in case of sound repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; and he is an offender, prophesieth against the City, and no less than his blood can serve to expiate his crime. How happy a thing is it to preach to a pious Generation, who, because they hate their sins, love their reprovers? How unhappy to come to a People wedded to their wicked wayes, who count those their enemies who are so to their lust? As for the Prophets Apology, I need, for the present occasion, to take notice only of the just defence which he makes both of himself and his prophesie, which is contained in the <hi>Text.</hi> The Persons before whom he makes it are the Princes, and all the
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:000380_0173_0FA4FE6C28B3C4F0"/>
People; under whom we may list the Priests and Prophets, unless we look on these as his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusers, and the other, as those to whom he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals as Judges.</p>
                  <p>The Vindication it self consists of two Parts.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A clearing up of the Authority by which he had spoken; <hi>Their Lord</hi> (Jehovah) <hi>sent me to prophesie</hi>: Divine Authority gives a supersede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as to humane Laws: They may make it Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital to speak against their wayes and doings; but if God Authorize his Servants to it, it is no Crime in them, but a duty to cry aloud and not to spare.</p>
                  <p>The Prophets Commission comprizeth the full of their Accusation: He might have prophesied against other Nations without their offences; but that he doth it against this City, this is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation: He therefore asserts his particular charge, <hi>To prophesie against this House and this City: Grotius</hi> indeed lenifies the expression, and would have the words read, <hi>To this House, and to this City</hi>: Noting that the prophesie was for them, and not against them: And indeed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing and awakening preaching would be so, if a People had wisdom and grace rightly to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it: But suppose it against them, yet if God be against a People, and would have them to know it, should the Prophet obey man or God? Especially, if he exceeds not the bounds of his
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:000380_0174_0FA4FE6D3341A0B8"/>
commission, which <hi>Jeremiah</hi> here further asserts for the Lord sent him <hi>to speak all the words which they had heard</hi>; he had not added one of his own head: And must the Herald be impeached for proclaiming the King's Edicts?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The end of his prophesie, <hi>viz.</hi> if it might be to prevent their ruine, which he therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers in way of Exhortation; <hi>Therefore now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend your wayes and your doings,</hi> &amp;c. I name that Exhortation as a branch of his defence, because he doth therein explicate what he had before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered in the prophesie it self. <hi>Vers.</hi> 3. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so insinuates that his errand and business was not to triumph over them, but compassionately to endeavour the prevention of all the evil de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced: It is, <hi>q. d.</hi> Wherein have I offended? I have only studied your peace and safety; only advised to means of delivery and establishment, and is this a Crime? Must I dye for this? He therefore gives them a safe direction, and backs it with a perswasive encouragement.</p>
                  <p>The Direction is to Repentance and Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and designs the rectifying both of heart and life, projects and practices. <hi>Amend,</hi> the word is, <hi>make good,</hi> noteing they had been bad, which called for amendment or refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. <hi>Your way and doings: Calvin</hi> reads it, <hi>your wayes and studies</hi>: The word signifies a thing done by study, plotting, design and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration: <hi>And obey the voice of the Lord your God.</hi>
                     <pb n="169" facs="unknown:000380_0175_0FA4FE6DA69EC3B8"/>
The word is, <hi>Hear,</hi> and is the frequent Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture expression of obedience: By the voice of God as intended the will of God delivered in his Word, intimating that he brought no new Commands to them, but only studied to reduce them to the obedience of God's Law, of which they professed themselves the subjects (if they would studiously consider, and compare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves by it) they might easily know their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent course to be Judged and Condemned.</p>
                  <p>The encouragement is full, and clears the Prophet from the imputation of any studied mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, in as much as he gives them to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that if his Counsel be imbraced<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and faithfully put in execution all the threatnings of wrath and ruine shall cease, as having attained their appointed end.</p>
                  <p>Hence,</p>
                  <p>He brings in God as clothed with humane af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, ready to sympathize with the miseries of a penitent People, and reverse the sentence passed against them. <hi>The Lord shall repent, &amp;c.</hi> The word firstly signifies to be grieved and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for one, and then to repent of any thing we have said or done against them, and finally to change ones mind, or alter ones purpose. But is God capable of perturbation? Can the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely blessed Being suffer any disturbance or grief? Or can the immutable and everlasting will of God be changed? No, but an unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:000380_0176_0FA4FE6EA3C1F228"/>
Decree, may ordain changeable Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and an immutable God may vary his works according to the changes of the subject, and all this agreeably to invariable counsel: And there may be such effects wrought, which, to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of men, proceed from a different prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple. God had pronounced a sentence of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation against <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> but if they repent the sentence shall not take effect, but cease.</p>
                  <p>Hence.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Septuagint</hi> translates it, he shall cease, or desist; which gives the true intent of the phrase, though not the <hi>Grammatical</hi> construction of the Word.</p>
                  <p>There are two conclusions, proper from the Words, and pertinent to the present occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, offer themselves to our meditation, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Doct. 1. <hi>When God commissioneth his Ministers, to denounce awful threatnings against an Apostatiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Generation, they must deliver, and these ought to apply them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is to the one a warrant for Justification, &amp; to the other a warning for serious consideration. It is true, it is not every ones place and work. He had need be able to say, <hi>The Lord sent me,</hi> that will undertake to pronounce a sentence full of woes upon a whole People; yea, and through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

to ponder every word, that he may be sure he shall have God himself to patronize him. But if God do indeed say, <hi>Go and prophesie, and speak all these words in their hearing,</hi> it would be rebellion in them to keep silence, and will be pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>nicious for that People who receive them not.</p>
                  <p>The way indeed wherein the Prophets of old received intimation of the will of God, <hi>viz.</hi> By Visions, Dreams, immediate Revelations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As it was extraordinary, so it is now shut up: But yet there remains a more sure word of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie, and no less infallible evidence of God's mind in general, and our call in particular,</p>
                  <p>For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Christ's Ministers are set as Watch-men, under a solemn and strict charge, to look out and espy all approaching dangers, and give timely warning of them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3.17, 18. They must give the alarum though it be at mid-night, when it is like to be most surprizing, and men are loth to be bereaved of their beloved sleep. Men naturally love security, and like not to be disturbed: But what shall those Watch men do? Christ hath placed them on the Watch-tower, and put a Trumpet in their hands, charging them upon pain of death to sound when occasion calls for it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The spiritual presence of Christ with his faithful Messengers abides perpetually engaged
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:000380_0178_0FA4FE721CDCCB40"/>
to stand by them, and afford them all the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary assistance which their Calling and Duty doth require. Were it not for this their charge were insupportable, their burden intolerable; for, <hi>Who is sufficient for these things?</hi> But he hath given his word for it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Word of God is a sure rule by which to discover the true and proper state of any Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, so far forth as to afford sufficient light and direction for their warning, if we compare them thereby. It is true, the soveraignty of his secret will is not there stinted, nor can we from thence certainly determine what God will undoubtedly do with these or those: Neither did God alwayes discover this to his Prophets of old, nor yet did they so understand him. <hi>Jonah</hi> upon this very suspicion waved his errand, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.2. <hi>Was not this my saying in my Country? Therefore I fled un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> Tarshish, <hi>for I knew thou art a gracious God, &amp;c.</hi> But yet the Word of God evidently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, when it is that a People comes within the compass, of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>reatning, when they are cast in common Law. Gods revealed will is one and perpetual: If men break Covenant with God, and falsify their engagements to him; if they bring themselves under the threatnings of the word, there is a sentence out against them, and those that are God's Watch-men may espy it. If then they declare against such wayes, and
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:000380_0179_0FA4FE736C1A4498"/>
proclaim that there is Wrath gone forth, and Calamities before us, even at the door, and daily to be expected, they herein say not a word more than what they have God's warrant and Command for.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. God sometimes gives his servants a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, special opportunity to declare his mind against a sinful Generation. Thus he did unto <hi>Jeremiah</hi> at this time, when the people were ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered out of all their cityes to one of the great feasts at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and there was a general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of them to the Temple. And when it is thus, to omit the improving a price in our hands, is to play the fool egregiously. The wise-man tells us their is a season to every pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, and sometimes this season comes once and no more, the neglect whereof proves ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reparable, and leaves a woful sting upon the Conscience.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. There are also sometimes deep and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full impressions upon the minds of God's Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers, which by an irresistible impulse, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain them to bear open and publick witness a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the sins of the times and places which they live in. I am far from pleading for, or justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing that looks like <hi>Euthusiasm,</hi> or think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that men should make a secret <hi>impetus</hi> upon their spirits the rule and plea of their words and actions. But, if men who are called by God to declare his counsels, advantaged by his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:000380_0180_0FA4FE74B29927D0"/>
to proclaim his pleasure, directed by his word to speak nothing but what is agreeing there unto; are prest in their spirits to a zealous wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness bearing against these and those prevailing sins and solemnly to denounce the Judgements of God against them, if men repent not. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve there is much of God in it, and it carries a great evidence along with it, that God is about to do some speedy, strange work there, if he be not prevented. When we are in such a frame as our Prophet was, <hi>Jer.</hi> 20.9. <hi>His word was in my heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I was weary with forbearing, and could not stay.</hi> Or as <hi>Elih<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>And when it is thus, it concerns such a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to apply these things to themselves: It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes them not now to take exceptions and grow into a rage, but to lay them to heart. These things are of God, and not in vain: They ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum a People to prepare to meet their God; and if by repentance they are not rendred heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them, they will prove killing words: The sword of his mouth will hew them in pieces, <hi>Hos.</hi> 6.5. <hi>I have hewed them by my Prophets, and slain them by the words of my mouth.</hi> God is not wont to let such words perish, and come to nought; yea, though he may defer to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish, yet he will not disanul them: They may be deferred a while, but they ly in reserve against the due time.</p>

Of what efficacy this is will appear, if we shall consider.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That this is the priviledge of a People in visible Covenant with God, that there is no threatning denounced against them, but with a gracious reserve and room to reverse it in case of Repentance. God sometimes indeed seems to speak positively, but then, to lenefie such abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute threatnings, and render them equivalent to
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:000380_0182_0FA4FE75EC2233D8"/>
Hypothetical, he speaks after the manner of men, of repenting. God imitates his own Law, for in making of War, he first proffers Peace, and presents men with termes of compliance: When he takes up armes, he would be glad if there were some to hold his hands: When he saith I will do thus, yet then he wisheth <hi>Israel to prepare to meet him, Amos</hi> 4.12. If a People of God suffer at his hands, it shall be through their own wilfulness. God can threaten and never execute, and yet be God unchangeable, alwayes provided his People do truely repent and amend their wayes and doings.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. God therefore sends his Ambassadours to plead with his People about their sins, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish his Judgements, that they may have motive and opportunity to repent. Divine threatnings are Expostulatory and awakening: They are to convince men of their sin, and to put them in aw: They are to see if words will do that blows may be spared. After threatnings therefore God hearkens, <hi>Jer.</hi> 8.6. <hi>I hearkened and heard, but they spake not aright.</hi> God might else strike as well as menace; yea, it were as easie, nay and as merciful for him so to do, were it not that he had rather men should live than dye.</p>
                  <p>Hence therefore,</p>
                  <p>The Proclamations of War which God makes against a revolting People. are to be annumerat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his long-suffering.</p>

                     <pb n="177" facs="unknown:000380_0183_0FA4FE76AA50DAF0"/>3. This only can put a stop to the wrath of God from proceeding; for, as the promise is s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So that when God hath a purpose of mercy to a rebellious Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and is resolved to exalt his Grace upon them, and also makes known these purposes in those discoveries which we call absolute Promises, he doth it so as not to cross this Rule of his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with People, and therefore engageth not only to give deliverance from his Judgements; but also to do it in such a way, as withal to give them the condition, <hi>Isa.</hi> 57.18. <hi>I have seen his wayes, and I will heal him,</hi> &amp;c.

God expresseth himself better pleased at the Repentance of his People, and thereby ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguishing of the fire of his anger, than if it had burnt up and consumed them. He therefore gives oath that he delights not in their death, professeth that he rejoyceth in their returning: like a tender Father, who is glad if any means

will reclaim his refractory, and disobedient Son whom he loveth, and for whose good he longs.</p>

As I would not give flattering words, lest God should destroy me, so neither would I designedly provoke or move any to anger, except it be at his sins. I shall therefore endeavour to speak words of truth and soberness; and yet chuse rather to offend man than provoke the most high.</p>
                  <p>There are two Uses I have to suggest, unto which I shal reduce those few words which I have to speak; the one by way of Conviction, the other of Exhortation.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For Conviction: Let us solemnly consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and rightly weigh whether or no those words which have been spoken against this Place
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:000380_0185_0FA4FE7830499668"/>
and People on such occasions as this, were not such words as God commanded those that deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered them to come and speak. I must confess, when I seriously look upon this People in their constitution Civil and Ecclesiastical, molded in the one under wholsome Laws, in the other un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der strict and sacred Covenants: When I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider that the management of these is under the hands of a Pious and Prudent Magistracy, a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and learned Ministry: When I think how many there are whose hearts are upright with God, and do not wickedly depart from his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant: When I mind that by the very confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of unprejudiced strangers, here is more of sobriety and honest conversation, then almost in any place they have occasion to be conversant in: It seems hard to believe that God who is full of Mercy and Pity, who knows this frame of ours, and minds that we are but dust, should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare against us, though many infirmities should appear in the midst of us: And could be willing to think that all the warnings &amp; menaces which have been uttered by these or those, were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but the mistakes of an irregular) though well minded) zeal, or the dumps and night vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of some melancholick spirits, and thus indeed were the Prophets of old censured. But when I throughly weigh all circumstances in an equal ballance, I dare not but conclude that the Lord hath sent them to speak all these words. What
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:000380_0186_0FA4FE7BB33859B8"/>
they have spoken is for the most part upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, and commended to us in Print: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we are impeached for degenercy, threatned with the Judgements of God if we amend not; and thence solemnly advised and invited to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.

                  <p n="6">6. The Grounds and Reasons of these threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings are found in the midst of us. They have not only declared the anger of an holy and jeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous God, but also drawn up our indictment, and entered God's Plea against us, and fully answered all our reasons of appeal: They have shewn <hi>Judah</hi> their Transgressions, and the house of <hi>Jacob</hi> their Sins; yea, such sins as according to
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:000380_0189_0FA4FE7EF2F0C580"/>
the word of God (that rule of procedure between him and his People) are found to be incentives of Divine displeasure; such as raise up God's jealousie, and kindle his anger against those that are so found guilty of them: Nor yet have they done this of their own meer surmize:</p>
                  <p>But,</p>
                  <p n="7">7. We have, at least verbally, acknowledged a Judgement in many, yea, the most, if not all which they have charged us withal: Witness the proposed grounds for many days of fasting, issued out from those who stand as the representatives of this People: Witness the confessions and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments which have been on such dayes made unto God: And that which will stand up for a full clearing of this truth against us, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness the Records of the last Synod, in which we shall find the full and free consent of the Elders and Messengers of these Churches, acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the hand of God is out against this Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple awful in tokens of wrath; and giving him the Glory, by confessing that the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And shall we not yet believe? Or shall we say to <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> the Lord sent thee not, but <hi>Baruch</hi> stirreth thee up? Shall we say, we have such a Magistracy, such a Ministry, such Churches, and therefore
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:000380_0190_0FA4FE7FA32FDFA0"/>
what need we to fear? When did <hi>Micah</hi> say, Zion <hi>shall be ploughed as a field</hi>? Was it not in the dayes of good <hi>Hezekiah</hi>? When did God say <hi>I will remove</hi> Jadah <hi>out of my sight</hi>? Or when did <hi>Zephaniah</hi> deliver his terrible prophesies, but in the dayes of godly <hi>Josiah?</hi> All I shall here add is thus much: If God's faithful Messengers are to be believed when speaking from God himself; if the Word of God be to be credited which they have delivered to us; if the concurrence of so many (divers of whom are now with God) be of any weight,; if Providence may be thought to speak any thing, and the Rod have a voice in it; if to be self-Judged and Condemned be of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny efficacy; then there is an hand-writing of God given out against us; and therefore let it be.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For Exhortation: Be we perswaded to make it our serious endeavour, by an universal and through Repentance to seek a way to escape the after effects of God's displeasure. Let us o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the voice of the Lord our God; let us amend, and God will repent.</p>
                  <p>I might urge many things strongly argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentative to press the great necessity of this Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, let it suffice to give some brief hints.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Remember your Profession to the World. How oft have you given it out that your design, and main business here is to promote the service of Christ, and maintain the interest of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel;
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:000380_0191_0FA4FE806A982108"/>
Which is then only upheld when a People stick close to the Law and to the Testimony, walking by the holy Rules of Scripture, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the revealed will of God in his Word, and can only be your Glory among the Nations, and will be so if you thus do, otherwise your very profession will be your shame.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Remember your Covenants, and solemn Engagements to be the Lords. How you have called God to witness, and bound your selves in an oath and a curse to serve God, and him on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: How you have avouched him to be your Lord and Law-giver, and renounced the gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of your own wills and lusts. And if you ly under breach of Covenant, and can so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent your selves, and not return again to the Lord, how can you escape from bringing your selves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the dreadful guilt of taking his name in vain. To the vindication whereof, his holiness stands firmly engaged.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Forget not your own Confession. How oft have ye made large and full declarations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst your selves? Such hath been the evident and notorious declination of the power of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, and manifest growth of iniquity, that we have been constrained to confess it, God hath extorted it out of our mouths: And know this, that sins confessed and not repented of will be an heavy indictment against a People, profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing themselves the servants of God, when out of
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:000380_0192_0FA4FE8126AF7CF8"/>
their mouths they shall be Judged, and many stripes shall be inflicted on such as knew the Lords will and did it not.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Think how many Calls you have had to Repentance. The mercies of God to our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and continued to our selves; by these God expostulates, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.5. <hi>What iniquity did your Fathers find in me, that ye are gone so far away?</hi> And vers. 31. <hi>Have I been a Wilderness to</hi> Israel, <hi>a land of darkness</hi>? The Judgements of God which have been upon the land; these are Doctrinal, <hi>Isa.</hi> 26.9. <hi>When thy Judgements are in the Earth, the Inhabitants of the World shall learn Righteousness.</hi> The Patience of God wherein he hath given you a space to repent, this is not forgotten, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.21. <hi>I gave her a space to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and she Repented not.</hi> The continual cry of the Ministry by powerful convictions, severe comminations, gracious promises followed with earnest and unwearied entreaties; God keeps a Register of these, <hi>Jer.</hi> 25.4, 5. <hi>The Lord hath sent unto you all his Prophets, rising up early, and sending them: They said, turn again every one from his evil way,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. God hath thoughts of good for you, if you will Repent. He hath not forgotten the love of your Fathers, who followed him into a Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness, a Land that was not sown: He hath a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect for the faithful in the land: Though the Ax be up, and ready to fall, yet he sees a few clus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:000380_0193_0FA4FE8284C3D940"/>
and will say spare it, for there is a blessing in it. And I cannot but be perswaded that God hath good things yet in reserve for <hi>New-England</hi>; but he expects your reformation, and that you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge and turn from your sins. And yet I am afraid there is more to do, and some severe tryals to befal us in order to this: For God will do for his People in waves suitable to his own ends, and such which shall recommend him to be a God glorious in Holiness.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Know it, there yet wants such a Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance as God requires; and that notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all that he hath said or done. Though he hath convinced us, counselled us, warned, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, smitten, renewed his Judgements with breach upon breach, altered his course, tryed us in one fire, and after in another, the old scent yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains: This may be the burden of the Song, and make up the period of every plea, <hi>yet have ye not returned to me, saith the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. Our persent condition and exigencies call for speedy Repentance. It will be our wisdom and can alone be our safety,: Men are against us, and that which is most awful, to consider, is, God seems to be against us too. Providences look to an eye of reason, as if they were conspir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to bring a further day of trouble upon us. On all the Glory, whereon there was sometimes a defence, there now appears to be a blast. We are brought low in our outward affairs, and low
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:000380_0194_0FA4FE82A21B1FF8"/>
in spiritual things, and some sudden and doleful change looks as if it were at the door. But if we may recover Gods gracious presence, and re-engage his protection, all shall be well: Yet if not now done, a few dayes may summe up and cancel our felicity, and we be left to sigh out our Ichabod.</p>
                  <p>I shal not need to be prolix in the directive part of this use, since divers that have gone before me, have largely unfolded our particular estate, and prescribed rules for our recovery: Both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed us what there is of sin prevailing, and wherein we may so testifie our Repentance as to obtain a repeal of that sentence which hath been past against us. Yet if I could help to drive home any of these nails, I should think it labour not in vain. I need but say, if you will believe the Messengers of Christ; nay, if you will but believe your selves and your own confessions, there is work enough cut out for your reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Do but amend cordially what you have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to be amiss, and I dare affirm that God will accept it, I shall not so far trespass on the time, and other occasions as to urge every particular: It may suffice to hint at some things which seem especially to call for our speedy and extraordinary endeavours, and these do more immediately concern.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The body of this People considered as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested with liberties, and engaged as one man
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:000380_0195_0FA4FE83AA491E78"/>
for the upholding of them in wayes according to God. Let me tell you that <hi>for the Division of</hi> Reuben <hi>there are great searching of heart.</hi> These jealousies and suspitions one to another, those minings and counterminings that are among you, those aspersions and defamations which you cast one upon another, and upon your best friends, those endeavours to strengthen a Party, and countermand your brethren, are provoking to God, and like to prove ruinating to your selves. It is not a sin only, but a Judgement too, and that which tends to issue in misery, <hi>Hos.</hi> 10.2. <hi>Their heart is divided, now shall they be found guilty.</hi> Gal. 5.15. <hi>If ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another.</hi> Your security is in being one for God: your safety is only in unity. There are enough abroad who watch for your halting, you need not your selves lay open one anothers infirmities: And one would think it might sufficiently awaken you to think how little Gods work goes forward, or his Glory strenuously promoted, whiles men spend their little zeal in oppositions and inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctives one against another, as if herein lay the life of Religion. This picks out the cement, and crumbleth away the mortar, which is the strength of the building, and when gone, with what ease may it be made to fall? To remedy this, put on charity. When God's People agree in the end, though for a while they may not
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:000380_0196_0FA4FE8421A66910"/>
Judge alike of the means to it in some critical points and circumstance, it is far from a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian spirit so to abound in our own sense, as to proclaim or declare such enemies to the cause of God, that speak not in every punctilio with us. Men of the largest charity here, are the best friends to this Cause. It is Gods will and wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom that his People should in many things beat out their way by debates: But men that may not be thwarted in their own private sentiments, are dangerous Coals, fitted to kindle a destroying fire among us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. These Churches as tyed up in the strictest bonds of Covenant to be the Lords: Whose great receding from, and manifold notorious breaches of this Covenant of God, do strongly call for, and vehemently urge, solemn and seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous renewals of it before him. Essayes towards this, I confess, have been made by several Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: But what damps and demurs are cast on the work by the many that hold back, is matter of lamentation: And truly the reason rendred by many makes it still the more lamentable, <hi>viz.</hi> Left it should encrease the guilt of the Churches through neglect of performance.

to God at all, and say to him, <hi>We are Lords and will come no more unto thee?</hi> All I will here urge is this; if these Churches are not prepared to renew their Covenant with God, they are not prepared for mercy: If the way of our Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasie be more dangerous than our state of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasie, our danger is tremendous: If all confess that spiritual slumber, luke-warmness, earthly-mindedness, slighting of Ordinances, underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luing of the Messengers of Christ, carnal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with the World, and many the like evils are crept into, and prevail much over our Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and the Covenant-People of God are not capable of a resolute, strenuous, and voluntary engagement to the rooting of these out, our wound is next to incurable.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To the representative body of this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment assembled in General-Court; on whom it lyes as an indispensible duty to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the maintainance of God's Glory, and to put forth utmost care for the securing of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of the true Religion, and extirpation of that which is false. The prevalency of corrupt Doctrines, and impudent boldness of many in prosecution of them, calls for your vigilant and resolute industry in the suppression thereof. I am not ignorant to how much calumny I expose my self in mentioning this point; but it is in Gods cause which I may not decline for fear of reproach. I have often heard (though, I must
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:000380_0198_0FA4FE88A9C64E30"/>
needs confess, not without some secret regrets) the Encomiastick titles put upon this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as if it were singularly a Theocrasy, and carried in it a glorious specimen of the Kingly Government of Christ: But I fear, if this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment decline, or think it not their concern vigorously to extend their power in upholding the duties of the first Table, and secure them from the invasion of perverse men, these will be found no more than a few empty Hyperbolies. I confess, your legislative power is limited, and must take its measure from your Charter; nor do I advise to exceed that which God's provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence hath invested you withal. I believe it shal never be charged as a sin upon you, that you did (with grief of heart) bear with those things which you could not regularly confront. But if men, upon pretence of Conscience (and who will not pretend it, if they may find it a shelter against Justice,?) If thus, I say, they may be suffered (though it be in your hand to oppose them) without any restraint to run to and fro. Disseminate their erronious principles, make breaches in Churches, undermine and seduce silly souls, set up their Posts by God's Posts, enjoy as free and publick liberty to carry on their own wayes, as those Churches of Christ whom you profess to countenance and defend, and that by a total silence, and a full connivance; if thus you can tolerate the dishonour of Christ, let me

                  <p n="4">4. To the Honoured Magistrates, and all such as have an Executive power in their hands. It is an observation of one, that nothing is more dangerous and disgraceful than to suffer Laws to ly by unprofitable, for want of Execution. The best Laws, if only promulgated and not pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, will not promote a Reformation. Some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed are of the mind, that it is good to have Laws as a Testimony of your dislike of such &amp; such practices though never prosecuted against the breakers of them: But, besides that the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating of one Law with impunity, will naturally embolden to a like violation of others, under the same presumption; such Laws will indeed be a witness, not for, but against a People, that they thought, and were in conscience perswad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it was their duty, but had not courage or zeal enough to put it in execution. There are many sins, some very crying; profane and scandalous Sabbath breaking, beastly drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, desperate cursing and swearing, woeful and miserable idleness: There are good and wholsome Laws against those sins, let there be such a check and restraint laid upon them, that our streets may not be witness of them: If these do prevail, God hath said that the Land shall mourn for them: Great industry and zeal is needful here when sin is grown impudent; the

exerting of it will be your honour, and by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing these things, you shall verifie the title God hath dignified you withal, that you are Shields of the Earth.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. To the Reverend Elders, the Messengers of Christ, that you be faithful to God, to this People, and to your own Souls: in particular much to study and preach the sins of the times and places you live in. God hath placed us as Watch-men to descry danger, and give due war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of approaching evil. Let us be faithful in our places, vigilant in our work, much in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, seeking to find out the mind of God, and not afraid with boldness to declare it though the times may seem hardly to resent us. We have an account to give for Souls, and God will demand of us what is become of those who were committed to our charge. Above all let us take care to do as we say, and be ensamples to the Flocks: It may be, by this means you shal not only save your selves, but also those that hear you. Beware of being Idol-Shepherds; they are evil times we live in, men love to be let a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone and encouraged in sin, but let us have no fellowship with their works of darkness, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reprove them. In all your dealings with men be plain and faithful: Some may for that say with <hi>Ahab, Art thou he that troubleth</hi> Israel? But be not angry but compassionate, and mourn in secret for them. Let us study to be men of

                  <p>To hasten towards a Conclusion, I shall strike but one blow more on these nails, to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten them, and so recommend all unto him who is the great Master of the Assemblies. It is an opinion which some seem strongly to be built upon, and it renders them strangely presumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, <hi>viz.</hi> That the foundations of this People are unmovable; that our civil constitutions, and Church Covenants have so engaged the presence of God with us, that we ly out of the reach of forraign mischief.

renowned places, which once enjoyed as much of Gods presence with them as any in the World, do stand for monumental witnesses, The more of God hath sometimes been among you, the greater is your sin, and the speedier may be your Calamity, If growing weary of his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment you abuse all your liberties to desperate li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiousness. There is nothing so dear or preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous unto God, or sticks so close and near unto him, but if it once comes to interfear with his Glory (which is his beloved end, and he will upon no pretence part withal) he can remove it far enough from him. See, <hi>Jer.</hi> 22.24, 25. You have here the only remedy to recover a sick and dying People,; this will, nothing else will affect it. True Repentance, and through Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation never come in vain, though when Judgement was gathered into a thick Cloud and ready, yea, beginning to drop down in a storm of fury, but it hath blown it over. This God proffered <hi>Judah</hi> here when they were almost ripe for ruine; and this God once again this day proffers to you. Oh, be not proud and stiff-necked! be not obstinate and rebellious! Why will you dye? Obey the voice of the Lord, do what he bids, do what your Consciences say you ought to do, do what you have before God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed your selves guilty for, because you have neglected to do it: Do what all reason and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty requires, and for the omission whereof you

But if all that is said from time to time, be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regarded; if these counsels prove as water spilt upon a rock; and though you can lend an ear to hear these words with patience, yet will not do them, but can slightly cast them out of your minds, and throw them behind your backs; they will stand on record against you, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a farther aggravation of your guilt: And in that day when all those things shall come to pass, of which you have been so frequently and solemnly warned, and the Lord shall suffer none of the the words of his Servants to fall to the ground.

truths into a little room, and binding them up as so many portable Jewels, for the better accomodation of the Christian Pilgrim in his Journey, challengeth our more diligent attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on them. The words before us are a choise <hi>Elixir,</hi> or precious Cordial, extracted on purpose to comfort the hearts of the People of God, and keep them from fainting, when they see all the wit in the World, and the deepest polititi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of earth and hell gathered into a combinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on against them.</p>
                  <p>In the Words are two things observable:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A presumption or supposition of a deep and desperate conspiracy, in which we may consider.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. The Conspirators, who are not plainly named, but are tacitly Characterized; and we are to suppose them to be the deepest heads and profoundest Counsellors in the World: Men of <hi>Wisdom, Understand and Counsel.</hi> Devils also may, without force to the <hi>Text</hi> be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended under them, those perspicatious spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, who are of a vast intelligence and long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. The quality of the Conspiracy, intimated to be made with the maturest deliberation which the farthest reach of the most politick created understanding could attain unto. Whither so many several things be aimed at in the divers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of our <hi>Text,</hi> as by wisdom, a natural
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:000380_0206_0FA4FE91CA21B830"/>
callidity, and excellent ability to contrive means most sutable to the fairest attainment of our end; by understanding, an experimental knowledge gathered by Observation and History, built u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, and further accomplishing of that natural sagacity; and by counsel an improving of both the former by deepest study and consultation, contriving how they may with best security of the success accommodate means to their design: or whither by the accumulation of so many words be only intended to set forth the height of mens wit and industry in this plot, is not much materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al: either way, we are to suppose these Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratours to have done their best, and made the conjur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t on as stronge and secure as their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined wits can possibly devise.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Object against whom this conspiracy is made, <hi>against the Lord.</hi> The word translated <hi>against,</hi> sometimes signifies before, or in the presence, and so one Translatour renders it, <hi>q. d.</hi> Man's counsel is vain, or to no purpose, whiles God looks on, or because God seeth it. But the word is also frequently used adversatively, to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie <hi>against,</hi> and so the generality of Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and interpreters do here carry it. And it is the Lord [Jehovah] against whom men are thus supposed to take counsel: and here we are not only to look upon such as included within the plot, and here intended, who by open and professed hostility do take up Arms directly
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:000380_0207_0FA4FE92694648C0"/>
against God, saying with proud <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> in dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing defiance, <hi>who is the Lord that I should let Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael go?</hi> but it also extends unto all those who do collaterally oppose themselves against him, and such are all they who do.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Seek to overthrow his purposes, &amp; decrees, and by their own counsels to disanul his, hoping to establish them, notwithstanding he hath o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise determined. Thus did <hi>Joseph</hi>'s breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren seek all courses to frustrate the counsel of God which he had signified, about the advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their brother.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Labour to nullifie his promises, and make his word, by which he hath engaged himself to his People, to fall to the ground; seeking to throw blocks in the way of his providence, which may give check to his procedure to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance: Thus <hi>Saul</hi> sought by all means to hinder <hi>David</hi> from receiving the promised Crown.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Contrive how they may subvert, and root the true Religion out of the World, by destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the sincere fearers of God, and suppressing the true profession of his Name: As <hi>Sanballa</hi> &amp; <hi>Tobijah</hi> did against the <hi>Jews,</hi> when they were weak and feeble.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We have the disappointing, defeating, and total routing of this treacherous plot, intimated in that expression, <hi>there is none</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Which negative particle is three times inculcated in the Original

                     <hi>Text</hi>; insinuating that it is a truth, not dark and dubious, but notorious.</p>
                  <p>We are not to interpret the wise man as if he intended to assert that there were no such designs at all, as though he denied the being of such a thing, that cannot be his meaning, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture often asserts the quite contrary, and the Records of the Church tell us, and experience hath proved it too true, that in all ages, there have been such conclaves as these, bandying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Lord and his anointed. His true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention therefore is, that all such undertakings are wholly succes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ess; that they study and plot in vain and to no purpose; that they are so fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated and disappointed that they become as if they had never been. God enjoyes himself in as much security and tranquillity, and is as far from being endangered by them, as if there had been none at all: They do not so much as disturb him.</p>
                  <p>Hence,</p>
                  <p>Doct. <hi>The strongest Conspiracies, and most subtle combinations against Gods purposes, promises and People, shall be altogether ineffectual.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let the wisest men upon earth, and the most knowing Devils in hell, proceed with the most mature deliberation, lay all their heads together, take never so much time to consult, find out the

The Scripture is so full for this both with Testimonies and Examples, that it would be endless to essay the producings of all that is there recorded for the evidence of it. See how the Psalmist expresses it, <hi>Psal.</hi> 2. begin. Where he brings in the enemies sitting at the Counsel-Table, beating their brains, and contriving how they may prevent God in his design: And God in the mean while deriding and scoffing at all their enterprizes, and in despite of them all giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing being to his decrees, and accomplishing his word: So true is that of the wise-man, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19 21. <hi>There are many devices in a man's heart, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless the Counsel of the Lord that shall stand.</hi> We may take up the explication of the Doctrine in these following propositions.</p>

                     <hi>Pro.</hi> 1. That there alwayes have been, and still are those in the World, who are designedly set against the Lord. There are such desperate and fool-hardy ones, that bend all their wits and power against the God of heaven. And if any should enquire, who these <hi>Nimrods</hi> be? Or
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:000380_0210_0FA4FE956CBE0290"/>
where these Gyants dwell? I answer in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, every wicked man is he that so doth: It is part of his description given, <hi>Job</hi> 15.25, 26. <hi>He stretcheth out his hand against God, and strengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himself against the Almighty, &amp;c.</hi> But in a more especial manner, all those that set them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves against God's People to oppress, persecute, and as far as in them lyes to root them out, are herein accounted by the word of truth, to stand against God. So the Psalmist, <hi>Psal.</hi> 83.3. with 5. <hi>They have taken crafty counsel against thy Peo-People: — They are confederate against thee.</hi> They may possibly in words confess God and Christ; yea, and be so foolish as to think they do God the best service, when they do the most against his servants<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But still God takes them for his enemies; and when was the World with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out such since <hi>Cain</hi>'s time?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pro.</hi> 2. That the Ring-leaders and principal Agents among God's enemies, are men of the greatest natural wit and understanding: So that if events were to be judged of according to the quality of instruments they would be thought most likely to speed. If there be a plot laid against Gods <hi>Davids,</hi> you shall hear that the Worlds <hi>Achitophels</hi> (those Oracles of Policy) are in it. The Devil, if at any time he finds any that are singularly witty, useth with most endeavours to make them notoriously wicked, and seeks to fill their hearts with deepest pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudices
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:000380_0211_0FA4FE96238D45C8"/>
against the wayes and People of God: He useth more than ordinary care, to make such men his own. That observation of our Saviours is too observable to be questioned, <hi>Luk.</hi> 26.8. <hi>The Children of this World are in their generation wiser than the Children of light.</hi> The Apostle, when he would Charactarize those that stand on Gods side, and those that take part with his enemies, puts the greatest number of the wise and prudent of the World on the adverse part, and finds a very few standing on God's side, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.26. <hi>Not many wise.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Pro.</hi> 3. That the enemies of God and his People do make it their business, to consult and contrive, now they may manage their cause to the best advantage against them. It is a plot which is ever on foot, and unto which contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution is continually made: For this they ride and run, and communicate their counsels: Such is their wrath and ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The enemies of God are very presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous, and full of confidence that the day shall be their own; they make no doubt of bringing about their devices against God and his Church.

As if Heaven were not able to confront them: They say that Wisdom, and Counsel, and Strength are all on their side, and who then shall think to defeat them of success?

                     <hi>Pro.</hi> 6. God many times suffers his enemies to be seemingly prosperous and successeful in their undertakings against him. Infinite Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom hath holy ends, for which it often permits wicked men to proceed a great way against his Cause and People. The Church is oftimes brought very low, whiles God seems to stand by and not regard, so that his People are ready to think that Providence sleeps; and God appears as if he had withdrawn and estranged himself from his own interest.</p>

There may be great outward Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities upon those that are called by God's Name, as we may see by that doleful complaint made <hi>Psal.</hi> 77.7. &amp;c. And the ends which God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds in his so doing, are.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That he may humble and reform his own People: Hence the Churches enemies are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his Rod, <hi>Isa.</hi> 10.5. Corruptions and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravations do sometimes grow insensibly upon the Church and People of God, especially in times of peace and tranquillity; God by thus doing cleanseth them of their pollutions. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution and oppression, and a yoke of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, is a fire in which their dross and filth is melted out, and taken away, <hi>Isa.</hi> 27.9. <hi>By this therefore shall the iniquity of</hi> Jacob <hi>be purged away, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. That by the Saints perseverance under af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction he may be glorified. God is greatly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured by the patience and constancy of his Children under the opposition and oppression of their adversaries. As he puts an honour upon them, when he counts them worthy to suffer for his name, so the Apostles reckoned it, <hi>Act.</hi> 5.41. So is he also honoured by them, when they with an holy resolution, suffer quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and chearfully in defence of the truth, and for the sincere profession of the Gospel, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1.4, 5.</p>

Hereby God honoured himself upon <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> by letting him proceed to the height of his rage, before he crusheth him. God will have a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed world to know how easie a thing it is with him to curb them in, and give check to their rage and fury; and to the discovering of this, he will permit them to arrive at the height and utmost pitch of their hoped advantage, and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer his own cause hereupon to be most deeply hazarded, that so he may give them the more notable defeat, and make them to know that he is above them in all those things wherein they have dealt most proudly.

By all their plots and practices against Gods cause wicked men cannot carry their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign one hairs breadth beyond the bounds which God hath set them in his Decree. Might we be admitted to look upon those ancient Records, and then compare the doings of the enemies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God, we should find them exactly to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree: Men are in the Scripture compared to many and great waters, and their tumults com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the roaring waves of the Sea dashing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Rocks: These waters many times swell into billows, and break with impetuous fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as if they scorned to be comprehended and

bounded within the sandy bars which are laid for them; but, as Gods decree hath laid out their limits, and fixt their bounds, so his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence tyes them up powerfully, that for all their noise and rage they cannot get a step further, <hi>Job.</hi> 38.8, to 11. <hi>Psal.</hi> 65.7. <hi>Which stilleth the noise of the Seas, the noise of their waves, also the tumults of the People.</hi> When wicked men think they have done never so much, they have but fulfilled God's counsel, and not their own, <hi>Psal.</hi> 76.10. <hi>The wrath of man shall praise thee: the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of wrath shalt thou restrain.</hi> God's hand holds the Flood-gates, and as the waters ly still till he pulls them up, so when he hath let out so much as serves his turn, he shuts them down again in a moment, and not a drop gets out but at his appointment. If men purpose contrary to what God hath purposed, theirs must fall, for his shall stand; and whiles they seek to defeat, they shall in that very thing be the instruments of bringing it about; as we see in <hi>Joseph</hi>'s breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, who in what they supposed had made his dreams abortive, helped forward their accomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishment.</p>

Whenever therefore we see the Ax cutting, and feel the Rod smarting, let us say, this could not be without an hand to wield them: When the wicked persecute the Righteous, say this is the Lord, who is holy in all his wayes, and just in all his works.</p>

Learn hence that the only reason of the Churches safety is because their cause is twisted in with Gods; And hence that their only securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is in being and standing for God and his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest. Could we look upon the people of God separate and by themselves, it would readily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear what odds the wicked would have of them; there are the politick states men, the ripe wits, and profound heads, men of greatest skill and political observations; theirs are the mighty men, men of renown, skilful in War, and valiant for the battle: Theirs are the walled Towns with
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:000380_0226_0FA4FEA8E60E89D8"/>
Gates of Brass, the high Towers, and fortified Castles, and invincible Armadoes; they have the men, and the mony, and ammunition: and what can carnal reason Judge from all this, but that theirs must be the day too? And if their wit and power had no other Antagonist to encounter withal, but those of the Saints, it would certainly be so; but here lyes their securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, whatsoever is undertaken against the Saints of God, is undertaken against God himself: they that strike at the People of God, strike at God in them, and so they that touch them, touch the Apple of his eye, <hi>Zech.</hi> 2.8. Christ interprets both kindnesses and injuries done to his, as done to himself, Gods own Name, Honour, and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry are herein sought to be undermined, and that rouseth him up, kindleth his jealousie; and those who but now were such odds to the People of God, find God to be much more their odds. And are made but as flax and stubble to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring fire. It is well for the poor Church that God takes himself to be concerned in their cause; and, for the vindication of his own name, and injuries done to himself, puts in, and takes up the Gantlet against his proud enemies, and tryes for mastreies with them; else had that lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Barge, the Church of Christ, long ago sunk and been swallowed up in the billows of the worlds Sea, <hi>Psal.</hi> 124. begin.</p>

present some wholsome practical lessons for the People of God to make use of in these times. There never was more plotting and counsel taking against God, than is at this day in the World.</p>
                  <p>And hence,</p>
                  <p>Never more need of Faith for the upholding of the spirits of the People of God, against the thence arising Temptations; and no better help than the Doctrine that is before us: And the things we are hence to learn are,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Not to be much moved when we see or hear what is contriving &amp; practicing against God in the World. It is said, <hi>Isa.</hi> 7.2. <hi>It was told the house of</hi> David, <hi>saying,</hi> Syria <hi>is confederate with</hi> Ephraim, <hi>and his heart was moved, and the heart of his People, as the trees of the wood are moved with the wind.</hi> Let it not be so with them that fear God. It is now a time to pray hard and believe much, but it is no time to perplex and distract our selves. We may interpret those words as spoken to the Church in way of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, <hi>Psal.</hi> 64.10. <hi>Be still, and know that I am God.</hi> What are you afraid of? It is against God all that is undertaken; and whoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver resisted him and prospered? do you think that Men or Devils shall ever drive God out of the field, and make a triumph upon <hi>the Lord of Hosts?</hi> Be quiet, let God alone, he will do his own work, and that to purpose: Tarry a little

and you shall see these Bravo's weltering in their own gore, and the arrows of the Almighty drunk with their blood. It shall not be long er<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> the field be cleared, and not an enemy standing, <hi>Yet a little while and the wicked shall be no more, Psal.</hi> 37.10.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Not to be put by our profession and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful service of God by all the menaces of the World against us. Let Godly men hold on their way, though the wicked be laying snares in it. It is a sin, and a disgrace for a Child of God to stand still, or start aside, though utmost perils seem to threaten him. <hi>Luther</hi> being called to <hi>Worms,</hi> for the defence of the truth, was diswad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by some friends, who advised him that there was a plot laid against his life: but with an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roical resolution he professed, that though all the Tiles of their houses were Devils, yet go he would. Rightly regulated and well tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red zeal is very necessary in times when Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is stricken at on all sides. 'Tis the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter and honour of a good Christian to hold fast his own, and press forward against opposition; yea, by an holy Antiperistasis, to gather strength and courage from that which is intended to make him faint, <hi>Job</hi> 17.9. <hi>The Righteous also shall hold on his way, and he that hath clean hands shall be stronger and stronger.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Not to be discouraged though for a while the wickeds counsels seem to take place.

It is the Psalmists advice, <hi>Psal.</hi> 37.7. <hi>Fret not thy self because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass.</hi> When you hear how Gods cause is the present suffering cause, and seems to go down the wind; so many Churches of Protestants dissipated in <hi>Hungary,</hi> so many thousands ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juring their Religion in <hi>France</hi>: So much blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed in one place, so much power of the adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary in another, be not now dis-spirited: The Seas roar, and the waves thereof make a tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous noise, mountains come rolling down into the midst of the Seas; still there is a River to make glad the City of God: <hi>God sits upon the water-floods, God sits King for ever.</hi> God's Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is concerned in all this, and he will not give it away: God is not asleep, though you are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to think him so: He hath holy ends why he suffers all this, and will make a discovery of them seasonably: The pit is all this while digg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for them, the sword is whetting, the arrows are preparing for the Persecutours; the Scene shall be turned, and a tragical end waits upon them: For, <hi>though hand joyn in hand, yet shall not the wicked go unpunished.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Wait with patience and holy confidence under the outmost extremities, till God's time comes to blast all the counsels of his adversaries, and utterly dissolve hells conclave. Though God be not come as yet visibly, yet believe that he
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:000380_0230_0FA4FEABE7950A98"/>
will come seasonably, and there are these two things that may fortifie your confidence in this belief, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. That all their Counsels as yet have not prevailed, and the reason only is taken from God's Power and Providence. It is said that <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Hell</hi> have carried on a plot, ever since the Reformation in <hi>England,</hi> to blow up the Protestant interest there; and this is a ground of comfort, that although God hath not as yet (for holy ends) wholly scattered it, yet he hath wonderfully disappointed it. That Vessel, the Church, hath had many a blustring storm rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed against it, but it is not as yet foundred at all, but weathers it out against Tempests,; and this is certain, that he who hath delivered, can deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and will deliver.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That God's counsel stands Diametrically opposite to the counsel of wicked men: <hi>i. e.</hi> as to the order and design they are carrying one. They consult his dishonour and his Churches dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbance: He is mean while consulting his own Glory, and his Peoples safety: Let God then alone to dash theirs, and establish his own, hear what he saith fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> this, <hi>Isa.</hi> 14.24, 25, 26, 27. <hi>The Lord of hosts hath sworn, saying, Surely as I have thought, so it shall come to pass, and as I have purposed, so shall it stand,</hi> &amp;c: <hi>This is the purpose that is purposed uopn the whole Earth,</hi> &amp;c: <hi>The Lord of hosts hath purposed and who shall disanul it</hi>:
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:000380_0231_0FA4FEAECF7BC690"/>
Men say it shall be thus, but God saith it shall be so, whose word shall stand, theirs or his? When you read bloody decrees, the product of humane consultations, then read the book of God, &amp; oppose to them the gracious decrees of Heaven. It was <hi>Luther</hi>'s consolation to the Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> in a time of great danger; <hi>Let your Highness know (saith he) and nothing doubt, but that this business is otherwise concluded of in Heaven, than it is at</hi> Norinberge: Where the Emperour and States were met in Counsel: God knows what his own thoughts are towards his People, even thoughts of peace, whatever the thoughts of men may be, <hi>Jer</hi> 29.10. Wait then, the wickeds day is a coming; in due time their foot shall slide: The Web which they have been for a long while in weaving, God will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravel in a moment: He will shortly muster up his Forces and draw out his Armies into the Field, and call together the Fowls of Heaven to his great S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This is the work which he hath undertaken to do, and will certainly accomplish it throughly, who hath written on his Vesture, and on his Thigh, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.

be the Lord's Remembrancers. Not ceasing day nor night to be earnestly and importunately put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him in mind of his Covenant, his Name, and Glory? and in Faith pray to him in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of his poor, despised, and abused Church, which is as a Lilly among the Thornes, that he would remember and not forget, or grow un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindful of the Congregation which he hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased of old, and arise to save those that are as sheep prepared to the slaughter, and appointed to dy: And when we have thus done, and in a way of so doing, there is nothing more but to sit still and wait to see the Salvation of the Lord.</p>
