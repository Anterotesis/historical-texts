            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>AN ORATION.</head>
            <p>IT has been juſtly obſerved, that in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the benefits which an inſtitution is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated to produce, in that proportion is the extenſion of its duration and its operative in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon ſociety. This remark, which does equal honor to the ſagacity of the human head and the benevolence of the human heart, is abundantly verified by the experience of ages. In exploring the hiſtoric page, we find that thoſe inſtitutions, which have been productive of benefit to mankind, have like the pyramids of Egypt braved the ravages of time and weather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the convulſions of Empires; while thoſe eſtabliſhments, however ſtrongly ſupported by the ſceptre of power or upheld by the hand of ſuperſtition, which have rioted upon the induſtry and lived upon the blood of our ſpecies, have quickly mouldered into duſt. The Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of Jeſus has nearly ſeen the flight of eighteen centuries, and will laſt as long as time itſelf; while the four great Monarchies and the mighty empire of Rome which levelled man with the brute and violated all the rights of nature, have long ſince felt the tranſitory ſtate <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">

<pb n="6" facs="unknown:028427_0005_0FDA79CE5ED3E438"/>
of the world has often been the theme of philoſophic ſpeculation and the ſubject of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetic viſion; and in truth whether we view man in his paſſage from the ſolitary to the ſocial ſtate, or conſider him in the various modifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſociety, we will find ſufficient reaſon to concur in the opinion and to taſte of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine fountain of rapture, which ſprings from the union of the intellect and the heart in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor of human happineſs.</p>
            <p>The progreſſive improvement of human af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs opens a proſpect ſo grand and ſo intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, promiſes ſuch permanence and ſuch practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cability, as naturally to induce an enquiry into the moſt efficient mode of maturing it to perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. As the univerſal extenſion of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of benevolence preſents itſelf as the only me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of accompliſhing this great event; and as our fraternity reſts its principal merits upon, and has been uniformly and highly and honorably diſtinguiſhed for, the exerciſe of this ſublime virtue, you will excuſe me if I preſume to offer a few thoughts upon it; and when deſcribing the nature and effects of benevolence, I feel confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of experiencing the benefit of yours, if I ſhould fail in thoſe flights of fancy—that eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſtyle and that profundity of remark, which become a man ſpeaking on a ſubject that unites in its praiſe—all the modes of imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, all the faculties of the underſtanding, and all the virtues of the heart.</p>
            <p>In ſcentific diſcuſſions, it is conſidered ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:028427_0006_0FDA7992B10D0990"/>
evidence of the falſity of a doctrine to demonſtrate that it leads to an abſurdity; in like manner, in queſtions of morals it is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuperable objection to a ſyſtem, to prove that it produces miſchief and depravity. The preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of evil has never proceeded from a defect, but from a perverſion of good original princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. The father of the Univerſe has endowed us all with competent capacity to cultivate virtue and enjoy felicity: And if we wander into the devious paths of vice and taſte of the bitter cup of miſery, the fault is to be aſcribed to ourſelves. To eſtabliſh or refute a propoſition in morals, we may then not only reaſon with propriety from the phenomena of the mind, but we may enter into a wider field of diſcuſſion and trace the conſequences of a particular doctrine upon all the relations of ſociety and the modes of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man action.</p>
            <p>In contemplating the ſubject propoſed, we at the firſt glance behold mankind divided, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in ſpeculation but in action, into two great parties. The one ſide eſpouſing the cauſe of diſintereſted benevolence and the other declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that intereſt and ſelfiſhneſs govern the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe. A well regulated ſelf-love might un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionably anſwer all the purpoſes of creation, and it is certainly not fair promiſcuouſly to claſs the advocates of this opinion with thoſe who eſpouſe the ſyſtem of miſanthropy, eſpecially as the general complexion of our conduct receives its color and its glow from ſelf-love: There is ſomething however extremely pleaſing to a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:028427_0007_0FDA7997E8CBC578"/>
mind, independent of its benign influence to view man as capable of diſintereſted bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence: It elevates him in the ſcale of being and breaks down the partition that ſeperates him from the order of ſpirits; It places him on a lofty eminence, from which he can look down without any other ſigh than the ſigh of pity, upon the periſhable goods of mortality.</p>
            <p>He who ſuppoſes that all our actions are bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed upon intereſt or vanity will naturally conduct himſelf according to his opinion. If charity proceeds from oſtentation, patriotiſm from ambition and friendſhip from intereſt in others—why ſhould they not emanate from the ſame ſources in himſelf. He will thus paſs through the world a ſtranger to all the endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing charities of life—dead to the nobleſt feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the ſoul and deaf to the enchanting voice of virtuous pleaſure. The delights of love will be viewed by him as an article of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce or an union of convenience—the ties of friendſhip will be rendered ſubſervient to views of profit and vanity—the good of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try will be ſacrificed to the calls of ambition— philanthrophy will give way to the moſt deteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſelfiſhneſs—the world will receive its hue from his jaundiced eye of ſuſpicion—and like an unfortunate traveller caſt upon a deſert coaſt, he will live iſolated from the delights of ſociety—uſeleſs to mankind, uſeleſs to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. If this doctrine has ſuch a pernicious practical influence upon individuals, the evil en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes with tenfold fury when extended to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:028427_0008_0FDA799CE1E55670"/>
From what ſource but from this, did the diſpoſition of the Jews to exterminate all the other nations of the earth proceed? The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Romans made uſe of the ſame word <hi>Hoſtis</hi> to ſignify both ſtranger and enemy; and from one extremity of the world to the other their chariot wheels of Empire rolled over the necks of mankind drenched with the blood of millions. The modern ſyſtem of warfare has not ſo much ſoftened its aſperities and mitigated its ferocities, as the enlightened ideas of humanity ſo generally diffuſed among nations. We are no longer conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as ſavage beaſts deſtined to tear and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour each other, but as children of the ſame common father, connected by the ties of the ſame common nature: The captured are now preſerved from maſſacre and the conquered from extirpation; but alas! humanity is reluct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly compelled to look upon the preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions of the world, and to ſee with tear-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed eyes a departure from her principles—to recognize with bleeding heart, the ſpectacle of civilized nations endeavouring with more than diabolical fury to ſtarve and to exterminate each other.</p>
            <p>There is a faculty of the ſoul which has received various denominations among phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers and which ſeems to be the offspring of the heart and the underſtanding united: It has been termed the moral ſenſe, the moral taſte and the moral inſtinct, and it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in an inſtantaneous admiration or diſguſt of moral beauty or deformity. From this principle
<pb facs="unknown:028427_0009_0FDA799FDCEFF968"/>
of our nature which we recognize in almoſt every action of our lives may be deduced various important inferences in favor of diſintereſted benevolence and in honor of mankind. The moment we hear of any vicious or cruel action we feel a ſenſe of indignation; and the very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant we are informed of a great or noble deed we feel the glow of admiration and ſatisfaction: When we read of the perſecutions of ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of the ravages of war and of the deſolating career of tyranny, what are our feelings but the mingled emotions of indignation and regret? And are we not inſtantaneouſly enraptured at the pious endeavors of the religious—the hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable exploits of the patriotic, and the magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous views of the benevolent?</p>
            <p>The operation of this principle in a great multitude, in defiance of the pomp of power and the parade of victory, has been admirably deſcribed by a celebrated Poet.</p>
            <q>
               <l>EVEN when proud Caeſar 'midſt triumphal cars,</l>
               <l>The ſpoils of nations and the pomp of wars,</l>
               <l>Ignobly vain and impotently great,</l>
               <l>Shew'd Rome her Cato's figure drawn in ſtate,</l>
               <l>As her dead father's reverend image paſt,</l>
               <l>The pomp was darken'd and the day o'er caſt,</l>
               <l>The triumph ceas'd, tears guſh'd from every eye,</l>
               <l>The world's great victor paſs'd unheeded by;</l>
               <l>Her laſt good man dejected Rome ador'd</l>
               <l>And honor'd Caeſar's leſs than Cato's ſword.</l>
            </q>
            <p>The deduction is plain: There muſt exiſt in the ſoul a regard for the welfare of mankind in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent of intereſted views. To conceive a
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:028427_0010_0FDA79A56467AFD8"/>
ſelfiſh ſcheme, we muſt conſider—we muſt inveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigate—we muſt combine ideas—but the moral ſenſe like a flaſh of lightning burſts in upon us: We either inſtantly glow with anger or loſe ourſelves in admiration: It is an emanation from the divinity—the Promethean fire brought down from Heaven—the working of the image of God within us.</p>
            <p>It may be obſerved in anſwer to this, that our indignation ariſes from an application of the caſe of the injured to ourſelves and our admiration from a mercenary view of obtaining favors from the ſubject of our panegyrics. I appeal to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man, who has attended to the train of his thoughts or the proceſs of his feelings, whether any perſonal reference exiſts, whether the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent excited is not intirely abſtracted from ſelf; but are there not many immoral actions which injure none but the guilty agent himſelf? are not many committed in ſuch a mode and at ſuch a diſtance that by all the rules of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability they can never be extended to us—and what benefit can we receive from venerating the illuſtrious ſhades of the martyrs of liberty or heirs of genius? Has not the cold hand of death placed us beyond their power?</p>
            <p>Pure unadulterated nature can alone ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory clear up this important queſtion—and to this we muſt reſort as a clue to guide us through a labyrinth of doubts and uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. If the fanciful idea of placing a window in every man's boſom could be realized, we

could then ſee the ſecret workings and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives which conſpire to produce our actions— and we could then unqueſtionably tell whether benevolence exiſts unalloyed by ſelfiſhneſs or whether man is really the creature of low and vicious ſentiments, which bow him down to the earth and render him little ſuperior to the beaſts of the field: But as this is far beyond our reach, we muſt accommodate our reſearches to a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent mode of enquiry. Let us not then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort to the man, hackneyed in the ways of the world, whoſe paſſions have been perverted by the ſtruggles of ambition and the conflicts of intereſt—but let us viſit nature in her unſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſticated forms, where the refinements of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety have not corrupted the benevolent bias of the mind and effaced from the heart the impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Heaven.</p>
            <p>It is in the ſeaſon of infancy that we muſt look for genuine nature; then the character firſt opens, and ſhews itſelf; then the power of intereſt is feeble and the artifices of ambition obvious. The inhabitant of the woods, who has never mingled in the corruptions of ſociety, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibits amidſt the awful ferocities of his diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſome of the genuine characters of man, but in contemplating him we muſt carefully diſtinguiſh between the vices which grow out of the different ſtages of ſociety and the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent propenſities of the heart. Misfortune al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſerves to reduce us to the level of nature, and to render us acquainted with ourſelves; it has been well remarked by an acute obſerver that
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:028427_0012_0FDA79ACEB3ECD00"/>
the moſt unfeeling man he ever met with, was one whoſe whole life was a ſeries of fortunate events. To the recluſe and the ſolitary we may alſo with propriety look for the leſſons of nature; here the colliſion of intercourſe has not worn off the feelings and deſtroyed the emotions of the heart. In theſe various conditions and ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, we ſee the principle of benevolence ſtrongly operative; we find the mind thus una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterated by a commerce with the world, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete with the kindeſt wiſhes and moſt friendly ſentiments. The firſt emotions of the infant heart beat in uniſon with friendſhip and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence. The hoſpitable ſavage, to relieve his forlorn gueſt, will part with his laſt morſel and hazard the horrors of famine. The child of affliction will often forget his own misfortunes in ſympathiſing with the diſtreſſes of others; and the recluſe, on his firſt appearance in the buſtle of the world, fraught with the moſt bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent ſentiments, will alas, too ſoon experience that his opinions are too pure for the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſociety.</p>
            <p>If the principle of benevolence is ſo pure ſo hallowed, how excellent muſt be its practice! The power of diſpenſing good approaches the attributes of the deity, and the pleaſures reſulting from the relief of the diſtreſſed are ſo extatic and delightful as to form the moſt ſtriking foretaſte of the joys of Heaven.— The ſun itſelf, with all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

bounty—and to him we muſt look up as the truly great, for in the calm eye of reaſon he ſtands pre-eminently towering above the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious general or the throned monarch. The ſtate of office, the pomp of power, the ſplendor of wealth or a long train of illuſtrious anceſtors may not attend him, but what are theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the pleaſures of ſenſibility or the ſmiles of Heaven?</p>

            <p>Benevolence ſeems to inveſt a man with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gic charms; wherever he goes kind wiſhes at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend him: it forms a good criterion of the whole frame and temper of his ſoul with which all the other virtues riſe and will almoſt neceſſarily be connected. "Tell me, ſays a feeling writer, of a compaſſionate man, you repreſent to me a man of a thouſand other good qualities, on whom I can depend, whom I may ſafely truſt with my wife, my children, my fortune and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation!"</p>
            <p>The draughts of life, according to the allegory of the Poets, proceed from the veſſels of good

and evil that ſtand on each ſide of Jupiter and whenever they are found pure and unmixed, they flow from the veſſel on the left hand. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable deſcription of the miſeries of life! Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alloyed felicity we never experience, but afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in all the forms of terror in all the channels of bitterneſs, attacks us: It approaches us in the ſhape of diſeaſe and poverty, preſents itſelf in the dreſs of oppreſſion and calumny, aſſails us in the loſs of friends and reputation, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces us in all the incalculable forms with which imagination can array the victims of her influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. The priſon, the houſe of madneſs, the retreat of poverty, the horrid gibbet, and the blood ſtreaming ſcaffold, bear dreadful teſtimony to her mighty power. To reſtrain her baneful influence and to draw the draughts of life from the veſſel of good on the right hand of Jupiter, are the objects of the benevolent man. In this grand expedition of humanity, the immortal Howard eſtabliſhed beyond doubt the being and beauty of benevolence; he roſe ſublimely from the couch of affluence and eaſe—encountered the inſolence of fools and the ridicule of miſanthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſts—the dungeon's groans and the tyrant's frowns—braved the horrors of diſeaſe, the ſtorms of heaven and the tempeſts of the ocean; and wherever he went, chains fell from the hands of ſlavery and the tears of the priſon were changed into ſmiles—the bleſſings of all good men fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed his footſteps and even deſpots, diſarmed by the ſublimity of his virtues, deigned to liſten from their thrones to the tale of ſorrow and to ſtretch forth the lenient hand of relief.</p>

               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:028427_0015_0FDA79811FD55678"/>In the application of the benevolent princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to the conduct of nations, ſo many pleaſing ideas ruſh upon the mind as to hazard the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of viſionary and chimerical ſpeculations. To pave the way for the introduction of this ſublime virtue in the adminiſtration of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of a nation, the will of the community not the will of an individual ought to be the controling power: The ſentiments of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are always right, whereas thoſe of an indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual, eſpecially in an elevated ſtation, are too much under the government of ſiniſter impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. Next to a good diſpoſition to conduct right political affairs may be ranked competent ability; The diffuſion of knowledge is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alſo requiſite to produce this great improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; which when effected, the conduct of a nation to itſelf and to other nations will afford a ſight upon which celeſtial ſpirits will look with admiration.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place, it will be the ardent object of the community to encreaſe the quantity of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſecondly to diminiſh the influence of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery among its members. With this view, ſchools of virtue and ſeminaries of learning will be founded—agriculture, commerce, and manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures encouraged—the polite arts and the uſeful ſciences patroniſed—and the rights of nature and the rights of religion reſpected: With this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, it will alſo be the object of the Nation to aſſuage phyſical evils by the eſtabliſhment of hoſpitals, alms-houſes and public granaries, and to alleviate by proper correctives the moral ills
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:028427_0016_0FDA79C0B978A198"/>
which prevail. The ſhackles of ſlavery will then fall to the ground and the horrid inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of capital puniſhment be only ſeen on the deſcriptive canvas.—The proud creſt of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion will be levelled to the duſt—the chica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery of law baniſhed from the ſeats of diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive juſtice—and the long catalogue of crimes which diſgraces our ſtatute books conſidered as the forgery of miſanthrophiſts or as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of diabolical ſpirits.</p>
            <p>After viewing this ſublime proſpect of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion happy in itſelf, let us behold the ſublimer ſpectacle of all the nations of the world happy in each other.</p>
            <p>No longer will the melancholy yew and the doleful cypreſs overſhade the martial field—no longer will the voice of diſcord like Ate hot from hell cry havock and let looſe the dogs of war—no longer will the din of arms and the claſh of conflicting hoſts "grate thunder" on the ear—but benevolence daughter of Heaven will compoſe the tempeſts of nations and extend the olive branch of peace over the Univerſe.</p>
            <p>The firſt anticipation that preſents itſelf, is a Congreſs of Ambaſſadors from all the nations of the world, to conſult upon the ways and means of augmenting the maſs of human hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs; and let not this idea receive the contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous ſneer of high-pretending wiſdom before it is brought to the touchſtone of examination, for it is only an extenſion of the confederacies
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:028427_0017_0FDA79C1A91D5848"/>
of bordering ſtates, an amplification of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of Henry the Great of France to unite the views of the European Nations.</p>
            <p>By this mighty congreſs of nations, a free commerce will be univerſally eſtabliſhed; trade will be left open to the channels which nature points out; Duties and premiums and prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will be no more; Commerce will ſeek the regions of induſtry and ſkill, and the wants of mankind will be ſupplied upon the baſis of their virtues.</p>
            <p>An univerſity, for the illumination of the world, will alſo be founded; to which as the ſtore-houſe of knowledge the learned of all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will reſort as formerly they did to antient Egypt. Here the European, the Aſiatic, the African, and the American Literati will aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and communicate to each other, the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries, the curioſities and the knowledge of their reſpective continents; here the prejudices of country will vaniſh before the taliſman of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; here the ground of emulation will be wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened; and it will be no longer contended whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Frenchman or an Engliſhman but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Native of the Eaſtern or Weſtern Hemiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere ſhall bear away the palm of genius and the trophies of knowledge.</p>
            <p>Great improvements muſt alſo take place, which far ſurpaſs the momentum of power that a ſingle nation can produce, but will with faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity proceed from their united ſtrength. The

hand of art will change the face of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe; Mountains, deſerts, and oceans will feel its mighty force. It will not then be debated whether hills ſhall be proſtrated, but whether the Alps and the Andes ſhall be levelled? Nor whether ſterile fields ſhall be fertiliſed, but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the deſerts of Africa ſhall feel the power of cultivation? Nor whether rivers ſhall be join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but whether the Caſpian ſhall ſee the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean, and the waves of the Pacific lave the Atlantic Shores?</p>
