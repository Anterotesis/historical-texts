            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Reaſon of my chuſing the <hi>Subject</hi> of the following Sermon, in the Courſe of my ſtated Miniſtrations to my own Congregation, was the ſorrowful Apprehenſion I had of the low State of <hi>vital Religion,</hi> in general among us, at this Time; and a ſincere Deſire to excite truly pious Perſons, to more Earneſtneſs and Diligence in the Service of God: I had not the leaſt Thought of its Publication when it was preached; but being ſince Earneſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to commit it to the <hi>Preſs,</hi> I have conſented, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and praying, that it may thro' the divine Bleſſing, be of ſome Uſe to Mankind: The Sovereign God ſends by whom he will ſend, he can, and has in many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, bleſſed weak Means; if we ſincerely endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour as well as we can to promote his Kingdom, he will graciouſly accept of our humble Endeavours, and probably bleſs them to ſome; both which Conſiderations are great Incentives to Action: To prevent <hi>Prolixi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
               <pb facs="unknown:008745_0003_102FD85D74DD0908"/>
I have not expreſſed in the <hi>Sermon,</hi> the Words of many Places of ſacred Scripture, which confirm and illuſtrate the Matters treated of: I would there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore intreat the <hi>Reader,</hi> to turn to them for his own Satisfaction and Benefit; and I earneſtly beg his Prayers, for one who is leſs than the leaſt of all Saints, that I may obtain Mercy, to be faithful to the Death:</p>

Ardent Love</hi> is termed <hi>ZEAL, (Num.</hi> xi. 29. <hi>Pſalm</hi> lxix. 9.)

            <p>THE Subject of our preſent Meditations is ZEAL, which is twofold, <hi>viz.</hi> bad and good: Of the former <hi>Genus</hi> or Sort, there are various Kinds or <hi>Species,</hi> particularly</p>

               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:008745_0007_102FD854C0083D60"/>1. THERE is a <hi>natural Zeal</hi> and Activity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> unſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, which is the Effect of a ſprightly <hi>Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> of Body; which, tho' it be not poſitively Evil, yet has Nothing ſpiritual or ſaving in it, and ſo is comparatively Bad.</p>
            <p n="2">2. AN <hi>ignorant Zeal,</hi> when Perſons are zealous and they dont know for what or why; and hence it is ſaid of the carnal <hi>Jews,</hi> that <hi>they had a Zeal for God, but not according to Knowledge, for being ignorant of Gods Righteouſneſs,</hi> or of the Neceſſity and Sufficiency of the Righteouſneſs of a Mediator, to the Juſtification of a believing Sinner, which is of Gods Appointment; <hi>and going about to eſtabliſh their own</hi> in Place thereof, <hi>they did not</hi> ſincerely <hi>ſubmit to,</hi> or entirely depend upon, <hi>the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, (Romans</hi> x. 2, 3.) And <hi>thus</hi> Iſrael <hi>that followed after the Law of Righteouſneſs, hath not attained to the Law of Righteouſneſs. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore?

(1 <hi>Cor.</hi> ii. 14. <hi>Rev.</hi> iii. 17. <hi>Luke</hi> xi. 13.) Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant Zeal is exceeding Dangerous, like a <hi>Sword</hi> in the Hand of one that is blind, or mad!

            <p n="3">3. A <hi>hypocritical Zeal,</hi> when Men affect to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear zealous before others, when they are not ſo in Reality; thus the <hi>Phariſees</hi> wore broad <hi>Phylac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery's,</hi> made long <hi>Prayers,</hi> compaſſed Sea and Land to make a <hi>Proſelyte,</hi> gave <hi>Alms</hi> in public, built the <hi>Tombs</hi> of the <hi>Prophets,</hi> that they might be ſeen of Men, and eſteemed Religious; and yet they <hi>perſecuted</hi> at the ſame Time, the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Prophets.</hi> Thoſe Hypocrites our Lord accoſts in the following Language, <hi>Ye Serpents, ye Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Vipers, how can ye eſcape the Damnation of Hell, (Matthew</hi> xxiii.

            <p n="4">4. A <hi>proud Zeal,</hi> when Men are <hi>fervent</hi> in any Matter that concerns them, their Opinions, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, Honors, Intereſts, Friends, or any Thing that is theirs, and principly becauſe it is theirs: And yet ſuch is the Deceitfulneſs of the human Heart, that ſome are pleaſed with this ſorry <hi>Muſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>room</hi> Witneſs <hi>Jehu,</hi> who had the Confidence to aſk good <hi>Jonabab, to come and ſee his Zeal.</hi> (2 <hi>Kings</hi> x, 16.)</p>

As if it was a great Catch to be damned, rather in this, than in that <hi>Faction;</hi> but bleſſed be God, the Church of Chriſt is not confined to any Party, (<hi>John</hi> x 16.) Nor does the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of God conſiſt in <hi>Meats</hi> and <hi>Drinks, but in Peace and Righteouſneſs, and Joy in the holy Ghoſt, (Rom.</hi> xiv. 17.)

            <p>As ſinful <hi>ZEAL</hi> is manifold in Kind, ſo it is exceeding hainous and of malignant Influence; it diſhonoreth God by preſuming to affix his ſacred Name to Error in Principle, and Impiety in Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice;
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:008745_0011_102FD86369DB2DF0"/>
it charges upon infinite Purity all the Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs it commits; it injures the Church of God, as well as civil Society and our own Souls; this made <hi>Paul</hi> exceeding <hi>mad</hi> againſt the Diſciples of Chriſt, ſo that he ſhut them up in Priſons and compelled them to blaſpheme! (<hi>Acts</hi> xxvi. 10, 11.) This breeds Contention, and overſets the Peace and Order of Societies and Families: As pious <hi>Zeal</hi> is the Fervency of Grace, ſo is ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Zeal</hi> the Fervency of Sin, it makes Men dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſinful, for hereby they are induced to do much Evil in a little Time, and that in the Name of God, whereby they fight againſt him by his own Authority: (Perverted) this blinds Men's Minds, and prejudices their Hearts againſt Conviction; the zealous Sinner juſtifies his Sin, and pleads Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Reaſon in its Defence: Yea, he thinks he is ſerving God, when he is <hi>murdering</hi> his Servants, and oppoſing the <hi>Power</hi> and Spirit of Religion, a melancholy Caſe this indeed! Yea, even <hi>Zeal</hi> for ſmall and circumſtantial Matters, when high in Degree, is of hurtful Tendency, for it deſtroyeth Charity and Peace, and diſparages holy Zeal by Accident, making the profane think that all Zeal is no better than the fooliſh Paſſions of deceived Men; and hence it diſables thoſe that have it to do Good, even when they are zealous for important Truth and Duty, for many will be inclined to
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:008745_0012_102FD864F4241D30"/>

            <p>BUT the PIOUS <hi>ZEAL</hi> enjoined in our Text, is of a very different Kind, and may be thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, <hi>viz.</hi> that it is <hi>a devout Fervour or Warmth, wrought in the Affections of a regenerated Perſon by the holy Spirit, in the Uſe of appointed Means, whereby they are carried out to the utmoſt, in promoting the Kingdom of God, from Love to his Majeſty, with an Eye to his Glory, and according to the Directions of his written Word, (Romans</hi> xii. 11. <hi>James</hi> v. 16. 1 <hi>Peter</hi> i. 22 and 48.)</p>
            <p>HERE obſerve, that <hi>love</hi> to God, is the <hi>Principle</hi> from which this pious Paſſion proceeds, (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> v. 14.) His <hi>Glory</hi> is its <hi>End,</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> x. 31.) His <hi>Word</hi> is the <hi>Rule</hi> by which it is regulated, (<hi>Gal.</hi> vi. 16.) His <hi>Spirit</hi> its <hi>Efficient, (Rom.</hi> viii. 9.) And <hi>Regeneration</hi> its <hi>Antecedent, (Coloſſi.</hi> iii. 1, 2.)

meanly of themſelves, they highly eſteem others, and give them all that Honor that is due to their ſeveral Places and Relations, (<hi>Rom.</hi> xiii. 7.) And while their Indignation burns againſt the Sins of Men becauſe of the diſhonor done thereby to God; they feel Bowels of Pity towards their Perſons! (<hi>Rev.</hi> ii. 2. <hi>Col.</hi> iii. 12.) When <hi>Moſes</hi> tho' the meekeſt of Men, ſaw the Calf which the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had made, and Dancing, his Anger wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hot, and he broke the Tables of Stone, (<hi>Ezod.</hi> xxxii. 19.)

And hence we may learn that true <hi>Zeal</hi> is a compound of <hi>Anger</hi> and <hi>Grief,</hi> both which proceed from <hi>love</hi> to God and Man, and therefore is inconſiſtent with Barbarity and Blood!

To love God without Zeal, is not to love him at all, becauſe it is not loving him as God: No deſire of Chriſt, of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and Heaven, is ſaving; but that which prefers them to all the Treaſures and Delights of Life; and that which doth ſo, hath certainly ſome Zeal in it; ſo that <hi>Zeal</hi> is eſſential to every Grace, as Life and Heat is to a Man.</p>

Whom have I in Heaven but thee? And there is none upon Earth that I deſire beſides thee, (Pſalm</hi> xxvii. 5, and lxxiii. 25.) <hi>No Man can ſerve two Maſters, God and Mamon: Either he will hate the one, and love the other, or hold to the one, and deſpiſe the other, (Matthew</hi> vi. 24.)</p>
            <p n="4">4. ZEAL is the <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Strength</hi> of the <hi>Duty,</hi> and makes it like to attain its End; <hi>the fervent Prayer of the Righteous is effectual.
