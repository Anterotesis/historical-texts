            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               </opener>
               <p>THE proceedings of the late Aſſembly held at Jackſonborough have already excited the attention not only of this, but of other States; and ſome of the laws then enacted are of ſo ſerious a nature, that the memory of them will laſt, and their conſequences operate, when the authors of the meaſures ſhall be no more. By one of thoſe laws, upwards of two hundred men who had been citizens of this State before the reduction of Charleſtown, have been ſtript of all their property: innocent wives and children involved in the calamity of huſbands and fathers, their widows are deprived of the right of dower, their children diſinherited, and themſelves baniſhed for ever from this country. And this <hi>without proceſs, trial, examination,</hi> or <hi>hearing;</hi> and without allowing them the ſacred right of proving their innocence on a future day. Under other acts of that aſſembly, a number of the inhabitants are ſubjected to heavy fines, ſome to near one third, others to one eight, and ſome to a tenth part of their eſtate, real and perſonal, without better proof of crime than report and ſuggeſtions. Another act excludes from the freedom of voting or being elected to a ſeat in the legiſlature, almoſt a majority of our citizens. The crimes of all conſiſt in the part which they were ſaid to have taken after the reduction of South-Carolina by the Britiſh army.</p>
               <p>One would imagine there is no free country upon earth, in which laws bringing ſuch ruin on ſo many families, and ſo big with political miſchief, would not have been publickly diſcuſſed before this day. But whether it be owing, that the meaſures have ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in breaking the ſpirit of the people, by filling every man
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:017861_0004_0FA37412874D52E0"/>with a ſenſe of his own danger; or that the fear of the Governor's <hi>extraordinary power,</hi> awes men into ſilence; or that they are indifferent about public affairs; not a man has yet undertaken to enquire into the juſtice or injuſtice of it, or aſk his neighbour how far the Legiſlature could effect the ruin and diſgrace of ſo many of his fellow citizens, conſiſtently with the laws, conſtitution, and happineſs of his country.</p>
               <p>From every point of view in which I conſider thoſe proceedings, I am convinced it is eſſential to the future peace and liberty of our country, that a true judgment be formed on the matter. The people at large in whom the ſovereignty of the State <hi>ſhould be veſted,</hi> ought to be informed whether public meaſures be right or wrong; and it therefore becomes the duty of every citizen to preſent the ſubject in as open and publick a light as opportunity or knowledge may enable him. Under this perſuaſion I venture to offer a few remarks to the conſideration of the publick; and I only wiſh my talents were equal to the importance of the ſubject. I truſt the candid, plain manner in which I ſhall diſcourſe on it will anſwer for me, that I have no other deſign by it but what has been the object of my purſuit through ſeven years public ſervice; that is, the liberty and peace of my courtry.</p>
               <p>I muſt firſt obſerve, that G—r R—'s proclamation of the 27th of September 1781, was the fountain from whence ſprung ſome of thoſe bitter laws, and the forfeitures and diſabilities abovemention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. That proclamation went entirely on the ſuppoſition, that the citizens of the State who had taken protection on the fall of the country under Britiſh uſurpation, had thereby not only forfeited their lives, fortunes, and the privileges of citizenſhip, but had alſo incurred the penalty of treaſon againſt the State. This was the doctrine allowed on all hands; not only laid down by the proclamation, but advanced in both houſes, and I never heard it contradicted by the <hi>judges</hi> or <hi>lawyers</hi> who ought to have known better. The proclamation indeed was ſuppoſed to have reſtored all thoſe who complied with the terms of it, to their loſt liberties, by joining the army within a limited time.</p>
               <p>I ſhall proceed to make ſome remarks on the ſuppoſed crime and delinquency of the people in taking protection.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="1" type="part">
               <head>I. <hi>On the Citizens making a temporary Submiſſion to the Britiſh Arms, after the reduction of Charleſtown in</hi> 1780.</head>
               <p>THIS State, ſoon after the reduction of Charleſtown, may be ſtrictly ſaid to have been conquered. Not only the capital, but every poſt throughout the country was in the hands of the enemy. The Governor who repreſented the Sovereignty of the State, had provided for his ſafety by flight, and all the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nental troops in South-Carolina were either killed, taken, or routed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="unknown:017861_0005_0FA3741346D06280"/>
The enemy, thus maſters of the country, reſolved to reduce by military force the inhabitants to obedience. And Sir Henry Clinton accordingly in the month of June 1781, iſſues a proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<q>Commanding all perſons whatever inhabitants of this province, (thoſe who were in Charleſtown and Fort Moultrie at the time of their capitulations and ſurrender, or were then in actual confinement excepted) who ſhall after the 20th of June next, neglect to return to his allegiance and to his Majeſty's government, will be conſidered as enemies and rebels to the ſame, and treated accordingly.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus a military deſpotiſm was eſtabliſhed throughout the ſettlements, and to compleat this miſerable ſcene of woes, the army under General Gates, and a diviſion under General Sumpter, to whom we looked up as our deliverers, were entirely defeated. The country thus abandoned to a cruel, unprincipled foe, the people had no idea but that our independence was loſt irrecoverably. And indeed the advantages gained by the enemy were ſo rapid and deciſive, it was for ſome time apprehended thro' the other States, and even by many members of Congreſs, that Carolina and Georgia muſt in the end revert to the domination of Great Britain.</p>
               <p>In this ſituation <hi>neceſſity,</hi> whoſe dominion triumphs over all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man laws pointed out to our inhabitants, that as there was neither government, laws, nor army to protect them, they were at liberty to protect themſelves, as well as they could. This is the law of Nature and of Nations: And all Stateſmen, the beſt lawyers, and moſt eminent writers, agree, that when an invader over-runs a country, defeats the ſtanding forces, and ſubverts its government, the inhabitants of ſuch a country are juſtifiable to take the conqueror's protection and obey his laws; and whether the government be a monarchy or republick, it makes no difference, as the reaſon of the thing is the ſame.</p>
               <p>In Germany and other parts of Europe, it is not uncommon for one and the ſame city to be taken and retaken and have different maſters in one campaign. And the inhabitants of ſuch a city, magiſtrates and all, who are not ſoldiers by profeſſion, uniformly take an oath of allegiance to the ſtronger ſide, which oath is binding only ſo long as the conqueror's power laſts. And I believe we have the excluſive honour of being the firſt who proceeded to puniſh their inhabitants on account of ſuch ſubmiſſion. I ſhall bring forward the authority of the beſt writers on the laws of nations and nature to prove that taking protection from a conqueror is no crime.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Things may be brought to ſuch an iſſue, ſays Puffendorf, lib. 7 c. 8. as ſhall make it not only allowable, but good and neceſſary to obey the ruler in poſſeſſion, by whatſoever means poſſeſſion was gained. As if the lawful Sovereign be reduced to ſuch ſtraits, that one can no longer exerciſe his regal office to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his people. For tho' the commands of the uſurper, being deſtitute of legal power are not in themſelves obligatory, yet it
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:017861_0006_0FA3741406DE9F08"/>becomes a wiſe man to conſult the welfare of himſelf and of his affairs, make proviſion againſt the future, and with warineſs and caution reflect on his preſent condition, that he may not thruſt his life and fortune into danger; as he would do, ſhould he by vain obſtinacy and oppoſition draw the uſurper's rage upon his own head, without procuring the leaſt advantage to his country.</q> And further on he concludes,
<q>That when the prince cannot afford his ſubjects due protection, nor they on the other hand able to reſiſt the uſurper without imminent ruin, they are releaſed from all obligations to him, until providence ſhall open a way to his reſtoration.</q> Again,
<q>This method muſt be allowed to be lawful not only for particular ſubjects, but alſo for entire cities and provinces, when they find no other way left for their ſafety and preſervation.</q> Lib. 8. c. 11. In ſupport of this right he quotes the caſe of the Petilini from Livy. This nation being in alliance with the Romans, and preſſed by their enemies, ſent for aſſiſtance. But the Romans being diſtreſſed themſelves, anſwered,
<q>They confeſſed themſelves no longer in a condition to defend their diſtant friends, and therefore deſired the petitioners to return home, conſult for themſelves, and make the beſt terms they could.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This is the law laid down by Grotius as well as Puffendorf: and Vattel, a late writer of the firſt diſtinction, delivers the like doctrine in the following words:</p>

                  <q>If a State is overcome by force, <hi>neceſſity, that irreſiſtable law,</hi> frees it from its firſt engagement, and gives it a right to treat with the conqueror, in order to obtain the beſt conditions poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. If it muſt ſubmit to him, or periſh, who can entertain a doubt but that it may, and even ought to chuſe the firſt expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, <hi>ſubmiſſion?</hi> The modern uſage is agreeable to this deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: A city ſubmits to an enemy when it cannot expect ſafety from a vigorous reſiſtance: it takes an oath of fidelity to him, and the Sovereign of ſuch city has no body to accuſe but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Vattel gives as examples the caſes of the country of Zug, and the city of Zurich abandoned by their Confederates in the 14th century, who entered into a treaty with their enemies from neceſſity.</p>
               <p>This part of my ſubject I ſhall conclude with a quotation from Mr. Heboes, a writer whoſe authority is the more to be depended on, as be lived in England in the time of the grand rebellion, when England then was, as Carolina was lately, diſtracted by a fierce war, and were perſecuting each other, as the parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment forces, or thoſe of the king got the better.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Becauſe I find, ſays Hobbes, by our Engliſh books lately printed, that the civil wars have not ſufficiently taught men in which point of time it is that a ſubject becomes obliged to the conqueror, nor how it comes about that men are obliged to obey his laws. Therefore, for ſatisfaction of men therein, I ſay, That for him who has no obligation to his former ſovereign, but
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:017861_0007_0FA37414C95B08E8"/>that of an ordinary ſubject, <hi>(that is not a ſoldier by profeſſion)</hi> it is then when the means of life are within the guards and garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the enemy: for it is then he hath no longer protection from his ſovereign, but is protected by the adverſe party for his contribution. Seeing therefore ſuch a contribution is every where eſteemed lawful, as a thing inevitable, (notwithſtanding it be an aſſiſtance to the enemy) a total ſubmiſſion cannot be eſteemed unlawful. Beſides, if we conſider that he who ſubmits aſſiſts the enemy but with part of his eſtate, whereas, they that refuſe to ſubmit, aſſiſt him with the whole.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Again, when in a war (foreign or domeſtic) the enemy get a final victory, ſo as the forces of the Commonwealth keeping the field no longer, there is no farther protection of the citizens in their loyalty: <hi>Then is the Common wealth diſſolved, and every man at liberty to protect himſelf by ſuch courſes as his own direction ſhall ſuggeſt to him.</hi> For the Sovereign is the public ſoul, giving life and motion to the Commonwealth; which expiring, the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are no more governed by it than the carcaſe of a man by his departed ſpirit. For tho' the right of a ſovereign cannot be extinguiſhed, yet the obligation of the members may; for he that wants protection may ſeek it any where.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Again, the obligation of ſubjects to the State is underſtood to laſt ſo long, and no longer than the power laſts by which it is able to protect them. For the right which men have by nature to protect themſelves, when none elſe can protect them, can by no covenant be relinquiſhed. The ſovereignty is the ſoul of the commonwealth, which once departed from the body, the members do no more receive their motion from it. The end of obedience is protection, which whereſoever a man ſeeketh, either in his own, or his enemy's ſword, nature applieth his obedience to it.</q> Hobbes's Leviathan, cap. 21.27.29. and the Review.</p>
               <p>Nothing can be clearer than this doctrine; and however ſhocking it will ſeem to thoſe who have kept a perpetual boaſting of their own virtue and clamour againſt ſuch as the Britiſh did not think fit to ſend to St. Auguſtine; yet this is what is good law in South-Carolina as well as all the world over: All thoſe writers whoſe autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity we rely on in law-matters laying it down for law, that ſubjects are excuſed and juſtified, and not liable to be impleaded or called to account for taking protection from a conqueror or uſurper.</p>
               <p>I hope I have ſaid enough to ſatisfy the reader, that our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants did nothing more than their duty in taking protection: and if they thought they could ſecure better treatment, or alleviate their calamity by congratulations, they had an undoubted right to do it. It did not ſhew much political wiſdom, I allow; but let that matter be as it will, they did not commit any crime againſt the laws or government, for neither law nor government exiſted. The Sovereign power was in a ſtate of temporary death, the ſoul was fled and departed, and nothing remained but the carcaſe; which could no more be injured or violated by any of our former
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:017861_0008_0FA3741585FBB148"/>citizens taking protection, or ſigning a congratulation, than they could be ſaid to commit murder by trampling on the body of a man who had been dead and buried many months.</p>
               <p>With reſpect to preſenting congratulations, it were eaſy to prove from what happened in other countries that they are by no means a true teſt or proof of the public ſentiments, or of thoſe who preſent them. Such addreſſes are obtained in all countries by a few deſigning men, and the reſt by threats, terror, or a ſort of impulſe, follow the example. For a long time before Cromwell died he was deteſted by the Engliſh nation, and ſcarcely an honeſt man in it who did not wiſh to have him diſpatched.</p>
               <p>Yet after his death, and the nomination of his ſon Richard to the protectorſhip, which was looked on as a tyranny.
<q>The city of London and almoſt all the countries and cities in England ſent him addreſſes of condolance for the loſs of his father, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulations on his ſucceſſion to the protectorſhip. So little, ſays Burnet, do theſe appearances ſignify.</q> This levity, this infirmity of the multitude, no ſtateſman before our time thought in earneſt of puniſhing. Our laws cannot do it. Lord Cornwallis himſelf, tho' not a man of abilities, yet has ſenſe enough to know that if he and Clinton were in Charleſtown going to be hanged, the people would rejoice and ſign congratulations as they did on a different occaſion.</p>
               <p>I well know prudent men, or rather ſuch as think themſelves ſo, will ſay, that this doctrine of <hi>Protection</hi> ought not to be drawn into diſcuſſion, but ſhould ſleep in ſilence for the preſent. But is not the contrary doctrine believed to be law? Have not be few proclaimed to the world, and ſtill continue to proclaim it, that the protection<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men forfeited their lives and fortunes? Has not the government been ſeized, and its conſtitution ſubverted, by the <hi>few</hi> in conſequence of that doctrine? Has it not ſet one part of the community againſt the other, brought ruin on many, and diſhonour on us all? I ſhould hold myſelf guilty of the moſt poſillammous ſubmiſſion, were I under this conviction and to be ſilent on it.</p>
               <p>For men in power to perſuade the people, that they committed crimes and acted diſhonourably, when there is neither crime nor diſhonour in the caſe, is a moſt miſchievous policy. It has the ſame pernicious effects on the multitude, that private ſcandal and defamation, has on an innocent individual. It breaks that ſpirit, and generous pride, which is the beſt guardian of publick liberty and private honour. It overwhelms the publick as well as the private mind, with conſcious inferiority; degrades men in their own opinion, and tenders them fit tools for the ambitious deſigns, and arbitrary diſpoſitions of haughty aſpiring ſuperiors.</p>
               <p>Whether I am right, let thoſe judge who have carefully obſerved the deportment and behaviour of ſuch of our unhappy citizens as are held under cenſure, for taking protection, by thoſe in authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The citizens who came from Charleſtown in the ſcorching hearts of Auguſt laſt, by a proclamation, afforded a melancholy
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:017861_0009_0FA374164725B640"/>proof, how ſoon oppreſſion degrades mankind, and impreſſes timid, cringing habits, even on the minds of freemen.</p>
               <p>Having proved the taking protection was no crime in the people, I ſhall go on to ſhew, that on the reſtoration of the republic and laws from Britiſh thraldom, the protection-men who had been our citizens before, were as fully entitled to all the rights and freedom of citizenſhip, as thoſe who were detained priſoners of war, or took refuge to the northward.</p>
               <p>Every country of which we have any account from hiſtory, has had its day of woe and affliction, by foreign invaſion, or civil diſcord, as we have had. But in every one of them as ſoon as the troubles were over, and the country regained; the government returned to its antient form, and the ſubjects were reinſtated in the participation of their rights and privileges. And this is not only agreeable to juſtice, but the freedom and liberty of the country would be deſtroyed if it were otherwiſe. If in a republic a <hi>few</hi> could ſet up pretenſions to ſuperior political merit, over the whole aggregate body of the people, and deprive the latter of their rights and privileges, this would be nothing more nor leſs than overthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the conſtitution, ſeizing on the liberties of the people, and ſetting up an arbitrary government of the <hi>few</hi> The laws of nations as well as the rights of nature therefore dictate, that when a country oppreſſed by a foreign power regains its liberty, the citizens ſhould be reſtored to all the rights and liberties they before enjoyed.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>A whole nation, ſays Puffendorf, cap. 6, when it hath, either by its own ſtrength, or the aſſiſtance of friends or allies, ſhaken off an enemy's yoke, recovers its liberty and antient ſtate. And if a part of the people be recovered by the people, from which they were for ſome time divided or torn, or by the aſſiſtance of allies, they again incorporate with the old body, and return to the place and rights they had before.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This authority goes to the point; but in order to make it plainer, I ſhall put a caſe: I ſhall ſuppoſe a nation governed by a limited monarch, invaded by a powerful enemy, and after trying the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of war, entirely vanquiſhed. The Prince eſcapes into another State, and the ſubjects are obliged to receive ſuch terms as the conqueror chuſes to grant. In caſe this country be again recovered by the aſſiſtance of friends or allies, would it not be ſtrange indeed, that the prince on returning, ſhould call the conqueſt over his people, and their neceſſity to ſubmit, by the name of treaſon againſt the government? Should he carry this notion ſo far as to exclude the ſubjects from the benefit of the antient laws, and deny to all the rights of citizenſhip, except to his friends or adherents, and ſuch whoſe captivity prevented them from following the example of the reſt, or whoſe reſidence on the frontier afforded an eaſy removal into another country; would not this procedure be conſidered as ſeizing the government and ſetting up his own will to reign inſtead of laws? If there was a ſpark of freedom left in ſuch a
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:017861_0010_0FA374175D2EA078"/>country, they would aſk what his deſign and preſence for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming to the world that his ſubjects had committed treaſon, and forfeited, without trial or conviction, the rights and protection of the antient laws? To cut this matter ſhort, was not this exactly the courſe taken by the late G— R—, who acted only as miniſter of State for our Republic? Did he not iſſue his procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation to make the people and the nations around believe, that by a temporary ſubmiſſion to a conqueror who had the power of life and death in his hands, they had incurred crime and diſhonour? Has not himſelf and a <hi>few</hi> others who were not in the country while the war raged, nor lent the leaſt aid to drive out the enemy, bereaved the citizens of their rights and privileges, and by the terror of dictatorial power reduced the whole State to a condition of vaſſalage, without any other redemption than dragooning into ſix months military ſervice, by way of puniſhment and expiation?</p>

               <head>II. <hi>On Governor Rutledge's Proclamation of the</hi> 27th <hi>of September,</hi> 1781.</head>
               <p>A Meaſure ſo ſingular as this is muſt be produced by ſome uncommon motive. It is, however, one of thoſe things, which the more a man will think of, the more will he deteſt it. For it is calculated for no other end but to ſow the poiſonous ſeeds of faction and party, to diſgrace the middling and lower claſs of our citizens, and throw the whole weight and powers of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment out of the people into a few families. G—r R—'s proclamation, and the plans which he carried laſt aſſembly, would, unleſs unrivetted by a future one, faſten at one blow in this country, a fierce and jealous ariſtocracy, which has been gaining ground for ſeven years paſt. Miſerable is that republic whoſe citizens want diſcernment to penetrate through ſuch deſigns, or are afraid to expoſe them!</p>
               <p>For ſome time before the battle of the Eutaw Springs, almoſt all our citizens without the lines of Charleſtown, and with few ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, all within, worried by the tyranny of the Britiſh army, held them and their cauſe in the utmoſt deteſtation. The victory obtained in that action proved a death-warrant to the tory intereſt in this State; and the capture of the Britiſh army under Lord Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wallis following on the heels of the event, rouſed the few tories there were as from a dream; and they ſaw clearly they had hitherto only deluded themſelves in thinking this country would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered. And thoſe who from zeal, levity, or neceſſity, adhered to the enemy after the fall of Charleſtown, employed all the means in their power to pave the way to a reconciliation. This was not difficult for thoſe who had not perſonal enemies among us; for General Greene wanted ſupplies, the town abounded with merch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andize,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:017861_0011_0FA37417C809E838"/>of which our old citizens found means to ſend out large quantities. The very adventurers who followed the Britiſh army to South-Carolina became our friends, and teſtified their zeal for us on many occaſions.</p>
               <p>This I believe was the true ſtate of parties the latter end of the year 1781. Happy would it have been for this country if the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the public could have diſentangled their minds from the reſentments and party-rage which prevail in civil wars! A procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation then framed upon principles of wiſdom and humanity, would have had a happy tendency to bury in oblivion what was paſt; to extinguiſh from the minds of men, a ſenſe of late injuries; to unite the affections of all; and reſtore the country to order and tranquillity.</p>
               <p>The proclamation of September 27th, as I obſerved before, went on the Governor's idea that the great body of the people who had taken protection had thereby forfeited their lives, liberty, and property. He takes upon him to offer pardon to every one of them who ſhould join our ſtandard in 30 days, and ſerve 6 months in the militia, as common ſoldiers; excepting from this benefit, thoſe who were baniſhed the State in the beginning of the troubles; the congratulators, and ſuch as held commiſſions civil or military on the 27th of September, or were then with the enemy. I ſhall ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the good or bad policy of excluding ſuch a number of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens as this exception comprehended, admitting he had the power he pretended to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> However on the 17th of November he iſſued a ſecond proclamation, extending the benefits held out by the former under the like terms.</p>
               <p>As the capture of Cornwallis and his army was known to the Governor when this proclamation came out; as the Britiſh troops had abſolutely loſt their courage with their loſs at Eutaw, and the Pennſylvania Line was on the march from York-Town to our aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance: When this, and the ſtate the country was in at that junc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is conſidered; I leave the reader to judge, whether the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation was not calculated rather for creating miſchief than for raiſing a force. For it laid all who neglected or refuſed, not only under a ſtigma and reproach, but under ſuch diſabilities as degrad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them below the rank of freemen.</p>
               <p>Obliging the whole country that had taken protection to turn out and ſerve ſix months in the militia, was the greateſt oppreſſion imaginable; and the contriver of it well knew, as thoſe do, who now drive down the meaſure, that it was commanding what was abſolutely impoſſible. Men are generally ſo embarraſſed with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences of one ſort or another, that there is no ſociety on earth, the aggregate body whereof could all quit their families and homes for ſix months. In our caſe, not to mention how much agriculture would ſuffer by ſuch emigration, the heads of thoſe families who reſided within the enemy's range, were peculiarly cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtanced. They were no doubt called on by the feelings of
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:017861_0012_0FA3741886C46430"/>fathers, huſbands, or protectors to ſtay and afford the feeble pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection they could to their families, or avert the diſtreſs or ruin that would enſue; if they joined our army, which at that time had not the power of protecting them.</p>
               <p>Ordering them out, therefore, without regard to local ſituation, ſickneſs, or other diſtreſs, was an extravagant act of power. Whether they reſided within or out of the enemy's garriſon or guards; whether a man's wife or little ones, or the property the Britiſh had left him unplundered, were in or out of the enemy's reach: All this was nothing; they muſt abandon the whole to the rage of an unprincipled, revengeful enemy; and ſally forth, like Don Quixote, ſetting Britiſh guards and parties at defiance, in queſt of adventures on the report of a proclamation; and what per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps was more mortifying; they muſt humble themſelves and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate for mercy as criminals, at the feet of a man who a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was a fellow citizen, no more than on a fooling with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>I conjure any ſenſible honeſt man to tell me, if this was acting the part of a magiſtrate, framing regulations for the eaſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience of a people, over whoſe happineſs he was appointed to preſide? In the high ſtation he was, ought he not to have looked on the people at large as children of the republic; whoſe only crime was a misfortune that admitted of no alternative? Inſtead of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the liſt of their calamities, from Britiſh oppreſſion, ought he not to have comforted them, and rather to palliate, or cover over any ſtain of diſhonour, if any there was, than lay them under the condemnation of treachery to their country? this proclamation was like putting the citizens in a Bear-ſkin, and then worrying them; or according to a more juſt compariſon made by General Gadſden on the Confiſcation Bill; he ſaid it was like an <hi>Auto de fe,</hi> a ſort of proceeding uſed in Portugal againſt Heretics, where they are dreſſed in frocks painted over with figures of fiends and devils, to excite a horror in the multitude againſt them.</p>

               <head>III. <hi>On the Mode of conducting the Election for the Aſſembly at Jackſonborough.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>I Shall proceed to examine the mode of conducting the elections in the latter end of 1781, for the Aſſembly at Jackſonborough; as I think it of conſequence that the public ſhould be acquainted with the nature of it. The Governor reſolved to convene the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly in January; and whether the meaſure of calling them at all, at that time, will turn out a bleſſing or a curſe to us, time will diſcover. The writs of election were accompanied with <hi>printed inſtructions</hi> to the returning officers, not to admit any perſon to vote, but ſuch as obeyed his extraordinary proclamation. The returning officers had alſo further orders from the Governor to chuſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar men whom he named, and according to ſuch nomination they were choſen.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="unknown:017861_0013_0FA3741945C36B08"/>
Our Conſtitution or Charter or Liberties aſcertains the qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of voters, and ſecures this valuable priviledge by the following clauſe:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Every free white man who has attained to the age of 21 years, and hath been a reſident and an inhabitant in this State for the ſpace of one whole year, and hath freehold of fifty acres of land, or a town lot, and been ſeized of it ſix months previous to the election, or paid a tax, or was taxable ſix months previous to the election in a ſum equal to the tax on fifty acres of land, ſhall be deemed qualified to vote for, and be eligible, &amp;c.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus the Conſtitution gives to every ſuch citizen a <hi>participation in the Sovereignty of the State,</hi> which right and ſhare neither Governor nor both Houſes can take away without eſtabliſhing a tyrannical government on the ruins of our Liberties. And at any rate the Aſſembly could not alter the Conſtitution nor any part of it without ninety days notice by the—ſection. For the Governer therefore to aſſume authority to deprive ſome citizens of this right and give it to others, is a flagrant inſtance of tyranny, and is ſcarcely to be equalled in any country that pretended to freedom. The priviledge of voting for thoſe who are to make laws for us, is a right ſo inherent in every citizen of our State, that the Governor or Legiſlature, who pretends under any condition or limitation to deprive him of it, and then return it as a matter of favour, actually plays the tyrant by ſo doing: It is <hi>at once veſting the government in a few independant of the whole: An overt-act</hi> to change the nature and form of our Conſtitution: Not an injury to one or a few individuals, but I aver it to be what in every Republican Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is called <hi>crimen laeſae libertatis, high treaſon againſt the ſovereignty and liberties of the people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>It is eſſential to the being of a parliament, ſays Blackſtone, that elections ſhould be abſolutely free. Therefore all undue influence on the electors is illegal and ſtrongly prohibited; Mr. Locke ranks it among thoſe breaches of truſt in the <hi>executive magiſtrate,</hi> which according to his notion amount to a diſſolution of the government if he employs the force, the treaſure and offices of ſociety to corrupt the Repreſentatives, or <hi>openly to pre-engage the electors,</hi> and <hi>preſcribe what manner of perſons ſhall be choſen.</hi> For thus to regulate candidates and electors and <hi>new model the ways of election;</hi> what is it, ſays he, but to cut up the government by the roots, and poiſon the very fountain of public ſecurity.</q> Blackſt. vol. 1. p. 178.</p>
               <p>The right of electing thoſe who act as public truſtees in the legiſlature is by our conſtitution ſo veſted in the citizen, ſo perſonal to him, that he cannot ſurrender or reſign it, any more than the ſubſtance of his body can part with its ſhadow; nor can it be forfeited until he be convicted of ſome notorious crime, on a fair trial by his peers. <hi>It is indefeaſible and hereditary,</hi> and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor with all the authority which an act of Aſſembly could give him, was only an agent or truſtee, who could no more aboliſh
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:017861_0014_0FA3741A06D76760"/>this right of the principal or people who appointed him, than a man who is only attorney or manager of an eſtate, can deſtroy or alienate the right of his employer. The manager exerciſing an act of ownerſhip, ſuch as ſelling or converting it to his own emolument, makes void his commiſſion. The power of the truſt returns to the owner, and the other is reſponſible for his breach of it. So the Governor ſeizing on the freedom of election, which alone conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes the freedom of the people, was deſtroying all legal authority in himſelf. Such an act of power was a <hi>felo de ſe;</hi> a murderer of itſelf. It was no longer the act of the law, but of the uſurper; and <hi>packing an Aſſembly</hi> in which he confirmed all his doings, was making the matter ten times worſe; it was employing the <hi>forms</hi> of parliament, of law and conſtitution to rivet his uſurpation.</p>
               <p>As to the Governor's extraordinary powers in the receſs of the Aſſembly, <q>to do and execute whatever he thought neceſſary for the ſafety of the State.</q> On due conſideration of this clauſe, I believe no lawyer will be ſo hardy as to deny, that this power only authoriſed him to ſupport, not to overturn the charter of our liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and fundamental laws of the State, and by this precedent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe us in future to all the miſchiefs of arbitrary power.</p>
               <p>Encroachments on public liberty commence in all republics with plauſible pretences of promoting ſome public good, or remedying ſome evil. In any government where there is the leaſt ſpark of freedom, <hi>open</hi> and <hi>barefaced tyranny</hi> can never inſinuate itſelf. It is obliged therefore like the original tempter in Paradiſe, to aſſume a ſhape which may conceal its ſubtilty, and the ſtory of every na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion affords examples of this truth. In the inſtance before me, the pretence was "a neceſſity for excluding from votes the diſaffected or protection-men, to prevent a tory influence in the Legiſlature." I look upon this to be a ſhallow pretence: It alſo amounts to a calumny on the great body of the people, who hated the Britiſh government as much, and loved <hi>Republican equality</hi> much better than ſome people I could name <note n="*" place="bottom">I have been told that certain gentlemen frequently make it their buſineſs in company, to propagate a notion, that the people of this State are not capable to govern themſelves, and that the conſtitution ſhould be changed into an ariſtocracy, or the government of certain potent families. Does not this let the Cat out of the bag, and account for ſome late proceedings?</note>. The political ſentiments of the public were ſuch, and the hatred to the Britiſh ſo univerſal, that had a free, impartial election prevailed, there would have been, not only no danger, but the ſettlement of the government, and peace of the country, would in all probability have been conſulted much better than it was. I believe as much as I exiſt, that it was a great and public misfortune, that the Governor returned to the country, or that Major Hyrne, whom I regard by the by, as a man of great merit, exchanged the Charleſtown militia. Had they remained where they were, <hi>a convention of the people</hi> would have been
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:017861_0015_0FA3741AC74E1E00"/>held as ſoon as things were ripe for it: Elections would have been made agreeable to the conſtitution; ſomething like temperance and juſtice might have prevailed; and the State at this time might have been in freedom and ſerenity; inſtead of the arbitrary mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, the ſpirit of faction, and diſcontent, ruin and miſery of families, which like a diſmal gloomy miſt hangs over the land at preſent.</p>
               <p>At any rate we could not have been worſted, for anarchy or no Government is far preferable to an arbitrary one. How different the policy adopted in New-Jerſey, and other parts of America, where the enemy for a while domineered, and the people uniformly took a temporary protection! Not one of them affords an example of a public ſervant fixing on the tyranny exerciſed by the enemy over his countrymen, as a maſk or pretence for accuſing them of diſaffection, and taking the government out of their hands. Not one of them trampled, as we have done, on <hi>the charter of their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties or conſtitution,</hi> under colour of guarding againſt tory influence.</p>
               <p>This influence the State of Jerſey apprehended a few months ago; but what did they do? Not to open a theatre for the citizens to worry and perſecute each other, under diſtinctions of the <hi>virtuous few,</hi> and <hi>protection-men;</hi> they only paſſed an act ſubſtituting the mode of giving in their votes at the elections, openly and publicly, inſtead of balloting as formerly.</p>
               <p>How the legiſlature could make this proclamation of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or the ground-work of all their proceedings, cannot be accounted for, but by conſidering that ſuch was his influence, and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement of his party, that it became dangerous to make any oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. The great majority of the Aſſembly were men who had taken protection; but who from local ſituation were enabled to join the army, or find a ſubſtitute.</p>
               <p>What a ſtrong impreſſion of horror of the Governor's arbitrary power muſt thoſe members have upon them, when they gave their votes for degrading their fellow-citizens from the rights of freemen, only for doing what they did themſelves, making a temporary ſubmiſſion to a conqueror! Some gratified the workings of revenge, and others ſome other paltry paſſion. But they were all mere tools to carry on the buſineſs of uſurpation on the freedom of their country, and raiſe a few families to a height of power as would one day cruſh them and their poſterity.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>The following words of the preamble of the Excluſion Act are worth quoting:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>AND WHEREAS it is inconſiſtent with juſtice and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy that any of the perſons who are excluded by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor's
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:017861_0016_0FA3741B86A395C0"/>proclamation from pardon ſhould be admitted to vote for, or be eligible as members of the Legiſlature; be it enacted, that no perſon by the ſaid proclamation excepted, ſhall be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to vote for, or be eligible as members of either branch of the Legiſlature.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This Act of Aſſembly ſuppoſes with the Governor, that all who did not come in whithin the time ſpecified by the proclamation, and ſerve ſix months, had forfeited their liberty, and that ſuch as obeyed, were reſtored to loſt freedom. But the gentlemen of both Houſes forgot, that the citizens of South-Carolina had to thank the Governor for nothing: Their rights and liberties were founded on ſomething elſe beſides parchment, or paper, or a proclamation; they were built on the laws of nature, and the fundamental laws of the State, and they were ſupported by the valour, and cemented by the blood of thoſe brave men who fought, bled, and died in the cauſe of freedom, not for the uſurpation of a few, but for the liberties and happineſs of all. And yet this wretched country at this very hour, when peace and happineſs ſhould prevail, is ſplit into a faction of two claſſes of men; the one ſort, a ſet of mongrel freemen, begot between G—R—and a proclamation, or his party in the Aſſembly; or holding the privilege of voting becauſe they could advance fifty or ſixty guineas to procure a ſubſtitute. The reſt are aliens in the government, diveſted of every privilege we have been contending for theſe ſeven years paſt, and to be <hi>ruled</hi> and <hi>taxed without their conſent.</hi> Even the unfortunate citizens of Charleſtown, who tho' they were not <hi>ſix months-men</hi> under G— R—'s proclamation, yet were actually <hi>ſix years-men</hi> like common ſoldiers, before the reduction of the town. Their zeal for the cauſe, and courage in ſupporting it, was often proved on dangerous and honourable trials: They were all taken in defending it; and the great bulk of them bore hunger, inſults and perſecution before they would ſubmit even to a conqueror; yet are their ſervices not only forgotten, but they have been abuſed and worried as if they were convicts, and are now little better than vaſſals in their own city, except a few of the richer ſort, who could buy the freedom of voting; which it ſeems before this laſt general election was let to ſale as it were with an OYEZ. Gold, it appears, with all their pretended fears of tory influence can work a miracle, by making a man a whig, and buy a right of voting or being elected. Is not this like the coming of the day of judgment to our freedom? when the right of election, to keep which chaſte and unſpotted, we went to war with Great Britain, is now, like a public ſtrumpet, to be embraced only by him who can pull out his guineas, and advance a mercenary reward?</p>
               <p>I have now done with the proclamation and election buſineſs; and here I muſt declare, that I can lay my hand on my heart, and ſay, that I entertain no perſonal diſlike or prejudice to J— R—. It is not the man I cenſure but the meaſure. Probably any other citizen with the power of doing what he pleaſed, would
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:017861_0017_0FA3741C45CDB3D8"/>have acted no better; for ſupreme authority is ſo intoxicating to human nature, that even the good are miſled by it. The aggran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſement of his family, and perpetuating power in it; or being at the head of an <hi>ariſtocracy,</hi> is of far greater conſequence to an able, ambitious man, than public freedom. South-Carolina is not the only place in the world where a firſt-rate citizen, of a guardian of his countrymens liberty, turned an invader, and ſubverted it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of preſerving it.</p>

               <p>The principal difficulty I meet with on a ſubject where ſo much may be ſaid, is to confine myſelf within the narrow compaſs I propoſed.</p>
               <p>It is impoſſible not to feel diſtreſs when we reflect on the miſeries which each party in a civil war, inflicts on the other as they become uppermoſt. The cruel oppreſſions of the Britiſh, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly the perſonal inſults and outrage we ſuffered from their officers, after the fall of the country, is enough to make a man ſhudder.</p>
               <p>Their treatment was ſo extravagantly outrageous, that no deſcription will ever give a juſt idea of it; and to myſelf who was a witneſs and a ſufferer, it appears like a dream, and almoſt incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to me. Their cruelty to the garriſon; their violation of the capitulation; their ſequeſtration and plunder; their baniſhing the tender ſex, our wives, and children, to a diſtant country, merely to gratify malice, as a days journey would have ſet them down amidſt their friends in their own country: During all this ſcene of violence and revenge, we ourſelves never ceaſed to make the moſt tragical complaints, and calling heaven and earth to witneſs and avenge the injuſtice of our enemies; and yet no ſooner did Providence turn things in our favour, and reſtore to us our country, than inſtead of thinking how to ſettle the peace and happineſs of it, we took the quite contrary way, and looked about for means of doing vengeance in our turn, by way of retaliation. No ſooner did we ceaſe to fear and ſuffer, than our next endeavour was to make others fear and feel miſery, as if it was neceſſary either to be ſuffering ruin or doing miſchief. In thinking on theſe bitter calamities which men are ſo ingenious in contriving for each other, he muſt be more or leſs than man who cannot feel compaſſion and ſorrow for the unhappy lot of human nature, and cry out with Shakeſpear,

               <p>Our act of aſſembly which baniſhes ſo many citizens, after reducing their families <note n="*" place="bottom">Beccaria makes the following remarks on confiſcation: <q>The law which ordains confiſcations, ſets a price on the head of the ſubject; with the guilty puniſhes the innocent; and by reducing them to indigence and deſpair, tempts them to become criminal. Can there be a more melancholy ſpectacle, than a whole family, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with infamy and miſery, from the crime of their chief? a crime, which if it had been poſſible, they were reſtrained from preventing, by that ſubmiſſion which the laws themſelves have ordained.</q>
                  </note> to beggary, <hi>without hearing,</hi> is perhaps the moſt furious proſcription of which we have any account in all hiſtory. Sylla, the Dictator, by virtue of his <hi>extraordinary powers,</hi> to be revenged on the party in oppoſition, and enrich his own ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents, baniſhed more citizens, though he took not perhaps half the property we did. He diſdained however to do it under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence or colour of law and conſtitution; he did it as Lord Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wallis ſequeſtered our eſtates, and baniſhed our families, by dint of military force, at the head of an army devoted to him.</p>
               <p>In the civil diſcord and factions of the ſmall republics of Greece, the party which was uppermoſt ſometimes baniſhed the leading men on the other ſide. But this proceeding was always done in a mobbiſh way, or by force of arms. But our Aſſembly very peaceably, under the maſk of juſtice, and under the forms of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, condemned the citizens in violation of the ſpirit and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of both. No crime alledged; no one article of charge given in againſt any of them; nor does any ſuch accuſation appear on the journals of either houſe at this moment. Before they heard of it with any certainty, the law was paſſed and their doom fixed. At the time the Aſſembly was taking his property from the citizen, which the State ſhould ſecure for the maintenance of his children; at the inſtant he was condemned to utter ruin and infamy, and put to a <hi>political death;</hi> the unhappy man was in Charleſtown, with his wife and family; perhaps ſtruggling under the preſſure of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity in getting them common neceſſaries, or ſuffering under
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:017861_0019_0FA3741DC6ECBC50"/>Britiſh tyranny; and his little property going for a trifle, under the deſpotic orders of a military tribunal. This was the caſe with many of them.</p>
               <p>And thus, a report or idle ſlory, an old grudge, revenge, or malice, ſupplied the place of legal accuſation, of evidence, of Judge and Jury.</p>
               <p>The injuſtice of this meaſure is ſo enormous, that the endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to prove it, is like proving that the Sun now ſhines at noon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day. Hearing the accuſed, and giving him a chance to defend himſelf, is the firſt and moſt ſacred rule of juſtice. All ſorts of laws, civil and military, laws of parliament, courts-martial, and others, hear proof and defence; and any tribunal that refuſes to hear proof, refuſes to do juſtice; and muſt thereby ſuffer a ruin of character, and bear an eternal ſtigma and reproach on the face of its proceedings.</p>
               <p>According to Magna Charta, which is in force in this State, <q>No man ſhall be diſinherited, nor put out of his franchiſes, or freehold, unleſs he be duly brought to anſwer, and before-judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by due courſe of law, if any thing be done to the contrary, it ſhall be redreſſed and holden for none.</q>
               </p>
               <p>By the—clauſe of our conſtitution, or charter of liberties, <q>No freeman ought to be taken or impriſoned, or diſſeized of his freehold, liberties or privileges, or outlawed, or exiled, or in any manner deſtroyed, or deprived of his liberty or property, but by the judgment of his peers, or the law of the land.</q>
               </p>
               <p>It is needleſs to obſerve that the liberty of the people through the other States, are ſecured againſt arbitrary power in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, by their reſpective conſtitutions. All of them have paſſed laws of baniſhment and confiſcation againſt ſome of their danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous citizens; but every one of them appointed a long day, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic notice was given in the prints, to render themſelves for trial.</p>
               <p>Nor did they make any diſtinction, whether the parties were within the enemy's lines at New-York, or elſewhere. The legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature of Pennſylvania, paſſed a <hi>Second Act,</hi> for giving a further time to certain of the exiles, who were ſaid to be in England, and ſuppoſed to have been out of the reach of the former proclamation; and accordingly this ſecond law was notified in the prints. I am credibly informed that the State of Maryland extended to their exiles, three years to come in and ſhew their innocence. In ſhort we are the only State in the Union, who ran blindfold into this irregular buſineſs, without hearing their defence or giving them a future day to make it; except the State of Georgia who improved on our example; but it ſeems are now repenting of it.</p>
               <p>The drivers of the confiſcation and other acts, may attempt to juſtfy the late proceedings from the Parliamentary hiſtory of the Houſe of Lords in England: The nation whence we deſcended; whoſe code of laws we in general made uſe of, and whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of government we have copied as nearly as our circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances will admit. If in the whole hiſtory of that people, the
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:017861_0020_0FA3741E8790DFD8"/>meaſure of attainting without a hearing, cannot be ſupported; then muſt it fall to the ground: for as to the juſtice, reaſon, or policy of it, the mind of man muſt revolt at it.</p>
               <p>I do aver it to be a law of Parliament, <q>That on all bills of attainder the accuſed do appear and put in his anſwer;</q> and the hiſtory of England affords not a ſingle inſtance of an attainder, that was grounded upon <hi>general charges,</hi> without examination and hearing, but hath been univerſally branded with marks of deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by the lawyers and hiſtorians of that nation, and is at this day, conſidered rather as a national reproach, than a precedent for imitation. It is true their parliament have been too often led by the furious heats of civil war, or the influence of arbitrary rulers, into acts of attainder without a hearing. But they have not only been execrated, but almoſt uniformly reverſed by act of Parliament, for the injuſtice of them; as I ſhall ſhew preſently. In moderate reigns, and when arbitrary power did not prevail, bills of attainder in Parliament were conducted according to maxims of juſtice, or <hi>ſecundum allegata &amp; probata:</hi> That is, the accuſed was reſponſible only for ſuch crimes as were <hi>alledged and proved</hi> againſt him; if he was in any port of the king's dominions, and forth coming, he had notice to appear, or was legally arreſted; if he abſconded, then they proclaimed a day for his appearance, which if he obſerved not, they proceeded to attaint him.</p>
               <p>On the bill of attainder againſt the Earl of Clarendon, [Lords Debates, Vol. I. &amp;c] he was ſo generally obnoxious to all parties, that he did not think it ſafe to abide by the event, but he fled his country to Holland. On this the houſe ſent a meſſage to the king to iſſue a proclamation for his appearance, and afterwards the charges of impeachment againſt him were enquired into, and referred to the opinion of the Judges whether they were criminal or not. This is the law, this the mode of proceeding in the Britiſh Parliament, except where law and juſtice were trampled on by tyranny and oppreſſion.</p>
               <p>I ſhould have obſerved, that bills of attainder were never intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Engliſh conſtitution, but as the ultimate reſource upon extraordinary occaſions: The deſign of them was excellent; not to deſtroy mechanics and people of obſcure condition, ſuch as our act of attainder is full of; but bills of attainder was originally inſtituted to call to a ſevere reckoning, <hi>Governors</hi> and <hi>Miniſters of State,</hi> who, of public ſervants, turned public enemies; and were by the influence which their very abuſe of power gave them, grown too big and weighty for Judge and Jury to deal with.</p>
               <p>According to Judge Blackſtone, this, and no other, was the true intent of bills of attainder. <q>For though in general, ſays he, the union of the Legiſlature and judicial powers ought to be moſt carefully avoided, yet it may happen <hi>that a ſubject intruſted with the adminiſtration of public affairs, may infringe the rights
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:017861_0021_0FA3741F47626180"/>of the people, and be guilty of ſuch crimes as the ordinary magiſtrate, either does not or cannot puniſh.</hi>

               <p>I ſhall leave the reader to apply the quotation as he chuſes, and go on to produce a few caſes on attainders.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of the reign of Edward III Roger, Earl Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timer, <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Lord Coke ſays they indicted him, and not being able to proceed that way, "Reſolved to ruin him by Attainder."</hi>
                  </note> was condemned and executed without trial. But this at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainder was reverſed by Act of Parliament for this reaſon, <q>becauſe he was not brought to judgement according to the courſe of law.</q>
               </p>
               <p>1ſt. Ed. 3 The like happened to Edmond, Earl of Arundel; but in the 4th of this reign, his ſon petitioned Parliament, ſetting forth, "that the proceedings were contrary to Magna Charta, and inſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he ſhould have been tried by due courſe of law" And he was reſtored in part; and an act of reverſal paſſed the 28th of this reign, <q>declaring that the ſtatute by which he was attainted, was void and null.</q>
               </p>
               <p>4th. Ed. III. Sir Simon de Beresford, Materevers, and others were condemned to death without trial or examination, for killing Edward II. and his uncle. But the 19th of the ſame reign, a writ iſſued to ſuſpend the judgment againſt Materevers, for this reaſon, "becauſe it had been illegally paſſed."</p>
               <p>In the reign of Charles 1ſt, the Earl of Stafford was attainted by Act of Parliament, but he was allowed to pot in his anſwer, and was heard before the Houſe of Lords. However, though the charges againſt him, amounted not to treaſon or felony, he was condemned and executed through party malice and revenge; but in the next reign his attainder was, for the injuſtice of it, reverſed by Act of Parliament, in which was a clauſe to this effect, viz. <q>That the ſaid act of attainder againſt Earl Stafford be obliterated from the journals of both houſes, that the ſame be not viſible in after ages, nor uſed as a precedent againſt any perſon what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.</q>
               </p>
               <p>For the act of attainder paſſed againſt Sir John Fenwick, Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam the IIId. was branded by the Britiſh nation, becauſe he was attainted without a witneſs; whereas an act paſſed that very Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament requiring two witneſſes in caſes of treaſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>It is impoſſible, ſays an author of a treatiſe on penal laws, to apologize for the many bloody ſtains we find indelibly fixed upon Engliſh hiſtory. One of Henry VIII's Parliaments, attainted the Counteſs of Saliſbury, the Marchioneſs of Exeter, and others, <hi>without any trial or citation to appear, or without better proofs than the ſuggeſtions</hi> of the wretched ſycophant Cromwell, (his miniſter.) This inſtrument of regal tyranny, fell a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to the ſame <hi>iniquitous meaſures</hi> himſelf. He was ſome time afterward attainted by the ſame Parliament, and without trial,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:017861_0022_0FA3742007F55E68"/>examination, or evidence, condemned to death and executed.</q> Principle of penal laws, c. 5.</p>
               <p>My Lord Coke's remark on Cromwell's attainder without trial, is thus:—Auſert oblivio, ſi potent, ſi non utcunque ſilentium regat.—<hi>Let the tranſaction be forever buried in oblivion, if poſſible; if not, conceal it as well as we can.</hi> Theſe cruel attainders are alſo cenſured by Biſhop Burnet, Hiſt. Reformat. <q>Such bills, ſays he, cannot be enough condemned; for they were a breach of the moſt ſacred and unalterable rules of juſtice.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The cruelty of this Parliament in condemning the ſubjects with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out trial or examination is alſo branded with infamy, by the hiſtorians, Hume, Rapin, and thoſe who went before them. To ſtrike a blow of vengeance under the maſk of juſtice, is the moſt to be execrated of all iniquity; and the hiſtorian who joins to a clear head, a good heart, never fails to deter poſterity from ſuch deeds by painting them in proper colours. Mr Hume in the Counteſs of Saliſbury's caſe, obſerves; <q>Henry reſolved to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed againſt her <hi>in a more ſummary and more tyrannical manner;</hi> he found that her offences could not be proved, or that ſhe could not by law be ſubjected to ſuch ſevere puniſhment as he deſired to inflict on her. And for that purpoſe he ſent Cromwell, who was obſequious to his will, to demand of the judges whether the Parliament could attaint a perſon who was forth-coming without giving him any trial, or citing him to appear before them. The Judges replied it was a dangerous queſtion, and <hi>that the high court of Parliament ought to give examples to inferior courts, of proceeding according to juſtice—No inferior court could act in an arbitrary manner, and they thought the Parliament never would.</hi>—Being preſſed to give a more explicit anſwer, they replied, that if a perſon were attainted in that manner, the attainder after could never be brought in queſtion, and muſt remain good in law. Henry learned by their deciſion that ſuch a method of proceeding, <hi>though the contrary to all principles of equity, was yet practicable.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>In his account of Cromwell's fate he goes on. <q>Immediately after a bill of attainder was framed againſt him, and the Houſe of Peers thought proper, without trial, examination, or evidence, to condemn him to death. The only circumſtance of his conduct by which he ſeems to have merited this fate was, his being the inſtrument of the <hi>king's tyranny</hi> in conducting the like <hi>iniquitous bills</hi> in the former ſeſſions againſt the Counteſs of Saliſbury and others.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The few quotations I have made need no comment. Every caſe I have given runs parallel to that under conſideration, and goes to prove the irregularity of the late proceedings.—They ſhew what a clamour the illegal condemnation of even one ſubject makes in a nation that pretends to freedom. And that no Parliament was ever underſtood by any ſound lawyer, or good hiſtorian, to have a lawful power to deſtroy the citizens without trial or examination.

               <p>But condemning without hearing is not the only objection againſt our late proſcription; it is what the lawyers call an <hi>ex poſt facto law;</hi> which even in arbitrary governments is reckoned tyranny. An <hi>ex poſt facto law</hi> is ſuch a law as is made <hi>to day,</hi> to puniſh the action of <hi>yeſterday,</hi> tho' yeſterday's action was innocent. A man for inſtance takes a protection from a conqueror, who is in poſſeſſion of the country, or ſigns a congratulation; this, I ſay, could not be puniſhed by any law of <hi>our</hi> State on a public and fair trial. To bring in a retroſpective act therefore, on purpoſe to ruin him, is an <hi>ex poſt facto</hi> law. It firſt makes the crime out of nothing, or which is next to nothing, out of appearances: and afterwards ordains a puniſhment as revenge or caprice may dictate. It requires ſome reflection to ſee into the miſchiefs of ſuch laws. But all lawyers agree, <q>that to puniſh for a fact done before there was a law to forbid it, is not, properly ſpeaking, a <hi>puniſhment,</hi> but <hi>hoſtility;</hi> not the penalty of the law, but the outrage of an enemy. For before the law was, there could be no trangreſſion.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Againſt laws ſo deſtructive all moderate governments have armed themſelves: Moſt of our Siſter States have done it expreſsly by their Conſtitutions. In the Declaration of Rights of the State of Maſſachuſetts-Bay, it is enacted, article 24, <q>That laws made to puniſh for actions done before the exiſtence of ſuch laws, and which have not been declared crimes by preceding laws, are unjuſt, oppreſſive, and inconſiſtent with the principles of a free government.</q> Article 25, <q>No ſubject ought in any caſe, or at any time to be declared guilty of treaſon or felony by the Legiſlature.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Other States are guarded by ſimilar laws, and the ſpirit of our own, if attended to, forbids the uſe of them. For if there exiſted a country in which they were frequent, it muſt be governed by the fierce paſſions of malice and revenge, and not by juſtice and equity.</p>
               <p>There are many weighty reaſons why a Republic ſhould be more cautious than any other form of government, not to tranſgreſs their laws and conſtitutions by arbitrary meaſures. A popular aſſembly, not governed by fundamental laws, but under the blaſs of anger, malice, or a thirſt for revenge, will commit more exceſs than an arbitrary monarch <note n="*" place="bottom">In Athens the citizens went into a faction about a diviſion of corn.

Such deviations from juſtice, moderation and temper, would fix diſgrace on the very name of a republic.</p>
               <p>In anſwer to this it will be ſaid, that the exceſs of thoſe powers lately exerted by the legiſlature, can never be formidable, but to the enemies of the republic; and that nothing can be too ſevere for the tories. <q>Who can find fault with ſeverity of laws againſt men who were foremoſt in ſupporting Britiſh tyranny?</q> Why not give them a hearing, I ſay? They formerly took an oath of allegiance to the State; and admitting they were guilty of the greateſt crimes, they were ſo far entitled to its protection, that they had a clear right to be heard in their defence.</p>
               <p>Unthinking are thoſe who imagine that one arbitrary exertion of power will not open a door for many others! There is hardly an inſtance in hiſtory of a law made to be revenged on enemies, but that very law was brought in as a precedent to deſtroy friends; and the thing is quite natural. For if the legiſlature can, without ceremony, or forms of law, ſeize the property, or baniſh the perſon of the meaneſt, or worſt member of ſociety; what I pray can hinder their ſtripping or baniſhing men of character and virtue? If ſo obſcure a man as <hi>Paday Hinas,</hi> or ſo obnoxious a one as <hi>Bob Williams,</hi> can be baniſhed, amerced, or put to death without trial, hearing, or examination; whence comes ſecurity to you, or even to J— R— himſelf.</p>
               <p>He, and other citizens may blind and flatter themſelves with hopes that no miſchiefs can accrue from ſuch tyrannical proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. But as factions and revolutions have been the lot of every republic that we ever heard of, our government will no doubt have its ſhare of them.</p>
               <p>Time which changes all things, may bring matters about, ſo as to turn the tables againſt the very men who were foremoſt in driving down thoſe laws; for after this precedent I ſee nothing they have to depend on, but faction, cabals, or influence in the legiſlature: And the ſheets on which thoſe laws are written, may wrap in winding-ſheets ſome of their deſcendants.</p>

               <head>VI. <hi>On the Amercement Act.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>AS to the <hi>Amercement Act,</hi> every argument which I have uſed above, apply with equal force againſt it; not to ſpeak of the injuſtice of ſtripping our citizens of their property, without <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination</hi> or <hi>hearing;</hi> The Amercement Act is the moſt impolitic that could be deviſed. I inſiſt upon it, that if it ſtood unrepealed, <hi>it would do more real injury to this country than the invaſion and all the ravages of the Britiſh army.</hi> The misfortunes of the war will be ſoon out-grown by a young country, ſo fertile and full of reſources as ours. But the diviſions and heart-burnings which thoſe amerce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments will leave behind, would turn out a bitter misfortune to us, and go as an inheritance to our children. It will irritate one half of the people againſt the other, and diſgrace both; by the injuſtice done on one ſide, and the reproach endeavoured to be fixt on the other; many worthy citizens, and of as good families as any we have, being handed down on the journals of both houſes as traitors and enemies to their country. It will alſo ſerve to keep alive the memory of the troubles of the preſent day, which ſhould be buried in oblivion. Therefore the application of ſuch laws as that of the <hi>amercement,</hi> can never be ſaid <hi>to be governing a country.</hi> It is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>diſtracting it,</hi> and turning things upſide down. Thoſe men
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:017861_0026_0FA3742306180F00"/>are deprived of their property, without being ſo much as allowed to hear the accuſation againſt them, contrary to the fundamental laws of the State. Can any one imagine that ſuch extraordinary proceedings will produce no bad conſequence in the community? and that all diviſion, diſcontent and murmur about the matter will be ſoon over, as if nothing had happened? This law of itſelf would be ſufficient to diſturb the peace of the country, and alarm every thinking man in it; and he who thinks otherwiſe has but little knowledge of human nature.</p>
               <p>The reader may judge by the preamble, whether the Committee who framed the Amercement Law, paid more attention to law and fact than they did civil language. <q>Whereas many perſons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of, and owing allegiance to this State (ſome bearing high and important commiſſions) have withdrawn themſelves from the defence thereof, accepted protection, &amp;c.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I have proved already that our government was diſſolved; it did not exiſt, and of courſe thoſe who are amerced could not withdraw from its defence: At the Republic could not give the citizen pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, which is the equivalent he receives for allegiance, he owed none, and yet the preamble inſiſts, "they owed allegiance." We alſo ſee that "accepting protection" is ſtated as a high crime, though I have proved above it was not. It goes on: <q>And are either within the lines of the enemy, or have omitted to enroll themſelves and perform the duties of their country, pointed out and required by the Proclamation of his Excellency the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, of the 27th of September, in utter contempt of the executive authority, and evil example of ſociety.</q>
               </p>
               <p>My remarks on the circumſtances of the inhabitants who were within <hi>the enemy's guards,</hi> have, I hope, ſatisfied the reader that the proclamation was improper and oppreſſive; that thoſe citizens could not poſſibly comply with it; and that remaining where they were was perfectly juſtifiable.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>And whereas there are others, who forgetting the ſocial ties of kindred and humanity, and regardleſs of the duty and alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance they had moſt ſolemnly ſworn to their country, did actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſubſcribe, and pay by themſelves or agents, conſiderable ſums of money towards mounting and equipping a troop or troops of cavalry, or other military force for the ſervice of his Britannic Majeſty.</q> It is a maxim of our law that the greater the crime of which any citizen is accuſed, the clearer ſhould be the proof to convict him of it: Yet the preamble ſtates thoſe facts without any ſort of proof that can be called <hi>legal,</hi> and in ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter contempt of all law-knowledge declares the facts to be a crime, that if true, were not puniſhable by our laws.</p>

Thoſe in Charleſtown who ſubſcribed for the Britiſh cavalry, were ſome of them voluntiers for raiſing a force againſt us; but I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this was not the caſe with all of them; the citizens was under the yoke of a tyrant, who had a thouſand ways of doing him miſchief.</p>
               <p>He had favours to aſk of Britiſh commanders; a reſtoration of indigo, rice, cattle, or other property, was a great one that day; and to be purchaſed only by mortifying conceſſions. To ſuch people the <hi>ſubſcribing to Britiſh cavalry,</hi> was another name for <hi>contribution.</hi> It was done perhaps under the higheſt neceſſity and compulſion. To make that a crime therefore, by a <hi>retroſpective law,</hi> which was none before, and condemn them to near a third of their property, was what I mentioned above, to be puniſhing by <hi>ex poſt facto law,</hi> and is arbitrary and unconſtitutional. The amerced citizens are painted as miſcreants who do not deſerve to live; yet not one act charged in the preamble could be conſtrued to be a breach of any law of South-Carolina.</p>
               <p>As the amercement law is founded on injuſtice and bad policy; it is no wonder that the mode in which it is inforced, adds to the hardſhip of it. Three freeholders are choſen by the commiſſioners, to appraiſe thoſe eſtates, without the controul or challenge of the owner: and however enormous the valuation they ſet, yet he muſt abide by it, without appeal or redreſs. The freeholders may be raw unexperienced men, or biaſſed by the prejudices, malice, or revenge, peculiar to civil troubles, or miſled by a thirſt for ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on the property of their neighbour. It is eaſy to ſee therefore, that injuſtice and oppreſſion muſt be the lot of many. It is ſaid by good judges, that ſome eſtates have been appraiſed at upwards of twice their real value; ſo that the proprietor, inſtead of 12 or 30 <hi>per cent.</hi> may ſuffer an entire confiſcation of the whole. Thoſe who have <hi>large families to bring up,</hi> and are <hi>much in debt,</hi> muſt be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely ruined; and in this manner are our laws and forms of juſtice overturned, which have been handed down as our birth-right for ages paſt; and the fruits of a man's toil and induſtry, which every good government ought to ſecure for the education and advancement of his children, are ſnatched from him in a moment.</p>
               <p>There is ſomething very curious in the ſtory of the republic which was attempted in England, in the laſt century, after the trial and execution of Charles I. and the expulſion of his family. It is worth the reader's attention: The true republican ſpirit never ſhone with more luſtre on any ſpot of the globe. Such was the enthuſiaſm of that nation, that it produced, as it were in an inſtant, a race of heroes, patriots, and men of letters, who all diſtinguiſhed themſelves in pulling down kingly government, and ſetting up a commonwealth.</p>
               <p>The great <hi>Milton, Harrington,</hi> and other men of genius, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed all the charms of eloquence to cheriſh and ſupport it. But their liberties under their favourite republic they did not maintain a moment. Not becauſe the conjuncture of affairs was unfavourable; for it was quite otherwiſe. But the members of the new legiſlature, <hi>forgetting that they were young beginners in the art of governing;</hi>
                  <pb n="28" facs="unknown:017861_0028_0FA3742486C77D28"/>inſtead of endeavouring to reconcile all parties to the republic, by a temperate adminiſtration of law and juſtice; ſet to work immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to gratify perſonal malice and revenge; and purſue their adverſaries, the <hi>Royaliſts,</hi> with <hi>confiſcation</hi> and <hi>amercement.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some had to avenge cruelty or inſults, when in the hands of their enemies; others the burning of their houſes, or to retaliate the death of their kindred; or the plunder of their property; all which miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs, the royal party, in the hour of ſucceſs, never failed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute.</p>
               <p>By way of retaliation, <q>they were plundered, impriſoned, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimated, ſays an annaliſt, and ſo worried by amercements or fines, that they were forced to compound over and over, 'till at laſt they had nothing left.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Many of them were forced by ſuch tyranny, to fly their country, and ſuffered ſuch diſtreſs abroad, that the very gentlemen were forced to fell themſelves as ſlaves to the Dutch, who accordingly tranſported them to their plantations.</p>
               <p>The bleſſings of heaven could not attend ſcenes of ſuch oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The ſpirit of diſcord went forth among the people; mutual hatred and animoſity aroſe between neighbours; fear and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions ſeized others, for themſelves or family connections: Men had no reſource or ſafety, but to enter into parties, form factions and cabals, to ſupport themſelves or friends. And thus oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, hatred, malice, and vexation, ſeemed to have been let looſe by Divine Providence, as a puniſhment on the nation. Their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs at laſt were ſo entangled and diſtracted by the animoſity of contending parties, that the tyrant Cromwell ſprung up in the heighth of it; and the ſenſible part of the people were glad to ſubmit to his uſurpation, rather than bear any longer the miſery of being governed by men, who ſet moderation and juſtice at defiance and who proved themſelves totally incapable of any thing, but to create public and private ruin.</p>
               <p>God Almighty has ſo ordered the affairs of men in this world, that a miſchievous legiſlature, any more than a miſchievous indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual, can never ſucceed in oppreſſion and injuſtice, without drawing down a curſe and misfortune on itſelf. And ſhould the legiſlature of South-Carolina, and Georgia perſiſt in the fearful meaſures lately purſued, I make no ceremony to foretel, that we and they ſhall remain a conſpicuous example with poſterity, to prove, <hi>that the people are incapable of governing themſelves.

               <p>THE experience of all countries has ſhewn, that where a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity ſplits into a faction, and has recourſe to arms, and one finally gets the better, a law to bury in <hi>oblivion</hi> paſt tranſactions
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:017861_0029_0FA374254812CD90"/>is abſolutely neceſſary to reſtore tranquillity. For if after a civil war, and one party vanquiſhed, perſecution was to go on; if the fury of laws and the fierce rage of paſſions prevailed, while the minds of men were yet fired by deadly revenge againſt their fallen adverſaries; this would be worſe than keeping up the war: it would be carrying on hoſtility under the ſhape of juſtice, which is the moſt oppreſſive, and of all other injuſtice, excites the greateſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation, and the moſt violent factions and diviſion.</p>
               <p>Every part of Europe has had its ſhare of affliction by uſurpation, or civil war, as we have had lately; but every one of them conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered an act of oblivion as the firſt ſtep on their return to peace and order. This was the caſe in Greece and Rome, as well as in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and other places, as I ſhall ſhew by a few examples.</p>
               <p>The cruelty of the thirty tyrants in Athens exceeded all bounds. Xenophon tells us, they deſtroyed more citizens in eight months than were killed in thirty years war; and what made them more formidable was their being ſupported by 3000 citizens. However, they were at laſt depoſed by an armed force, under Thraſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulus, and their ruin was followed by a general amneſty. <q>By which order wiſely made, and carefully obſerved, the city returned to its former quietneſs, ſays Raleigh.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>I cannot forbear obſerving, ſays Rollin, ſpeaking of that event, the wiſdom and moderation of Thraſybulus, ſo eſſential after a long continuance of domeſtic troubles. <hi>This is one of the fineſt events in antient hiſtory, worthy the Athenian lenity and benevolence,</hi> and has ſerved as a model for ſucceſſive ages to good governments.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Never had tyranny been more cruel and bloody than that which the Athenians had ſhaken off: Every houſe was in mourning: Every family bewailed the loſs of ſome relation. I had been a ſeries of public robbery and rapine; in which licence and impunity had authorized all manner of crimes. The people ſeemed to have a right to demand the blood of all accomplices in their villainies; but Thraſybulus roſe above thoſe ſentiments: from the ſuperiority of his genius, and his views of a more diſtinguiſhing policy, he foreſaw that <hi>by giving into the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of the guilty, eternal ſeeds of diſcord and enmity would remain and weaken the republic by domeſtic diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</q>
               </p>
               <p>All hiſtorians and political writers condemn the miſchievous policy of purſuing the citizens with proſecutions after civil wars. Machiavel himſelf, tho' for violent meaſures on other occaſions, yet ſtrongly recommends an act of oblivion after a revolution. And he cenſures the conduct of the Roman republic on the expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the ten tyrants, for not paſſing an amneſty, inſtead of carrying on proſecutions againſt thoſe citizens who ſupported their tyranny.</p>
               <p>In that republic ten of their principal citizens were entruſted with <hi>extraordinary powers;</hi> but regardleſs of laws or conſtitution, they ſeized on the government and freedom of the people; who, with the aſſiſtance of the army, expelled them after three years

Yet the proceedings againſt him are condemned by all hiſtorians, for he was refuſed a hearing and appeal before the people, agreeable to their conſtitution.</note>. Inflamed with ſucceſs and revenge, the very people who had taken the tyrant's protection, for all did it; were for putting to death the moſt violent and miſchievous and their adherents. Machiavel's remarks on this conduct is worth noting.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>It is a very great fault in a State, ſays he, every day in the citizens minds to renew the memory of old wrongs done to this and that man, with new puniſhments, as it befel at Rome under the Decemvirate. For all the ten, and ſundry other citizens were accuſed and condemned, ſo that the nobility were affrighted, thinking they would never leave off condemning them 'till they had deſtroyed the whole. And certainly it had produced ſome great commotion in the city, if Marcus Duellius the Tribune, had not paſſed a decree, that for a whole year it ſhould not be lawful to accuſe any citizen. Where we ſee how great a hurt it is in a republic, or prince, to hold their ſubjects minds in ſuſpicion and fear with continual proſecutions and puniſhments; <hi>and without doubt a worſe courſe cannot be taken.</hi> For men that begin to doubt of miſchief in any caſe, provide for themſelves in their danger, grow bolder and leſs reſpectful how they venture on novelties. Wherefore it is neceſſary never to hurt any, or the hurt that is done to do it at once, and afterwards let them enjoy ſome aſſurance that may give them cauſe to quiet and ſettle their minds.</q> Machiavels diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>Whether the neceſſity of a general amneſty ever occured to the reader or not, the above obſervations will ſtrike him very forcibly, as they apply ſo well to our preſent ſituation. However, to make this matter ſtill clearer, I ſhall draw a compariſon between the conduct of the Britiſh nation, on the reſtoration, after the grand rebellion, and of our legiſlature on the re-eſtabliſhment of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public in 1782.</p>
               <p>The ſituation of the two countries was ſimilar in this, that Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land ſuffered a uſurpation under Cromwell, and other tyrants, and South-Carolina under the tyranny of Great-Britain: And the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of both countries, with few exceptions, ſubmitted to the uſurpers. But in other circumſtances England differed from us: Britiſh tyranny prevailed in this country only about 16 months. Their officers plundered our ſide boards of <hi>place,</hi> and our ward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robes of their <hi>contents,</hi> to a conſiderable amount; and ſtole, or were the death of about twenty thouſand negroes. In battle and cold blood they deſtroyed perhaps 3000 of our citizens; and they tortured our every manlike feeling, by diſtreſſing our families, and inſults to ourſelves, whenever we fell into their hands. This is rating our damage pretty fairly.</p>
               <p>But theſe injuries vaniſh into nothing, compared with what the Engliſh nation ſuffered in the grand rebellion. It laſted 19 years I think. The ſtronger party dethroned the prince, brought him
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:017861_0031_0FA37426C68BDB88"/>to a public trial, and put him to death. The heir to the crown-having been detained under various indignities a priſoner in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, put himſelf at the head of an army; and was defeated in battle at Worceſter.</p>
               <p>Ten thouſand of his adherents were made priſoners, many of whom Cromwell ſold as ſlaves to the Weſt-India planters. Young Charles, after the rout was hunted like a deer, and by aſſuming various diſguiſes got to France. When abroad he was reduced ſo low that he could not command a piſtole. The number of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects deſtroyed on both ſides is computed at half a million.</p>
               <p>When the troubles were over, and Charles the Second was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to the throne, he had his own injuries and the ruin of his friends, to avenge. But did he avenge thoſe injuries? Did he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs his firſt parliament, as we did the laſt aſſembly, leaving the terrors of laws hanging over the people's heads; and reſolve to ſend the courts of ſeſſions through the country, to fill it with condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and convicts, to the diſgrace and utter diſtreſs of families, and add to the liſt of widows and orphans? He did nothing of all this. The very firſt bill he paſſed was an act of amneſty, to ſettle the diſtractions of the nation. Had he reaſoned like our politicians, he would have fallen upon confiſcation, baniſhment and amerce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and under pretence of preventing a future rebellion, he would like us, have paſſed acts to exclude from votes or ſeats in the legiſlature, ſuch as were deemed enemies to royalty. Inſtead of ſuch like meaſures, which would have only increaſed the nation's misfortunes, he paſſed a general amneſty; out of which forty nine of the late king's judges were excepted. Theſe had a fair and public trial, and of the whole, ten only were executed. This was all the blood ſhed after ſo furious a civil war.</p>
               <p>I ſhall tranſcribe one healing clauſe of this famous <note n="*" place="bottom">I refer any of the Gentlemen in the Aſſembly to the firſt volume of the Lords debates.</note> act of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty, which is worthy to be remembered.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>And to the end and purpoſe that all names and terms of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction, may be likewiſe put in utter oblivion, be it further enacted, that if any perſon or perſons, within the ſpace of three years next enſuing, ſhall preſume maliciouſly to call or alledge, or object againſt any perſon or perſons, any name or names, or other words of reproach, any way leading to revive the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the late differences; that then every ſuch perſon offending as aforeſaid, ſhall pay ten pounds if a gentleman, and forty ſhillings if of an inferior degree.</q>
               </p>
               <p>It is a maxim in politics, that if a breach be made in the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of a government, and it be not healed, it will prove as fatal to its freedom, as a wound that is neglected and ſuffered to mortify, would to the life of a man. I proved clearly that ours received a mortal one; and ſhould the preſent aſſembly leave it <hi>to inflame,</hi> without applying a cure, we ceaſe to be a free people. The reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy I ſpeak of is lenient, all healing. <hi>Repeal at once the late election act, the amercement law, and the confiſcation act, as far as it affects
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:017861_0032_0FA37427876F1B50"/>thoſe who were our citizens.</hi>—And in order that ſuch proceedings may not be drawn into precedent hereafter, let there be a clauſe, <hi>to obliterate thoſe three acts</hi> from the journals of both houſes. <hi>Paſs an act of amneſty and oblivion, with as few exceptions as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;</hi> allowing ſuch as may be excluded, a day to come in and be heard, either before the court of ſeſſions, on a fair and public trial; or ſhould they be men whoſe inveteracy, power or influence may be dangerous to the State, and are not liable to puniſhment by our laws; let them have a hearing before the legiſlature on articles of impeachment. — Provided we mean that the word <hi>Republic</hi> ſhould ſignify ſomething more than mere <hi>ſound, paſs an Act for diſſolving the preſent Aſſembly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If every citizen cannot enjoy the rights of <hi>election</hi> and <hi>repreſentation,</hi> according to the conſtitution, I hope <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o body will be ſo idle as to talk of <hi>Liberty. This, and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> of the three acts above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned,</hi> is the meaſure, <hi>and the only one</hi> that can reconcile us to the friendſhip of each other; it will put an end to ſilly diſtinctions and faction: leave us at liberty to ſhake hands as brethren, whoſe fate it is to live together; and it will ſtand as a more laſting monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our national wiſdom, juſtice and magnanimity, than ſtatues of braſs or marble.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the ſentiments of one who pleads not for perſonal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence. In the varieties of good and bad fortune which America has paſſed thro', he ſhared in her joys and ſorrows. Though the connection with her brought him little beſides the affection ſhe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired; though the changes in her health and appearance were often for the worſt, yet it made no change in him; and neither in feeling, word, or deed, from the fidelity he pledged to her, has he deviated a moment. If he has any political ſin to anſwer for, it is that he diſdains in the hour of ſucceſs, to triumph over the diſtreſs of any man who once bore the name of a fellow-citizen. And ſhould the preſent publication but contribute to reſtore harmony to the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic; or prevent the return of the bitter hours of heart-ake, which many an innocent man has undergone ſince laſt January; then however ſilent or obſcure my walk in life, I ſhall enjoy a ſweet and ſecret pleaſure of having done ſome ſervice to my country.</p>
