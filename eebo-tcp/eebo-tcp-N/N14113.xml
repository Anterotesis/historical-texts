            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <opener>
                  <salute>Friends and Fellow Citizens,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>THE proceedings of the late A≈ø≈øembly held at Jack≈øonborough have already excited the attention not only of this, but of other States; and ≈øome of the laws then enacted are of ≈øo ≈øerious a nature, that the memory of them will la≈øt, and their con≈øequences operate, when the authors of the mea≈øures ≈øhall be no more. By one of tho≈øe laws, upwards of two hundred men who had been citizens of this State before the reduction of Charle≈øtown, have been ≈øtript of all their property: innocent wives and children involved in the calamity of hu≈øbands and fathers, their widows are deprived of the right of dower, their children di≈øinherited, and them≈øelves bani≈øhed for ever from this country. And this <hi>without proce≈øs, trial, examination,</hi> or <hi>hearing;</hi> and without allowing them the ≈øacred right of proving their innocence on a future day. Under other acts of that a≈ø≈øembly, a number of the inhabitants are ≈øubjected to heavy fines, ≈øome to near one third, others to one eight, and ≈øome to a tenth part of their e≈øtate, real and per≈øonal, without better proof of crime than report and ≈øugge≈øtions. Another act excludes from the freedom of voting or being elected to a ≈øeat in the legi≈ølature, almo≈øt a majority of our citizens. The crimes of all con≈øi≈øt in the part which they were ≈øaid to have taken after the reduction of South-Carolina by the Briti≈øh army.</p>
               <p>One would imagine there is no free country upon earth, in which laws bringing ≈øuch ruin on ≈øo many families, and ≈øo big with political mi≈øchief, would not have been publickly di≈øcu≈ø≈øed before this day. But whether it be owing, that the mea≈øures have ≈øuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in breaking the ≈øpirit of the people, by filling every man
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:017861_0004_0FA37412874D52E0"/>with a ≈øen≈øe of his own danger; or that the fear of the Governor's <hi>extraordinary power,</hi> awes men into ≈øilence; or that they are indifferent about public affairs; not a man has yet undertaken to enquire into the ju≈øtice or inju≈øtice of it, or a≈øk his neighbour how far the Legi≈ølature could effect the ruin and di≈øgrace of ≈øo many of his fellow citizens, con≈øi≈øtently with the laws, con≈øtitution, and happine≈øs of his country.</p>
               <p>From every point of view in which I con≈øider tho≈øe proceedings, I am convinced it is e≈ø≈øential to the future peace and liberty of our country, that a true judgment be formed on the matter. The people at large in whom the ≈øovereignty of the State <hi>≈øhould be ve≈øted,</hi> ought to be informed whether public mea≈øures be right or wrong; and it therefore becomes the duty of every citizen to pre≈øent the ≈øubject in as open and publick a light as opportunity or knowledge may enable him. Under this per≈øua≈øion I venture to offer a few remarks to the con≈øideration of the publick; and I only wi≈øh my talents were equal to the importance of the ≈øubject. I tru≈øt the candid, plain manner in which I ≈øhall di≈øcour≈øe on it will an≈øwer for me, that I have no other de≈øign by it but what has been the object of my pur≈øuit through ≈øeven years public ≈øervice; that is, the liberty and peace of my courtry.</p>
               <p>I mu≈øt fir≈øt ob≈øerve, that G‚Äîr R‚Äî's proclamation of the 27th of September 1781, was the fountain from whence ≈øprung ≈øome of tho≈øe bitter laws, and the forfeitures and di≈øabilities abovemention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. That proclamation went entirely on the ≈øuppo≈øition, that the citizens of the State who had taken protection on the fall of the country under Briti≈øh u≈øurpation, had thereby not only forfeited their lives, fortunes, and the privileges of citizen≈øhip, but had al≈øo incurred the penalty of trea≈øon again≈øt the State. This was the doctrine allowed on all hands; not only laid down by the proclamation, but advanced in both hou≈øes, and I never heard it contradicted by the <hi>judges</hi> or <hi>lawyers</hi> who ought to have known better. The proclamation indeed was ≈øuppo≈øed to have re≈øtored all tho≈øe who complied with the terms of it, to their lo≈øt liberties, by joining the army within a limited time.</p>
               <p>I ≈øhall proceed to make ≈øome remarks on the ≈øuppo≈øed crime and delinquency of the people in taking protection.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="1" type="part">
               <head>I. <hi>On the Citizens making a temporary Submi≈ø≈øion to the Briti≈øh Arms, after the reduction of Charle≈øtown in</hi> 1780.</head>
               <p>THIS State, ≈øoon after the reduction of Charle≈øtown, may be ≈øtrictly ≈øaid to have been conquered. Not only the capital, but every po≈øt throughout the country was in the hands of the enemy. The Governor who repre≈øented the Sovereignty of the State, had provided for his ≈øafety by flight, and all the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nental troops in South-Carolina were either killed, taken, or routed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="unknown:017861_0005_0FA3741346D06280"/>
The enemy, thus ma≈øters of the country, re≈øolved to reduce by military force the inhabitants to obedience. And Sir Henry Clinton accordingly in the month of June 1781, i≈ø≈øues a proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<q>Commanding all per≈øons whatever inhabitants of this province, (tho≈øe who were in Charle≈øtown and Fort Moultrie at the time of their capitulations and ≈øurrender, or were then in actual confinement excepted) who ≈øhall after the 20th of June next, neglect to return to his allegiance and to his Maje≈øty's government, will be con≈øidered as enemies and rebels to the ≈øame, and treated accordingly.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus a military de≈øpoti≈øm was e≈øtabli≈øhed throughout the ≈øettlements, and to compleat this mi≈øerable ≈øcene of woes, the army under General Gates, and a divi≈øion under General Sumpter, to whom we looked up as our deliverers, were entirely defeated. The country thus abandoned to a cruel, unprincipled foe, the people had no idea but that our independence was lo≈øt irrecoverably. And indeed the advantages gained by the enemy were ≈øo rapid and deci≈øive, it was for ≈øome time apprehended thro' the other States, and even by many members of Congre≈øs, that Carolina and Georgia mu≈øt in the end revert to the domination of Great Britain.</p>
               <p>In this ≈øituation <hi>nece≈ø≈øity,</hi> who≈øe dominion triumphs over all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man laws pointed out to our inhabitants, that as there was neither government, laws, nor army to protect them, they were at liberty to protect them≈øelves, as well as they could. This is the law of Nature and of Nations: And all State≈ømen, the be≈øt lawyers, and mo≈øt eminent writers, agree, that when an invader over-runs a country, defeats the ≈øtanding forces, and ≈øubverts its government, the inhabitants of ≈øuch a country are ju≈øtifiable to take the conqueror's protection and obey his laws; and whether the government be a monarchy or republick, it makes no difference, as the rea≈øon of the thing is the ≈øame.</p>
               <p>In Germany and other parts of Europe, it is not uncommon for one and the ≈øame city to be taken and retaken and have different ma≈øters in one campaign. And the inhabitants of ≈øuch a city, magi≈øtrates and all, who are not ≈øoldiers by profe≈ø≈øion, uniformly take an oath of allegiance to the ≈øtronger ≈øide, which oath is binding only ≈øo long as the conqueror's power la≈øts. And I believe we have the exclu≈øive honour of being the fir≈øt who proceeded to puni≈øh their inhabitants on account of ≈øuch ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion. I ≈øhall bring forward the authority of the be≈øt writers on the laws of nations and nature to prove that taking protection from a conqueror is no crime.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Things may be brought to ≈øuch an i≈ø≈øue, ≈øays Puffendorf, lib. 7 c. 8. as ≈øhall make it not only allowable, but good and nece≈ø≈øary to obey the ruler in po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, by what≈øoever means po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion was gained. As if the lawful Sovereign be reduced to ≈øuch ≈øtraits, that one can no longer exerci≈øe his regal office to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his people. For tho' the commands of the u≈øurper, being de≈øtitute of legal power are not in them≈øelves obligatory, yet it
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:017861_0006_0FA3741406DE9F08"/>becomes a wi≈øe man to con≈øult the welfare of him≈øelf and of his affairs, make provi≈øion again≈øt the future, and with warine≈øs and caution reflect on his pre≈øent condition, that he may not thru≈øt his life and fortune into danger; as he would do, ≈øhould he by vain ob≈øtinacy and oppo≈øition draw the u≈øurper's rage upon his own head, without procuring the lea≈øt advantage to his country.</q> And further on he concludes,
<q>That when the prince cannot afford his ≈øubjects due protection, nor they on the other hand able to re≈øi≈øt the u≈øurper without imminent ruin, they are relea≈øed from all obligations to him, until providence ≈øhall open a way to his re≈øtoration.</q> Again,
<q>This method mu≈øt be allowed to be lawful not only for particular ≈øubjects, but al≈øo for entire cities and provinces, when they find no other way left for their ≈øafety and pre≈øervation.</q> Lib. 8. c. 11. In ≈øupport of this right he quotes the ca≈øe of the Petilini from Livy. This nation being in alliance with the Romans, and pre≈ø≈øed by their enemies, ≈øent for a≈ø≈øi≈øtance. But the Romans being di≈øtre≈ø≈øed them≈øelves, an≈øwered,
<q>They confe≈ø≈øed them≈øelves no longer in a condition to defend their di≈øtant friends, and therefore de≈øired the petitioners to return home, con≈øult for them≈øelves, and make the be≈øt terms they could.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This is the law laid down by Grotius as well as Puffendorf: and Vattel, a late writer of the fir≈øt di≈øtinction, delivers the like doctrine in the following words:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>If a State is overcome by force, <hi>nece≈ø≈øity, that irre≈øi≈øtable law,</hi> frees it from its fir≈øt engagement, and gives it a right to treat with the conqueror, in order to obtain the be≈øt conditions po≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. If it mu≈øt ≈øubmit to him, or peri≈øh, who can entertain a doubt but that it may, and even ought to chu≈øe the fir≈øt expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, <hi>≈øubmi≈ø≈øion?</hi> The modern u≈øage is agreeable to this deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion: A city ≈øubmits to an enemy when it cannot expect ≈øafety from a vigorous re≈øi≈øtance: it takes an oath of fidelity to him, and the Sovereign of ≈øuch city has no body to accu≈øe but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Vattel gives as examples the ca≈øes of the country of Zug, and the city of Zurich abandoned by their Confederates in the 14th century, who entered into a treaty with their enemies from nece≈ø≈øity.</p>
               <p>This part of my ≈øubject I ≈øhall conclude with a quotation from Mr. Heboes, a writer who≈øe authority is the more to be depended on, as be lived in England in the time of the grand rebellion, when England then was, as Carolina was lately, di≈øtracted by a fierce war, and were per≈øecuting each other, as the parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment forces, or tho≈øe of the king got the better.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Becau≈øe I find, ≈øays Hobbes, by our Engli≈øh books lately printed, that the civil wars have not ≈øufficiently taught men in which point of time it is that a ≈øubject becomes obliged to the conqueror, nor how it comes about that men are obliged to obey his laws. Therefore, for ≈øatisfaction of men therein, I ≈øay, That for him who has no obligation to his former ≈øovereign, but
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:017861_0007_0FA37414C95B08E8"/>that of an ordinary ≈øubject, <hi>(that is not a ≈øoldier by profe≈ø≈øion)</hi> it is then when the means of life are within the guards and garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons of the enemy: for it is then he hath no longer protection from his ≈øovereign, but is protected by the adver≈øe party for his contribution. Seeing therefore ≈øuch a contribution is every where e≈øteemed lawful, as a thing inevitable, (notwith≈øtanding it be an a≈ø≈øi≈øtance to the enemy) a total ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion cannot be e≈øteemed unlawful. Be≈øides, if we con≈øider that he who ≈øubmits a≈ø≈øi≈øts the enemy but with part of his e≈øtate, whereas, they that refu≈øe to ≈øubmit, a≈ø≈øi≈øt him with the whole.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Again, when in a war (foreign or dome≈øtic) the enemy get a final victory, ≈øo as the forces of the Commonwealth keeping the field no longer, there is no farther protection of the citizens in their loyalty: <hi>Then is the Common wealth di≈ø≈øolved, and every man at liberty to protect him≈øelf by ≈øuch cour≈øes as his own direction ≈øhall ≈øugge≈øt to him.</hi> For the Sovereign is the public ≈øoul, giving life and motion to the Commonwealth; which expiring, the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are no more governed by it than the carca≈øe of a man by his departed ≈øpirit. For tho' the right of a ≈øovereign cannot be extingui≈øhed, yet the obligation of the members may; for he that wants protection may ≈øeek it any where.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Again, the obligation of ≈øubjects to the State is under≈øtood to la≈øt ≈øo long, and no longer than the power la≈øts by which it is able to protect them. For the right which men have by nature to protect them≈øelves, when none el≈øe can protect them, can by no covenant be relinqui≈øhed. The ≈øovereignty is the ≈øoul of the commonwealth, which once departed from the body, the members do no more receive their motion from it. The end of obedience is protection, which where≈øoever a man ≈øeeketh, either in his own, or his enemy's ≈øword, nature applieth his obedience to it.</q> Hobbes's Leviathan, cap. 21.27.29. and the Review.</p>
               <p>Nothing can be clearer than this doctrine; and however ≈øhocking it will ≈øeem to tho≈øe who have kept a perpetual boa≈øting of their own virtue and clamour again≈øt ≈øuch as the Briti≈øh did not think fit to ≈øend to St. Augu≈øtine; yet this is what is good law in South-Carolina as well as all the world over: All tho≈øe writers who≈øe autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity we rely on in law-matters laying it down for law, that ≈øubjects are excu≈øed and ju≈øtified, and not liable to be impleaded or called to account for taking protection from a conqueror or u≈øurper.</p>
               <p>I hope I have ≈øaid enough to ≈øatisfy the reader, that our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants did nothing more than their duty in taking protection: and if they thought they could ≈øecure better treatment, or alleviate their calamity by congratulations, they had an undoubted right to do it. It did not ≈øhew much political wi≈ødom, I allow; but let that matter be as it will, they did not commit any crime again≈øt the laws or government, for neither law nor government exi≈øted. The Sovereign power was in a ≈øtate of temporary death, the ≈øoul was fled and departed, and nothing remained but the carca≈øe; which could no more be injured or violated by any of our former
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:017861_0008_0FA3741585FBB148"/>citizens taking protection, or ≈øigning a congratulation, than they could be ≈øaid to commit murder by trampling on the body of a man who had been dead and buried many months.</p>
               <p>With re≈øpect to pre≈øenting congratulations, it were ea≈øy to prove from what happened in other countries that they are by no means a true te≈øt or proof of the public ≈øentiments, or of tho≈øe who pre≈øent them. Such addre≈ø≈øes are obtained in all countries by a few de≈øigning men, and the re≈øt by threats, terror, or a ≈øort of impul≈øe, follow the example. For a long time before Cromwell died he was dete≈øted by the Engli≈øh nation, and ≈øcarcely an hone≈øt man in it who did not wi≈øh to have him di≈øpatched.</p>
               <p>Yet after his death, and the nomination of his ≈øon Richard to the protector≈øhip, which was looked on as a tyranny.
<q>The city of London and almo≈øt all the countries and cities in England ≈øent him addre≈ø≈øes of condolance for the lo≈øs of his father, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulations on his ≈øucce≈ø≈øion to the protector≈øhip. So little, ≈øays Burnet, do the≈øe appearances ≈øignify.</q> This levity, this infirmity of the multitude, no ≈øtate≈øman before our time thought in earne≈øt of puni≈øhing. Our laws cannot do it. Lord Cornwallis him≈øelf, tho' not a man of abilities, yet has ≈øen≈øe enough to know that if he and Clinton were in Charle≈øtown going to be hanged, the people would rejoice and ≈øign congratulations as they did on a different occa≈øion.</p>
               <p>I well know prudent men, or rather ≈øuch as think them≈øelves ≈øo, will ≈øay, that this doctrine of <hi>Protection</hi> ought not to be drawn into di≈øcu≈ø≈øion, but ≈øhould ≈øleep in ≈øilence for the pre≈øent. But is not the contrary doctrine believed to be law? Have not be few proclaimed to the world, and ≈øtill continue to proclaim it, that the protection<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men forfeited their lives and fortunes? Has not the government been ≈øeized, and its con≈øtitution ≈øubverted, by the <hi>few</hi> in con≈øequence of that doctrine? Has it not ≈øet one part of the community again≈øt the other, brought ruin on many, and di≈øhonour on us all? I ≈øhould hold my≈øelf guilty of the mo≈øt po≈øillammous ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion, were I under this conviction and to be ≈øilent on it.</p>
               <p>For men in power to per≈øuade the people, that they committed crimes and acted di≈øhonourably, when there is neither crime nor di≈øhonour in the ca≈øe, is a mo≈øt mi≈øchievous policy. It has the ≈øame pernicious effects on the multitude, that private ≈øcandal and defamation, has on an innocent individual. It breaks that ≈øpirit, and generous pride, which is the be≈øt guardian of publick liberty and private honour. It overwhelms the publick as well as the private mind, with con≈øcious inferiority; degrades men in their own opinion, and tenders them fit tools for the ambitious de≈øigns, and arbitrary di≈øpo≈øitions of haughty a≈øpiring ≈øuperiors.</p>
               <p>Whether I am right, let tho≈øe judge who have carefully ob≈øerved the deportment and behaviour of ≈øuch of our unhappy citizens as are held under cen≈øure, for taking protection, by tho≈øe in authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The citizens who came from Charle≈øtown in the ≈øcorching hearts of Augu≈øt la≈øt, by a proclamation, afforded a melancholy
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:017861_0009_0FA374164725B640"/>proof, how ≈øoon oppre≈ø≈øion degrades mankind, and impre≈ø≈øes timid, cringing habits, even on the minds of freemen.</p>
               <p>Having proved the taking protection was no crime in the people, I ≈øhall go on to ≈øhew, that on the re≈øtoration of the republic and laws from Briti≈øh thraldom, the protection-men who had been our citizens before, were as fully entitled to all the rights and freedom of citizen≈øhip, as tho≈øe who were detained pri≈øoners of war, or took refuge to the northward.</p>
               <p>Every country of which we have any account from hi≈øtory, has had its day of woe and affliction, by foreign inva≈øion, or civil di≈øcord, as we have had. But in every one of them as ≈øoon as the troubles were over, and the country regained; the government returned to its antient form, and the ≈øubjects were rein≈øtated in the participation of their rights and privileges. And this is not only agreeable to ju≈øtice, but the freedom and liberty of the country would be de≈øtroyed if it were otherwi≈øe. If in a republic a <hi>few</hi> could ≈øet up preten≈øions to ≈øuperior political merit, over the whole aggregate body of the people, and deprive the latter of their rights and privileges, this would be nothing more nor le≈øs than overthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the con≈øtitution, ≈øeizing on the liberties of the people, and ≈øetting up an arbitrary government of the <hi>few</hi> The laws of nations as well as the rights of nature therefore dictate, that when a country oppre≈ø≈øed by a foreign power regains its liberty, the citizens ≈øhould be re≈øtored to all the rights and liberties they before enjoyed.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>A whole nation, ≈øays Puffendorf, cap. 6, when it hath, either by its own ≈øtrength, or the a≈ø≈øi≈øtance of friends or allies, ≈øhaken off an enemy's yoke, recovers its liberty and antient ≈øtate. And if a part of the people be recovered by the people, from which they were for ≈øome time divided or torn, or by the a≈ø≈øi≈øtance of allies, they again incorporate with the old body, and return to the place and rights they had before.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This authority goes to the point; but in order to make it plainer, I ≈øhall put a ca≈øe: I ≈øhall ≈øuppo≈øe a nation governed by a limited monarch, invaded by a powerful enemy, and after trying the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of war, entirely vanqui≈øhed. The Prince e≈øcapes into another State, and the ≈øubjects are obliged to receive ≈øuch terms as the conqueror chu≈øes to grant. In ca≈øe this country be again recovered by the a≈ø≈øi≈øtance of friends or allies, would it not be ≈øtrange indeed, that the prince on returning, ≈øhould call the conque≈øt over his people, and their nece≈ø≈øity to ≈øubmit, by the name of trea≈øon again≈øt the government? Should he carry this notion ≈øo far as to exclude the ≈øubjects from the benefit of the antient laws, and deny to all the rights of citizen≈øhip, except to his friends or adherents, and ≈øuch who≈øe captivity prevented them from following the example of the re≈øt, or who≈øe re≈øidence on the frontier afforded an ea≈øy removal into another country; would not this procedure be con≈øidered as ≈øeizing the government and ≈øetting up his own will to reign in≈øtead of laws? If there was a ≈øpark of freedom left in ≈øuch a
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:017861_0010_0FA374175D2EA078"/>country, they would a≈øk what his de≈øign and pre≈øence for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming to the world that his ≈øubjects had committed trea≈øon, and forfeited, without trial or conviction, the rights and protection of the antient laws? To cut this matter ≈øhort, was not this exactly the cour≈øe taken by the late G‚Äî R‚Äî, who acted only as mini≈øter of State for our Republic? Did he not i≈ø≈øue his procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation to make the people and the nations around believe, that by a temporary ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion to a conqueror who had the power of life and death in his hands, they had incurred crime and di≈øhonour? Has not him≈øelf and a <hi>few</hi> others who were not in the country while the war raged, nor lent the lea≈øt aid to drive out the enemy, bereaved the citizens of their rights and privileges, and by the terror of dictatorial power reduced the whole State to a condition of va≈ø≈øalage, without any other redemption than dragooning into ≈øix months military ≈øervice, by way of puni≈øhment and expiation?</p>

               <head>II. <hi>On Governor Rutledge's Proclamation of the</hi> 27th <hi>of September,</hi> 1781.</head>
               <p>A Mea≈øure ≈øo ≈øingular as this is mu≈øt be produced by ≈øome uncommon motive. It is, however, one of tho≈øe things, which the more a man will think of, the more will he dete≈øt it. For it is calculated for no other end but to ≈øow the poi≈øonous ≈øeeds of faction and party, to di≈øgrace the middling and lower cla≈øs of our citizens, and throw the whole weight and powers of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment out of the people into a few families. G‚Äîr R‚Äî's proclamation, and the plans which he carried la≈øt a≈ø≈øembly, would, unle≈øs unrivetted by a future one, fa≈øten at one blow in this country, a fierce and jealous ari≈øtocracy, which has been gaining ground for ≈øeven years pa≈øt. Mi≈øerable is that republic who≈øe citizens want di≈øcernment to penetrate through ≈øuch de≈øigns, or are afraid to expo≈øe them!</p>
               <p>For ≈øome time before the battle of the Eutaw Springs, almo≈øt all our citizens without the lines of Charle≈øtown, and with few ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, all within, worried by the tyranny of the Briti≈øh army, held them and their cau≈øe in the utmo≈øt dete≈øtation. The victory obtained in that action proved a death-warrant to the tory intere≈øt in this State; and the capture of the Briti≈øh army under Lord Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wallis following on the heels of the event, rou≈øed the few tories there were as from a dream; and they ≈øaw clearly they had hitherto only deluded them≈øelves in thinking this country would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered. And tho≈øe who from zeal, levity, or nece≈ø≈øity, adhered to the enemy after the fall of Charle≈øtown, employed all the means in their power to pave the way to a reconciliation. This was not difficult for tho≈øe who had not per≈øonal enemies among us; for General Greene wanted ≈øupplies, the town abounded with merch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andize,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:017861_0011_0FA37417C809E838"/>of which our old citizens found means to ≈øend out large quantities. The very adventurers who followed the Briti≈øh army to South-Carolina became our friends, and te≈øtified their zeal for us on many occa≈øions.</p>
               <p>This I believe was the true ≈øtate of parties the latter end of the year 1781. Happy would it have been for this country if the ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the public could have di≈øentangled their minds from the re≈øentments and party-rage which prevail in civil wars! A procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation then framed upon principles of wi≈ødom and humanity, would have had a happy tendency to bury in oblivion what was pa≈øt; to extingui≈øh from the minds of men, a ≈øen≈øe of late injuries; to unite the affections of all; and re≈øtore the country to order and tranquillity.</p>
               <p>The proclamation of September 27th, as I ob≈øerved before, went on the Governor's idea that the great body of the people who had taken protection had thereby forfeited their lives, liberty, and property. He takes upon him to offer pardon to every one of them who ≈øhould join our ≈øtandard in 30 days, and ≈øerve 6 months in the militia, as common ≈øoldiers; excepting from this benefit, tho≈øe who were bani≈øhed the State in the beginning of the troubles; the congratulators, and ≈øuch as held commi≈ø≈øions civil or military on the 27th of September, or were then with the enemy. I ≈øhall ≈øay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the good or bad policy of excluding ≈øuch a number of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens as this exception comprehended, admitting he had the power he pretended to<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> However on the 17th of November he i≈ø≈øued a ≈øecond proclamation, extending the benefits held out by the former under the like terms.</p>
               <p>As the capture of Cornwallis and his army was known to the Governor when this proclamation came out; as the Briti≈øh troops had ab≈øolutely lo≈øt their courage with their lo≈øs at Eutaw, and the Penn≈øylvania Line was on the march from York-Town to our a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øtance: When this, and the ≈øtate the country was in at that junc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is con≈øidered; I leave the reader to judge, whether the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation was not calculated rather for creating mi≈øchief than for rai≈øing a force. For it laid all who neglected or refu≈øed, not only under a ≈øtigma and reproach, but under ≈øuch di≈øabilities as degrad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them below the rank of freemen.</p>
               <p>Obliging the whole country that had taken protection to turn out and ≈øerve ≈øix months in the militia, was the greate≈øt oppre≈ø≈øion imaginable; and the contriver of it well knew, as tho≈øe do, who now drive down the mea≈øure, that it was commanding what was ab≈øolutely impo≈ø≈øible. Men are generally ≈øo embarra≈ø≈øed with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences of one ≈øort or another, that there is no ≈øociety on earth, the aggregate body whereof could all quit their families and homes for ≈øix months. In our ca≈øe, not to mention how much agriculture would ≈øuffer by ≈øuch emigration, the heads of tho≈øe families who re≈øided within the enemy's range, were peculiarly cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum≈øtanced. They were no doubt called on by the feelings of
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:017861_0012_0FA3741886C46430"/>fathers, hu≈øbands, or protectors to ≈øtay and afford the feeble pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection they could to their families, or avert the di≈øtre≈øs or ruin that would en≈øue; if they joined our army, which at that time had not the power of protecting them.</p>
               <p>Ordering them out, therefore, without regard to local ≈øituation, ≈øickne≈øs, or other di≈øtre≈øs, was an extravagant act of power. Whether they re≈øided within or out of the enemy's garri≈øon or guards; whether a man's wife or little ones, or the property the Briti≈øh had left him unplundered, were in or out of the enemy's reach: All this was nothing; they mu≈øt abandon the whole to the rage of an unprincipled, revengeful enemy; and ≈øally forth, like Don Quixote, ≈øetting Briti≈øh guards and parties at defiance, in que≈øt of adventures on the report of a proclamation; and what per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps was more mortifying; they mu≈øt humble them≈øelves and ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate for mercy as criminals, at the feet of a man who a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was a fellow citizen, no more than on a fooling with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves.</p>
               <p>I conjure any ≈øen≈øible hone≈øt man to tell me, if this was acting the part of a magi≈øtrate, framing regulations for the ea≈øe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience of a people, over who≈øe happine≈øs he was appointed to pre≈øide? In the high ≈øtation he was, ought he not to have looked on the people at large as children of the republic; who≈øe only crime was a misfortune that admitted of no alternative? In≈øtead of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the li≈øt of their calamities, from Briti≈øh oppre≈ø≈øion, ought he not to have comforted them, and rather to palliate, or cover over any ≈øtain of di≈øhonour, if any there was, than lay them under the condemnation of treachery to their country? this proclamation was like putting the citizens in a Bear-≈økin, and then worrying them; or according to a more ju≈øt compari≈øon made by General Gad≈øden on the Confi≈øcation Bill; he ≈øaid it was like an <hi>Auto de fe,</hi> a ≈øort of proceeding u≈øed in Portugal again≈øt Heretics, where they are dre≈ø≈øed in frocks painted over with figures of fiends and devils, to excite a horror in the multitude again≈øt them.</p>

               <head>III. <hi>On the Mode of conducting the Election for the A≈ø≈øembly at Jack≈øonborough.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>I Shall proceed to examine the mode of conducting the elections in the latter end of 1781, for the A≈ø≈øembly at Jack≈øonborough; as I think it of con≈øequence that the public ≈øhould be acquainted with the nature of it. The Governor re≈øolved to convene the A≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øembly in January; and whether the mea≈øure of calling them at all, at that time, will turn out a ble≈ø≈øing or a cur≈øe to us, time will di≈øcover. The writs of election were accompanied with <hi>printed in≈øtructions</hi> to the returning officers, not to admit any per≈øon to vote, but ≈øuch as obeyed his extraordinary proclamation. The returning officers had al≈øo further orders from the Governor to chu≈øe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar men whom he named, and according to ≈øuch nomination they were cho≈øen.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="unknown:017861_0013_0FA3741945C36B08"/>
Our Con≈øtitution or Charter or Liberties a≈øcertains the qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of voters, and ≈øecures this valuable priviledge by the following clau≈øe:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Every free white man who has attained to the age of 21 years, and hath been a re≈øident and an inhabitant in this State for the ≈øpace of one whole year, and hath freehold of fifty acres of land, or a town lot, and been ≈øeized of it ≈øix months previous to the election, or paid a tax, or was taxable ≈øix months previous to the election in a ≈øum equal to the tax on fifty acres of land, ≈øhall be deemed qualified to vote for, and be eligible, &amp;c.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus the Con≈øtitution gives to every ≈øuch citizen a <hi>participation in the Sovereignty of the State,</hi> which right and ≈øhare neither Governor nor both Hou≈øes can take away without e≈øtabli≈øhing a tyrannical government on the ruins of our Liberties. And at any rate the A≈ø≈øembly could not alter the Con≈øtitution nor any part of it without ninety days notice by the‚Äî≈øection. For the Governer therefore to a≈ø≈øume authority to deprive ≈øome citizens of this right and give it to others, is a flagrant in≈øtance of tyranny, and is ≈øcarcely to be equalled in any country that pretended to freedom. The priviledge of voting for tho≈øe who are to make laws for us, is a right ≈øo inherent in every citizen of our State, that the Governor or Legi≈ølature, who pretends under any condition or limitation to deprive him of it, and then return it as a matter of favour, actually plays the tyrant by ≈øo doing: It is <hi>at once ve≈øting the government in a few independant of the whole: An overt-act</hi> to change the nature and form of our Con≈øtitution: Not an injury to one or a few individuals, but I aver it to be what in every Republican Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is called <hi>crimen lae≈øae libertatis, high trea≈øon again≈øt the ≈øovereignty and liberties of the people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>It is e≈ø≈øential to the being of a parliament, ≈øays Black≈øtone, that elections ≈øhould be ab≈øolutely free. Therefore all undue influence on the electors is illegal and ≈øtrongly prohibited; Mr. Locke ranks it among tho≈øe breaches of tru≈øt in the <hi>executive magi≈øtrate,</hi> which according to his notion amount to a di≈ø≈øolution of the government if he employs the force, the trea≈øure and offices of ≈øociety to corrupt the Repre≈øentatives, or <hi>openly to pre-engage the electors,</hi> and <hi>pre≈øcribe what manner of per≈øons ≈øhall be cho≈øen.</hi> For thus to regulate candidates and electors and <hi>new model the ways of election;</hi> what is it, ≈øays he, but to cut up the government by the roots, and poi≈øon the very fountain of public ≈øecurity.</q> Black≈øt. vol. 1. p. 178.</p>
               <p>The right of electing tho≈øe who act as public tru≈øtees in the legi≈ølature is by our con≈øtitution ≈øo ve≈øted in the citizen, ≈øo per≈øonal to him, that he cannot ≈øurrender or re≈øign it, any more than the ≈øub≈øtance of his body can part with its ≈øhadow; nor can it be forfeited until he be convicted of ≈øome notorious crime, on a fair trial by his peers. <hi>It is indefea≈øible and hereditary,</hi> and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor with all the authority which an act of A≈ø≈øembly could give him, was only an agent or tru≈øtee, who could no more aboli≈øh
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:017861_0014_0FA3741A06D76760"/>this right of the principal or people who appointed him, than a man who is only attorney or manager of an e≈øtate, can de≈øtroy or alienate the right of his employer. The manager exerci≈øing an act of owner≈øhip, ≈øuch as ≈øelling or converting it to his own emolument, makes void his commi≈ø≈øion. The power of the tru≈øt returns to the owner, and the other is re≈øpon≈øible for his breach of it. So the Governor ≈øeizing on the freedom of election, which alone con≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes the freedom of the people, was de≈øtroying all legal authority in him≈øelf. Such an act of power was a <hi>felo de ≈øe;</hi> a murderer of it≈øelf. It was no longer the act of the law, but of the u≈øurper; and <hi>packing an A≈ø≈øembly</hi> in which he confirmed all his doings, was making the matter ten times wor≈øe; it was employing the <hi>forms</hi> of parliament, of law and con≈øtitution to rivet his u≈øurpation.</p>
               <p>As to the Governor's extraordinary powers in the rece≈øs of the A≈ø≈øembly, <q>to do and execute whatever he thought nece≈ø≈øary for the ≈øafety of the State.</q> On due con≈øideration of this clau≈øe, I believe no lawyer will be ≈øo hardy as to deny, that this power only authori≈øed him to ≈øupport, not to overturn the charter of our liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and fundamental laws of the State, and by this precedent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe us in future to all the mi≈øchiefs of arbitrary power.</p>
               <p>Encroachments on public liberty commence in all republics with plau≈øible pretences of promoting ≈øome public good, or remedying ≈øome evil. In any government where there is the lea≈øt ≈øpark of freedom, <hi>open</hi> and <hi>barefaced tyranny</hi> can never in≈øinuate it≈øelf. It is obliged therefore like the original tempter in Paradi≈øe, to a≈ø≈øume a ≈øhape which may conceal its ≈øubtilty, and the ≈øtory of every na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion affords examples of this truth. In the in≈øtance before me, the pretence was "a nece≈ø≈øity for excluding from votes the di≈øaffected or protection-men, to prevent a tory influence in the Legi≈ølature." I look upon this to be a ≈øhallow pretence: It al≈øo amounts to a calumny on the great body of the people, who hated the Briti≈øh government as much, and loved <hi>Republican equality</hi> much better than ≈øome people I could name <note n="*" place="bottom">I have been told that certain gentlemen frequently make it their bu≈øine≈øs in company, to propagate a notion, that the people of this State are not capable to govern them≈øelves, and that the con≈øtitution ≈øhould be changed into an ari≈øtocracy, or the government of certain potent families. Does not this let the Cat out of the bag, and account for ≈øome late proceedings?</note>. The political ≈øentiments of the public were ≈øuch, and the hatred to the Briti≈øh ≈øo univer≈øal, that had a free, impartial election prevailed, there would have been, not only no danger, but the ≈øettlement of the government, and peace of the country, would in all probability have been con≈øulted much better than it was. I believe as much as I exi≈øt, that it was a great and public misfortune, that the Governor returned to the country, or that Major Hyrne, whom I regard by the by, as a man of great merit, exchanged the Charle≈øtown militia. Had they remained where they were, <hi>a convention of the people</hi> would have been
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:017861_0015_0FA3741AC74E1E00"/>held as ≈øoon as things were ripe for it: Elections would have been made agreeable to the con≈øtitution; ≈øomething like temperance and ju≈øtice might have prevailed; and the State at this time might have been in freedom and ≈øerenity; in≈øtead of the arbitrary mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øures, the ≈øpirit of faction, and di≈øcontent, ruin and mi≈øery of families, which like a di≈ømal gloomy mi≈øt hangs over the land at pre≈øent.</p>
               <p>At any rate we could not have been wor≈øted, for anarchy or no Government is far preferable to an arbitrary one. How different the policy adopted in New-Jer≈øey, and other parts of America, where the enemy for a while domineered, and the people uniformly took a temporary protection! Not one of them affords an example of a public ≈øervant fixing on the tyranny exerci≈øed by the enemy over his countrymen, as a ma≈øk or pretence for accu≈øing them of di≈øaffection, and taking the government out of their hands. Not one of them trampled, as we have done, on <hi>the charter of their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties or con≈øtitution,</hi> under colour of guarding again≈øt tory influence.</p>
               <p>This influence the State of Jer≈øey apprehended a few months ago; but what did they do? Not to open a theatre for the citizens to worry and per≈øecute each other, under di≈øtinctions of the <hi>virtuous few,</hi> and <hi>protection-men;</hi> they only pa≈ø≈øed an act ≈øub≈øtituting the mode of giving in their votes at the elections, openly and publicly, in≈øtead of balloting as formerly.</p>
               <p>How the legi≈ølature could make this proclamation of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or the ground-work of all their proceedings, cannot be accounted for, but by con≈øidering that ≈øuch was his influence, and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement of his party, that it became dangerous to make any oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øition. The great majority of the A≈ø≈øembly were men who had taken protection; but who from local ≈øituation were enabled to join the army, or find a ≈øub≈øtitute.</p>
               <p>What a ≈øtrong impre≈ø≈øion of horror of the Governor's arbitrary power mu≈øt tho≈øe members have upon them, when they gave their votes for degrading their fellow-citizens from the rights of freemen, only for doing what they did them≈øelves, making a temporary ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion to a conqueror! Some gratified the workings of revenge, and others ≈øome other paltry pa≈ø≈øion. But they were all mere tools to carry on the bu≈øine≈øs of u≈øurpation on the freedom of their country, and rai≈øe a few families to a height of power as would one day cru≈øh them and their po≈øterity.</p>

               </p>
               <p>This Act of A≈ø≈øembly ≈øuppo≈øes with the Governor, that all who did not come in whithin the time ≈øpecified by the proclamation, and ≈øerve ≈øix months, had forfeited their liberty, and that ≈øuch as obeyed, were re≈øtored to lo≈øt freedom. But the gentlemen of both Hou≈øes forgot, that the citizens of South-Carolina had to thank the Governor for nothing: Their rights and liberties were founded on ≈øomething el≈øe be≈øides parchment, or paper, or a proclamation; they were built on the laws of nature, and the fundamental laws of the State, and they were ≈øupported by the valour, and cemented by the blood of tho≈øe brave men who fought, bled, and died in the cau≈øe of freedom, not for the u≈øurpation of a few, but for the liberties and happine≈øs of all. And yet this wretched country at this very hour, when peace and happine≈øs ≈øhould prevail, is ≈øplit into a faction of two cla≈ø≈øes of men; the one ≈øort, a ≈øet of mongrel freemen, begot between G‚ÄîR‚Äîand a proclamation, or his party in the A≈ø≈øembly; or holding the privilege of voting becau≈øe they could advance fifty or ≈øixty guineas to procure a ≈øub≈øtitute. The re≈øt are aliens in the government, dive≈øted of every privilege we have been contending for the≈øe ≈øeven years pa≈øt, and to be <hi>ruled</hi> and <hi>taxed without their con≈øent.</hi> Even the unfortunate citizens of Charle≈øtown, who tho' they were not <hi>≈øix months-men</hi> under G‚Äî R‚Äî's proclamation, yet were actually <hi>≈øix years-men</hi> like common ≈øoldiers, before the reduction of the town. Their zeal for the cau≈øe, and courage in ≈øupporting it, was often proved on dangerous and honourable trials: They were all taken in defending it; and the great bulk of them bore hunger, in≈øults and per≈øecution before they would ≈øubmit even to a conqueror; yet are their ≈øervices not only forgotten, but they have been abu≈øed and worried as if they were convicts, and are now little better than va≈ø≈øals in their own city, except a few of the richer ≈øort, who could buy the freedom of voting; which it ≈øeems before this la≈øt general election was let to ≈øale as it were with an OYEZ. Gold, it appears, with all their pretended fears of tory influence can work a miracle, by making a man a whig, and buy a right of voting or being elected. Is not this like the coming of the day of judgment to our freedom? when the right of election, to keep which cha≈øte and un≈øpotted, we went to war with Great Britain, is now, like a public ≈øtrumpet, to be embraced only by him who can pull out his guineas, and advance a mercenary reward?</p>
               <p>I have now done with the proclamation and election bu≈øine≈øs; and here I mu≈øt declare, that I can lay my hand on my heart, and ≈øay, that I entertain no per≈øonal di≈ølike or prejudice to J‚Äî R‚Äî.

               <p>It is impo≈ø≈øible not to feel di≈øtre≈øs when we reflect on the mi≈øeries which each party in a civil war, inflicts on the other as they become uppermo≈øt.

               <p>Their treatment was ≈øo extravagantly outrageous, that no de≈øcription will ever give a ju≈øt idea of it; and to my≈øelf who was a witne≈øs and a ≈øufferer, it appears like a dream, and almo≈øt incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to me.

               <p>In the civil di≈øcord and factions of the ≈ømall republics of Greece, the party which was uppermo≈øt ≈øometimes bani≈øhed the leading men on the other ≈øide.

Before they heard of it with any certainty, the law was pa≈ø≈øed and their doom fixed.

               <p>And thus, a report or idle ≈ølory, an old grudge, revenge, or malice, ≈øupplied the place of legal accu≈øation, of evidence, of Judge and Jury.</p>
               <p>The inju≈øtice of this mea≈øure is ≈øo enormous, that the endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to prove it, is like proving that the Sun now ≈øhines at noon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day. Hearing the accu≈øed, and giving him a chance to defend him≈øelf, is the fir≈øt and mo≈øt ≈øacred rule of ju≈øtice. All ≈øorts of laws, civil and military, laws of parliament, courts-martial, and others, hear proof and defence; and any tribunal that refu≈øes to hear proof, refu≈øes to do ju≈øtice; and mu≈øt thereby ≈øuffer a ruin of character, and bear an eternal ≈øtigma and reproach on the face of its proceedings.</p>
               <p>According to Magna Charta, which is in force in this State, <q>No man ≈øhall be di≈øinherited, nor put out of his franchi≈øes, or freehold, unle≈øs he be duly brought to an≈øwer, and before-judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by due cour≈øe of law, if any thing be done to the contrary, it ≈øhall be redre≈ø≈øed and holden for none.</q>

               <p>Nor did they make any di≈øtinction, whether the parties were within the enemy's lines at New-York, or el≈øewhere.

In ≈øhort we are the only State in the Union, who ran blindfold into this irregular bu≈øine≈øs, without hearing their defence or giving them a future day to make it; except the State of Georgia who improved on our example; but it ≈øeems are now repenting of it.</p>
               <p>The drivers of the confi≈øcation and other acts, may attempt to ju≈øtfy the late proceedings from the Parliamentary hi≈øtory of the Hou≈øe of Lords in England: The nation whence we de≈øcended; who≈øe code of laws we in general made u≈øe of, and who≈øe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtitution of government we have copied as nearly as our circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtances will admit. If in the whole hi≈øtory of that people, the
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:017861_0020_0FA3741E8790DFD8"/>mea≈øure of attainting without a hearing, cannot be ≈øupported; then mu≈øt it fall to the ground: for as to the ju≈øtice, rea≈øon, or policy of it, the mind of man mu≈øt revolt at it.</p>
               <p>I do aver it to be a law of Parliament, <q>That on all bills of attainder the accu≈øed do appear and put in his an≈øwer;</q> and the hi≈øtory of England affords not a ≈øingle in≈øtance of an attainder, that was grounded upon <hi>general charges,</hi> without examination and hearing, but hath been univer≈øally branded with marks of dete≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by the lawyers and hi≈øtorians of that nation, and is at this day, con≈øidered rather as a national reproach, than a precedent for imitation. It is true their parliament have been too often led by the furious heats of civil war, or the influence of arbitrary rulers, into acts of attainder without a hearing. But they have not only been execrated, but almo≈øt uniformly rever≈øed by act of Parliament, for the inju≈øtice of them; as I ≈øhall ≈øhew pre≈øently. In moderate reigns, and when arbitrary power did not prevail, bills of attainder in Parliament were conducted according to maxims of ju≈øtice, or <hi>≈øecundum allegata &amp; probata:</hi> That is, the accu≈øed was re≈øpon≈øible only for ≈øuch crimes as were <hi>alledged and proved</hi> again≈øt him; if he was in any port of the king's dominions, and forth coming, he had notice to appear, or was legally arre≈øted; if he ab≈øconded, then they proclaimed a day for his appearance, which if he ob≈øerved not, they proceeded to attaint him.</p>
               <p>On the bill of attainder again≈øt the Earl of Clarendon, [Lords Debates, Vol. I. &amp;c] he was ≈øo generally obnoxious to all parties, that he did not think it ≈øafe to abide by the event, but he fled his country to Holland. On this the hou≈øe ≈øent a me≈ø≈øage to the king to i≈ø≈øue a proclamation for his appearance, and afterwards the charges of impeachment again≈øt him were enquired into, and referred to the opinion of the Judges whether they were criminal or not. This is the law, this the mode of proceeding in the Briti≈øh Parliament, except where law and ju≈øtice were trampled on by tyranny and oppre≈ø≈øion.</p>
               <p>I ≈øhould have ob≈øerved, that bills of attainder were never intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Engli≈øh con≈øtitution, but as the ultimate re≈øource upon extraordinary occa≈øions: The de≈øign of them was excellent; not to de≈øtroy mechanics and people of ob≈øcure condition, ≈øuch as our act of attainder is full of; but bills of attainder was originally in≈øtituted to call to a ≈øevere reckoning, <hi>Governors</hi> and <hi>Mini≈øters of State,</hi> who, of public ≈øervants, turned public enemies; and were by the influence which their very abu≈øe of power gave them, grown too big and weighty for Judge and Jury to deal with.</p>
               <p>According to Judge Black≈øtone, this, and no other, was the true intent of bills of attainder. <q>For though in general, ≈øays he, the union of the Legi≈ølature and judicial powers ought to be mo≈øt carefully avoided, yet it may happen <hi>that a ≈øubject intru≈øted with the admini≈øtration of public affairs, may infringe the rights
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:017861_0021_0FA3741F47626180"/>of the people, and be guilty of ≈øuch crimes as the ordinary magi≈øtrate, either does not or cannot puni≈øh.</hi>

               <p>In the beginning of the reign of Edward III Roger, Earl Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timer, <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Lord Coke ≈øays they indicted him, and not being able to proceed that way, "Re≈øolved to ruin him by Attainder."</hi>
                  </note> was condemned and executed without trial. But this at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainder was rever≈øed by Act of Parliament for this rea≈øon, <q>becau≈øe he was not brought to judgement according to the cour≈øe of law.</q>
               </p>
               <p>1≈øt. Ed. 3 The like happened to Edmond, Earl of Arundel; but in the 4th of this reign, his ≈øon petitioned Parliament, ≈øetting forth, "that the proceedings were contrary to Magna Charta, and in≈øid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he ≈øhould have been tried by due cour≈øe of law" And he was re≈øtored in part; and an act of rever≈øal pa≈ø≈øed the 28th of this reign, <q>declaring that the ≈øtatute by which he was attainted, was void and null.</q>
               </p>
               <p>4th. Ed. III. Sir Simon de Beresford, Materevers, and others were condemned to death without trial or examination, for killing Edward II. and his uncle. But the 19th of the ≈øame reign, a writ i≈ø≈øued to ≈øu≈øpend the judgment again≈øt Materevers, for this rea≈øon, "becau≈øe it had been illegally pa≈ø≈øed."</p>
               <p>In the reign of Charles 1≈øt, the Earl of Stafford was attainted by Act of Parliament, but he was allowed to pot in his an≈øwer, and was heard before the Hou≈øe of Lords. However, though the charges again≈øt him, amounted not to trea≈øon or felony, he was condemned and executed through party malice and revenge; but in the next reign his attainder was, for the inju≈øtice of it, rever≈øed by Act of Parliament, in which was a clau≈øe to this effect, viz. <q>That the ≈øaid act of attainder again≈øt Earl Stafford be obliterated from the journals of both hou≈øes, that the ≈øame be not vi≈øible in after ages, nor u≈øed as a precedent again≈øt any per≈øon what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoever.</q>
               </p>
               <p>For the act of attainder pa≈ø≈øed again≈øt Sir John Fenwick, Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam the IIId. was branded by the Briti≈øh nation, becau≈øe he was attainted without a witne≈øs; whereas an act pa≈ø≈øed that very Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament requiring two witne≈ø≈øes in ca≈øes of trea≈øon.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>It is impo≈ø≈øible, ≈øays an author of a treati≈øe on penal laws, to apologize for the many bloody ≈øtains we find indelibly fixed upon Engli≈øh hi≈øtory. One of Henry VIII's Parliaments, attainted the Counte≈øs of Sali≈øbury, the Marchione≈øs of Exeter, and others, <hi>without any trial or citation to appear, or without better proofs than the ≈øugge≈øtions</hi> of the wretched ≈øycophant Cromwell, (his mini≈øter.) This in≈øtrument of regal tyranny, fell a ≈øacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to the ≈øame <hi>iniquitous mea≈øures</hi> him≈øelf. He was ≈øome time afterward attainted by the ≈øame Parliament, and without trial,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:017861_0022_0FA3742007F55E68"/>examination, or evidence, condemned to death and executed.</q> Principle of penal laws, c. 5.</p>
               <p>My Lord Coke's remark on Cromwell's attainder without trial, is thus:‚ÄîAu≈øert oblivio, ≈øi potent, ≈øi non utcunque ≈øilentium regat.‚Äî<hi>Let the tran≈øaction be forever buried in oblivion, if po≈ø≈øible; if not, conceal it as well as we can.</hi> The≈øe cruel attainders are al≈øo cen≈øured by Bi≈øhop Burnet, Hi≈øt. Reformat. <q>Such bills, ≈øays he, cannot be enough condemned; for they were a breach of the mo≈øt ≈øacred and unalterable rules of ju≈øtice.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The cruelty of this Parliament in condemning the ≈øubjects with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out trial or examination is al≈øo branded with infamy, by the hi≈øtorians, Hume, Rapin, and tho≈øe who went before them. To ≈øtrike a blow of vengeance under the ma≈øk of ju≈øtice, is the mo≈øt to be execrated of all iniquity; and the hi≈øtorian who joins to a clear head, a good heart, never fails to deter po≈øterity from ≈øuch deeds by painting them in proper colours. Mr Hume in the Counte≈øs of Sali≈øbury's ca≈øe, ob≈øerves; <q>Henry re≈øolved to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed again≈øt her <hi>in a more ≈øummary and more tyrannical manner;</hi> he found that her offences could not be proved, or that ≈øhe could not by law be ≈øubjected to ≈øuch ≈øevere puni≈øhment as he de≈øired to inflict on her. And for that purpo≈øe he ≈øent Cromwell, who was ob≈øequious to his will, to demand of the judges whether the Parliament could attaint a per≈øon who was forth-coming without giving him any trial, or citing him to appear before them. The Judges replied it was a dangerous que≈øtion, and <hi>that the high court of Parliament ought to give examples to inferior courts, of proceeding according to ju≈øtice‚ÄîNo inferior court could act in an arbitrary manner, and they thought the Parliament never would.</hi>‚ÄîBeing pre≈ø≈øed to give a more explicit an≈øwer, they replied, that if a per≈øon were attainted in that manner, the attainder after could never be brought in que≈øtion, and mu≈øt remain good in law. Henry learned by their deci≈øion that ≈øuch a method of proceeding, <hi>though the contrary to all principles of equity, was yet practicable.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>In his account of Cromwell's fate he goes on. <q>Immediately after a bill of attainder was framed again≈øt him, and the Hou≈øe of Peers thought proper, without trial, examination, or evidence, to condemn him to death. The only circum≈øtance of his conduct by which he ≈øeems to have merited this fate was, his being the in≈øtrument of the <hi>king's tyranny</hi> in conducting the like <hi>iniquitous bills</hi> in the former ≈øe≈ø≈øions again≈øt the Counte≈øs of Sali≈øbury and others.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The few quotations I have made need no comment. Every ca≈øe I have given runs parallel to that under con≈øideration, and goes to prove the irregularity of the late proceedings.‚ÄîThey ≈øhew what a clamour the illegal condemnation of even one ≈øubject makes in a nation that pretends to freedom. And that no Parliament was ever under≈øtood by any ≈øound lawyer, or good hi≈øtorian, to have a lawful power to de≈øtroy the citizens without trial or examination.
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:017861_0023_0FA37420C7194E78"/>It is ≈øo cruel and unju≈øt in its nature, that it can never be made law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful by an Act of Parliament or of A≈ø≈øembly, any more than theft, adultery, or murder can.</p>
               <p>But condemning without hearing is not the only objection again≈øt our late pro≈øcription; it is what the lawyers call an <hi>ex po≈øt facto law;</hi> which even in arbitrary governments is reckoned tyranny. An <hi>ex po≈øt facto law</hi> is ≈øuch a law as is made <hi>to day,</hi> to puni≈øh the action of <hi>ye≈øterday,</hi> tho' ye≈øterday's action was innocent. A man for in≈øtance takes a protection from a conqueror, who is in po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the country, or ≈øigns a congratulation; this, I ≈øay, could not be puni≈øhed by any law of <hi>our</hi> State on a public and fair trial. To bring in a retro≈øpective act therefore, on purpo≈øe to ruin him, is an <hi>ex po≈øt facto</hi> law. It fir≈øt makes the crime out of nothing, or which is next to nothing, out of appearances: and afterwards ordains a puni≈øhment as revenge or caprice may dictate. It requires ≈øome reflection to ≈øee into the mi≈øchiefs of ≈øuch laws. But all lawyers agree, <q>that to puni≈øh for a fact done before there was a law to forbid it, is not, properly ≈øpeaking, a <hi>puni≈øhment,</hi> but <hi>ho≈øtility;</hi> not the penalty of the law, but the outrage of an enemy. For before the law was, there could be no trangre≈ø≈øion.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Again≈øt laws ≈øo de≈øtructive all moderate governments have armed them≈øelves: Mo≈øt of our Si≈øter States have done it expre≈øsly by their Con≈øtitutions. In the Declaration of Rights of the State of Ma≈ø≈øachu≈øetts-Bay, it is enacted, article 24, <q>That laws made to puni≈øh for actions done before the exi≈øtence of ≈øuch laws, and which have not been declared crimes by preceding laws, are unju≈øt, oppre≈ø≈øive, and incon≈øi≈øtent with the principles of a free government.</q> Article 25, <q>No ≈øubject ought in any ca≈øe, or at any time to be declared guilty of trea≈øon or felony by the Legi≈ølature.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Other States are guarded by ≈øimilar laws, and the ≈øpirit of our own, if attended to, forbids the u≈øe of them. For if there exi≈øted a country in which they were frequent, it mu≈øt be governed by the fierce pa≈ø≈øions of malice and revenge, and not by ju≈øtice and equity.</p>
               <p>There are many weighty rea≈øons why a Republic ≈øhould be more cautious than any other form of government, not to tran≈øgre≈øs their laws and con≈øtitutions by arbitrary mea≈øures. A popular a≈ø≈øembly, not governed by fundamental laws, but under the bla≈øs of anger, malice, or a thir≈øt for revenge, will commit more exce≈øs than an arbitrary monarch <note n="*" place="bottom">In Athens the citizens went into a faction about a divi≈øion of corn.

It is well known a certain gentleman who is now in the pre≈øent A≈ø≈øembly, would have been bani≈øhed, and his e≈øtate forfeited, had not ≈øome friend ≈øecreted the ≈ølip of paper on which his name was in≈øerted.</note> 
                  <hi>and keep out friends;</hi> will give more loo≈øe to malice, avarice, or revenge; commit more <hi>inju≈øtice</hi> and <hi>glaring partiality;</hi> and differ in outrage from one tyrant, as one fire-brand is inferior to many hundreds lighted together, and blown up by a fierce gale. Such deviations from ju≈øtice, moderation and temper, would fix di≈øgrace on the very name of a republic.</p>
               <p>In an≈øwer to this it will be ≈øaid, that the exce≈øs of tho≈øe powers lately exerted by the legi≈ølature, can never be formidable, but to the enemies of the republic; and that nothing can be too ≈øevere for the tories. <q>Who can find fault with ≈øeverity of laws again≈øt men who were foremo≈øt in ≈øupporting Briti≈øh tyranny?</q> Why not give them a hearing, I ≈øay? They formerly took an oath of allegiance to the State; and admitting they were guilty of the greate≈øt crimes, they were ≈øo far entitled to its protection, that they had a clear right to be heard in their defence.</p>
               <p>Unthinking are tho≈øe who imagine that one arbitrary exertion of power will not open a door for many others! There is hardly an in≈øtance in hi≈øtory of a law made to be revenged on enemies, but that very law was brought in as a precedent to de≈øtroy friends; and the thing is quite natural. For if the legi≈ølature can, without ceremony, or forms of law, ≈øeize the property, or bani≈øh the per≈øon of the meane≈øt, or wor≈øt member of ≈øociety; what I pray can hinder their ≈øtripping or bani≈øhing men of character and virtue? If ≈øo ob≈øcure a man as <hi>Paday Hinas,</hi> or ≈øo obnoxious a one as <hi>Bob Williams,</hi> can be bani≈øhed, amerced, or put to death without trial, hearing, or examination; whence comes ≈øecurity to you, or even to J‚Äî R‚Äî him≈øelf.</p>
               <p>He, and other citizens may blind and flatter them≈øelves with hopes that no mi≈øchiefs can accrue from ≈øuch tyrannical proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. But as factions and revolutions have been the lot of every republic that we ever heard of, our government will no doubt have its ≈øhare of them.</p>
               <p>Time which changes all things, may bring matters about, ≈øo as to turn the tables again≈øt the very men who were foremo≈øt in driving down tho≈øe laws; for after this precedent I ≈øee nothing they have to depend on, but faction, cabals, or influence in the legi≈ølature: And the ≈øheets on which tho≈øe laws are written, may wrap in winding-≈øheets ≈øome of their de≈øcendants.</p>
               <p>I ob≈øerved before, that hi≈øtory abounds with examples which prove, that arbitrary laws made to puni≈øh obnoxious people, have been generally u≈øed afterwards, as precedents to the de≈øtruction of the innocent.</p>

               </head>
               <p>AS to the <hi>Amercement Act,</hi> every argument which I have u≈øed above, apply with equal force again≈øt it; not to ≈øpeak of the inju≈øtice of ≈øtripping our citizens of their property, without <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination</hi> or <hi>hearing;</hi> The Amercement Act is the mo≈øt impolitic that could be devi≈øed. I in≈øi≈øt upon it, that if it ≈øtood unrepealed, <hi>it would do more real injury to this country than the inva≈øion and all the ravages of the Briti≈øh army.</hi> The misfortunes of the war will be ≈øoon out-grown by a young country, ≈øo fertile and full of re≈øources as ours. But the divi≈øions and heart-burnings which tho≈øe amerce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments will leave behind, would turn out a bitter misfortune to us, and go as an inheritance to our children. It will irritate one half of the people again≈øt the other, and di≈øgrace both; by the inju≈øtice done on one ≈øide, and the reproach endeavoured to be fixt on the other; many worthy citizens, and of as good families as any we have, being handed down on the journals of both hou≈øes as traitors and enemies to their country. It will al≈øo ≈øerve to keep alive the memory of the troubles of the pre≈øent day, which ≈øhould be buried in oblivion. Therefore the application of ≈øuch laws as that of the <hi>amercement,</hi> can never be ≈øaid <hi>to be governing a country.</hi> It is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>di≈øtracting it,</hi> and turning things up≈øide down. Tho≈øe men
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:017861_0026_0FA3742306180F00"/>are deprived of their property, without being ≈øo much as allowed to hear the accu≈øation again≈øt them, contrary to the fundamental laws of the State. Can any one imagine that ≈øuch extraordinary proceedings will produce no bad con≈øequence in the community? and that all divi≈øion, di≈øcontent and murmur about the matter will be ≈øoon over, as if nothing had happened? This law of it≈øelf would be ≈øufficient to di≈øturb the peace of the country, and alarm every thinking man in it; and he who thinks otherwi≈øe has but little knowledge of human nature.</p>
               <p>The reader may judge by the preamble, whether the Committee who framed the Amercement Law, paid more attention to law and fact than they did civil language. <q>Whereas many per≈øons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of, and owing allegiance to this State (≈øome bearing high and important commi≈ø≈øions) have withdrawn them≈øelves from the defence thereof, accepted protection, &amp;c.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I have proved already that our government was di≈ø≈øolved; it did not exi≈øt, and of cour≈øe tho≈øe who are amerced could not withdraw from its defence: At the Republic could not give the citizen pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, which is the equivalent he receives for allegiance, he owed none, and yet the preamble in≈øi≈øts, "they owed allegiance." We al≈øo ≈øee that "accepting protection" is ≈øtated as a high crime, though I have proved above it was not. It goes on: <q>And are either within the lines of the enemy, or have omitted to enroll them≈øelves and perform the duties of their country, pointed out and required by the Proclamation of his Excellency the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, of the 27th of September, in utter contempt of the executive authority, and evil example of ≈øociety.</q>
               </p>
               <p>My remarks on the circum≈øtances of the inhabitants who were within <hi>the enemy's guards,</hi> have, I hope, ≈øatisfied the reader that the proclamation was improper and oppre≈ø≈øive; that tho≈øe citizens could not po≈ø≈øibly comply with it; and that remaining where they were was perfectly ju≈øtifiable.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>And whereas there are others, who forgetting the ≈øocial ties of kindred and humanity, and regardle≈øs of the duty and alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance they had mo≈øt ≈øolemnly ≈øworn to their country, did actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ≈øub≈øcribe, and pay by them≈øelves or agents, con≈øiderable ≈øums of money towards mounting and equipping a troop or troops of cavalry, or other military force for the ≈øervice of his Britannic Maje≈øty.</q> It is a maxim of our law that the greater the crime of which any citizen is accu≈øed, the clearer ≈øhould be the proof to convict him of it: Yet the preamble ≈øtates tho≈øe facts without any ≈øort of proof that can be called <hi>legal,</hi> and in ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter contempt of all law-knowledge declares the facts to be a crime, that if true, were not puni≈øhable by our laws.</p>

The amerced citizens are painted as mi≈øcreants who do not de≈øerve to live; yet not one act charged in the preamble could be con≈øtrued to be a breach of any law of South-Carolina.</p>
               <p>As the amercement law is founded on inju≈øtice and bad policy; it is no wonder that the mode in which it is inforced, adds to the hard≈øhip of it. Three freeholders are cho≈øen by the commi≈ø≈øioners, to apprai≈øe tho≈øe e≈øtates, without the controul or challenge of the owner: and however enormous the valuation they ≈øet, yet he mu≈øt abide by it, without appeal or redre≈øs. The freeholders may be raw unexperienced men, or bia≈ø≈øed by the prejudices, malice, or revenge, peculiar to civil troubles, or mi≈øled by a thir≈øt for ≈øpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on the property of their neighbour. It is ea≈øy to ≈øee therefore, that inju≈øtice and oppre≈ø≈øion mu≈øt be the lot of many. It is ≈øaid by good judges, that ≈øome e≈øtates have been apprai≈øed at upwards of twice their real value; ≈øo that the proprietor, in≈øtead of 12 or 30 <hi>per cent.</hi> may ≈øuffer an entire confi≈øcation of the whole. Tho≈øe who have <hi>large families to bring up,</hi> and are <hi>much in debt,</hi> mu≈øt be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely ruined; and in this manner are our laws and forms of ju≈øtice overturned, which have been handed down as our birth-right for ages pa≈øt; and the fruits of a man's toil and indu≈øtry, which every good government ought to ≈øecure for the education and advancement of his children, are ≈ønatched from him in a moment.</p>
               <p>There is ≈øomething very curious in the ≈øtory of the republic which was attempted in England, in the la≈øt century, after the trial and execution of Charles I. and the expul≈øion of his family. It is worth the reader's attention: The true republican ≈øpirit never ≈øhone with more lu≈øtre on any ≈øpot of the globe. Such was the enthu≈øia≈øm of that nation, that it produced, as it were in an in≈øtant, a race of heroes, patriots, and men of letters, who all di≈øtingui≈øhed them≈øelves in pulling down kingly government, and ≈øetting up a commonwealth.</p>
               <p>The great <hi>Milton, Harrington,</hi> and other men of genius, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed all the charms of eloquence to cheri≈øh and ≈øupport it. But their liberties under their favourite republic they did not maintain a moment. Not becau≈øe the conjuncture of affairs was unfavourable; for it was quite otherwi≈øe. But the members of the new legi≈ølature, <hi>forgetting that they were young beginners in the art of governing;</hi>
                  <pb n="28" facs="unknown:017861_0028_0FA3742486C77D28"/>in≈øtead of endeavouring to reconcile all parties to the republic, by a temperate admini≈øtration of law and ju≈øtice; ≈øet to work immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to gratify per≈øonal malice and revenge; and pur≈øue their adver≈øaries, the <hi>Royali≈øts,</hi> with <hi>confi≈øcation</hi> and <hi>amercement.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some had to avenge cruelty or in≈øults, when in the hands of their enemies; others the burning of their hou≈øes, or to retaliate the death of their kindred; or the plunder of their property; all which mi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs, the royal party, in the hour of ≈øucce≈øs, never failed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute.</p>
               <p>By way of retaliation, <q>they were plundered, impri≈øoned, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimated, ≈øays an annali≈øt, and ≈øo worried by amercements or fines, that they were forced to compound over and over, 'till at la≈øt they had nothing left.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Many of them were forced by ≈øuch tyranny, to fly their country, and ≈øuffered ≈øuch di≈øtre≈øs abroad, that the very gentlemen were forced to fell them≈øelves as ≈ølaves to the Dutch, who accordingly tran≈øported them to their plantations.</p>
               <p>The ble≈ø≈øings of heaven could not attend ≈øcenes of ≈øuch oppre≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The ≈øpirit of di≈øcord went forth among the people; mutual hatred and animo≈øity aro≈øe between neighbours; fear and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hen≈øions ≈øeized others, for them≈øelves or family connections: Men had no re≈øource or ≈øafety, but to enter into parties, form factions and cabals, to ≈øupport them≈øelves or friends. And thus oppre≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, hatred, malice, and vexation, ≈øeemed to have been let loo≈øe by Divine Providence, as a puni≈øhment on the nation. Their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs at la≈øt were ≈øo entangled and di≈øtracted by the animo≈øity of contending parties, that the tyrant Cromwell ≈øprung up in the heighth of it; and the ≈øen≈øible part of the people were glad to ≈øubmit to his u≈øurpation, rather than bear any longer the mi≈øery of being governed by men, who ≈øet moderation and ju≈øtice at defiance and who proved them≈øelves totally incapable of any thing, but to create public and private ruin.</p>
               <p>God Almighty has ≈øo ordered the affairs of men in this world, that a mi≈øchievous legi≈ølature, any more than a mi≈øchievous indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual, can never ≈øucceed in oppre≈ø≈øion and inju≈øtice, without drawing down a cur≈øe and misfortune on it≈øelf. And ≈øhould the legi≈ølature of South-Carolina, and Georgia per≈øi≈øt in the fearful mea≈øures lately pur≈øued, I make no ceremony to foretel, that we and they ≈øhall remain a con≈øpicuous example with po≈øterity, to prove, <hi>that the people are incapable of governing them≈øelves. Tyranny</hi> will be furni≈øhed from our hi≈øtory with another new example to e≈øtabli≈øh her favourite principle, <q>that mankind were de≈øtined by nature for ≈ølavery, and to be hewers of wood and drawers of water for <hi>one</hi> or <hi>a few.</hi>

               <p>THE experience of all countries has ≈øhewn, that where a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity ≈øplits into a faction, and has recour≈øe to arms, and one finally gets the better, a law to bury in <hi>oblivion</hi> pa≈øt tran≈øactions
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:017861_0029_0FA374254812CD90"/>is ab≈øolutely nece≈ø≈øary to re≈øtore tranquillity. For if after a civil war, and one party vanqui≈øhed, per≈øecution was to go on; if the fury of laws and the fierce rage of pa≈ø≈øions prevailed, while the minds of men were yet fired by deadly revenge again≈øt their fallen adver≈øaries; this would be wor≈øe than keeping up the war: it would be carrying on ho≈øtility under the ≈øhape of ju≈øtice, which is the mo≈øt oppre≈ø≈øive, and of all other inju≈øtice, excites the greate≈øt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te≈øtation, and the mo≈øt violent factions and divi≈øion.</p>
               <p>Every part of Europe has had its ≈øhare of affliction by u≈øurpation, or civil war, as we have had lately; but every one of them con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered an act of oblivion as the fir≈øt ≈øtep on their return to peace and order. This was the ca≈øe in Greece and Rome, as well as in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and other places, as I ≈øhall ≈øhew by a few examples.</p>
               <p>The cruelty of the thirty tyrants in Athens exceeded all bounds. Xenophon tells us, they de≈øtroyed more citizens in eight months than were killed in thirty years war; and what made them more formidable was their being ≈øupported by 3000 citizens. However, they were at la≈øt depo≈øed by an armed force, under Thra≈øy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulus, and their ruin was followed by a general amne≈øty. <q>By which order wi≈øely made, and carefully ob≈øerved, the city returned to its former quietne≈øs, ≈øays Raleigh.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>I cannot forbear ob≈øerving, ≈øays Rollin, ≈øpeaking of that event, the wi≈ødom and moderation of Thra≈øybulus, ≈øo e≈ø≈øential after a long continuance of dome≈øtic troubles. <hi>This is one of the fine≈øt events in antient hi≈øtory, worthy the Athenian lenity and benevolence,</hi> and has ≈øerved as a model for ≈øucce≈ø≈øive ages to good governments.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Never had tyranny been more cruel and bloody than that which the Athenians had ≈øhaken off: Every hou≈øe was in mourning: Every family bewailed the lo≈øs of ≈øome relation. I had been a ≈øeries of public robbery and rapine; in which licence and impunity had authorized all manner of crimes. The people ≈øeemed to have a right to demand the blood of all accomplices in their villainies; but Thra≈øybulus ro≈øe above tho≈øe ≈øentiments: from the ≈øuperiority of his genius, and his views of a more di≈øtingui≈øhing policy, he fore≈øaw that <hi>by giving into the puni≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of the guilty, eternal ≈øeeds of di≈øcord and enmity would remain and weaken the republic by dome≈øtic divi≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</q>
               </p>
               <p>All hi≈øtorians and political writers condemn the mi≈øchievous policy of pur≈øuing the citizens with pro≈øecutions after civil wars. Machiavel him≈øelf, tho' for violent mea≈øures on other occa≈øions, yet ≈øtrongly recommends an act of oblivion after a revolution. And he cen≈øures the conduct of the Roman republic on the expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion of the ten tyrants, for not pa≈ø≈øing an amne≈øty, in≈øtead of carrying on pro≈øecutions again≈øt tho≈øe citizens who ≈øupported their tyranny.</p>
               <p>In that republic ten of their principal citizens were entru≈øted with <hi>extraordinary powers;</hi> but regardle≈øs of laws or con≈øtitution, they ≈øeized on the government and freedom of the people; who, with the a≈ø≈øi≈øtance of the army, expelled them after three years
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:017861_0030_0FA374260713C480"/>u≈øurpation <note n="*" place="bottom">Appius was at the head of that tyranny, and his cruelty and lu≈øt are well known. Yet the proceedings again≈øt him are condemned by all hi≈øtorians, for he was refu≈øed a hearing and appeal before the people, agreeable to their con≈øtitution.</note>. Inflamed with ≈øucce≈øs and revenge, the very people who had taken the tyrant's protection, for all did it; were for putting to death the mo≈øt violent and mi≈øchievous and their adherents. Machiavel's remarks on this conduct is worth noting.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>It is a very great fault in a State, ≈øays he, every day in the citizens minds to renew the memory of old wrongs done to this and that man, with new puni≈øhments, as it befel at Rome under the Decemvirate. For all the ten, and ≈øundry other citizens were accu≈øed and condemned, ≈øo that the nobility were affrighted, thinking they would never leave off condemning them 'till they had de≈øtroyed the whole. And certainly it had produced ≈øome great commotion in the city, if Marcus Duellius the Tribune, had not pa≈ø≈øed a decree, that for a whole year it ≈øhould not be lawful to accu≈øe any citizen. Where we ≈øee how great a hurt it is in a republic, or prince, to hold their ≈øubjects minds in ≈øu≈øpicion and fear with continual pro≈øecutions and puni≈øhments; <hi>and without doubt a wor≈øe cour≈øe cannot be taken.</hi> For men that begin to doubt of mi≈øchief in any ca≈øe, provide for them≈øelves in their danger, grow bolder and le≈øs re≈øpectful how they venture on novelties. Wherefore it is nece≈ø≈øary never to hurt any, or the hurt that is done to do it at once, and afterwards let them enjoy ≈øome a≈ø≈øurance that may give them cau≈øe to quiet and ≈øettle their minds.</q> Machiavels di≈øcour≈øe.</p>
               <p>Whether the nece≈ø≈øity of a general amne≈øty ever occured to the reader or not, the above ob≈øervations will ≈øtrike him very forcibly, as they apply ≈øo well to our pre≈øent ≈øituation. However, to make this matter ≈øtill clearer, I ≈øhall draw a compari≈øon between the conduct of the Briti≈øh nation, on the re≈øtoration, after the grand rebellion, and of our legi≈ølature on the re-e≈øtabli≈øhment of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public in 1782.</p>
               <p>The ≈øituation of the two countries was ≈øimilar in this, that Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land ≈øuffered a u≈øurpation under Cromwell, and other tyrants, and South-Carolina under the tyranny of Great-Britain: And the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of both countries, with few exceptions, ≈øubmitted to the u≈øurpers. But in other circum≈øtances England differed from us: Briti≈øh tyranny prevailed in this country only about 16 months. Their officers plundered our ≈øide boards of <hi>place,</hi> and our ward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robes of their <hi>contents,</hi> to a con≈øiderable amount; and ≈øtole, or were the death of about twenty thou≈øand negroes. In battle and cold blood they de≈øtroyed perhaps 3000 of our citizens; and they tortured our every manlike feeling, by di≈øtre≈ø≈øing our families, and in≈øults to our≈øelves, whenever we fell into their hands. This is rating our damage pretty fairly.</p>
               <p>But the≈øe injuries vani≈øh into nothing, compared with what the Engli≈øh nation ≈øuffered in the grand rebellion. It la≈øted 19 years I think. The ≈øtronger party dethroned the prince, brought him
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:017861_0031_0FA37426C68BDB88"/>to a public trial, and put him to death. The heir to the crown-having been detained under various indignities a pri≈øoner in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, put him≈øelf at the head of an army; and was defeated in battle at Worce≈øter.</p>
               <p>Ten thou≈øand of his adherents were made pri≈øoners, many of whom Cromwell ≈øold as ≈ølaves to the We≈øt-India planters. Young Charles, after the rout was hunted like a deer, and by a≈ø≈øuming various di≈øgui≈øes got to France. When abroad he was reduced ≈øo low that he could not command a pi≈øtole. The number of ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects de≈øtroyed on both ≈øides is computed at half a million.</p>
               <p>When the troubles were over, and Charles the Second was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtored to the throne, he had his own injuries and the ruin of his friends, to avenge. But did he avenge tho≈øe injuries? Did he di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øs his fir≈øt parliament, as we did the la≈øt a≈ø≈øembly, leaving the terrors of laws hanging over the people's heads; and re≈øolve to ≈øend the courts of ≈øe≈ø≈øions through the country, to fill it with condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and convicts, to the di≈øgrace and utter di≈øtre≈øs of families, and add to the li≈øt of widows and orphans? He did nothing of all this. The very fir≈øt bill he pa≈ø≈øed was an act of amne≈øty, to ≈øettle the di≈øtractions of the nation. Had he rea≈øoned like our politicians, he would have fallen upon confi≈øcation, bani≈øhment and amerce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and under pretence of preventing a future rebellion, he would like us, have pa≈ø≈øed acts to exclude from votes or ≈øeats in the legi≈ølature, ≈øuch as were deemed enemies to royalty. In≈øtead of ≈øuch like mea≈øures, which would have only increa≈øed the nation's misfortunes, he pa≈ø≈øed a general amne≈øty; out of which forty nine of the late king's judges were excepted. The≈øe had a fair and public trial, and of the whole, ten only were executed. This was all the blood ≈øhed after ≈øo furious a civil war.</p>
               <p>I ≈øhall tran≈øcribe one healing clau≈øe of this famous <note n="*" place="bottom">I refer any of the Gentlemen in the A≈ø≈øembly to the fir≈øt volume of the Lords debates.</note> act of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øty, which is worthy to be remembered.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>And to the end and purpo≈øe that all names and terms of di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction, may be likewi≈øe put in utter oblivion, be it further enacted, that if any per≈øon or per≈øons, within the ≈øpace of three years next en≈øuing, ≈øhall pre≈øume maliciou≈øly to call or alledge, or object again≈øt any per≈øon or per≈øons, any name or names, or other words of reproach, any way leading to revive the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the late differences; that then every ≈øuch per≈øon offending as afore≈øaid, ≈øhall pay ten pounds if a gentleman, and forty ≈øhillings if of an inferior degree.</q>
               </p>
               <p>It is a maxim in politics, that if a breach be made in the con≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of a government, and it be not healed, it will prove as fatal to its freedom, as a wound that is neglected and ≈øuffered to mortify, would to the life of a man. I proved clearly that ours received a mortal one; and ≈øhould the pre≈øent a≈ø≈øembly leave it <hi>to inflame,</hi> without applying a cure, we cea≈øe to be a free people. The reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy I ≈øpeak of is lenient, all healing. <hi>Repeal at once the late election act, the amercement law, and the confi≈øcation act, as far as it affects

               </p>
               <p>If every citizen cannot enjoy the rights of <hi>election</hi> and <hi>repre≈øentation,</hi> according to the con≈øtitution, I hope <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The≈øe are the ≈øentiments of one who pleads not for per≈øonal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence.
