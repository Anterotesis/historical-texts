            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>AMONG a great Variety of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances which the ancient Prophecies declared would mark the Advent of the Meſſiah; one was, That he ſhould be uſhered in, and his Preſence announced, by a Meſſenger, who was to come in the Power and Spirit of Elias, and prepare the Way before him.</p>
            <p>THUS the Almighty, when ſilencing the Cavils that were then raiſed by Infidelity againſt his Providence, and affording Conſolation to the Faithful and Pious, declares by the Prophet Malachi,—<q>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I will ſend my Meſſenger, and he ſhall prepare the Way before me; and the Lord whom ye ſeek, ſhall ſuddenly come to his Temple.</q>

To the ſame Purpoſe, the ſublime and evangelical Prophet Iſaiah, pointing out the Circumſtances preparatory to our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's Appearance—ſays—<q>The Voice of him that crieth in the Wilderneſs, prepare ye the Way of the Lord, make ſtraight in the Deſert a Highway for our God. Every Valley ſhall be exalted, and every Mountain and Hill ſhall be made low; and the crooked ſhall be made ſtraight, and the rough Places plain.</q>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">ISAI. xl. 3, 4. ISAIAH prophecied about 800 Years before our Saviour's Incarnation—MALACHI about 400—he was the laſt of the ancient Prophets.</note>
            </p>
            <p>THESE Words exhibit to us the Idea of a public Herald; who, at the Approach of an illuſtrious Monarch, commands the Ways to be levelled, and every Thing prepared for his Reception.</p>
            <p>THIS metaphorical Language is bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed from a Cuſtom which may be traced up to the remoteſt Antiquity; when Kings ſent proper Perſons to prepare Roads, and every Thing elſe neceſſary for their March.</p>
            <p>THUS it is ſaid of ALEXANDER <hi>the Great,</hi> by an Author who wrote his Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Arrian.</hi>
               </note>—<q>He now marched towards the
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:015372_0005_0F98D2CA637B2140"/>
River Indus, his Army going before, to prepare the Way for him; for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe thoſe Places could not have been paſſed over.</q> Thus alſo JOSEPHUS tells us, when Titus marched to beſiege Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,—<q>That there went before him all the Royal Aids, and all the Auxiliaries, and thoſe who made the Ways plain.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THIS Prophecy of a Voice crying in the Wilderneſs to prepare the Way of the Lord, received its literal Accompliſhment in John the Baptiſt, who was the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner and Harbinger of our bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</p>
            <p>HE was the Meſſenger whom the Son of God ſent to pepare the Way before him, by preaching the Doctrine of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and Reformation. The Baptiſt earneſtly exhorted to the Practice of Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, Charity, Benevolence, Humility and Contentment. Hereby Men's Hearts were prepared to receive the Meſſiah, then juſt on the Point of making his public Appearance. Hereby the Valleys were exalted, Mountains were depreſſed, and the crooked Places made ſtraight—which are only figurative Expreſſions to ſignify, that the Pride, Self Righteouſneſs and Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities of Man were laid low in the Duſt; whilſt the humble and pious were raiſed to
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:015372_0006_0F98D2CAC5229EF8"/>
the Smiles and Favour of God. The Perverſeneſs and Folly of Sin and Error were expoſed; thoſe Virtues and Truths were inculcated, which would remove every Impediment to a full Reception of the Meſſiah,—to an intire Acquieſcence in his Diſpenſation, which was the laſt that God would vouchſafe to Mankind.</p>
            <p>THE intereſting Doctrines taught by John the Baptiſt—his Declaration that "the Kingdom of Heaven," i. e. the Kingdom of the Meſſiah, "was at Hand"—theſe, I ſay, joined to his extraordinary Sanctity, awakened the Attention of all Men. They eagerly crouded round him, and anxiouſly waited to ſee the Iſſue of thoſe remarkable Circumſtances. <q>All the People were in Expectation, ſays the Evangeliſt; and all Men muſed in their Hearts of John, whether he were the Chriſt or not.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THE Prophecies had pointed out this Period for the coming of the Meſſiah. Accordingly, there was at this Time an univerſal Expectation among the Jews, that the Meſſiah would ſhortly appear; as ſeveral Writers, Jewiſh and Heathen, expreſsly teſtify<note n="‖" place="bottom">JOSEPHUS, SUETONIUS, TACITUS, &amp;c.</note>. This partly accounts
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:015372_0007_0F98D2CB89819FD0"/>
for the vaſt Concourſe of People which reſorted to the Baptiſt for Inſtruction, and to receive his Baptiſm.</p>
            <p>THE Phariſees, the Sadducees, and Publicans came, deſiring to be inſtructed; and the Baptiſt wiſely adapted his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions to their reſpective Caſes.</p>
            <p>AMONG others, the Soldiers, likewiſe demanded of the Baptiſt—<q>And what ſhall we do?</q> His Anſwer, which I have choſen for my Text, though ſuited to the peculiar Circumſtances of thoſe who made the Inquiry, yet when duly explained, will be found to contain the Duty of every Chriſtian Soldier. <q>Do Violence to no Man,</q> ſays the Heaven commiſſioned Baptiſt, <q>neither accuſe any falſly; but be content with your Wages.</q>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Who thoſe Soldiers were—whether Heathens or Jews, is a Point on which Commentators are much divided. As it is not a Matter of much Conſequence, I ſhall interfere no further than juſt to mention my Opinion, and briefly ſet down the Reaſons which ſupport it. I think it is evident that thoſe Soldiers were not idolatrous Heathens; for had they been ſuch, can we ſuppoſe the Baptiſt would not, on their deſiring his Inſtructions, exhort them to renounce Idolatry which was ſo repugnant to the Spirit of divine Revelation—ſo utterly inconſiſtent with the Worſhip of the true God? From their Attendance on the Baptiſt's preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, applying to him for Direction, and probably ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Baptiſm, as the Jews did, it appears that thoſe Soldiers were poſſeſſed of the ſame Principles and Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, with the Jews of their Time. Hence I conclude they were either Proſelytes to the jewiſh Religion, ſuch as I ſuppoſe CORNELIUS, <hi>Acts</hi> x. and the two CENTURI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ONS, <hi>Matth.</hi> viii, and <hi>Luke</hi> vii, to have been; or elſe natural born Jews. Judea was at this Time a Roman Province; and when the State of Things there, during that Period, is duly conſidered, there will appear but little Weight in the Objections which are made againſt the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition that thoſe Soldiers were Jews. The Jews, it is true, frequently applied for, and obtained, an Exemption from ſerving in the Armies of Heathen Princes, on Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Difficulties they met with in obſerving the Laws relative to the Sabbath, Diſtinction of Meats, &amp;c. Yet it is certain the Jews often went into foreign Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. A large Body of Jews attended the Army of XER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>XES, when he invaded Greece. Many of them ſerved under ALEXENDER <hi>the Great,</hi> in his Aſiatic Expeditions. They compoſed a reſpectable Corps in the Army of PTO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LOMY when he retreated from Syria, after the Defeat of CELLES, his Lieutenant, by DEMETRIUS; and among them was the celebrated MOSOLLAM, ſo famous for his Archery. Many other Inſtances of the ſame Kind, and of a later Date, might be produced.</note>

THIS I judged a proper Subject to dwell on, when addreſſing you, my Brethren, who are now called into the Field, in Defence of legal Government, and of the juſt Authority of your rightful Sovereign—in Defence of your Lives, Liberties and Property—of all, in ſhort, that is dear or valuable to Man on this Side of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, which the Hand of Violence, and Uſurpation would wantonly rend from you.</p>
            <p>BEFORE I enter on an Explanation of the Duties recommended in my Text, it may be proper to obſerve, That this Paſſage is a full Anſwer to the crude
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:015372_0009_0F98D2CD05708460"/>
Notions of thoſe who aſſert the Unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of War, or of bearing Arms, on any Occaſion.</p>
            <p>JOHN the Baptiſt was commiſſioned by the Almighty to prepare the Way for the Meſſiah's Reception. This arduous office he faithfully diſcharged, by rebuking Vice and Error boldly, and delivering Truths conducive to this End, by the Authority of Heaven. Unawed by the Power of exalted Station, unbiaſſed by the ſpecious Veil of aſſumed Sanctity, neither of them could ſcreen the Patrons of Vice or Error from his ſevere Reprehenſions. He rebuked the Phariſees, for their Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocricy and Wickedneſs—the Publicans for their Extortion—he reproved even Herod for his flagitious Enormities.</p>
            <p>Now can it be ſuppoſed, that when Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers applied to this faithful and intrepid Servant of God for Inſtruction, he would not inform them of the Unlawfulneſs of their Profeſſion, if indeed it had been unlawful? Had it been diſpleaſing to God, would he omit declaring it to be ſo? Would he give Directions for their Conduct in that Profeſſion, thereby approving of it, and affording it the Sanction of his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority? No—This the Baptiſt never would
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:015372_0010_0F98D2CDC5C81E28"/>
have done, had the Profeſſion of a Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier been inconſiſtent with Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>IT were indeed moſt devoutly to be wiſhed that Hoſtilities, and all Occaſions of them, would ceaſe among the Children of Men—that Nation might not lift up Sword againſt nation, nor learn war any more. But alas! this is a Bleſſing not to be looked for in the preſent State of Things. Ambition, Selfiſhneſs, Malice, and the other malignant Paſſions of our fallen Nature have a great Aſcendency over the Judgement, Principles, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Mankind. Theſe ever have, and it is probable, ever will produce Violence, and unjuſt Encroachments, in ſome; and theſe again will make Self-Defence indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſably neceſſary in others.</p>
            <p>TO what a dreadful Situation would Mankind be reduced were they precluded from Self-Defence! Society could not poſſibly ſubſiſt. The Weak and Helpleſs would be a Prey to the Strong—the Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and Induſtrious would be ſure Vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tims to every lawleſs Invader, who ſpurn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Dictates of Humanity and Juſtice. This whole Earth would be one wretched Scene of Diſorder, Rapine and Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:015372_0011_0F98D2CE84A383E8"/>
ON the other Hand, I may affirm, that as the beneficent Creator wills the Happineſs of his Creatures—as their Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs cannot be attained without Society, as Societies cannot be preſerved, nor their Ends obtained, without Self-Defence—On theſe Conſiderations I may affirm, that Self-Defence is agreeable to the Will of the Deity. For he that wills the End, muſt will the Means that are neceſſary for that End.</p>
            <p>BUT enough of this—I now proceed to unfold the Soldier's Duty, as laid down in my Text.</p>
            <p>THE different Profeſſions and Stations in human Life, are liable to Temptations peculiar to each: And ſuch is the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Goodneſs of God, that he has given Inſtructions in his Word, adapted to thoſe various Stations; by which the Temptations and Vices, incident to them, may be guarded againſt.</p>
            <p>THE Soldier, by his Profeſſion, is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently called on to face Dangers, and engage in hazardous Conflicts. Hence Courage and Intrepidity are eſſential Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications in his Character. Theſe when guided by Principles of Benevolence and Juſtice, conſtitute that generous Magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:015372_0012_0F98D2CF4492B720"/>
which is one of the greateſt Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of our Nature. Through this, the Soldier becomes the gallant Aſſerter of his Country's injured Rights,—the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector of the Innocent, the Scourge and Terror of Oppreſſors,—of the Seditious and Rebellious.</p>
            <p>BUT theſe Qualities, through the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravity of human Nature, ſometimes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate; they lead Men to oppreſs and over-bear, and commit various Diſorders.</p>
            <p>AGAINST this Abuſe, the Injunction in my Text "Do Violence to no Man"—is directed. The Original Word ſignifies to <hi>ſhake,</hi> or <hi>terrify by ſhaking;</hi> and may be applied to any Kind of unjuſt Violence, in Order to inſult, oppreſs, or forcibly extort Money, or any Sort of Property from others.</p>
            <p>ALL this is utterly inconſiſtent with the Soldier's Duty. Humanity and a Regard to Juſtice, ſhould direct all his Move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; even in the moſt rugged Scenes of War—for Benevolence and War are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly conſiſtent. Humanity is ever Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtic of true Courage, juſt as Cruelty and Baſeneſs are of Cowardice. The greateſt Heroes that have figured in Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, were no leſs diſtinguiſhed by their
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:015372_0013_0F98D2D063E600A0"/>
Humanity and perſonal Bravery: And God forbid that ſo good and righteous a Cauſe as you are engaged in, ſhould ever be diſgraced by any Action, which is not warranted by Juſtice and true Magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity.</p>
            <p>WHEN a Man becomes a Soldier, he ceaſes not to be a Chriſtian, or a Member of Society. The Duties, the Principles of the Chriſtian and Citizen, he ſhould therefore keep in View, and never loſe Sight of them. Theſe ſhould regulate his Conduct, whilſt vindicating his own civil and religious Rights, and thoſe of his Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Citizens, at the Hazard of his Life. And truſt me, that this will be ſo far from damping his Ardour, or depreſſing his Courage, that it will animate both—it will add Fortitude to his Breaſt—Strength and Vigour to his deſcending Arm.</p>
            <p>BY this Injunction, all Violence to a Superior, or Diſobedience to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, is alſo forbidden. Subordination is the very Life of military Diſcipline; as that again is, humanly Speaking, what will moſt effectually inſure Succeſs. The Want of Subordination and Diſcipline among our infatuated Adverſaries, affords you one very great Advantage over them. Their wild Principles naturally lead to theſe and
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:015372_0014_0F98D2D1F4AA8370"/>
other Diſorders; and ſo far tend to defeat the Object they have in View.</p>
            <p>FIX it therefore in your Minds, that a chearful, ready Submiſſion to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of Superiors, and a vigorous Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of them, is a great and indiſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Duty of the Chriſtian Soldier.</p>
            <p>THE next Thing injoined by my Text is, "to accuſe no Man falſly;" which may be done either out of Malice, or Self-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt; thus employing the Authority of others, where our own will not avail, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure our Fellow Creatures. This is ſo bare-faced a Crime, and of ſo flagitious a Nature, that I need not enlarge on it. I flatter myſelf that your own Hearts revolt againſt it in ſuch a Manner, and you ſo thoroughly deteſt it, that the Neceſſity of diſſuading you from committing it, is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſuperſeded. For what more baſe or abominable, than to give falſe Evidence againſt others; thereby to gratify Revenge, or enrich ourſelves with their Spoils!</p>
            <p>I PROCEED therefore to the laſt Injunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my Text—<q>Be content with your Wages.</q>
            </p>
            <p>CONTENTMENT with that Station, in which the Will of Providence, and their
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:015372_0015_0F98D2D2459CBCB0"/>
own Choice hath placed them, is the Duty of all Men. A Diſregard of this Duty, ſo clearly inculcated by the united Voice of Revelation and Reaſon, is the Source of numberleſs Evils—perhaps of moſt of the Miſeries of human Life.</p>
            <p>A DISCONTENTED Mind is never at Reſt. It finds Matter to prey upon, and to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh its Diſeaſe in every Place, and in every Situation. It ſickens under the choiceſt Bleſſings of Earth and Heaven—Theſe often ſerve only to ſtimulate it on in the Purſuit of Meaſures which are utterly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſive of all Happineſs.</p>
            <p>O HOW melancholy an Inſtance of this Truth, does this wretched Country afford at preſent! Where a Land of Peace and Plenty—a Land diſtinguiſhed above any other by its Civil and Religious Privileges, is turned into a Field of Blood—a Scene of Devaſtation, Oppreſſion and Miſrule—and all this through the Diſcontent of thoſe who were goaded on by Ambition to riſe above their Fellows—and realize their crude, republican Schemes!</p>
            <p>THE Sources of Diſcontent are various. A wrong Byaſs of Mind, inordinate Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and Deſires, or an overweening Opinion of ourſelves, which claims more
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:015372_0016_0F98D2D30CD4E1B0"/>
than others think fit to give, frequently produce this unhappy Temper. But it is not my Deſign to inveſtigate all the Springs from which it is derived; and ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore only mention <hi>two,</hi> which ſeem to have a particular Relation to my Text.</p>
            <p>ONE of thoſe is Covetouſneſs; which may induce a Soldier to be diſſatisfied with his Wages, and to deſire more than of Right he can claim. But this is repugnant to every Dictate of Reaſon, ſince he ſhould certainly be ſatisfied with his ſtipulated Reward. He knew before-hand the Terms on which he engaged: Should he not therefore be content with thoſe Terms af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards? And certain it is that no Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in the Univerſe have leſs Reaſon to be diſcontented in this Reſpect than Britiſh Soldiers; for no other State has made ſuch ample Proviſion for thoſe who engage in that Profeſſion.</p>
            <p>THE other Cauſe of a Soldier's Diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with his Wages, which I alluded to, is Extravagance, or Profuſeneſs, which his Wages may not be ſufficient to ſupply. When his Expences thus become greater than his Income, it will not only prevent his being content with his Wages; but may alſo put him upon uſing unjuſtifiable Methods to increaſe his Income.—It may
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:015372_0017_0F98D2D3C5FA6158"/>
lead him to do Violence to others, or to accuſe them falſly.</p>
            <p>ONE Vice generally makes Way for, and introduces another. Drunkenneſs, Diſſipation, and criminal Purſuits, involve Men in extravagant Expences beyond their Abilities. They deſtroy Men's Health, enfeeble the Body, debaſe the Mind, and bring on a Neglect of Principle and Duty. Profane Swearing, Diſcontent, Turbulence and Impatience of juſt Reſtraint, with a long Train of other Evils, are their inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable Attendants.</p>
            <p>YOU muſt perceive at firſt View how neceſſary it is for a Soldier to avoid theſe; and how well the Precept in my Text—"to be content with his Wages"—is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated to guard againſt them. This Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception Fact is the moſt important of any that was delivered by the Baptiſt, to the Soldiers; and what effectually ſecured an Obſervation of the Reſt. The Soldier who is content with his Wages, reſtraining his Deſires and Expences within proper Bounds, is under no Temptation to do Violence to others, or accuſe them falſly.</p>
            <p>COLLECTED in himſelf, and mindful only of what is his Duty, he is prepared for the vigorous Diſcharge of it. Anxious
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:015372_0018_0F98D2D4865F4190"/>
to diſtinguiſh himſelf in the honourable Purſuit of Fame, and ſignalize his Proweſs, he goes on ſteadily and undaunted. He ſerves God, while he ſerves his King and Country; and forgets not that he is a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of the holy Jeſus,—a Candidate for Eternity, whilſt he would gather Laurels in the Field of hardy Conflict.</p>
            <p>SUCH then is the Soldier's Duty, as preſcribed by the Heaven-taught Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and Fore-runner of the Meſſiah. He does not tell the Soldier that his Profeſſion is unlawful, or diſpleaſing to God—He bids him not fling away his Arms, aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don War, and renounce the military Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter: But he teaches the Soldier to act with Propriety in his Profeſſion—to avoid the Vices incident to it—and regulate his Conduct by the Rules of Religion, Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence and Humanity.</p>
            <p>I TRUST, my Brethren, theſe Out-lines of the Soldier's Duty and Character, which I have briefly delineated, are ſo evidently reaſonable, ſo congenial with your own Sentiments, that you will faithfully copy them in your future Conduct—That you will thus do Honour to the Cauſe in which you are engaged, and contribute as much as you can to its Succeſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:015372_0019_0F98D2D544FE9C38"/>
Never—I will boldly and without He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation pronounce it—Never was a more juſt, more honourable or neceſſary Cauſe for taking up Arms, than that which now calls you into the Field!</p>
            <p>IT is the Cauſe of Truth againſt Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhood—of Loyalty againſt Rebellion—of legal Government againſt Uſurpation—of Conſtitutional Freedom againſt Tyranny—in ſhort, it is the Cauſe of human Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the Happineſs of Millions, againſt Outrage and Oppreſſion.</p>
            <p>LET enthuſiaſtic Republicans belie Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, if they will, by claiming its Sanction to Schemes which have Falſhood, Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion and Uſurpation, for their Baſis—turning Faith into Faction, and the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of Peace, into an Engine of War and Sedition. We dare not thus prevaricate, or trifle with the living God; or handle his Word deceitfully.</p>
            <p>BUT on the other Hand, if Truth and Loyalty, if juſt Government and human Happineſs, are pleaſing to the Almighty and agreeable to his Will—and that they are ſo, we have the expreſs Declarations of his own unerring Word—If this, I ſay, be the Caſe, then we may humbly and confidently truſt that the juſt Ruler of the
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:015372_0020_0F98D2D6065A57C0"/>
Univerſe favours our Cauſe—that it hath HIS Approbation who is a God of Order.</p>
            <p>EVERY Motive that can animate the human Heart to a vigorous Exertion, now calls on you to ſtep forth with undaunted Reſolution.</p>
            <p>YOUR generous Efforts are required to aſſert the juſt Rights of your ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, inſulted Sovereign<note n="*" place="bottom">There is ſcarcely a Circumſtance attending the preſent unnatural Rebellion which can excite more Indignation in a generous Mind, than the inſolent Abuſe and ſcurrilous Invectives that are ſlung out, by the Abettors of it, againſt our gracious Sovereign: And yet his unparalleled Lenity has been one Cauſe of the Rebellion's gathering ſuch Strength. Averſe from ſhedding Blood—willing to try what Effects Forbearance would produce, and whether his deluded Subjects might not by Mildneſs, and their own Reflection, be brought to a Senſe of their Duty and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt; his Orders reſtrained his Troops and Ships of War here from acting offenſively, even after Hoſtilities had been commenced on the Part of the Rebels. Neceſſity at laſt compelled him to draw the Sword, when every other Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient to reſtore Peace, had failed of Succeſs. Through all the Stages of this unhappy Conteſt, he hath taken no Step in which he had not the Concurrence of his Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and numerous Precedents to guide him. He ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted no unconſtitutional Authority. A better Prince—a Prince of greater Virtue, or more exemplary Character, in public and private Life, or who deſired more earneſtly to promote the Happineſs of his Subjects, never adorned the Britiſh, or perhaps any other, Throne. To this Purpoſe is the Teſtimony of a judicious, impartial Foreigner,<note n="‡" place="bottom">M. DE PINTO.</note> who truly characteriſes him <q>A Monarch, known to be one of the moſt virtuous Men in his Kingdom; and a Sovereign the moſt pious and generous that ever filled the Throne.</q>
               </note>—a Sovereign whoſe numerous Virtues add Luſtre to his Throne; yet is abjured by thoſe

who owed him true Allegiance: They are required to reſtore your civil Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, which was formed by the Wiſdom of Ages, and was the Admiration and Envy of Mankind—under which we and our Anceſtors, enjoyed Liberty, Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Security; but is now ſubverted to make Room for—what?—for a motly Fabric, compoſed partly of the diſcordant Shreds of Heathen Republics, and perfectly adapted to popular Tyranny!</p>
            <p>YOUR bleeding Country, through which Deſtruction, Miſery and Ruin are now driving in full Career—from which, Peace, Order, Commerce and uſeful Induſtry are baniſhed—Your loyal Friends and Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives groaning in Bondage, under the Iron Scourge of Perſecution and Oppreſſion: All theſe now call upon you for Succour and Redreſs!</p>
            <p>IT is not wild, inſatiable Ambition, which riots in the Miſery and Spoils of others—which ſports with the Lives and Fortunes of Mankind, that leads you forth. You have taken up the Sword that thoſe who are Captives, for Conſcience Sake, may be ſet at Liberty, and that the Priſoner may go free—that Deſolation may be arreſted in its baneful Courſe, and fell Diſcord baniſhed from our Land. Driven

from your peaceful Habitations,<note n="*" place="bottom">The reſpectable Corps to which this Sermon was preached, is chiefly compoſed of Refugees, who fled from Perſecution. They were threatened with Bonds and Impriſonment, for refuſing to bear Arms againſt the King—nay, ſeveral of them broke out of Jail, where they were confined in Irons on that Account. They conſiſt of wealthy Farmers, or Yeomen, and their Sons. Many of the common Soldiers were poſſeſſed of Eſtates, worth from £.1000 to £.5000; and their Property has been moſtly confiſcated by the Rebels ſince their Flight. It is but Juſtice to ſay that thoſe new raiſed Troops have greatly diſtinguiſhed themſelves by their Bravery on ſeveral Occaſions.

               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:015372_0023_0F98D2D84474E650"/>
NOT only to your Boſoms, but to the Boſoms of Thouſands in every Province of this Continent, be the melancholly Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal for the Truth of theſe Facts—for the Truth of this Repreſentation: A Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation, in which many Circumſtances of the more attrocious and malignant Kind, are omitted. For I really mean not to kindle Reſentment; but to recommend Earneſtneſs, Fortitude and Perſeverance—ſuch as are founded upon Principle, and warranted by Reaſon and Humanity—ſuch, in ſhort, as the Importance and Juſtice of our Cauſe demand!</p>
            <p>HEAVEN forbid that I ſhould attempt to widen a Breach, which is too wide al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready; and which we ſhould all be anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly deſirous of healing. For they were not Enemies, our natural Foes, who oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned thoſe direful Scenes. They were Brethren and Fellow Subjects—thoſe who were cloſely connected, and endeared to us, by every ſocial Tie.</p>
            <p>WHILST therefore we lament their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatuation, and deplore the dreadful Effects it hath produced—whilſt we juſtly abhor their Principles and Proceedings, we ſhould reſolutely ſtep forth to ſnatch them and our Country from utter Ruin; and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:015372_0024_0F98D2D9C69A6E00"/>
to reſtore to them the Bleſſings of Peace and good Government.</p>
            <p>PEACE and Security are the Objects of every legitimate War; and no War can be juſtified longer than it is carried on for the Attainment of theſe. If this is the Caſe even in Foreign Wars; how much more ſhould it be ſo in a Conteſt with our deluded Countrymen! However criminal ſome of them have been; certain it is that Deception held up her falſe Mirror, and repreſented Things in a diſtorted Light to many more; and under the Influence of this Error, they act with miſguided Zeal. However infatuated they are; we ſhould ſtill remember they are our Brethren, and endeavour to reſtore Peace and Happineſs to them as well as to ourſelves. This is the Language of Humanity—of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of Jeſus; to which, I truſt, none of you will ever turn a deaf Ear.</p>
            <p>WITH ſuch Sentiments and Views as theſe—with ſuch a Cauſe, and ſuch Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders as you have: What is there to fear? What Boſom but muſt feel the warmeſt Glow of Ardour to be foremoſt in ſo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious an Enterprize!</p>
            <p>THUS circumſtanced as you are, every Obligation of Duty, Honour and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:015372_0025_0F98D2DA851E4D80"/>
—every generous Motive of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, Virtue, Religion and real Patriot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm—every Conſideration of Self-Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, Intereſt and Happineſs, unite to confirm you in your laudable Purpoſe—to animate your Zeal, and perſuade you to perſevere with unremiting Diligence and Ardour in obtaining theſe moſt important of all earthly Objects.</p>
            <p>LET this be the Caſe; and whilſt you are engaged in this noble Cauſe, beware of doing any Thing unworthy of it; or that would reflect Diſgrace on it, or on your Profeſſion. Avoid Intemperance, Profligacy and other debaſing Vices. Act up to the Dignity of your Character, as Soldiers, as Citizens, as Chriſtians. Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh a Spirit of Content, Subordination and Temperance. Reſolve to meet with Firmneſs, and to ſubmit with Patience to, the Fatigues and Difficulties of your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Station. Think not of the Blandiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Eaſe and Indulgence whilſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in Warfare—a Warfare which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be of long Continuance, and in which you are contending for every Thing that you hold dear or valuable on Earth. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence the Name of your Creator. Arch Angels bend in low Adoration, and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at that Name: Shall frail, ſinful Duſt and Aſhes then preſume to diſhonour it?
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:015372_0026_0F98D2DB44859BA8"/>
Shall thoſe eſpecially who are going forth in the Shadow of Death, profane it, and thereby inſult the Almighty?</p>
            <p>LET thoſe who command, ſet a virtuous Example before their Inferiors; and let thoſe under Authority, look up to that Example, and copy it in their Conduct. Cultivate the Temper, and aſpire after the Character, of the real Hero; in which Virtue, Magnanimity and Benevolence are neceſſary Ingredients. Superior Force may over-power, or conquer; but it is Bravery, joined to Humanity and Benevolence, that ſubdues the Heart, wins the Affections, and brings back the Miſguided to a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Senſe of their Duty.</p>
            <p>WHIST you thus ſerve your Country, and honour your King; forget not alſo to fear and ſerve your God. This will add peculiar Luſtre to the Soldier's Character; make the ſeveral Parts of his Duty more eaſy, and give him Vigour in diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.</p>
            <p>THE Judgments of God are now abroad, and his Hand lies heavy on our Land. Our Tranſgreſſions have provoked him to viſit us with ſevere Chaſtiſements: Theſe ſhould therefore awaken us from ſpiritual Slumber. We ſhould all humble our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves

before him, deprecate his Diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and turn to him with unfeigned Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and Reformation.</p>
            <p>WE ſhould earneſtly beſeech him to call back the Sword from deſtroying; and reſtore Peace, with its attendant Bleſſings, to our diſtracted Country. It is he that <q>ſtills the raging of the Sea, and the Madneſs of the People.</q> We ſhould therefore pray that he would remove the Deluſion of our miſguided Brethren, and turn their Hearts—that they may ſee the Evil and Error of their Ways, and know the Things which belong to their Peace, before it is too late.</p>
            <p>WE ſhould frequently ſupplicate the Throne of Grace for Bleſſings on our gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Sovereign—that he may be bleſſed with length of Days, and Increaſe of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs—that he may be defended againſt all his ſecret and open Enemies—that his benevolent Deſigns for the Welfare of his People may not be fruſtrated; but that he may fully accompliſh what is the Favourite Wiſh of his Heart—the Eſtabliſhment of Peace, Happineſs and conſtitutional Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in every Part of his Dominions.</p>
            <p>IMPRESSED deeply with theſe Sentiments—with all the Soldier, and all the Chriſtian
