            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE Court have taken the utmoſt pains to inveſtigate the ſubjects com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to them, and have expected that ſome perſons would have attended from Kentuckey, on the occaſion, as mentioned in your Excellency's letter of the 15th.—Finding no perſonal evidence come forward from that quarter, have this day cloſed their proceedings, and preſent to your Excellency their opinion as <hi>ſpecially directed.</hi>

                  <p>THE Court of which you are appointed Preſident, is ordered for the purpoſe of enquiring into the conduct of Brigadier General Harmar, the commanding officer upon the late expedition againſt the Miami Indians.</p>
                  <p>In the courſe of your inveſtigations, all the circumſtances of the campaign from the time the army departed, until it returned to Fort Waſhington, are to be taken into conſideration. Theſe will embrace the perſonal conduct of the General,—the organization of the army,—the orders of march, encampment and battle,—the motives which influenced the detachments of the 14th, the 19th and the 21ſt of October, and whether the ſaid detachments were duly ſupported, and if not, the reaſons which prevented the ſaid ſupport. The articles of war ſpecify, that Courts of Enquiry ſhall not give their opinion on the merits of any caſe; excepting they ſhall be ſpecially thereto required.— This ſeems to be one of the caſes in which an opinion is requiſite; you will therefore pleaſe, Sir, to take the opinion of the Court on all and every of the points above ſpecified, and convey the ſame to me when the Enquiry ſhall be cloſed.</p>
                  <p>Some evidences have been expected from Kentuckey—whether they will attend or not I cannot inform the Court; but the principal officers of the Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, who ſerved in the army of General Harmar, have had notice, that the Court would meet this day.—I have heard from none of them, excepting Lieutenant Colonel Trotter, who writes to me that his attendance is doubtful —that Colonel Hall is gone to the atlantic States, and he believes Colonel M'Mullen likewiſe.</p>
               </body>
            </floatingText>
            <p>Brigadier General Harmar being called upon for his Evidences, furniſhed the Court with a liſt of perſons, whereupon the Court ordered them to be ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned to attend.—The Court then adjourned to meet at 3 o'clock P. M.</p>

               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:023905_0005_0FC298670E645F38"/>Three o'clock P. M.—The Court met agreeably to adjournment.</p>
            <p>The Gentlemen who were ſummoned, not being ready to give in their evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, the Court adjourned to meet at 9 o'clock to-morrow morning.</p>
            <p>SEPTEMBER 16th.—The Court met agreeably to adjournment, and Major Ferguſon being called in and ſworn, depoſed as followeth:—That, ſome time about the 15th July, it was determined to carry on an expedition againſt the Miami villages. One thouſand militia from Kentuckey, and five hundred from Pennſylvania, with what could be collected of the 1ſt United States regiment, and one company of artillery, was to form the army. The militia from Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuckey began to aſſemble at Fort Waſhington about the middle of September; thoſe were very ill equipped, being almoſt deſtitute of camp kettles and axes; nor could a ſupply of theſe eſſential articles be procured. Their arms were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally very bad, and unfit for ſervice—that as he was the commanding officer of artillery, they came under his inſpection, in making what repairs the time would permit, and as a ſpecimen of their badneſs, he informed the Court, that a rifle was brought to be repaired without a lock, and another without a ſtock. That he aſked the owners what induced them to think, that thoſe guns could be repaired at that time? and they gave him for anſwer, that they were told in Kentuckey that all repairs would be made at Fort Waſhington. Many of the officers told him, that they had no idea of there being half the number of bad arms in the whole diſtrict of Kentuckey, as was then in the hands of their men. As ſoon as the principal part of the Kentuckey militia arrived, the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral began to organize them; in this he had many difficulties to encounter.— Colonel Trotter aſpired to the command, altho' Colonel Hardin was the eldeſt officer, and in this he was encouraged both by men and officers, who openly declared, unleſs Colonel Trotter commanded them, they would return home. After two or three days the buſineſs was ſettled, and they were formed into three battalions, under the command of Colonel Trotter, and Colonel Hardin had the command of all the militia. As ſoon as they were arranged, they were muſtered; croſſed the Ohio, and on the 26th, marched and encamped about ten miles from Fort Waſhington. The laſt of the Pennſylvania militia arrived on the 25th September.—Theſe were equipped nearly as the Kentuckey, but were worſe armed, ſeveral were without any. The General ordered all the arms in ſtore to be delivered to thoſe who had none, and thoſe whoſe guns could not be repaired.—Amongſt the militia were a great many hardly able to bear arms, ſuch as old infirm men, and young boys; they were not ſuch as might be expected from a frontier country, viz. the ſmart active woodſman, well accuſtomed to arms, eager and alert to revenge the injuries done them, and their connections. No—there were a great number of them <hi>ſubſtitutes,</hi> who probably had never fired a gun. Major Paul, of Pennſylvania, told him, that many of his men were ſo aukward, that they could not take their gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks off to oil them, and put them on again, nor could they put in their flints ſo as to be uſeful, and even of ſuch materials, the numbers came far ſhort of what was ordered, as may be ſeen by the returns. That on the 31ſt September, the General, with the continental troops, marched from Fort Waſhington, to join Colonel Hardin, who had advanced into the country, for the ſake of feed for the cattle, and to open the road for the artillery. On the 3d October, the whole army joined, and was arranged in order of march, encampment, and battle; theſe would appear by the orderly-book, with this difference in the encampment, the ſpace they were to occupy, when in order of battle, which was to be open, was always to be filled up with their fires, nor was any intervals to be left between battalions. This was done to prevent in ſome meaſure the cattle and horſes from getting out of camp; and the centinels round camp had orders not to let the cattle or horſes paſs out after dark, juſt before which time they were brought within their fires. Thoſe precautions, aided by the care and induſtry of Mr. Wells and his aſſiſtants, ſucceeded well in preventing loſs
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:023905_0006_0FC2986884C64658"/>
of cattle—he was informed there were only two oxen loſt from the time the whole army took up the line of march, until it returned to Fort Waſhington;— but he was ſorry to ſay, it was not the caſe of the pack-horſes, the generality of the people employed in that department were ignorant of their duty, indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and inactive; nor was it in the power of the General to remedy theſe defects.—The ſhortneſs of the time for aſſembling and organizing the army, put it out of his power to look about and ſelect fit characters, he was of courſe obliged to take thoſe that offered.—After he was in the woods it was out of his power to exchange them for better, and puniſhments for neglect of duty was out of the queſtion. The principles upon which the horſes were employed, induced the drivers who were chiefly parties in the buſineſs, to loſe and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways deſtroy them, rather than return them to their owners; by this means the proprietors had a high appraiſement paid them for their horſes, and daily pay for ſervices, until they were loſt; by adding to the above the negligence of centinels, he accounted for the number of horſes loſt, which in his opinion it was out of General Harmar's power to prevent.—After the army was arranged, they continued their march without any material occurrence, until the 13th, when the horſe fell in with two Indians, and took one of them priſoner, who informed that the Indians were not in force at the Maumee village.—This day they reached a place called the <hi>French Store,</hi> at which place a Frenchman, who was then with the General as a guide had lived. He informed that the village was about ten leagues diſtant. From this place, on the morning of the 14th Colonel Hardin was detached with 600 men, to endeavor to ſurpriſe the Miami village; the army moved at the ſame time, and although it rained the whole day, they continued their march with diligence until late.—The horſe were ordered to be tied up this night, to enable the army to move early the next day, which it did. This diligence of the army on its march induced him to believe, the General was endeavoring to guard againſt any diſaſter that might happen to Colonel Hardin, which he was of opinion would have been in his power; for Colonel Hardin had not gained more than four miles of the army, on the firſt day's march.—On the 17th, the army arrived at the Miami village; here were evident ſigns of the enemy having quitted the place in the greateſt confuſion. Indian dogs and cows came into their camp this day, which induced to believe the families were not far off.—A party of 300 men, with three days proviſion, under the command of Colonel Trotter, was ordered as he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, to examine the country around their camp, but contrary to the General's orders returned the ſame evening.—This conduct of the Colonel's, did not meet the General's approbation, and Colonel Hardin, anxious for the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his countrymen, wiſhed to have the command of the ſame detachment for the remaining two days, which was given him.—This command marched on the morning of the 19th, and was the ſame day ſhamefully defeated.— Colonel Hardin told him that the number which attacked him, did not exceed 150, and that had his people fought, or even made a ſhew of forming to fight, he was certain the Indians would have run. But on the Indians firing, which was at a great diſtance, the militia ran, numbers throwing away their arms, nor could he ever rally them; Major Ray confirmed the ſame. He did not know what influenced the detachment on the 21ſt. But from the enemy being fluſhed with ſucceſs on the 19th, it became neceſſary if in his power to give them a check, to prevent the army from being harraſſed on its return; which they might have done, will readily be granted by every one who has the leaſt knowledge of the Indians, and an army encumbered with cattle and pack-horſes, much worn down; and altho' the detachment was not ſo fortunate, as was reaſonably to have been expected, yet, he firmly believed it prevented the Savages from annoying their rear, as they never made their appearance after. With reſpect to ſupporting that detachment, which conſiſted of four hundred choſen troops, he always believed them ſuperior to one hundred and fifty Indians, which was the greateſt number as yet diſcovered, had it not been
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:023905_0007_0FC29869F98F4678"/>
for miſconduct and diſobedience of orders by the officers who were on the command. He underſtood that Major Ray's battalion had been advanced to cover them, which was as many as could poſſibly have been ſpared, taking into view, that thoſe in camp could not be depended on, and many were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out arms, having thrown them away. To ſupport with the whole army, was impracticable; the pack-horſes, being weak and greatly reduced in numbers. The artilery horſes very much reduced, and unable to undergo much more fatigue, but at the certain loſs of the artillery; as it was, they were obliged to ſend to Fort Waſhington for horſes to aſſiſt in hauling it in. The march of the army was regular and well conducted, as was poſſible to be done with militia. With reſpect to the General's conduct, report ſays, that he was intoxicated all the campain, and unable to execute the important duties of his ſtation; he had mentioned his commanding the artillery, which was poſted at the head of the centre column, and here the General chiefly was during the march, of courſe he had an opportunity of ſeeing, and being with him through the day; in the morning he received his orders from him, and when they halted to encamp, he chiefly pointed out the ground where the artillery ſhould be poſted; his duty called him often to his tent, before they marched in the morning, and after they halted in the evening, in ſhort, had he been given to drunkenneſs, he had as good an opportunity of ſeeing it, as any other officer in the army. —Yet he declared, that from their leaving Fort Waſhington, until their return, he never ſaw General Harmar intoxicated, or ſo as to render him unfit for the execution of any duties.—In him, and his abilities, as an officer, he placed the greateſt confidence, never doubting in his orders, but obeying with chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, being conſcious they were the production of experience and ſound judgment.</p>
            <p>Queſtion 1ſt. <hi>By the Court.</hi>—What were your reaſons for thinking puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for neglect of duty, out of the queſtion?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. The ſtate of the army being ſuch, that it obliged the General not to do any thing that would tend to irritate the militia.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>By the Court.</hi> Is it your opinion that the organization of the army was a judicious one, ſuch a one as was well calculated for the ſecurity of the troops?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. It is my opinion, that it was the moſt judicious organization that could be made, and calculated for the intereſt of the United States.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>By the Court.</hi> Is it your opinion, that the order of encampment was a judicious one, and that the extreme parts were ſo diſpoſed as were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated to give ſecurity to the army and its appendages?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. I think no better diſpoſition could have been made.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>By the Court.</hi> Do you think the order of battle calculated ſo as to have been eaſy of execution and eaſily formed?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. I think it was the beſt that could have been formed, and well cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated for covering the appendages of the army.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>By the Court.</hi> Do you know the General's motives for making the detachments of the 14th, 19th and 21ſt October?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. I do not know the General's motives for making the detachment of the 14th, but I ſuppoſe it was for the purpoſe of ſurprizing the <hi>Maumee</hi> village, as we had taken an Indian the day before, who gave us information, that the Indians were in great confuſion there, and that they were not in force, and very much divided in their councils. We expected to ſurprize them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſeperated.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>By the Court.</hi> What were the movements of the army after that detachment was made?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. We continued our march next day until an expreſs arrived to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us that the Indians had evacuated the village, when we halted.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>By the Court.</hi> What was the diſtance between the main body and the detachment?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:023905_0008_0FC29870A41CEF20"/>Anſwer About four miles.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>By the Court.</hi> Do you think that the army was within ſupporting diſtance when that detachment was made?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. On the firſt day we were.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>By the Court.</hi> Do you know what induced the General to make the detachment of the 19th?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. The day preceding that on which the detachment was made, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian dogs and cattle came into our camp, which led us to believe the Indians were near us, more eſpecially as they had left their village in ſuch haſte. I ſuppoſe it was for the purpoſe of examining the country around the camp. A detachment of 300 men under the command of Col. Trotter, with three days proviſion, was made on the 18th, with orders to continue out three days, but which nevertheleſs returned into camp the ſame evening. The General ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared diſpleaſed at their diſobedience of orders; Col. Hardin wiſhing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieve the character of the militia, aſked the General's permiſſion to take out the ſame detachment on the 19th, which was granted.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>By the Court.</hi> What motives led Col. Hardin at ſuch a diſtance as 15 miles from camp?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. I underſtood that he got on the trails of the Indians, and that he had diſcovered an Indian on horſeback, about one mile from where he fell in with their main body.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>By the Court.</hi> Upon hearing of the defeat of that detachment, did you underſtand that the General ordered any ſupport?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. I don't know that he did, the firſt intelligence of the defeat was brought us by thoſe who were defeated, late in the evening.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>By the Court.</hi> Do you know the motives for the detachment of the 21ſt, either from the General himſelf or any of his confidential officers?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. I do not know from the General, but it was my opinion, as well as that of other officers, that the defeat of the 19th had ſo panick ſtruck the army, that had the Indians attacked on the retreat, it might have been loſt, which induced the General to ſend the detachment in the rear.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>By the Court.</hi> Had the General ordered another detachment upon the ground, where the defeat of the 19th happened; do you think the Militia would have gone, or would they have mutinied?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. I am rather inclined to think they would not have gone.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>By the Court.</hi> With reſpect to the general conduct of General Harmar in the courſe of the campaign, is it your opinion that it was judicious, and in every reſpect commendable?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. I do think it was perfectly ſo; I have the greateſt confidence in, and good opinion of his military abilities.</p>
            <p>Captain <hi>Strong</hi> being ſworn, depoſed—That he knew of no circumſtance during the whole campaign that could in his opinion, affect the military cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the General.—That the organization of the army, appeared to his judgment, extremely judicious, and ſuch he believed was the general opinion of the officers.—That the order of march ſeemed to him no leſs judicious, and military in all parts—that the order of encampment and battle, met if he miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took not, with the approbation of every officer able to judge of it—that the motives which influenced the detachments of the 14th, 19th and 21ſt October, appeared to him to be a queſtion that could only be anſwered by the General, or perhaps by his confidential officers, or thoſe more immediately attached to his perſon—that he had reaſon to believe, that thoſe detachments were not properly ſupported, but it was his opinion at the ſame time, that the fault lay not with the General, who had given orders in each caſe, that were not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with, at leaſt until it was too late.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>By the Court.</hi> With reſpect to ſupport in the action of the 21ſt, was there any ſupport ordered that you know of?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:023905_0009_0FC74445805ACE18"/>Anſwer. I was preſent when the order was given to Major <hi>Ray</hi> to move with his battalion to ſupport Major <hi>Wyllys.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>By the Court.</hi> Do you know what diſtance they marched for that purpoſe, or how long they were gone from the army?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. I do not recollect perfectly how long, but I think it was not long.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>By General Harmar.</hi> Is it your opinion that the making the detachment under Major <hi>Wyllys</hi> was attended with good conſequences to the army, or not?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. I think it was attended with uſeful conſequences to the army.</p>
            <p>The Court then adjourned to 3 o'clock P. M.</p>
            <p>Three o'clock P. M.—The Court having met agreeable to adjournment—</p>
            <p>Lieutenant <hi>Hartſhorn</hi> was ſworn, and depoſed—That he knew of no cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances during the whole campaign that could in his opinion affect the military conduct of the General—that the organization of the army appeared to his judgment extremely judicious, and ſuch he believed was the general opinion of the officers—that the order of march ſeemed to him no leſs judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and military in all its parts—that the order of encampment and battle, met if he miſtook not with the approbation of every officer able to judge of it— that the motives which influenced the detachments of the 14th, 19th and 21ſt of October, appeared to him to be a queſtion, that could only be anſwered by the General, and perhaps by his confidential officers, or thoſe more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately attached to his perſon—that as to the queſtion of ſupport, he had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to believe the detachment was not properly ſupported, but it was his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion at the ſame time, that the fault lays not with the General, who had given orders in each caſe, that was not complied with at leaſt until it was too late.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>By the Court.</hi> Do you know, Sir, in the courſe of the campaign, from the time the army left Fort Waſhington, until its return to that place, any circumſtance that could militate againſt the military character of the General?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. I know of none.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>By the Court.</hi> Do you know of any unneceſſary delays?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. None at all, far from it, every thing was done to get forward the army.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>By the Court.</hi> Does any inſtance of inebriety in the General, come within your knowledge during the courſe of the campaign?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. I know of none.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>By the Court.</hi> So far as you are a judge of the organization of the army, do you think it was proper and judicious?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. So far as I could judge, I think it was extremely judicious.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>By the Court.</hi> Had you any converſation with the officers of the army on the ſubject of the organization of the army?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. I had, and with thoſe who I think were judges, who thought it to be very good.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>By the Court.</hi> Did the arrangement of march appear to be ſo connected, as to be able to ſupport each other in caſe of attack?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. I think it did, and ſeemed no leſs judicious and military in all its parts.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>By the Court.</hi> Did the extreme parts of the encampment appear to be ſo formed, as to be competent to cover the main body of the army in caſe of attack by the enemy?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. Perfectly ſo.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>By the Court.</hi> Was you in the firſt engagement of the army?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. I was in the action of the 19th October.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>By the Court.</hi> Was you in the detachment of the 14th?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. I was not.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>By the Court.</hi> Did the order of battle on the 19th appear to you to be a judicious one?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:023905_0010_0FC29883522A3138"/>Anſwer. I think it was not a judicious one.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>By the Court.</hi> Who was the officer who commanded the troops in that action?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. Colonel <hi>Hardin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>By the Court.</hi> In what manner did you attack the enemy, was it in columns, or did you diſplay in any regular order?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. We were attacked in front of columns.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>By the Court.</hi> When you were attacked, were you ordered to diſplay, or form in any regular order?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. No.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>By the Court.</hi> In what manner did you oppoſe the enemy when you were attacked?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. By endeavouring to form the line to charge them.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>By the Court.</hi> What troops came within your notice that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to form when charged?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. Not more than 30 federal troops and 10 militia.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>By the Court.</hi> How many militia had you?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. I don't know.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>By the Court.</hi> What became of the reſt of the militia?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. They gave way and ran.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. Do you think that if the militia in that action had been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly formed and in time, that they would have been ſufficient to have beat the enemy?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. They were.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>By the Court.</hi> Do you know the motives for making the detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the 14th?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. It was ſuppoſed for the purpoſe of gaining the <hi>Maumee</hi> village before the Indians left it, as we were informed they were preparing to leave it.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>By the Court.</hi> Is that your own opinion?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. It is, and was the general opinion in camp.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>By the Court.</hi> What was the reſult of the action of the 19th, were the continental troops and the 10 militia defeated?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. They were cut to pieces except 6 or 7.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>By the Court.</hi> Do you know from Head Quarters, or from any principal officers of the army, what were the motives for making the detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the 19th?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. It was for the purpoſe of overtaking a party of Indians, whoſe trails had been diſcovered.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>By the Court.</hi> Was there any attempt made to ſupport that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment from the main body?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. Not that I know of.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>By the Court.</hi> What was the diſtance between the main body of the army and the detachment attacked?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. Fourteen or fifteen miles.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>By the Court.</hi> From the conduct of the militia, do you think that the General had a right to expect any great ſupport from them, if he had been attacked?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. I don't think he had.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>By the Court.</hi> Was you in the action of the 21ſt?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. I was not.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>By the Court.</hi> Do you know the motives for making the detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the 21ſt?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. It was for the purpoſe of ſeeing if any Indians were in the village.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>By General Harmar.</hi> Did you not think, that the detachment ſent back under Major <hi>Wyllys</hi> competent to engage any body of the enemy?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. It was ſufficient for any body of Indians in that country.</p>

               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:023905_0011_0FC29884E930C4F0"/>Queſtion. <hi>By General Harmar.</hi> To what cauſe was it owing, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment did not ſucceed ſo perfectly as I could have wiſhed for?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. Becauſe they did not obey your orders, they did not march at the time they were directed.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>By General Harmar.</hi> Upon the firſt intelligence do you recollect any ſupport I ordered?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. I recollect you ordered a battalion, I think under Major <hi>Ray.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Enſign <hi>Morgan</hi> being ſworn, depoſed, as followeth—That as he did not join the army under the command of General Harmar until the 13th October, he was unacquainted with its progreſs until that time, when the army appeared in good order. As he was an enſign, and carried the ſtandard every fourth or fifth day after his joining the army, he was frequently near the General, and always obſerved, as far as he could judge, the greateſt propriety of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.—As to the organization of the army, the order of march, encampment and battle, they are perfectly explained in the general orders—As to the motives which influenced the General in ſending out the different detachments of the 14th, 19th and 21ſt, he was unacquainted—the opinion he took up concerning the one of the 14th was, that the General finding the army diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, reſolved to make a puſh for the towns before they were abandoned, and as he could not do it with his whole army formed the detachment on the 14th under Colonel Hardin; the motive for the detachment on the 19th he was utterly unacquainted with, that of the 21ſt as he ſuppoſed, was to pick up any ſtraggling Indians who might have come to the towns, to ſee what they had been about, but without an idea of the Indians being in force.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>By the Court.</hi> Do you think that the party of militia that were attached to Major <hi>Wyllys'</hi> detachment, was ſufficient to have defeated the Indians if they had done their duty?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. If they had been together, I think they were.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>By the Court.</hi> What time did you return to the army from the action of the 21ſt?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. About 5 o'clock P. M. The action commenced ſoon after day-light.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>By the Court.</hi> Did you ſee any thing of the detachment under Major <hi>Ray</hi> on your return?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. I ſaw only a party 3 miles from camp, under Captain <hi>Craig</hi> that were going to our ſupport.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>By the Court.</hi> What was the diſpoſition of the militia after you returned to the army, were they well affected to the ſervice and orderly?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. I think they were very diſorderly, and very inattentive to their duty, and ſome appearances of mutiny among them, with both officers and men, and turned out upon one occaſion particularly, to oppoſe a puniſhment that had been ordered by the General.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>By the Court.</hi> Do you remember any thing of General <hi>Harmar</hi>'s ordering his cannon to fire upon them?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. I remember that General <hi>Harmar</hi> once ſaid, that if the militia behaved again, in ſo ſcandalous a manner, that he would order his cannon to fire on them.</p>
            <p>Enſign <hi>Britt</hi> being ſworn, depoſed—That with reſpect to the perſonal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of General <hi>Harmar,</hi> he knew that he was indefatigable in making arrangements for the execution of the plans which had been formed for the expedition; and he alſo knew that the difficulties were great which the General had to encounter in organizing the militia, and in endeavouring to eſtabliſh that harmony, which was wanting in their commanding officers Colonels <hi>Hardin</hi> and <hi>Trotter;</hi> which he accompliſhed apparently to their ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction—that he was at all times diligent in attending to the conduct of the officers in the different departments of the army, and that he was always ready to attend to ſuch occurrences, as were conſequent to the ſame, and the

neceſſary exertions to have his orders carried into execution were not wanting; but that there were great deficiencies on the part of the militia, either owing to the want of authority in ſome of their officers, or from their ignorance or inattention—that the generality of them, ſcarcely deſerved the name of any thing like ſoldiers—that they were moſtly <hi>ſubſtitutes</hi> for others, who had nothing to ſtimulate them to do their duty—that as to the diſpoſitions for the order of march, form of encampment, and order of battle, they were matters which he being a young officer could ſay little about; he preſumed they would anſwer for themſelves—that the General's motives for detaching Colonel <hi>Hardin</hi> on the 14th October when they were told they were but 10 leagues from the Indian towns, he ſuppoſed to be, from information they received by a priſoner who was taken on the 13th, that the Indians at the <hi>Maumee</hi> village were in great conſternation and confuſion, and the proſpects were, they might be eaſily defeated if found in that ſituation—that in order to ſupport this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment, the horſes of the army were ordered to be tied up at night, ſo that the whole army might be ready to march early in the morning, which was done accordingly, and that when Colonel <hi>Hardin</hi> reached the village, the main body was not more than 5 or 6 miles in his rear—that the detachment under Colonel <hi>Trotter</hi> was ordered to reconnoitre for 3 days the neighbourhood, to endeavour to find out the Savages, who had fled from their towns—that this party returned the evening of the ſame day they ſtarted, and next morning Colonel <hi>Hardin</hi> marched with the ſame party and fell in with the Indians—that an engagement enſued, in which he was routed, owing to the cowardly beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of the militia under his command—that the motives which he conceived led to detaching the party under Major <hi>Wyllys</hi> on the 21ſt were, that the Indians having avoided engaging the whole army, would collect at their towns, and harraſs the rear and flanks, as much as poſſible on its return, and a ſtroke at them before they could aſſemble in large bodies, would prevent their doing it with much effect—that the party accordingly met with the Indians, and a battle followed in which numbers were killed on both ſides— that the moment the news of this arrived in camp Major <hi>Ray</hi> with his batta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of Kentuckey militia, was ordered to march to the ſupport of Major <hi>Wyllys,</hi> but that he did not proceed far before he returned.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>By the Court.</hi> Did you at any time in the courſe of the campaign perceive that General <hi>Harmar</hi> was intoxicated?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. I did not, I lived in the General's family and ſhould have known it, had any thing of that kind happened.</p>
            <p>Doctor <hi>Alliſon</hi> being ſworn, depoſed—That the organization of the army, the orders of march, encampment and battle, were queſtions which would be more amply anſwered by a reference to the orderly book, than they could be from the mere relation of an individual, or from any other official information—that as to the motives which influenced the detachments of the 14th, 19th and 21ſt October, thoſe were queſtions, which if anſwered at all, muſt be merely ſpeculative opinions, which it was not always prudent to divulge, nor would they in his judgment, be admitted as evidence, or even peruſed by any tribunal, and therefore were nugatory, and as he had not the honour of being in the cabinet, it was utterly out of his power to give any other—that as ſoon as the news arrived of the misfortune of the third detachment, a reinforcement was immediately ordered by the General, but whether it actually ſet out, or what induced it to return, he could not ſay, or whether ſufficiently ſtrong, he did not conceive himſelf a judge. His ſituation as ſurgeon, prevented a minute attention to every, or indeed any of the arrangements of the army; yet, as far as they came within his view, or knowledge, they were judicious and uniform, that every attention was paid to the army by the General in every ſituation, that every ſtep was taken by him, that prudence and military knowledge could ſuggeſt, the circumſtances of the army would permit, or that neceſſity required.</p>

A great many of their guns wanted repairs, and as they could not put them in order, our artificers were obliged to be employed, a conſiderable number came without any guns at all—Kentuckey ſeemed as if ſhe wiſhed to comply with the requiſitions of Government, as ineffectually as poſſible, for it was evident that about two thirds of the men ſerved only to ſwell their numbers— 19th September a ſmall detachment of Pennſylvania militia arrived, and the 25th of September Major <hi>Doughty</hi> with two companies of federal troops joined them from Muſkingum—Governor <hi>St. Clair</hi> had arrived from New-York the 22d, and the remains of the Pennſylvania militia came on the 25th. The militia laſt mentioned were ſimilar to the other, <hi>too many ſubſtitutes.</hi> The General loſt no time in organizing them, tho' he met with many difficulties— the colonels were diſputing for the command, and the one moſt popular was leaſt intituled to it. The General's deſign was to reconcile all parties, which he accompliſhed after much trouble. The Kentuckians compoſed three battalions, under the Majors <hi>Hall, M'Mullen</hi> and <hi>Ray,</hi> with Lieutenant Colonel Commandant <hi>Trotter</hi> at their head. The Pennſylvanians were formed into one battalion under Lieutenant Colonel <hi>Trubley,</hi> and Major <hi>Paul,</hi> the whole to be commanded by Colonel <hi>John Hardin,</hi> jubject to the orders of General <hi>Harmar</hi>— That on the 26th September the militia marched on the rout towards the Indian towns—the 30th the General having got forward all the ſupplies that he expected, he moved out with the federal troops, formed into two ſmall battalions under the immediate command of Major <hi>Wyllys</hi> and Major <hi>Doughty,</hi> together with Captain <hi>Ferguſon's</hi> company of artillery, and three pieces of ordnance. On the 3d of October General <hi>Harmar</hi> joined the advanced troops early in the morning, the remaining part of the day was ſpent in forming the line of march, the order of encampment and battle, and explaining the ſame to the militia field officers. General <hi>Harmar's</hi> orders will ſhew the ſeveral formations. On the 4th the army took up the order of march as is deſcribed in the orders.

The line of march was certainly one of the beſt that could be adopted, and great attention was paid to keep the officers with their commands in proper order, and the pack-horſes, &amp;c. as compact as poſſible. The order of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>campment appeared to be well calculated, not only for defence, but to preſerve
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:023905_0014_0FC298964CC99AF8"/>
the horſes and cattle from being loſt; however, notwithſtanding every pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution was taken, and repeated orders given to the horſe-maſters, to hopple well their horſes, and directions to the officers and men not to ſuffer any to paſs through the lines, many of them, owing to the careleſsneſs of the militia, and the ſcarcity of food, (tho' great attention was paid in the choice of ground) broke looſe and ſtrayed thro' the lines after night, and even paſſed the chain of ſentries which encircled the camp and were loſt. Patroles of horſemen were ordered out every morning by day-light, to ſcour the neighbouring woods, and to bring in any horſes that might have broke through the lines, and a ſtanding order directed the pickets to turn out ſmall parties, and drive in every horſe. This was done he believed, to expedite the movement of the army. There was no leſs attention paid to ſecuring the cattle, every evening when the army halted, the guard which was compoſed of a commiſſioned officer and thirty or thirty-five men, built a yard always within the chain of ſentries, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the ſquare of encampment, and placed a ſufficient number of ſentries round the encloſure, which effectually preſerved them, there was not more than two or three head loſt during the whole of the campaign—On the 13th of October early in the morning a patrole of horſemen captured a Shawanee Indian—On the 14th October Colonel Hardin was detached with 600 light troops to puſh for the Miami village, he believed that this detachment was ſent forward in conſequence of the intelligence gained of the Shawanee priſoner, which was, that the Indians were clearing out as faſt as poſſible, and that if they did not make more haſte, the towns would be evacuated before their arrival. As it was impoſſible for the main body of the army, with all their train, to haſten their march much, the General thought proper to ſend on Colonel Hardin in hopes of taking a few, before they would all get off. This night the horſes were all ordered to be tied up, that the army might ſtart by day-light, on purpoſe to keep as near Colonel Hardin as poſſible, the diſtance to the Indian towns when the detachment marched a-head was about thirty-five miles—On the 15th every exertion was uſed to get forward the main body this day, they found that the advanced party had gained but very few miles—On the 16th in the evening met an expreſs from Colonel Hardin who had got into the village, informing the General that the enemy had abandoned every place. On the 17th about noon, the army arrived at the Omee towns—On the 18th Col. Trotter was ordered out with three hundred men, militia and regulars, to reconnoitre the country, and to endeavour to make ſome diſcoveries of the enemy; he marched but a few miles, when his advanced horſemen came upon two Indians and killed them; the Colonel was contented with this victory and returned to camp. Colonel Hardin was diſpleaſed becauſe Colonel Trotter did not execute his orders, and requeſted the General to give him the command of the party, it was granted, and accordingly Hardin marched next morning, but he believed he had not two thirds of his number when two miles from camp, for to his certain knowledge, many of the militia left him on the march and returned to their companies. Whether he knew it or not he could not tell, but that he proceeded on with a determination to trace ſome freſh ſigns of the enemy—he believed the plan was merely to gain ſome knowledge of the Savages. He at length came upon a party not exceeding one hundred, but was worſted, owing entirely as he was informed to the ſcandalous behaviour of the militia, many of whom never fired a ſhot, but ran off at the firſt noiſe of the Indians, and left the few regulars to be ſacrificed, ſome of them never halted until they croſſed the Ohio. The army in the mean time was employed burning and deſtroying the houſes and corn, ſhifting their poſition from one town to another—that on the 21ſt of October the army having burned five villages, beſides the capital town, and conſumed or deſtroyed near twenty thouſand buſhels of corn in ears, took up the line of march on the rout back to Fort Waſhington and encamped about 8 miles from the ruins—that about nine o'clock P. M. the General ordered out 400 choice men, militia and regulars,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:023905_0015_0FC29897C2190490"/>
under the command of Major Wyllys to return to the towns, intending to ſurprize any parties, that might be aſſembled there, ſuppoſing that the Indians would collect to ſee how things were left. The General had felt the enemy, knew their ſtrength, and calculated much upon the ſucceſs of this enterprize— that it was the general opinion the force of the Savages was nothing equal to this detachment, and unleſs by ſome ſuch means, there was no poſſibility of getting any advantage of them, however the beſt laid plan was in ſome meaſure defeated, by the diſobedience of the militia, who ran in purſuit of ſmall parties, and left Major Wyllys unſupported—the conſequence was, that the Major with moſt part of the regulars were killed, and our loſs was equal if not greater than the ſavages—that the intention of this detachment was evident to all the army, and would have anſwered the fulleſt expectations, provided a due obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience had been obſerved on the part of the militia—to provide againſt diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of orders was what he believed no one would think of, and had it not been the caſe the Major in his opinion might have returned crowned with laurels. That the main body waited for the return of this detachment but to their mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification about eleven o'clock A. M. of the 22d a fellow who ran back from the field, gave them information of Major Wylly's misfortune—General Harmar immediately diſpatched Major Ray with his battalion to the aſſiſtance of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but the Major did not get the length, before he met Colonel Hardin return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to camp with his wounded. He was led to believe that about this time, the General loſt the confidence he had in the militia, thoſe of them among the dead, were of the beſt men, that the effective ſtrength was very much reduced by ſickneſs and otherways—the regular troops did not furniſh more than two hundred they were in his opinion very inſufficient, and he was alſo clearly of opinion, that had the enemy made an attack upon their camp that evening or the morning following, the militia were ſo panick ſtruck that very few of them would have ſtood, the conſequences that would have happened, ſtared every perſon with horror, the ſick and wounded, and all the ſtores, artillery, &amp;c. would have fallen a prey to the ſavages—that this was alſo the opinion of ſeveral of the principal officers who adviſed General Harmar of the danger of attempting to return to the towns, from the time it would take up, and the probability that the delay would give the ſavages time to collect from diſtant quarters. He obſerved that the 22d October was employed in fixing biers for the wounded, and in making repairs. He alſo obſerved that the froſt had deſtroyed the food early on their march out and that the horſes of the army were now become very much reduced, ſo much ſo, that it was utterly impoſſible for the main body to perform any thing rapidly, and to get back upon the road which they had ſo lately paſſed, was attended with difficulty, he ſaid that the greateſt attention was paid, the little army was kept compact, and vigilance was the word from all who had any reputation to loſe—That the militia on their return began to be refractory, ſhewing great ſigns of a revolt, diſcharging their pieces in open defiance of the general orders, ſome of them however were detected and puniſhed, which gave umbrage and was afterwards the cauſe of many ill-natured reports, ſpread without any foundation, to injure the General's reputation. He further obſerved that the army returned by ſlow marches, back to Fort Waſhington—That General Harmar's conduct during the campaign, was obſerved to be ſober, ſteady, and attentive to the ſervice, and as his duty required him to be frequently near the General, ſhould certainly have diſcovered it, had he been at any time intoxicated, as has been reported. Every evening as duly as the army halted, the General made his remarks for that day, and iſſued orders for the movement and arrangements for the next, and every morning he was found among the firſt prepared for the field.</p>

            <p>SEPTEMBER 20th.—The Court having met according to adjournment—</p>
            <p>Major <hi>Ziegler</hi> being ſworn, depoſed,—That ſome time had elapſed before the different corps and battalions could be organized, on account of rank—the militia officers diſputing for the command; and after a good deal of exertion by General Harmar, they commenced their march on the 30th September 1790. The militia under Colonel Hardin, having been ſent on a few days before, and on the 3d October, they joined the militia, and took up their line of march, and encamped as mentioned in the General's orders. He obſerved that the orders of march and encampment, motions, &amp;c. &amp;c. were ſuch as would have done honor to the firſt officers either in America or Europe. All neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary precautions were obſerved to gain the point General Harmar ſet out for. On the 14th October he was ordered to advance with Colonel Hardin com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding 50 rank and file of the federal troops, being part of ſix hundred men—at ten o'clock they took up their march, and before they left the ground the reſt of the army was ordered to parade and follow them, which he remembered to have ſeen the army from an eminence, as he inclined towards the left, with the column to which he was attached. The 15th about three o'clock P. M. they arrived at the Miami villages, and at the ſame time Colonel Hardin ſent an expreſs to General Harmar, to inform him that the villages were evacuated. It was his opinion that the motives for this manoeuvre was in conſequence of a <hi>Shewanuſe</hi> which they took a few days before, and who acquainted the General that the Indians were ready to move away, the army arrived the 17th—in the forenoon and that day as well as the reſt they were all buſy in deſtroying the Indian corn, &amp;c. &amp;c. He further obſerved that on the 18th Colonel Trotter was detached with three hundred men of militia, including thirty federal troops, but that the Colonel returned the ſame day without bringing any information, and that on the morning following, Colonel Hardin took command of the ſame party, and advanced to procure ſome knowledge of the enemy, and on his diſcovering the enemy thoſe which were in the rear would not come up and ſupport thoſe engaged in front, and very few of thoſe in front, ſtopped but ran and the militia fled in a ſhameful manner, and the few federal troops not ſupported, fell a ſacrifice; the Major ſaid that a ſerjeant of militia behaving very improper at that time, could not be bro't to trial, on account of a brother of his being a captain, and who made parties that would have been attended with bad conſequences, ſhould he be puniſhed, as his brother declared he would raiſe ſome men, and bid defiance. That, on the 21ſt October 1790, after they had deſtroyed a great quantity of corn and five or ſix villages, they took up their line of march towards Fort Waſhington, and at night Major Wyllys was detached with four hundred choice men, in hopes to ſurprize a body that might be at the ruins— this party was ſuppoſed to be ſufficiently ſtrong for any number of the enemy embodied. Major Wyllys marched in three columns with intention to join with the right and left columns, at the Miami village, but that the column under the command of Major M'Mullen fell in with a ſmall party of Indians, they followed them and diſobeyed the orders of Major Wyllys, in purſuing them and leaving the others unſupported, and ſo was the left wing, which would not have been if they had joined him, as he ſuppoſed it to be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently ſtrong for that party. He alſo remembered very well being on picket, or commanding one of the wings as captain <hi>au Carrée,</hi> when the firſt men arrived with the intelligence, that their party had gained ground—and at that very inſtant General Harmar ordered Major Ray with his battalion to the aſſiſtance of thoſe engaged, leaſt that information ſhould not prove true, but he went two miles or two and a half then meeting the ſcattered detachment, returned to the great ſurprize of General Harmar—that the ſucceſs of the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:023905_0017_0FC2989FF7C56F70"/>
detachment was defeated in a great meaſure by the militia running a-head, and leaving Major Wyllys unſupported.—The army remained this day in dreſſing and fixing the wounded—the militia behaving ſo bad in ſeveral inſtances, deſtroyed every confidence the General had in them, otherwiſe he would have returned with the army, but as things were ſituated, it would have been running too great a hazard. The army returned back to Fort Waſhing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, nothing appeared wanting on the part of the General, every attention was paid to the army to guard againſt ſurprize. The Major obſerved that there had been very injurious reports, ſpread about General Harmar, but if he was to be credited, he knew of nothing that could be alledged againſt him, or that could poſſibly injure his reputation, in any reſpect, the good of the ſervice, appeared to be his conſtant ſtudy.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>By the Court.</hi> I think, Sir, you ſaid that on the 15th at three o'clock P. M. you arrived at the Miami village, what did you do after your arrival there, were the militia in good order?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. When we arrived we were very much fatigued, having marched twenty-eight miles that day, I directed that my own men ſhould not go thirty yards from camp. The militia like a rabble ſtrolled into the neighbouring villages, in parties of thirty or forty after plunder, ſuch was the ſituation that one hundred and fifty Warriors might have beat us off the ground.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>By the Court.</hi> Did you ſee any deſire in the militia to return to the ground where Major Wyllys was defeated, or do you ſuppoſe they would have gone had they been ordered to go?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. I ſuppoſe they would not have gone—they appeared to be panick ſtruck.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>By the Court.</hi> Are you of opinion that the perſonal conduct of the General was regular, ſteady and tended to the good of the ſervice?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. Undoubtedly ſo, and very much to the credit of the General.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>By the Court.</hi> From your long knowledge of ſervice do you think that from the complexion of the troops General Harmar had to organize, that the formation of the army was judicious?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. I think it was.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. Do you think that the order of march and encampment, was calculated to ſecure every part of the army and its appendages?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. Yes, very much ſo.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>By the Court.</hi> From your experience, do you think that the order of battle directed by General Harmar was judicious?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. Yes, perfectly ſo.</p>
            <p>Captain <hi>Doyle</hi> being ſworn, depoſed—That previous to the campaign going out laſt fall every day was employed in the moſt induſtrious manner—on the arrival of the Kentuckey militia they were all much diſappointed, that inſtead of ſeeing complete rifle-men, many were armed with old muſkets, much out of repair—the General immediately ordered them repaired with all expedition. He referred the Court as to the line of march, to the General's orderly book, and informed the Court, that the perſonal conduct of the General through the campaign was uniform and ſteady, and that had the General's orders been ſtrictly obeyed, he was confident he muſt have come home with honour. As to what influenced the General to make detachments he could not ſay—he was in the detachment of the 14th October, and that the behaviour of the militia in that detachment, was very diſgraceful, they ran from town to town in purſuit of plunder, contrary to orders, and on the arrival of General Harmar at the town two thirds of them diſperſed in the ſame manner—the General ordered cannon to be fired, merely to collect them, and he at the ſame time harrangued the officers informing them of the ill-conſequences of ſuch conduct. That the General's not returning to the village after the ill-ſucceſs of the laſt detachment, he believed was owing to his not having confidence in his army. At that time there was a great rumour in camp, the general voice was for
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:023905_0018_0FC298A7806DF470"/>
returning, their horſes were much worn down, and the militia ſhewed great ſigns of revolt. The reports that the militia circulated after their return home, and which was much to the prejudice of General Harmar, was he believed owing to the General's having a few of them puniſhed for diſobedience of orders, he thought it certain, that they had no grounds for their ill-natured reports, and that General Harmar would have been juſtifiable in arreſting one or two of the moſt popular field-officers, and ſending them home with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace—but a thing of that kind he obſerved would have broke up the army. He knew of no part of the General's conduct during the whole of the campaign, that could be cenſured, without it was ſhewing too much lenity to the militia, and thanking them for their conduct, when they merited puniſhment.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>By the Court.</hi> Do you think that the ſending the detachment under Major Wyllys tended eventually to the preſervation of the army?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. I think the Indians would have harraſſed us very much on our return if that detachment had not been made.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>By General Harmar.</hi> Did the enemy annoy the army at all after that detachment was made?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. No they did not.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>By General Harmar.</hi> Did we ſee any Indians afterwards?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. We did not.</p>
            <p>Lieutenant <hi>Sedam</hi> being ſworn, depoſed—That he had the honour of ſerving under General Harmar laſt fall on a campaign againſt the Indians of the Maumee village, and that he ſaw nothing in his conduct, but what he thought was very proper, that relative to the organization of the army, he was but little acquainted, and therefore referred the Court to the General's orderly book—that he was entirely unacquainted with General Harmar's motives for ſending out the different detachments, and if thoſe detachments were not properly ſupported, it did not appear to him to be the fault of the General, for the militia were a poor ſet, and behaved very ill upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions—that after the firſt action, he heard Major Paul of the Pennſylvania militia ſay—he hoped General Harmar would not put any confidence in them, for he was ſure they would not fight.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>By General Harmar.</hi> When I was upon the return at <hi>Chilicothée,</hi> I ordered one of the militia to be whipped, I was informed that Colonel Trotter and Major M'Mullen ſaid I had no right to puniſh them—did you hear me reprimand them for that conduct?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. After the man was puniſhed, I heard you ſay to Colonel Trotter and Major M'Mullen, that you would ſend them both home with diſgrace, for their bad conduct.</p>
            <p>Enſign <hi>Armſtrong</hi> being ſworn, depoſed as follows—That the militia being ordered into battalions and organized in which he knew the General met with great difficulty—that the order of march and encampment could be better aſcertained by a reference to the orderly book, than any thing he could add on the ſubject—that the conduct of the militia in every inſtance ſeemed calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to obſtruct every meaſure adopted by General Harmar—that the conduct of the General in every particular was perfectly conſiſtent and uniform, and every ſtep taken by him appeared to be the dictates of prudence and ſobriety— that what induced the General to ſend out the detachments was wholly unknown to him, and therefore unanſwerable by him.</p>
            <p>Captain <hi>Armſtrong</hi> being ſworn, depoſed—That on report being made to General Harmar, by Major M'Mullen and others, that the tracks of women and children had been ſeen on the route leading towards the Kickapoo towns, a North-weſt courſe, and ſuppoſing the enemy had left their families and bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage not far diſtant from camp, Gen. Harmar, on the morning of October 18th, detached Colonel Trotter, Colonel Hall, Major Ray, and Major M'Mullen, with thirty federal troops, the mounted infantry, part of the cavalry, and a detachment of militia, amounting in the whole to 300 men.—After they had
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:023905_0019_0FC298A8F87D4DC0"/>
proceeded about one mile, the cavalry gave chace to an Indian, who was mounted; him they overtook and killed—before they returned to the column, a ſecond one appeared, on which the four field officers left their commands, and purſued, leaving the troops near half an hour without any directions whatever.—The cavalry came acroſs the ſecond Indian, and after wounding one of their party, killed him alſo.—When the infantry came up to this place, they immediately fell into confuſion, which he gained permiſſion to leave them ſome diſtance on the road, where he formed an ambuſcade.—After he had been ſome time at his ſtation, a fellow on horſeback came to him, who had loſt the party in purſuit of the firſt Indian; he was much frightened, and ſaid he had been purſued by fifty mounted Indians.—That on his telling this ſtory to Colonel Trotter, notwithſtanding his obſervations to him, he changed his route, marched in various directions until night, when he returned to camp.—That on their arrival in camp, General Harmar ſent for him; and after anſwering him many queſtions, ordered one ſubaltern and twenty militia to join his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.—With thoſe he croſſed the river St. Joſeph about ten at night, and with a guide proceeded to an Indian town, about two miles diſtant; where he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued with his party until morning of the 19th.—His party fired upon an Indian and retook from him two horſes.—About nine o'clock he joined the remainder of the detachment under Colonel Hardin.—They marched on the route Colonel Trotter had purſued the day before, and after paſſing a moraſs about five miles diſtant, they came to where the enemy had encamped the day before.—Here they made a ſhort halt, and the commanding officer diſpoſed of the parties at a diſtance from each other; after a halt of half an hour, they were ordered to move on, and Captain Faulkner's company was left on the ground; the Colonel having neglected giving him orders to move on. After they had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded about three miles, they fell in with two Indians on foot, who threw off their packs, and the bruſh being thick, made their eſcape.—He then aſked Colonel Hardin where Captain Faulkner was? He ſaid he was loſt, and then ſent Major Fontaine with part of the cavalry in ſearch of him, and moved on with the remainder of the troops.—That ſome time after he informed Colonel Hardin, a gun had fired in their front, which might be conſidered as an alarm gun, and that he ſaw where a horſe had come down the road, and returned again; but the Colonel ſtill moved on, giving no orders, nor making any arrangements for an attack.—That ſome time after he diſcovered the enemy's fires at a diſtance, and informed the Colonel, who replied, that they would not fight, and rode in front of the advance, until fired on from behind the fires; when he the Colonel retreated, and with him all the militia except nine, who continued with him, and were inſtantly killed, with twenty-four of the federal troops—that ſeeing his laſt man fall and being ſurrounded by the ſavages, he threw himſelf into a thicket and remained there three hours in day-light, during that time he had an opportunity of ſeeing the enemy paſs and repaſs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived their numbers did not amount to one hundred men—that ſome were mounted, others armed with rifles, and the advance with tomahawks only— he was of opinion that had Colonel Trotter proceeded on the 18th agreeable to his orders, having killed the enemy's ſentinels, they would have ſurpriſed their camp and with eaſe defeated them, or had Colonel Hardin arranged his troops, or made any military diſpoſition on the 19th, that they would have gained a victory, their defeat he therefore aſcribed to two cauſes, the un-officer-like conduct of Colonel Hardin (who he believed was a brave man) and the cowardly behaviour of the militia—many of them threw down their arms loaded, and he believed that none except the party under his command fired a gun. What he ſaw of the conduct of the militia on that day, and what he felt by being under the command of a man who wanted military talents, has cauſed him to determine, that he would not willingly fight with the one, or be commanded by the other. That he referred the Court to the orderly-book which pointed out the line of march, encampment and battle.</p>

               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:023905_0020_0FC7448244B951F0"/>Queſtion. <hi>By the Court.</hi> Are you clearly of opinion that if the militia had done their duty, they were fully competent to have defeated the Indians?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. I think they were fully ſo.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>By the Court.</hi> According to your ideas, as an officer of expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience was the formation and arrangement of the different corps of the army by General Harmar at the commencement of the expedition judicious?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. I think they were.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>By the Court.</hi> Did the line of march appear to you to be a judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious one, calculated for the protection of the army in all its parts?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. I think ſo.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>By the Court.</hi> Do you think the mode of encampment was calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated both for defence and protection?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. As much ſo as any one that could poſſibly be adopted.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>By the Court.</hi> What was your opinion of the General's order of battle?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. I think it was a judicious one.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>By the Court.</hi> Do you think that the making the detachment of the 21ſt was in its conſequences uſeful to the return of the army.</p>
            <p>Anſwer. I can judge from circumſtances only that we were not harraſſed by the enemy afterwards.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>By the Court.</hi> Do you know if any detachment was made for the purpoſe of ſupporting Major Wyllys?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. As ſoon as information of the Major's misfortune arrived in camp, the General ordered all the troops under arms, but whether any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment was made from them or not I don't know.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>By the Court.</hi> Do you ſuppoſe that if General Harmar had ordered the army back, the militia would have gone?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. I am of opinion that if a ſerious attack had been made, that in fifteen minutes the militia would have deſerted us and left the federal troops and artillery to be ſacrificed.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>By General Harmar.</hi> Do you recollect the proceedings of the militia at <hi>Chilicothée</hi> on our return?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. I recollect your ſaying to Colonel Trotter and Major M'Mullen, that you would poſt them in their country, for their un-ſoldier-like conduct and that they ought to be hanged.</p>
            <p>Enſign <hi>Shamburgh</hi> being ſworn, depoſed—That the organization of the army under General Harmar was, as far as he was capable of judging in military affairs, exceedingly well—That the march, encampment and order of battle were alſo in his opinion very well planned—that he was not capable of judging of the motives, which influenced the detachments of the 14th, 19th and 21ſt October, but it was his opinion, at that time, that the General was appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive, that, as the Savages had been ſucceſsful in the preceding engagements, they would harraſs his army on his return, in conſequence thereof he ordered the party commanded by Major Wyllys in order to check them, which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved had its effect—he recollected that the different detachments ſent out were numerous and he believed ſufficient to fight ſuch number of Indians as were then together, if the commanding officers thereof had taken more precaution, he had been told at the time that Major Ray was ordered to ſupport Major Wyllys, but he could not determine whether that officer had obeyed his orders. He obſerved that the loſs of ſo many pack-horſes, was owing to the neglect of horſe-maſters, notwithſtanding the repeated orders of the General on that head, it appeared to him as if they were parties concerned, and glad to loſe their horſes, becauſe they had a very great appraiſement for the ſame. He obſerved that he did duty in the ordnance department at that time, and had fifty pack-horſes under his direction, which gave him an opportunity to know the negligence and incapacity of both horſe-maſters and drivers.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>By General Harmar.</hi> Do you think after the laſt detachment was
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:023905_0021_0FC298ABF8148D58"/>
made under Major Wyllys and the remains of his party returned to camp, that the militia would have gone back if they had been ordered?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. I think not.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>By the Court.</hi> Was the appearance of the militia after the action of the 21ſt orderly or diſorderly?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. Very diſorderly.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>By the Court.</hi> Was there any particular cauſe aſcribed that you heard of for their diſorderly conduct?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. Not that I know of, the militia both officers and men ſeemed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to go home, and ſaid frequently that ten federal regiments ſhould not keep them.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>By the Court.</hi> Did you obſerve whether the militia were as well treated as the federal troops?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. Perfectly the ſame.</p>
            <p>Enſign <hi>Gaines</hi> (who was captain of horſe in General Harmar's expedition) being ſworn, depoſed—That on the expedition he was almoſt every evening at General Harmar's tent until the 24th October, when he was detached for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to Fort Waſhington, and that during the whole time he did not ſee General Harmar in the leaſt intoxicated with liquor, but that on the contrary the General conducted the army in a manner which in his eſtimation did him great honour. He further obſerved, that he had ſerved on a number of expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions againſt the Savages, undertaken by the militia of Kentuckey, and that he never ſaw in any of them, the like good order and military arrangement which accompanied General Harmar's expedition—he alſo obſerved that the people in Kentuckey never alledged any charge againſt General Harmar, until Colonel John Hardin had acquitted himſelf, before a Board of Enquiry of ſeveral charges exhibited againſt him, reſpecting his conduct on that expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—that the populace finding nothing they could ſay to the prejudice of the Colonel would be believed, levelled their malice at General Harmar. He did not conceive that any thing would have been ſaid againſt the General in that country, if a Baptiſt preacher's ſon who reſides there had not been whipped in the army for diſobedience of orders.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>By the Court.</hi> I think you ſay you have been in ſeveral expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againſt the Indians—did the militia who were with General Harmar con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct better or worſe, than thoſe in other expeditions?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. Much better, Sir.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>By the Court.</hi> Was you in the action of the 19th?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. I was.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>By the Court.</hi> Is it your opinion, that if the militia had been properly arranged in that action, and would have fought, that they would have been ſufficient to have defeated the Indians.</p>
            <p>Anſwer. Yes—for it appeared to me that the Indians were ſurprized—that if Colonel Trotter on the preceding day had not returned, he moſt certainly muſt have been in their camp, and completely defeated them; for I had taken two of their ſpies the day before, which appeared to be the only two they had out.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>By the Court.</hi> Do you think that if General Harmar had ordered the army back, after the action of the 21ſt, that the militia would have gone?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. They would not have gone willingly. I think in that caſe there would have been danger of mutiny. When the militia of Major Wyllys' de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment were ordered to march, they appeared to be unwilling to go, and ſome were ſo much ſo—as to cry.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>By the Court.</hi> Is it your opinion, that the movement of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment under Major Wyllys, had a good effect in ſecuring the army from being attacked and harraſſed on its return?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. I think it had a very good effect.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>By the Court.</hi> Did the Indians ever attack you afterwards?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. Not while I continued with the army.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:023905_0022_0FC298B9EBD603F0"/>Captain <hi>Aſheton</hi> being ſworn, depoſed—That the organization of General Harmar's army was a ſource of trouble and difficulty, ariſing from diſputes among the militia officers for precedency; but when effected, was in all its parts ſyſtematical.—That the organization of the army, the order of march, encamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and battle, when duly conſidered, cannot fail to raiſe the General in the eſtimation of every military man.—That it had been baſely reported, that the General was in a ſtate of intoxication nearly the whole of the campaign. This he aſſerted to be a malicious falſehood; and he averred, that his perſonal conduct, during that time will ever do him honour.—He ſaid the motives which influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced the detachments of the 14th, 19th and 21ſt October, could only be accounted for by the General himſelf: but he ſuppoſed, that the detachment un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Col. Hardin, was ſent in conſequence of information gained from a priſoner taken on the morning of the 13th, and from a Frenchman employed as a guide, who reported, that it was ſomething more than half a day's ride from a place called the French Store (at which place the army encamped the night of the 13th) to the Maumee villages.—This detachment was ſupported by the whole army, and moved off the ground at the ſame time with as much rapidity as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and arrived at the villages on the 17th, where the army encamped. On the morning of the 18th, I mounted guard in front of the encampment. In the courſe of that day, I was informed that a detachment of 300 men was ordered out under Colonel Trotter, with three days proviſion, with orders to ſcour the country; but they returned the ſame evening to camp, without effecting any thing. Colonel Hardin, diſguſted at the conduct of Colonel Trotter, and anxious to retrieve the loſt honour of his countrymen, ſolicited the ſame com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, which was granted. He marched on the morning of the 19th, while he was yet on guard, and was defeated the ſame day by the Indians.—He could not ſay what influenced the General to ſend out a detachment on the 21ſt, but he obſerved that the Indians were fluſhed with ſucceſs in the action of the 19th. —That it had become neceſſary to give them a ſudden check, in order to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the army from being harraſſed on its return; and that if this was the General's intention, he was fully perſuaded it had it's deſired effect. On the 21ſt, the army marched eight miles from the Maumee villages on it's return; late that night a corps of 340 militia, and ſixty of the federal troops under the command of Major Wyllys, were detached, that they might gain the vicinity of the Maumee villages before morning, and ſurprize any Indians who might be found there. The detachment marched in three columns, the federal troops in the centre, at the head of which he was poſted, with Major Wyllys and Colonel Hardin in his front—the militia formed the columns to the right and left. From ſeveral delays, occaſioned by the militia's halting, they did not reach the banks of the <hi>Omee</hi> till ſome time after ſun riſe. The ſpies then diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the enemy, and reported to Major Wyllys, who halted the federal troops, and moved the militia on ſome diſtance in front, where he gave his orders and plan of attack to the ſeveral commanding officers of corps—thoſe orders were not communicated to him—that Major Wyllys reſerved the command of the federal troops to himſelf. Major Hall with his battalion was directed to take a circuitous route round the bend of the Omee river, croſs the Pickaway Fort (or St. Mary's) which brought him directly in the rear of the enemy, and there wait until the attack ſhould commence with Major M'Mullen's battalion, Major Fontaine's cavalry, and Major Wyllys with the federal troops, who all croſſed the <hi>Omee</hi> at, and near the common fording place. After the attack commenced, the troops were by no means to ſeparate, but were to embody, or the batta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions to ſupport each other as circumſtances required. From this diſpoſition it appeared evident, that it was the intention of Major Wyllys to ſurround the enemy, and that if Colonel Hall, who had gained his ground undiſcovered, had not wantonly diſobeyed his orders, by firing on a ſingle Indian, the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize muſt have been complete. The Indians then fled with precipitation, the battalions of militia purſuing in different directions. Major Fontaine made a
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:023905_0023_0FC298BBBA2930D0"/>
charge upon a ſmall party of Savages; he fell the firſt fire, and his troops diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed. The federal troops who were then left unſupported, became an eaſy ſacrifice to much the largeſt party of Indians that had been ſeen that day. It was his opinion that the misfortunes of that day, were owing to the ſeparation of the troops, and diſobedience of orders. After the federal troops were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated, and the firing in all quarters nearly ceaſed, Colonel Hall and Major M'Mullen, with their battalions, met in the town, and after diſcharging, clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and freſh loading their arms, which took up about half an hour, proceeded to join the army unmoleſted. He was convinced that the detachment, if it had been kept embodied, was ſufficient to have anſwered the fulleſt expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the General, and needed no ſupport; but that he was informed a battalion under Major Ray, was ordered out for that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>By the Court.</hi> Is it your opinion, that if the General had ordered the army back, that the militia would have gone?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. I do not think they would.</p>
            <p>Lieutenant <hi>Kerſey</hi> being ſworn, depoſed—That when the militia arrived at Fort Waſhington, they were formed into battalions and properly organized. He knew that General Harmar had a great deal of difficulty to get them ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranged; their arms and accoutrements were in very bad order. He wiſhed to refer the Court to the General's orderly book for information relative to the order of march. In his opinion General Harmar's conduct was uniform, ſteady, and ſober during the whole expedition. He was alſo of opinion, that the detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the 14th, was in conſequence of information received from a priſoner, taken the morning before, which was, that the enemy were running away; and the detachment of the 19th, was to gain ſome knowledge of them, and the detachment of the 21ſt, was to ſurprize and take advantage of them; which in his opinion would have happened, had the militia attended to the directions and plan laid down for that enterprize. He obſerved that the reduced ſtate of the pack-horſes, notwithſtanding every attention was paid to ſecure and keep them in good condition, rendered it impoſſible for the army to take any advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the enemy.—The militia had proved that they were not to be depended upon; their daſtardly behaviour in three inſtances, deſtroyed every confidence the General had in them. He therefore determined to return, and not to hazard another engagement unleſs the enemy came in reach of the main body. That the army took up the march to return to Fort Waſhington, and it was with great difficulty that the General kept them together until they arrived there.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>By the Court.</hi> From your knowledge of ſervice, is it your opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that the organization of the army was judicious?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. I think it was.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>By the Court.</hi> Do you think that all the movements of the army were ſo connected, as to be able to ſuſtain each other in caſe of attack by the enemy?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. I think they were.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>By the Court.</hi> Do you think, that through the courſe of the cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign, the General's conduct was open and deciſive throughout?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. I think it was.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>By the Court.</hi> Was the conduct of the militia tolerably regular, on their advance towards the Maumee towns?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. It was more regular than it was on the return; but it was very irregular.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>By the Court.</hi> Do you ſuppoſe that it was neceſſary to make the detachment of the 21ſt, in order to prevent the Indians harraſſing the army on its return?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. I think it was, and for that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>By the Court.</hi> If the General had ordered the army to return to the towns, after Major Wyllys's misfortune, would the militia have gone?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. I think they would not—they would have mutinied.</p>

            <p>Major <hi>Heart</hi> was ſworn, and depoſed—That General Harmar's conduct on his expedition in October 1790, was at all times ſteady, calm, and deliberate, and was always attentive to the arrangements and applications made to him, and to the informations given, as far as came under his obſervation—that he was often at his quarters and marched in front of the right column, which was generally within fifty yards of him—That the organization of the army being publiſhed in the daily orders, would ſpeak for itſelf, he however never heard an individual find fault with it, during the campaign, or point out any defects, except in the commiſſary and pack-horſe departments, and in thoſe the execution, and not the arrangements were found fault with—that the order of march was in three columns, covered with front, rear and flank guards, which order was generally preſerved, and as well executed, as could be expected with a body compoſed moſtly of militia, and embarraſſed with pack-horſes— that the encampment was in a ſquare with the baggage, horſes, cattle and ſtores in center—guards were poſted in ſuch manner as to form a line of ſentries round the whole, field officers appointed to diſpoſe thoſe guards, and to ſee duty well done, and they were ſo diſpoſed as to prevent ſurprize, and had the horſe department followed orders would have ſecured the horſes—as they had not occaſion to form the line of battle, he could not determine how it would have been executed, but it was ſimple, eaſy to be underſtood, and univerſally approved—With reſpect to making the detachments he had never been in council, and could only aſſign ſuch motives as offered themſelves at the time from a concurrence of circumſtances—The detachment of the 14th he preſumed at that time was made in conſequence of information obtained from a priſoner, that the Indians were confuſed and diſtracted in their councils, and was deſigned to ſurprize them, prevent their concerting meaſures to unite, and attack them and not give them time to ſecure their proviſions and property, and that the deſired effect was anſwered, ſo far as to prevent their ſecuring ſo much as they would otherways have done—The whole army was put in motion the moment the detachment moved off, and followed with as much rapidity as artillery and ſtores would admit of, to ſupport the detachment—That the detachment of the 19th was made in conſequence of repeated information of having diſcovered a trail of men, women, and children, and on the fulleſt aſſurance as he was then informed, that the detachment was adequate for attacking the party they were in queſt of, a corps de reſerve was ordered but never came up, it was dark before information was brought to the General that the party were defeated, and a ſupport could not be ſent that night—a detachment was ordered to march next morning, but for what purpoſe, he could not ſay.—The detachment of the 21ſt he had every reaſon to believe was made on the general ſyſtem, viz. to find the enemy, and give them a check, to prevent their attacking and harraſſing the army, on the retreat, and on that principle the detaching was inevitable—he did not know that any ſupport was ordered, he was on the left, but he knew that the greater part of the detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment came in very ſoon after the intelligence of the defeat was brought, and it was too late for giving any aſſiſtance. He did not expect that the General would make a detachment to ſupport them, after the repeated proofs that the militia would not ſtand, and he preſumed the ſituation of the horſes would not admit of returning with the army. He ſuppoſed the detachment calculated to cover itſelf, and doubtleſs would have happily ſucceeded, had the right and left columns obeyed the orders which it is ſaid, Major Wyllys had given. He knew of no one circumſtance in the General's conduct during the expedition
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:023905_0025_0FC7448C628088E8"/>
which ought to injure his reputation, and tho' the misfortunes of the 21ſt were to be lamented, yet he believed the ſalvation of the remainder of the army, the baggage and ſtores, were due only to the making that detachment.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>By the Court.</hi> On the arrival of the troops in camp who were defeated on the 21ſt, do you think from the ſtate of mind the militia were in, that if the General had ordered the army back the militia would have gone?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. I do not know whether they would or not, but if they had gone, and not having any place to retreat to, I am of opinion they would have fled as ſoon as they were attacked and have left the federal troops to be ſacrificed.</p>
            <p>The Court then adjourned to to-morrow morning nine o'clock.</p>
            <p>SEPTEMBER 22d.—The Court having met according to adjournment directed the Recorder to write the following letter to his Excellency General St. Clair.</p>

                        <p>SEPTEMBER 23d.—The Court met according to adjournment—and no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Evidences appearing, came to a reſolution to cloſe their proceedings.</p>

               <head>NUMBER IV. The AFFIDAVIT of Colonel JOHN HARDIN, taken in conſequence of a Court of Enquiry to be held at Fort Waſhington, reſpecting the conduct of Brigadier General Harmar, on the expedition againſt the Maumee Towns, in October 1790.</head>
               <p>THIS deponent being firſt ſworn, depoſeth and faith,—That on his arrival with the Kentuckey militia at the mouth of Licking, he commenced an acquaintance with General Harmar, found from his converſation that he had the good of his country and the expedition very much at heart; buſineſs was carried on regular and with as much expedition as the nature of the caſe would admit. About the firſt of October we proceeded on our march: after the line of march was formed the General iſſued his orders regularly, and obſerved very ſtrictly that they were executed; on our march there was an Indian priſoner taken, who gave information, that the Indians and French were repairing the old fort at the Maumee town, and that the Indians were not likely to get any of the neighbouring tribes to join them; this priſoner alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed us they did not know that General Harmar had any artillery: After receiving this information the General and this Deponent conſulted upon the matter, and it was agreed to detach ſix hundred men, leaving all their heavy baggage and march rapidly to the towns, hoping that the enemy would fly to their fort provided the artillery was not diſcovered, and that ſix hundred rank and file would be ſufficient to keep them in their fort until General Harmar arrived with the artillery and balance of the army. Accordingly when the General was informed by the guides, that they were within thirty or thirty-five miles of the towns, there was a detachment ordered to make ready with all poſſible expedition; thoſe orders were ſo pleaſing to the officers that they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted who ſhould go, and ſome caſt lots in order to ſettle the diſpute; this deponent being honoured with the command, left the General with his detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſaw him no more until he arrived at the Maumee village, which he thinks was about three or four days after he left him, during which time he heard no complaints of General Harmar. After the General's arrival at the Maumee village and the Indians all fled, he expreſſed a very great deſire to make
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:023905_0032_0FC298DFB837D880"/>
his route by the Weaw towns on the Wabaſh; for this purpoſe there was a council ordered to be held, but before the council met, finding the Indians had ſtole the night before a number of the pack-horſes and ſome of the light-horſemen's horſes, there was a ſtop put to the buſineſs, and the thoughts of the route by the Weaw towns laid aſide. There was an old French captive that was taken informed us the Indians were ſcattered in the woods, and were not able by any means to fight us, and that they had not got any aſſiſtance from other tribes; this induced this deponent to ſolicit the General for a command of about three or four hundred men, to range the woods for ten or twelve miles, which he granted, and ordered the three hundred men to be furniſhed with three days proviſions, theſe orders were as pleaſing to the officers and ſoldiers as the former; Colonel Trotter inſiſted he had been promiſed a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and as it appeared this would be productive of ſomething very clever, he wiſhed to be indulged with the command of the detachment then ordered out, which was granted by the General, this deponent conſenting thereto; Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel Trotter marched on the morning of the 18th of October, equipt for a tour of two or three days, in order to hunt up Indian camps; he returned on the evening of the ſame day, at the time the General and the deponent was about fixing of guards in order to captivate any of the enemy that might come to ſteal horſes: the General appeared much diſpleaſed with the conduct of Colonel Trotter and ordered the ſame party out again that evening, and for this deponent to go next morning and take charge of them; this deponent agreeable to the orders given, collected what he could of the party next morning, and after proceeding about ten miles fell in with a party of Indians, who began a very briſk fire on the detachment, who retired without making but very little reſiſtance, notwithſtanding all the exertions to prevent them:—this deponent when he returned to camp informed the General what had happened, that it was owing to the cowardly behaviour of the militia, and inſiſted on another party's being ſent to the battle ground; the General informed this deponent he would let him know in the morning. Accordingly he told him that he had not compleated the object that he was ordered to do, and that if any thing ſhould happen to prevent him, he ſhould be reflected on, as he had been in poſſeſſion of the towns ſo long and had not deſtroyed them, that he would firſt give orders for that purpoſe, and then he would be better able to judge what was beſt to be done; on the morning of the 20th orders were given for deſtroying of the towns, which was executed accordingly; at this time the men appeared more timid than before; the General told this depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent he thought it would not anſwer a good purpoſe to go to the battle ground, as the mens ſpirits appeared to be very low at the hearſay of ſo many men being killed, and that the ſight of the mangled bodies would make them much more ſo, and the Indians if not able to fight us would be gone, and that he ſhould give orders to take up the line of march to Fort Waſhington: accordingly on the morning of the 21ſt we left the towns and began our march for the mouth of Licking, in about eight or nine miles encamped. The night being very clear and the moon giving light, this deponent informed the General that he thought it would be a good opportunity to ſteal a march on the Indians, as he had reaſon to believe they returned to the towns as ſoon as they knew the army had left it. The General did not appear fond of ſending a party back, but this deponent urged the matter informing the General that as he had been unfortunate the other day he wiſhed to have it in his power to pick the militia and try it again, and at the ſame time endeavoured to account for the mens not fighting, and deſired an opportunity to retrieve the credit of the militia; the General appeared not to be of opinion the enemy would return ſo ſoon, but told this deponent he might take about one hundred men and go back; this deponent replied he did not wiſh to go back with leſs than five or ſix hundred men; the General anſwered that the troops were very much fatigued, and that it would not anſwer any valuable purpoſe to ſend ſo many men; this deponent
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:023905_0033_0FC298E136C30EE8"/>
then left the General; in about half an hour he was ſent for, when the General informed him that he intended to ſend Major Wyllys back with all the federal troops that could be ſpared, ſaying at the ſame time they were the men that would ſtand to the work, and that he wanted about one hundred of your beſt militia; after ſome converſation between the General and this deponent, the latter went to Major Wyllys and told him he did not like his going back with ſo few men, the Major alſo thinking the number too few, wiſhed this deponent to ſpeak to the General on the ſubject, which was done; Major M'Mullen and Major Hall were then ſent for and the deſign made known to them, they both appeared well pleaſed with the affair; it was then propoſed what number of men would be ſufficient, this deponent recommending from four to ſix hundred, they both concluded that four hundred men was fully ſufficient; the General ſeemed perfectly ſatisfied that any number of troops that were thought adequate to the purpoſe ſhould be ordered; accordingly four hundred men conſiſting of ſixty regulars, three hundred foot militia and forty horſemen rank and file properly officered were ordered to be ready to march at midnight; this deponent was honored with the command of the militia. The troops marched agreeable to orders about two o'clock, and after proceeding to the towns they fell in with a party of Indians, a battle enſued (the reſult of which is generally known) as they returned, about one and a half miles before we got to camp, this deponent ſent a horſeman forward to inform the General what was done, and very ſhortly after he had diſpatched this horſeman, met Major Ray with about thirty men, who inform'd him there had come a horſeman into camp, and had acquainted the General that the party was nearly all cut off, that the General had ſent him with what men he could get out of the militia to meet what had eſcaped of the detachment, that thoſe with him was all that would turn out; this deponent informed the Major otherwiſe and requeſted him to wait until Major M'Mullen, Major Hall, and Major Ormſby ſhould come up, that they were but a ſmall diſtance behind and he would go forward to the General. When this deponent arrived at camp and informed the General what was done he appeared to be well ſatisfied; he alſo aſked the General if he would not ſend back another party to keep poſſeſſion of the battle ground, he replied he would not divide his army any more, when this deponent inſiſted on the whole army's marching back (no perſon being preſent except the General, Major Doughty and this deponent) the General anſwered, you ſee the ſituation of the army, we are now ſcarcely able to move our baggage, it will take up three days to go and return to this place, we have no more forage for our horſes, and if the Indians intend to collect, which he apprehended they would from their ſucceſs on the 19th, it would give them a great oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity; that they had got a very good ſcourging, and he would keep the army in perfect readineſs to receive them ſhould they think proper to follow, and finally concluded that under the preſent circumſtances, it was beſt to move forward to Fort Waſhington, and if the Indians did follow he would make every exertion in his power to defeat their intentions; Major Doughty appeared perfectly to agree with the General in opinion. The bounds of the camp were made leſs; the army continued at the ſame camp until next morning, orders were given to march at the uſual hour which was eight o'clock, during this time this deponent never heard any perſon expreſs a deſire to go back to the towns, except two ſoldiers of Major Ray's party by the names of Miller and Hammond. Next morning at the hour appointed to march the General moved with the front of the army and halted at a very ſmall diſtance, litters not being ready for all the wounded; this deponent with the rear-guard and many others did not leave the camp until ten o'clock, when they moved on and joined the army, the whole then proceeded on towards Fort Waſhington, with as much regularity as was obſerved in going out, until we came to the old Chilacothy on little Miami, when a number of the militia contrary to orders fired off their guns, this deponent endeavoured to put a ſtop to ſuch diſorderly behaviour,
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:023905_0034_0FC744B42EDC5A68"/>
and commanded that thoſe offenders that could be taken ſhould be puniſhed agreeable to general orders, and having caught a ſoldier himſelf in the very act of firing his gun, ordered a file of men to take him immediately and carry him to the ſix pounder, and for the drummer to tye him up and give him ſix laſhes; this deponent was ſhortly after met by Colonel Trotter and Major M'Mullen, and a number of militia ſoldiers, who in an abrupt manner aſked him by what authority he ordered that ſoldier whipt, he replied in ſupport of general orders; on which a very warm diſpute enſued between Colonel Trotter, Major M'Mullen and this deponent; the General being informed of what had happened came forward and gave Colonel Trotter and Major M'Mullen a very ſevere reprimand, ordered the federal troops to parade, and the drummer to do his duty, ſwearing he would riſque his life in ſupport of his orders, the man received the number of laſhes ordered, and ſeveral that were confined were ſet at liberty; numbers of the militia ſeem'd much pleaſed with what was done; this intended mutiny being ſoon quaſh'd the army proceeded in good order to Fort Waſhington. When the army arrived at the mouth of Licking the General informed this deponent he had determined to arreſt ſome of the militia officers, for their bad conduct and ſend them home with diſgrace; but this deponent oppoſed his intention, alledging that it would be a diſgrace to the whole militia, that he would perhaps ſtand in need of their aſſiſtance on ſome future occaſion, and it would four their minds and cauſe them to turn out with reluctance, and that his diſcharging them generally with honor perhaps would anſwer a better purpoſe, the General readily indulged the requeſt of this deponent. This deponent further obſerves, that during the expedition he never heard officer nor ſoldier find fault or give the moſt diſtant hint of being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with the General's conduct in any reſpect, nor charge him with cowardice or drunkenneſs, and expected the General had given general ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and what more confirm'd his opinion, was after their arrival at Fort Waſhington the General invited all the field and ſome other officers to dine with him, amongſt whom was Colonel Trotter, Major Doughty, Major Hall, and Major M'Mullen; dinner being over wine was introduced, the General ſtepping out on ſome occaſion Major Hall propoſed drinking his health, it was unanimouſly agreed to, and with as much cheerfulneſs as any other health that was propoſed; this deponent continued at Fort Waſhington a few days after, and never heard any perſon ſpeak a diſreſpectful word of General Harmar, or find fault in the leaſt with his conduct whilſt on the expedition. When this deponent returned home in Kentuckey, hearing ſuch reports reſpecting the expedition was much amazed, but concluded it aroſe from a want of knowledge and proper information or from prejudice. This deponent further ſaith, that be looked on General Harmar to be a very brave and experienced officer. And further ſaith not.</p>
