            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="6" facs="unknown:005969_0004_102718C673EFB338"/>
ſuch Cautions good and neceſſary. Behold <hi>Peter, Peter</hi> a Diſciple, <hi>Peter</hi> an Apoſtle, yea, the Chief of the Apoſtles, what a gallant Reſolution doth he make, that he will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>die for,</hi> than <hi>deny</hi> his LORD; and yet in an unguar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Hour, how doth his Faith fail, his Courage wither, while he becomes the boaſted Prey of <hi>Satan,</hi> and the Conqueſt of a trifling <hi>Girl!</hi> Alas, Once abandon'd of divine Grace, and there is no Temptation that Satan can lay before us, but we ſhould greedily catch at, and be caught by. Will it not hold then, my Brethren, by a Parity of Reaſon, that the beſt of <hi>Soldiers</hi> may be warn'd againſt that <hi>Cowardize,</hi> which is inconſiſtent with their Character, as Vice is with that of a Chriſtian? Yes; and whoever conſiders the Source of Cowardize, the many Things that expoſe to it, the pernicious Effects and Conſequences of it, and that Men naturally the moſt Valiant, have at particular Times been betrayed into it, will eaſily acknowledge, that a <hi>Caveat</hi> againſt it, at all Times, and eſpecially in Time of <hi>War,</hi> is neither un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary, nor unſeaſonable. Let this then, at leaſt, plead my Excuſe in the Choice of my Text on this Occaſion, and in the Cautions and Counſels that may be offer'd from it. My Fathers and Brethren, whom you have preſs'd into your Service on the like Occaſions, have in a manner ſearch'd out every ſuitable Subject, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted it: They have pointed you to the dreadful Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins of <hi>War,</hi> far more dreadful than all the Artillery of the Warriour; they have ſhewn it's Lawfulneſs in this preſent corrupt Eſtate, in what Manner, on what Principles, and with what Views, it muſt be enter'd into and carried on; they have alſo ſanctify'd your Arms, and engag'd you in an holy War, have diſplayed the Chriſtian Banner, enter'd your Names on CHRIST'S Muſter-Roll, furniſh'd you with Arms, and ſhow'd you your Strength, ſounded the Trumpet, muſter'd your Forces and marſhall'd 'em under the Command of JEHOVAH, the <hi>Lord of Hoſts</hi>; they have led forth the
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:005969_0005_102718C99C0CD8E0"/>
Armys of the living GOD, animating you to Battle with the Example of renowned Renowned Heroes, Men of War, and led you on to Victory in the Proſpect of thoſe divine Honours, that are the Reward of Conqueſt, placing you on the Throne of CHRIST, even as He alſo having overcome is ſit down with his Father on his Throne. After ſo much ſaid, and ſaid ſo well, what remains for me, unleſs to guard you againſt all <hi>Cowardize,</hi> ſhewing ſomething of it's Cauſes and Effects, the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of it, and the Way of eſcaping that Danger? And to theſe Ends, what Words can be more ſuitable, than thoſe of my Text? <hi>The Children of</hi> Ephraim <hi>being ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and carrying Bows, turned back in the Day of Battle: They kept not the Covenant of GOD, and refuſed to walk in his Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In theſe Words you have <hi>Cowardize</hi> painted in it's blackeſt Colours, drawn to the full length of Deformity, and glaring with lively Horror. Cowardize is baſe in it ſelf, and juſtly deteſted in all, more ſo in Men of a military Character, who by their Profeſſion proclaim their Courage; more abundantly ſo in them while in their martial Habit, equip'd with all the Inſtruments of War; and moſt of all ſo, in the Day and upon the Field of Battle. What an Abſurdity in Nature, What a Soleciſm in War, firſt to Sound the Onſet, and inſtantly beat a Retreat? And yet this ſeems to be the Behaviour of the Children of <hi>Ephraim</hi> in my Text: Their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter was Martial, their Habit Millitary; they were <hi>arm'd</hi> and <hi>carrying Bows</hi>: By which may perhaps be underſtood, that they were arm'd for Defence, as well as Offence; probably they had the Habergeon or Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlet, the Shield and Buckler, as well as the Sword and Bow: And yet after all, they <hi>turned back in the Day of Battle.</hi> I know not whether the inſpired Pſalmiſt intended a Pathos, when he ſpake of thoſe Perſons as the <hi>Children</hi> of <hi>Ephraim</hi>; but ſure 'tis with great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:005969_0006_102718CC53ACD5B0"/>
that he calls them <hi>Children,</hi> who were far from <hi>quitting themſelves as Men,</hi> eſpecially as Men of War. If this ſhould be thought too much a Criticiſm, or Fineſſe, yet ſure in theſe Perſons Cowardice and Diſgrace appear in horrid Triumph. Behold 'em (my Brethren) firſt looking their Enemy in the Face, and then turning their Backs in a Fright: Now ſtrutting in Armour, as if aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd of Victory, and then flinging away their Arms, as a Weight that would hinder them in their Flight; firſt they ſhew their Teeth, and then their Heels, and with the Countenance of a Lion, they cover the Heart of an Hare. Methinks this Picture ſtares ſo ſtrongly, as not only to make the valiant Man more abundantly to abhor Cowardize, but alſo to make the moſt Puſillanimous afraid of being tho't ſo, yea, grow Courageous thro' very Cowardize. But who are they that are thus deſcrib'd? My Text ſpeaks of theſe Perſons as being <hi>the Children of</hi> Ephraim.</p>
            <p>By <hi>Ephraim,</hi> we are ſometimes in Scripture led to underſtand a particular Perſon, the youngeſt Son of <hi>Joſeph</hi>; ſometimes a particular Tribe, in Conſequence of that adopting Grant, which <hi>Jacob</hi> made to his two Grandſons <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> whom he numbred among his own immediate Offſpring, and bleſſed as if they had been ſo indeed; making them Heads of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct Tribes, even as <hi>Reuben</hi> and <hi>Simeon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sometimes by <hi>Ephraim</hi> we are to underſtand the Ten Tribes, which revolted in the Days of <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> or <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as oppoſed to <hi>Judah</hi>: And they are called <hi>Ephraim,</hi> as this was the moſt Valiant of the Tribes; or perhaps becauſe <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> the principal Author of this Revolt, was an <hi>Ephraimite.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sometimes again, by <hi>Ephraim,</hi> we are to underſtand the whole Body of the <hi>Iſraelitiſh</hi> Nation: So in <hi>Jerem.</hi> 31.9, 20. the Divine Being is bro't in ſaying, Ephraim <hi>is my dear Son, my firſt born</hi>: Which, beſides that it is not true of <hi>Ephraim</hi> conſidered as a ſingle Perſon, or
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:005969_0007_102718CF04367208"/>
particular Tribe, or the ten Tribes, is the very ſame Phraſe which GOD put into the Mouth of <hi>Moſes,</hi> when he ſent him as Ambaſſador to <hi>Pharoah,</hi> to demand Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty for his People to go and ſacrifice. <hi>Thus ſhalt thou ſay to</hi> Pharaoh (ſays GOD) Iſrael <hi>is my Son, even my First-born.</hi> Exod. 4.22.</p>
            <p>What we are to underſtand by <hi>Ephraim</hi> in my Text, can only be learnt from the Story to which it relates. But here the Learned differ. Some ſuppoſe it to have Reſpect to the Defeat of the Children of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> recorded 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7.20, -22. and ſo by <hi>Ephraim</hi> would be underſtood a particular Perſon: But the Defeat being previous to the coming of the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> is of too early a Date for the Pſalm before us, which contains a Record of Tranſactions commencing with that Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Others ſuppoſe, our Text relates to ſomething conſequent to the Revolt of <hi>Jeroboam</hi>; and ſo by <hi>Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im</hi> would underſtand the Ten Tribes: But theſe ſeem to be of too late a Date for the Story referr'd to; our Pſalm ending with <hi>David,</hi> who died before that Revolt. Others therefore, more juſtly refer the Paſſage to the whole Body of the <hi>Iſraelitiſh</hi> Nation; our Pſalm containing a Regiſter of memorable Things from their coming out of <hi>Egypt</hi> to the Settlement of the Government in the Houſe of <hi>David.</hi> But yet what particular Piece of Hiſtory our Text relates to, we are yet at a loſs. Some ſuppoſe their Refuſal to go up and fight the Inhabitants of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> at the Command of GOD, to be pointed at; or their turning their Backs on the <hi>Amorites,</hi> when without GOD's Preſence, and contrary to his Command, they raſhly encountred them: So Biſhop <hi>Patrick.</hi> Others, particularly Meſſirs. <hi>Henry</hi> and <hi>Pool,</hi> ſuppoſe the Defeat by the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> (mentioned 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4.) when the <hi>Ark of God</hi> was taken Priſoner, to be the Story alluded to: And ſo they connect our Text with the 59<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Verſe of the Pſalm, where GOD is ſaid to have <hi>abhorred</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſo that he forſook the Tabernacle of</hi> Shiloh, <hi>the Tent which be
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:005969_0008_102718D1B5081878"/>
placed among Men,</hi> and <hi>delivered his Strength,</hi> that is, the Ark of his Strength, <hi>into Captivity, and his Glory,</hi> which reſted on the Wings of the Cherubims over the Ark, <hi>into the Enemies Hands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But not to trouble my ſelf or you about this Matter, 'tis of more Importance to obſerve that their Want of <hi>Courage</hi> was owing to their Want of <hi>Religion.</hi> This is plainly intimated in the latter Clauſe of the Text, where 'tis ſaid of them, <hi>They kept not the Covenant of their God, and refuſed to walk in his Law.</hi> As GOD had choſen that People out of all the Nations of the Earth, to be a peculiar Treaſure to himſelf; ſo did he enter into <hi>Covenant</hi> with them by Sacrifice, wherein he engaged to be their GOD, and they engaged to be his People, promiſing that <hi>all which God ſhould ſay, they would hear and do.</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly being now in a peculiar Manner King in <hi>Jeſhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run,</hi> GOD gave his Laws to <hi>Jacob,</hi> and his Statutes and Ordinances to his People <hi>Iſrael</hi>: But alas, they ſoon <hi>deſpiſed the Oath, in breaking the Covenant, when lo, they had given God the Hand</hi>; they provoked GOD to Anger with their high Places, and moved Him to Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy with their graven Images. No wonder now <hi>they turned their Back</hi> on their Enemy, ſince they had turned their Back on GOD, and he on them: No wonder they were Cowards towards Men, being Guilty before GOD: No wonder they could not perform any martial Atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſince (in the Words of D. <hi>Hammond</hi>) they were armed with Bows, but not with Grace. The Words being thus introduced, we may ſpeak to them under the following Remarks, —
<list>

            <p n="1">I. <hi>There may be much of a martial</hi> Habit <hi>and</hi> Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, <hi>where there is nothing of a true martial</hi> Spirit. — I diſtinguiſh here between a mere martial Spirit, and a true martial one, or a Spirit of true Fortitude. The one is only natural Courage, which has its Foundation in the Conſtitution of the Body; the other is that juſt Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament and diſcreet Management of Courage, which is ſeated in the Mind. The one acts without Thought or Reflection, and ſo is little better than the Valour of a Brute; the other is the Product of Thought and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſo the Fortitude of a Philoſopher. I confeſs, that I have no need of this Diſtinction here; for which Reaſon I ſhall defer any Enlargement upon it. No need of it here, I ſay, becauſe there may be much of a martial <hi>Habit</hi> and <hi>Appearance</hi> where there is no martial <hi>Spirit</hi> at all, or none in Exerciſe.</p>
            <p>The martial Habit is eaſily procur'd, the red Coat worn, perhaps for no other End but to conceal a pallid Spirit, that is loth to appear; the glittering Sword eaſily put on, while the Man that ſhould draw it, cannot find his Hands: The Feather itſelf may wave upon the Hat of one, whoſe Head is equally light, and his Heart equally trembling. This may be the Signal of ſuperiour Favour, not of Courage; or it may be the Rights of external Succeſſion, where there is no Right founded on any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal valorous Diſpoſitions; yea, the Commiſſion, as well as the Habit, may be the Purchaſe of Money, to the juſt Infamy and Reproach both of Buyers and Sellers. I know here that Cuſtom will plead the Cauſe of theſe Perſons; but Cuſtom is a pitiful Advocate, where there is not ſomething in Reaſon for it; and a deſpicable one where Reaſon oppoſes it: In the preſent Caſe, to be ſure, it pleads with weak Nerves and inſipid Eloquence; taking
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:005969_0010_102718D77B9A9F08"/>
its Arguments from Covetouſneſs in one, falſe Honour in the other, a ſelfiſh Spirit in both, rather than a public Spiritneſs in either, or a due Regard to their Country's Welfare: The Conſequences of which may not only be eaſily conceived greatly miſchievous, but we have Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to fear that ſometimes in Fact the Sale of Commiſſions has been the Sale of a Country's Glory. Thus the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Habit and Commiſſion itſelf may be only the Tokens of Favour, the Right of Succeſſion, or the Purchaſe of Money; which neither ſuppoſe or acquire the martial Spirit, no more than a Lion's Skin will influence a Lion's Heart. Accordingly <hi>Ephraim,</hi> notwithſtanding his <hi>Bow</hi> and <hi>Armour,</hi> is repreſented by the Prophet as <hi>a ſilly Dove without Heart. (Hoſ.</hi> 7.11.) The Martial Spirit is not the Purchaſe of Money; but we may ſay of it as the Divine Oracles ſpeak of <hi>Love,</hi> if a Man would give <hi>all the Subſtance of his Houſe for it,</hi> it would <hi>utterly be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned</hi>: Nor is it the Effect of humane Favour; but a free Gift of the GOD of Nature, who is the Former of Man's Body and the Father of his Spirit, and has the Hearts of all Men in his Hand: Nor doth Courage merely depend upon GOD for its Being, but alſo for its Exerciſe. Accordingly, when GOD promiſes to give his People the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> inhabited by War-like Nations, he tells them, that He would <hi>ſend his Fear and Terror before them, ſo that their Enemies ſhould turn their Backs,</hi> Ex. 23.27. which Promiſe you find was made good, by the Account of <hi>Rahab,</hi> who informed the Spies, ſaying, <hi>Your Terror is fallen upon us; and all the Inhabitants of the Land faint becauſe of you: For we have heard what the Lord has done for you; and as ſoon as we had heard, our Hearts did melt, neither did there remain any more Courage in any Man becauſe of you.</hi> (Joſh. 2.9, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) Accordingly 'tis reported in the <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem Gemara</hi> (as quoted by the Biſhop of <hi>Eli</hi>) that the <hi>Girgaſhites</hi> particularly fled, at the Approach of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> into <hi>Africa</hi>; and that in the Days of <hi>Alexander</hi> they ſued
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:005969_0011_102718DA33C49040"/>
to be reſtored to the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> from whence they had been driven out. And as it has been with Nations collectively, ſo has it been with particular Perſons, even renowned Commanders themſelves; who have freely owned, that when no extraordinary Danger appeared, yet from ſome ſecret and unknown Cauſe, by ſome ſtrange Influence that came they knew not by what Means, nor how or why, their wonted Courage has fail'd, and their Hearts ſunk within them: So <hi>Hannibal,</hi> tho' in Sight of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet <hi>non Auſus est obſidere.</hi> I mention theſe Things to ſhow where our Dependance muſt be, as for the Principle, ſo for the Exerciſe of Courage, own in GOD alone, who is the Strength of our Hearts as well as Hands. But I intend not to dwell on this Propoſition, and truſt you will forgive me this Wrong. — So I paſs to my next Propoſition, which is,</p>
            <p n="2">II. That <hi>without the true martial</hi> Spirit, <hi>the Spirit of true</hi> Fortitude, <hi>the most ſhining Armour and glittering Appearance will</hi> avail nothing <hi>to the genuine Purpoſes of</hi> War.</p>
            <p>That I may lead your Thoughts into the proper Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of War, and the Neceſſity of true Fortitude, to anſwer thoſe Purpoſes; Let me begin with the Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the <hi>Lawfulneſs</hi> of <hi>War</hi>: This ſtands upon the Foot of <hi>Nature,</hi> and is juſtified by the Principle of Self-Preſervation, which the Divine Creator has implanted in us. We may range our Thoughts in the following man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; Two Perſons having each of them equal or indeed any Poſſeſſions, have an undoubted Right to what they poſſeſs; whether their Poſſeſſions be given 'em by the GOD of Nature, or acquired by their own Induſtry under the Smiles of the GOD of Providence; and neither of theſe Perſons has a Right to the other's Poſſeſſion: If one then endeavours to deprive the other of his Poſſeſſion, he uſurps a Right which he has not, and there being by that Suppoſition no eſtabliſhed Government, the latter has a
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:005969_0012_102718DBD4A6FCC0"/>
Right to defend his own Poſſeſſion, though it be at the Expence of the Life of the Uſurper. The Caſe is the ſame with Regard to two Nations: Their Men, their Merchandize their Territories are their own: If one then uſurps a Right over the other, the latter may juſtly draw the Sword in Vindication of its own Rights, and there being no ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Judicature on Earth, hereby appeal to the GOD of Heaven. Thus Nature will allow the uſe of the Sword, even the firſt drawing of it, ſince this is not properly the Commencement of the War, but only the juſt Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Uſurpation. — Nor doth the <hi>Revelation of</hi> GOD lay us under any interdict in this Matter; no, but leaves theſe Things juſt as it finds them: It labours indeed to take away the Cauſe; and were the Revelation fully and practically embraced, we ſhould ſoon find <hi>Wars</hi> to <hi>ceaſe on the Earth</hi>; but the Cauſe remaining, it juſtifies the Effect. So under the Old Teſtament Diſpenſation, GOD repreſents Himſelf as <hi>a Man of War,</hi> teaches his People's Hands to war, and their Fingers to fight, makes the Battle his own, fights for his People, aſſures them of and crowns them with Succeſs and Victory. And doth not the New Teſtament ſufficiently countenance War; notwithſtanding all that has been ſaid by the Followers of <hi>Socinus,</hi> or others of an Enthuſiaſtick Turn: Did <hi>John Baptist</hi> diſband the <hi>Soldiers,</hi> when they aſk'd him, <hi>What they ſhould do?</hi> Did our Saviour command the Officers to lay by their Commiſſions, and lay down their Swords, when he ſet himſelf before them as their Leader, and bid 'em follow him? By no means. And when our Saviour tells <hi>Pilate,</hi> that if <hi>his Kingdom were of this World, then would his Diſciples fight</hi>; doth not this legitimate a War, with Reſpect to the Kingdoms of this World? To all which we may add this Query; Doth not the Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of CHRIST in the Book of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> as having the <hi>Jus Gladii,</hi> as One who doth <hi>Judge and make War,</hi> whoſe <hi>Sword is on his Thigh,</hi> and whoſe <hi>Veſture is dipt in Blood,</hi> his being <hi>followed with Armies,</hi> and <hi>overcoming
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:005969_0013_102718DEAE0D98B8"/>
them that make War with him?</hi> doth not this Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Things, I ſay, not only point out the Deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of CHRIST's Enemies, but their Deſtruction by <hi>War,</hi> through the Power of <hi>his Armies,</hi> ſuch as are <hi>called and choſen and faithful?</hi>— But now, my Brethren, What will the ſhining Armour and the military Habit do to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſuch a Conqueſt, while the true martial Spirit is wanting? Are ſuch Men like to be <hi>called and choſen and faithful?</hi> Yea, what will they do towards any Conqueſt? Let us ſuppoſe theſe Perſons deſtitute not only of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, but of Natural Courage; let them look like Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and have all the Skill of Soldiers; yet Skill itſelf in this Caſe will be no better than Ignorance, not ſerve ſo much as to make a juſt Retreat: No, the want of Courage relaxes not only the Arms, but the Brains too, confounds the Underſtanding, and leaves the Man not only without Conqueſt over his Enemy, but without <hi>Rule over his own Spirit,</hi> and ſo <hi>like a City broken down and without Walls.</hi> 'Tis Courage that is the prime Requiſite of a Soldier, as ſuch. Tho' Arms and Skill in the Uſe of them are neceſſarily implyed; yet 'tis Courage that gives Life and Efficacy to every Thing elſe: This improves even Skill it ſelf, brightens the Underſtanding, guards every Avenue of Danger, watches every Advantage, draws the Bow of <hi>Ephraim</hi> with a ſtrong Hand, and directs the Arrow with a ſteady one: But now take Courage away, and what then becomes of the ſhining Armour, the martial Habit, and military Skill? To what Purpoſes of War do theſe ſerve, unleſs to brighten the Enemy's Conqueſt, and adorn their Triumph? Theſe Men, as the <hi>five Kings</hi> that warred with <hi>Joſhua,</hi> act like themſelves, while they ſeek their Refuge in <hi>Caves</hi> and <hi>Dens</hi>; and meet with their juſt Doom when the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror, like <hi>Joſhua,</hi> commands his Captains to <hi>tread upon their Necks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now let us alter the Ballances, and to the military Armour, Skill and Habit, let us add natural Courage
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:005969_0014_102718E084F0CD10"/>
too, yet without <hi>true</hi> Fortitude will theſe Things do nothing towards anſwering the true Purpoſes of War. We have, my Brethren, already aſſerted the Lawfulneſs of War; but it is not every War that is lawful; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps no Offenſive one, properly ſo called. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> indeed war'd againſt the Inhabitants of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and took their Land for a Prey. But the War was <hi>not theirs,</hi> but <hi>GOD</hi>'s; who being juſtly offended at the <hi>Meaſure of their Iniquities,</hi> which was now <hi>full,</hi> had a Right to puniſh the Offenders, and employ whom He pleas'd as the Inſtruments of his Vengeance. Had they not by their Iniquities commenc'd a War with GOD, he had not come out in Battle againſt them. This Example then will not juſtify an offenſive War; unleſs ſuch an One as is entered into for the Recovery of thoſe Rights that a Nation has been robb'd of; which is therefore improperly call'd Offenſive. But now if we examine the Generality of Wars that have been upon the the Earth; for what Ends have they been under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, unleſs to ſatiate Ambition, and glut the Maw of Covetouſneſs, to ſpread the Fame of Conquerors, and convey their Glory to Poſterity, as if after Death, they were to have the pleaſing Senſe that their Glory was was yet alive? What elſe were the Wars of <hi>Alexander</hi> and of <hi>Caeſar</hi>? Were they not to enlarge their Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, or ſee how far they could carry their Swords, how many Widows they cou'd make, how much Blood they could ſhed, how many Slaves they cou'd conſtitute! For ſuch baſe and ſordid Ends, Millions have been made a Sacrifice; but a Sacrifice without Mercy; yea, Mercy it ſelf was ſacrificed to their ungodly Luſts. How ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble was that in <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> which <hi>Suetonius</hi> reports? <hi>Animadverſâ apud</hi> Herculis <hi>Templum, magni</hi> Alexandri <hi>imagine, ingemuit; quaſi pertaeſus Ignaviam ſuam, quod nihil dum â ſe Memorabile Actum eſſet, in Aetate quâ jam</hi> Alexander <hi>Orbem Terrarum ſubegiſſet.</hi> Here was his End, to do ſomething <hi>Memorable,</hi> without any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:005969_0015_102718E6AB3AF0B8"/>
to the moral Nature of the Thing, whether good or bad. But now the true Purpoſe and genuine End of War is <hi>Peace</hi>; in the Language of <hi>Cicero, Ita Bellum ſuſcipiatur, ut nihil aliud quam Pax quaeſita, Videatur.</hi> This End is noble, generous and publick ſpirited, worthy the higheſt Reaſon of Man, worthy of CHRIST that glorious Peace-Maker between GOD and Man, and worthy of that GOD, one of whoſe amiable Characters is, that He is the <hi>GOD of Peace.</hi>— The Thing then implied in the Propoſition is the Neceſſity of true Fortitude to anſwer the genuine and only proper Deſign of War.</p>
            <p>Here you demand, what is this <hi>Fortitude?</hi> You may remember, that under my firſt Propoſition I touch'd on the Diſtinction between natural Courage and true Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude: Here let me a little enlarge, and ſay, That natural Courage, which properly ſpeaking, is nothing but Strength with a Plerophory of animal Spirits, is mere Conſtitution, owing to the Mechaniſm of our bodily Nature, the Structure of the Solids, and the Temperament of the Fluids; but this is no more a Virtue (and ſo it is that I am here conſidering of Fortitude, as a moral Virtue) to enjoy, than it is a Vice to want it. This indeed often paſſes under the Name of Fortitude, merely becauſe it deſpiſes Danger: And when it has puſh'd Men on to ſome bold Attempts, which have been crowned with Succeſs, it has a World of Eloquence proſtituted in its Praiſe. When at the ſame Time all Mankind muſt own, that ſeparating the Succeſs from the Attempt, it would be called by its right Name, that of criminal Raſhneſs: Such Folly is in Man, to judge of Things by their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, as if this alone alter'd the Nature of them, and made that a Virtue at one Time, which would be a Fault at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Much of this natural Courage there may be where there is not the leaſt true Fortitude: this the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> demonſtrated, when they dar'd to aſſault the <hi>Amorites,</hi> tho' God himſelf had forbidden 'em, aſſuring
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:005969_0016_102718E845192D00"/>
that they ſhould not proſper. On the other Hand, there may be much of true Fortitude, where there is little or nothing of natural Courage: So Multitudes <hi>out of Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs were made ſtrong, turned to flight the Armies of Aliens</hi>; and when they could not conquer, ſubmitted to the greateſt Tortures with an unbroken Mind, and even dar'd to <hi>die.</hi> — By this Time it may be known what I underſtand by true Fortitude: It is that Virtue of Mind, by which upon ſolid and rational Principles, we are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd nobly to withſtand any Oppoſitions, encounter any Dangers, endure any Hardſhips, and ſubmit to any Sufferings, when they cannot be avoided <hi>ſalva Veritate &amp; Conſcientia,</hi> with the Preſervation of Truth and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. The Foundation of Fortitude is Principle, the Path of it is Duty, let the End or Succeſs be what it will. By theſe Deſcriptions you ſee that 'tis not natural Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, any more than natural Fear, but the juſt Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of both, in a Readineſs to encounter any Dangers, or ſubmit to any Sufferings we are called to. Natural Courage may ruſh into a thouſand Dangers, which Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude forbids becauſe they are needleſs: Natural Fear may ſhun as many Dangers, which Fortitude commands us to encounter, becauſe they are Matters of Duty. True Fortitude then regulates Courage on the one Hand, and ſubdues Fear on the other. Some indeed ſeem to think that Fortitude and Fear are inconſiſtent: This doubtleſs is a great Miſtake; ſince the moſt timerous may acquire the Character of the true Hero, in the juſt Management of his Fears, and has the beſt Right to that Character in Proportion to thoſe Fears which his Fortitude overcomes. Have not we an eminent Inſtance of the Conſiſtency there is between Fear and Fortitude in the three <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies, <hi>Shadrach, Meſheck,</hi> and <hi>Abednego?</hi> To ſay, that theſe Perſons were deſtitute of Fear, when they found an haughty Monarch threatning of and the maddeſt Flames preparing for them, is to ſay, that they belied their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and renounced their Humanity; but when by a
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:005969_0017_102718E9ED1E1C20"/>
due Management of their Fears, which they ſubjected to the Cauſe of Reaſon, Religion, and of GOD, they nobly replied, <hi>O Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to anſwer thee in this Matter: If it be ſo, our GOD, whom we ſerve, is able to deliver us from the burning fiery Furnace, and he will deliver us out of thine Hand, O King: But if not, be it known to thee, O King, that we will not ſerve thy Gods, nor worſhip the golden Image which thou hast ſet up.</hi> (Dan. 3.16, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) Here was a Fortitude triumphing over Fear, a Fortitude far exceeding that of an <hi>Alexander,</hi> or a <hi>Caeſar.</hi> Yes, they lov'd their Lives, but they lov'd their GOD more, with a Love <hi>ſtrong as Death,</hi> which many Waters could not quench, Floods drown, nor Fire conſume. Here was more true Heroiſm than in <hi>Cato,</hi> who when he could not conquer was too much of a Coward to live under the Shame of being conquer'd. But in the God-Man, our Lord JESUS CHRIST, this Conſiſtency between Fear and Fortitude appears in ſtrong and amiable Colours: <hi>He feared,</hi> ſo ſays the Apoſtle, Yes, and in the greatneſs of his Fear <hi>prayed, that the bitter Cup might paſs from him</hi>; yet how did his Fortitude overcome his Fears, when he ſet his Face to go up to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the Scene of Sufferings and of Blood, went <hi>before</hi> his Diſciples, as one that was in haſte, was <hi>ſtraitned</hi> till this <hi>Baptiſm</hi> of Blood ſhould be accompliſhed; and when his Hour was come, he made that his Choice, which could not have been his Neceſſity, bowing his ſacred Shoulders to the accurſed <hi>Croſs,</hi> that had the Weight of all the Sins of GOD's Elect laid upon it! Thus is Fortitude conſiſtent with Fear.</p>
            <p>Now this Fortitude, My Brethren, is neceſſary to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the juſt Purpoſes of <hi>War</hi>; and indeed the whole Management of it. This directs the <hi>End,</hi> guards a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt every Thing mean and ſelfiſh, diſdains the falſe Plumage of Ambition, and abhors the Graſp of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, and only ſounds the Trump of War for the Deſtruction of thoſe Luſts, which hinder Peace on the
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:005969_0018_102718ED44A3E590"/>
Earth. This, again, befriends the juſt <hi>Management</hi> of War; preſerving the Mind in a ſweet Calm, in Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to thoſe Perturbations, which natural Fear, or mere natural Courage excites. This prepares the Mind for Victory, on the one Hand, or a Defeat on the other; for Life, or for Death. Are our Arms proſperous, it ſuffers no undue Elation of Mind in our ſelves; far leſs, Inclemency towards others. Cowardize is generally Cruel; but Fortitude alway Mercifull: It can weep over the Miſeries, which it ſelf occaſions; and as <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> did by his Friend, pull off the Linnen Crown, to bind up the Wounds of an Enemy. But the Glory of Fortitude, like that of GOD, ſhines thro' the darkeſt Cloud; it doth not like <hi>Bajazet,</hi> foam and fret, curſe it's Diſappointments, and gnaw it's Chains; far from this, it ſubmits to thoſe unhappy Things it could not avoid, and amidſt Bonds and Impriſonments, can make that it's Language, <hi>None of theſe Things move me, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther count I my Life dear</hi>: 'Tis Satisfaction eno' to have endeavour'd my Duty, and leave the Event with GOD.</p>
            <p>But I haſten to my laſt Propoſition,</p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>The beſt Method of</hi> obtaining <hi>this Fortitude, is, the Practice of true</hi> Religion. — I ſay, the <hi>Practice</hi> of true Religion, in Contradiſtinction to the mere <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> of it; the <hi>Power of Godlineſs,</hi> not the mere <hi>Form.</hi> The latter <hi>Ephraim</hi> had, but not the former; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>turned their Back in the Day of Battle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Guilt, my Brethren, is the Parent of Cowardize. No ſooner had <hi>Adam</hi> fallen, but he <hi>hides</hi> himſelf in the <hi>Trees of the Garden,</hi> and confeſſes to GOD, <hi>I was afraid, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I was naked,</hi> ſtrip'd of my Robes of Innocence. So <hi>Cain</hi> having ſlain his Brother, immediately ſiez'd by Fear and Trembling, and with a Coward's Voice crys out, <hi>Every one that findeth me will ſlay me.</hi> This is always the Caſe; but Guilt contracted by the Violation
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:005969_0019_102718F12476BB68"/>
of <hi>Covenant-Bonds,</hi> has a peculiar Tendency to make the Hands weak, and the Heart faint. GOD then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears at the Head of the Enemy, to eſpouſe the <hi>Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel</hi> of his broken <hi>Covenant.</hi> No wonder then our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies appear as Giants and we as Graſhoppers; and that a View of that Covenant, which with our Hand we have ſigned, and of that Vengeance, which by our Guilt we have challeng'd, ſhould make our Hearts melt within us. <hi>Ephraim</hi> might perhaps remember that Threatning of the Covenant in Caſe of Diſobedience, <hi>that they ſhould flee before their Enemies</hi>; and the very Remembrance might haſten its Fulfilment. But if they did not, yet the <hi>Terror</hi> itſelf was Part of GOD's threaten'd Anger. — On the other Hand true Religion is the Friend of the beſt Courage. <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.1. <hi>The Wicked flee when no Man purſueth; but the Righteous is bold as a Lion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Two Things here demand an Enquiry.—Firſt, In what <hi>Reſpects</hi> is the Practice of Religion friendly to the Spirit of Fortitude. And, Secondly, By what <hi>Means</hi> is it ſo.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>In what</hi> Reſpects <hi>is the Practice of Religion friendly to the Spirit of Fortitude?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. As it <hi>Removes</hi> the main <hi>Obſtructions</hi> of true martial Courage. There are many Things which natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally as well as morally obſtruct the martial Spirit; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly here I might mention <hi>ſenſual Lusts,</hi> ſuch as Whoredom, Drunkeneſs, and the like. Wine in the moderate uſe of it, may indeed raiſe the Spirits; but ſure, in its Exceſs, <hi>Wine is a Mocker</hi>; and when <hi>Whoredom</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> go together, then in the Language of the Prophet, (<hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.11.) they <hi>take away the Heart,</hi> they relax the Nerves, effeminate the Mind, and emaſculate the whole Man, rendering him not only unfit for, but indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to the Hardſhips and Hazards of War. Whereas now Religion has taught its Votary to mortify theſe Limbs of the <hi>Old Man,</hi> to <hi>crucify the Fleſh,</hi> with its
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:005969_0020_102718F421D6C3F8"/>
Luſts and Affections: However he may have wallowed in theſe Luſts; yet now is he <hi>waſhed and ſanctify'd and juſtify'd in the Name of the Lord Jeſus, and by the Spirit of his God.</hi> And tho' the animal Appetite may yet be left within him, yet its Dominion, which was but for a Time, is taken away; if the <hi>Canaanites</hi> are in the Land, <hi>Iſrael</hi> is its Lord. — Again, An over-weening <hi>Fondneſs of Life,</hi> is another Obſtruction to the martial Spirit. Whoever over-rates his Life, muſt needs be ſuppos'd to over-rate that which indangers it; he looks upon Things through a falſe Perſpective, and by magnifying every Danger avoids all. The Conſequence is, that however the beſt Intereſts of his Country, Liberty, Learning and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion ly at Stake, he will have little Regard to theſe, ſince he prefers Life to 'em all. Let ſuch a Man, like <hi>Iſſachar,</hi> couch between Burdens; but ſure he is neither fit to draw the Bow of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> nor like, with <hi>Benjamin,</hi> to divide the Spoil. Far otherwiſe the true Soldier of JESUS CHRIST, he has weigh'd his Life in an even Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, and determined its true Value; he has parted with it intentionally, and is ready to part with it actually at the Call of his GOD, ſaying with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>My Soul is in mine Hand, yet do I not forget thy Law.</hi>— The <hi>Fear of Death</hi> is another great Obſtruction to the martial Spirit. Death is the <hi>King of Terrors,</hi> peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly ſo in the Field: there he appears in all his Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, terrible in Glory. To prevent or cure this Fear, ſome endeavour to extinguiſh all Tho't, and ſo ruſh like the Horſe into the Battle: While others preach to themſelves the Stoical-Doctrine of Fate, and are pleas'd to think, they ſhan't dy before their Time. However, 'tis hard to cancel theſe Fears, eſpecially where Guilt lies on the Conſcience uncancell'd by the Blood of Sprinkling, and there are any Proſpects of another World, where <hi>Hell</hi> follows the <hi>Pale Horſe.</hi> But now true Religion, as it makes Death familiar, ſo it abates it's Terror; and exalted Religion in a manner extinguiſhes
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:005969_0021_102718F60DAB11B8"/>
thoſe Fears. The chriſtian Soldier well knows, that his <hi>Captain</hi> has encountred Death, and onquer'd him, has entred into his Territorys, ſanctify'd and perfum'd 'em, and then taken an everlaſting Leave of 'em; and that having <hi>deſtroy'd Death,</hi> and <hi>him that had the Power of it, that is, the Devil,</hi> he has <hi>deliver'd</hi> them, who <hi>thro' Fear of Death, were ſubject unto Bondage.</hi> He therefore with a firm Courage, will ſay with <hi>David, Tho' I walk thro' the Valley of the Shadow of Death, I will fear no Evil</hi>: With <hi>Paul</hi> will inſult Death, ſaying, <hi>O Death, Where is thy Sting</hi>! 'Tis gone, 'tis gone, thou mayeſt hiſs, but canſt not hurt. Yea, he may glory in Death, as knowing that this is Part of the Chriſtian's Inventory: Yes, not only <hi>Life</hi> is <hi>yours,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, but <hi>Death</hi> too; the one to fit you for Heaven, and the other to tranſlate you into it. Thus Religion removes the main Obſtructions of martial Courage.</p>
            <p n="2">2. True Religion <hi>inſpires</hi> the Man with <hi>Courage.</hi> — This it doth (1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>) By it's <hi>Precepts.</hi> As CHRIST our Leader bore his own <hi>Croſs,</hi> and was <hi>made perfect thro' Sufferings,</hi> ſo is the Word of Command given forth to all his Followers, <hi>Take up the Croſs</hi>; this Word every true Chriſtian Soldier hears and obeys: Having weigh'd the Advantages of Religion in one Scale, and it's Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantages in the other, he wiſely <hi>reckons, that all the Sufferings of this preſent Time are not worthy to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd with the Glory that is to be revealed in us.</hi> And therefore he chooſes CHRIST with a Croſs, before the World with a Crown, and ſo becomes a Martyr in Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution; yea, he is actually ſo, having learned to <hi>take up his Croſs daily,</hi> by a gracious Encounter with all the Evils and Adverſities of Life: Theſe Things are what he allots upon, is prepared for, and engaged in. If he is not called with <hi>Paul</hi> to fight with Beaſts at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> he engages 'em nigher home: nor doth he only <hi>wreſtle with Fleſh and Blood</hi>; but <hi>with Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palities
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:005969_0022_102718FBB8B902E8"/>
and Powers and ſpiritual Wickedneſſes in high Places.</hi> Satan is daily making War upon him; but he <hi>overcomes thro' the Blood of the Lamb.</hi> In a word, he is daily batt'ling with himſelf; which requires more Courage, than to fight with others: He <hi>keeps under his Body,</hi> and combats with his <hi>Spirit,</hi> to ſubdue the <hi>Luſts of the Mind,</hi> as well as of the <hi>Fleſh</hi>: And ſurely <hi>greater is he that hath rule over his own Spirit, than he that taketh a City.</hi> — If it be ſaid here, that this Courage is of a ſpiritual Nature; 'tis granted, it is ſpiritual in it's Principle; but yet being drawn out to it's proper length, will diſpoſe us to encounter any Enemy, and plunge into the greateſt Dangers of a temporal Nature. He that has the true <hi>Fear of GOD</hi> in it's lively Exerciſe, will not be <hi>afraid of Man that ſhall die,</hi> and the <hi>Son of Man that is as Graſs.</hi> The ſame Courage that dares to dy for CHRIST, will diſpoſe us to <hi>play the Man for the Cities of our GOD,</hi> eſpecially when Religion it ſelf is in Danger. Accordingly, primitive Chriſtianity will fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh us with numberleſs Inſtances, in which, not only the naturally Brave and Valiant, but the moſt Timerous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Magnanimous; the aged Matron, and the tender Virgin were inſpired with ſuch an holy Courage, that they <hi>choſe</hi> to <hi>ſuffer Affliction</hi> and Torture, any that the moſt ingenious Malice cou'd contrive, and the moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged Power inflict, <hi>rather than Sin.</hi> And the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Soldiers were the beſt Veterans, ever ready to obey their Emperors and Generals, while they cou'd keep a good Conſcience: But yet they had Courage eno', to let them know that they wou'd not obey them, when to do ſo, might be conſtrued Diſobedience to GOD. It was not all the Artifice of a ſubtle <hi>Julian,</hi> the Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of one Emperor, or the Promiſes of another, that cou'd ſeduce 'em from their Allegiance to their chief Captain, the <hi>Lord of Hoſts</hi>: They nobly anſwer'd 'em in ſuch Language as this; "You threaten us with Fire, unleſs we obey; but this laſts but for an Hour: But
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:005969_0023_102718FD51F8D098"/>
GOD threatens our Diſobedience to him with a Fire that ſhall never be extinguiſh'd: You promiſe Parts and Portions of the World; but we have already renounc'd the whole of it: Give us ſomething more, or you take away more than you promiſe to give." — But this leads me to ſay, (2<hi rend="sup">dly</hi>) Religion inſpires Courage by it's <hi>Promiſes.</hi> By Promiſes here is to be underſtood ſuch as reſpect the divine Influence and Protection. The Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of GOD to every Believer, is like that to <hi>Abraham</hi> the Father of the Faithful, <hi>Fear not,</hi> Abraham; <hi>I am thy Shield. —A Thouſand ſhall fall at thy Side, and ten Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand at thy right Hand; but there ſhall no Evil befall thee. Becauſe thou haſt made the</hi> LORD <hi>thy Habitation, he ſhall give his Angels charge over thee.</hi> By this I mean not, that a good Man has any particular Aſſurance, that he ſhall not fall in the Heat of Battle; but that there is that general Encouragement in the divine Promiſes, which is ſufficient to animate him to the greateſt Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips and ſharpeſt Conflicts. Accordingly you find the holy <hi>Pſalmist</hi> would not <hi>trust in his Sword, and in his Bow,</hi> but <hi>boaſted in the Lord all the Day long.</hi> He often expreſſes the <hi>Boldneſs of Faith</hi> in ſuch Language as this, <hi>Thou,</hi> LORD, <hi>art my Shield and Buckler, my Glory and the lifter up of my Head: I will not be afraid of Ten Thouſand of the People that have ſet themſelves against me.</hi> No, <hi>The</hi> LORD <hi>is my Light and my Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whom ſhall I fear? GOD is our Refuge and Strength, a very preſent Help in Trouble; therefore will we not fear, though the Earth be removed, and though the Mountains be carried into the midst of the Sea, though the Waters thereof roar and be troubled, though the Mountains ſhake with the ſwelling thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Once more,</p>
            <p n="3">3. True Religion <hi>regulates</hi> our Courage. — 'Tis not ſufficient for a Soldier that he have Courage, unleſs it be under a due Regulation. Without this it ceaſes to be virtuous, and differs as much from true Fortitude, as
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:005969_0024_10271900051141A8"/>
a Flaſh of Gun-powder from the glowing ſteady Heat of a well-kindled Fire. Let the Succeſs of Courage be what it will, there is no other Praiſe to be given it, than what <hi>Seneca</hi> gives <hi>Alexander,</hi> when he ſays, <hi>pro Virtute erat felix Temeritas,</hi> the Succeſs of Raſhneſs was his Virtue. But now 'tis the Glory of Religion, that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulates Courage. — This it doth, (1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>) As to the <hi>Principle</hi> of military Actions. And here as the <hi>Grace of God teaches us to deny all Ungodlineſs and worldly Lusts,</hi> ſo doth it not ſuffer us to draw the Sword, upon the Principles of Covetouſneſs and Ambition. Thoſe therefore, who by a miſplaced Eloquence have been celebrated as the great Heroes of the World, Religion condemns as the great Murderers of it; ranking them among the Men who <hi>love Violence,</hi> and <hi>delight in War,</hi> the <hi>Men of Blood,</hi> whom GOD'<hi>s So<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ateth.</hi> Religion allows us to defend our own Rights; but not to invade thoſe of others. It will juſtify us in fighting for our Religion; but not in fighting againſt the Religion of others, tho' it be ever ſo falſe: In taking up the <hi>Croſs</hi>; but no <hi>Cruſades</hi>; this is Chriſtian, that Antichriſtian. An holy War, in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Senſe, is but a Baſtard, begot by the Devil upon Luſt and Cruelty. — Again, (2<hi rend="sup">dly</hi>) Religion regulates our Courage as to its <hi>Exerciſe</hi>; teaching us when to ſhun Dangers, and when to meet and encounter them. I am not inſenſible indeed, that in the primitive Times many of the Chriſtians diſcover'd an irregular Courage: They ſometimes broke into Priſon, when they would have ſcorn'd to break out of it: Sufferings and Death ſeem'd to approach 'em with leaden Heels, and a ſlow Pace; and therefore they met 'em more than half Way; courted the burning Flames, and too earneſtly long'd for the Crown of Martyrdom. But this Irregularity was the Fault of the Chriſtians, not of Chriſtianity. The <hi>Captain of our Salvation</hi> has indeed bid us <hi>take up the Croſs,</hi> but not to run after it: Far from this, he has commanded us, when <hi>perſecuted in
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:005969_0025_102719019E859558"/>
one City,</hi> to <hi>flee to another</hi>; and when we can fly no farther, with a good Conſcience, then to ſubmit to thoſe Sufferings, which in Honour to Him we cannot avoid. Yes, there muſt be a good Call, as well as a good Cauſe; or elſe our Sufferings are not juſtifiable. We are not to ſteal the Croſs: If ſo, what are we but Thieves upon it? In which Caſe, how can we expect the Applauſe of our Lord? I mean not, my Brethren, to ſpeak a Word againſt the Courage and Zeal of the primitive Chriſtians, ſo far as it was true: Would to GOD, that we might ſee primitive Chriſtianity reviv'd, and the Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to her <hi>first Love,</hi> and to <hi>the firſt Works,</hi> from whence ſhe is fallen, in Degree, as far as ſhe is diſtant in Time: But yet doubtleſs there was not an exact Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of Chriſtian Men to Chriſtian Principles, and wherein they were irregular, they are not to be imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated.— But I muſt haſten more briefly to enquire,</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>By what</hi> Means <hi>doth Chriſtianity befriend the Spirit of true Fortitude?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here, my Brethren, let me only point you to the Promiſes of the Goſpel, thoſe <hi>exceeding great and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Promiſes, which are given us, that by them we might be made Partakers of the Divine Nature.</hi> Our great Leader and Commander, though he has an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Right to the Obedience of his Soldiers, yet doth not bid 'em ſerve him for nought; no, he has <hi>ſet a Joy before them,</hi> enough to Reward all the Toil and Fatigue of the longeſt Life. We fight not for the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe of Men, the Acclamations of the People, which as they are often unjuſtly beſtowed, ſo afford no preſent Satisfaction to the Mind, and then periſh in a Moment: No, 'tis the Approbation of an holy GOD and Saviour, ecchoed from the golden Harps of Angels and Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angels, that animates and inſpires us. We fight not for Money, that will poorly pay for the Anguiſh of broken Bones, ſhatter'd Limbs, and mangled Bodies, which
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:005969_0026_10271903C5E425F0"/>
alſo are oftimes accompanied with wounded Conſciences: But we have an Inheritance before us large as our Wiſhes, and long as our Duration, or the Duration of GOD him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; an Inheritance, not to comfort us under Pain, but which eternally frees from it. — We fight not for a <hi>corruptible Crown,</hi> periſhing Laurels; but for a <hi>Crown of Righteouſneſs,</hi> a <hi>Crown of Life,</hi> a Crown whoſe Glory ſhall never fade away. Yes, if we <hi>ſuffer with</hi> CHRIST, it is that we alſo may be <hi>glorified together.</hi> We have the Word and Honour of CHRIST, <hi>To him that overcometh, will I grant to ſit with me in my Throne, even as I alſo overcame and am ſet down with my Father in his Throne.</hi> Revel. 3.21. Such is the Chriſtian's Encouragement: and 'tis the manifold Grace of the Divine Spirit, faſtning upon, embracing of, and delighting in this Encouragement, that excites the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Spirit, inſpires with the beſt Fortitude, fits the Chriſtian for and urges him on to the boldeſt Atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Faith ſees the Promiſes with a ſtrong Eye: Yes, <hi>Faith is the Subſtance of Things hoped for, and the Evidence of Things not ſeen.</hi> Love embraces them with a vigorous Arm; and Hope has a firm Expectation of the promis'd Bleſſedneſs. In the Exerciſe of theſe Graces the Saints have ſometimes <hi>eſcaped the Edge of the Sword</hi>; and ſometimes drawn it, to the <hi>ſubduing of Kingdoms</hi>: Even the <hi>Weak</hi> have been made <hi>ſtrong,</hi> and the Strong become Victorious, <hi>waxing Valiant in Fight,</hi> and <hi>turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Flight the Armies of the Aliens.</hi> At other Times, when GOD called 'em to ſuffer, the <hi>Spirit of God and of Glory reſted upon 'em</hi>; they had <hi>Trial of cruel Mockings, Scourgings, Bonds, and Impriſonments,</hi> were <hi>deſtitute, afflicted, tormented</hi>; and yet ſuperiour to all their Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, Triumphant in and over them.</p>
            <p>But I am ſenſible, 'tis Time to draw towards a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion. And with regard to the Congregation in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, allow me to apply the Words of the Preacher,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:005969_0027_10271908C3F08798"/>
               <hi>Let us hear the Concluſion of the whole Matter; Fear GOD, and keep his Commandments; for this is the whole of Man.</hi> This is his whole Duty, this is the Way to his entire and eternal Bleſſedneſs. This ſecures Peace with GOD, thro' JESUS CHRIST, and Peace with our own Conſcience, under the ſprinkling of a Saviour's Blood: This eſtabliſhes Peace with others, where 'tis enjoyed; and obtaining it, where it is wanted. <hi>Our Peace ſhall</hi> then <hi>be as a River, and our Righteouſneſs as the Waves of the Sea.</hi> Or if others war againſt us, it will procure Victory over them: So GOD himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates in that Language, <hi>O that my People had heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to me, and</hi> Iſrael <hi>had walked in my Ways! I ſhould ſoon have ſubdued their Enemies, and turned my Hand againſt their Adverſaries. Happy wouldſt thou be, O</hi> Iſrael, <hi>a People ſaved of the Lord, who is the Shield of thine Help, and the Sword of thine Excellency.</hi> — But the preſent Occaſion warrants a particular Addreſs to the honourable Company of <hi>Artillery,</hi> who have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited us this Day into the Houſe of our GOD, that they might hear ſome Part of the divine Counſels, in anſwer that Queſtion of the Soldiers, <hi>What muſt</hi> WE <hi>do?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>GENTLEMEN,</p>
            <p>'Tis juſtly eſteem'd an Inſtance of <hi>Spartan</hi> Wiſdom in our excellent Forefathers, who inſtituted your Order, form'd your Company, and gave you a Charter, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining ſpecial Rights and Priviledges. Their Deſign in diſtinguiſhing you, doubtleſs was, that you might diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh your ſelves: not ſo much by your Habit, as by your Skill; not ſo much by your martial Arms, as by your martial Spirit; that from you, as from a River, the Streams of Skill and Valour might flow thro' all the Militia of the Land, gladning the Cities of our GOD in their Proſpects of Defence.— And your Deſign in aſking the Prieſt to ſound the Trumpet, is, I truſt; that by the Word or GOD and Prayer, your Arms may be
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:005969_0028_1027190A7364A590"/>
conſecrated, your Courage ſupported, regulated by For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and ſanctified by Grace. And truly, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> Such Fortitude was never more neceſſary, than at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. Our Times are the Times of War: If we look abroad, we find Nation riſing up againſt Nation, and Kingdom againſt Kingdom. <hi>To Arms, To Arms,</hi> has been the horrid Cry, which has long reſounded from Shore to Shore, and from one Nation to another: The Conſequences of which have been wounding to the Ear, and ſhocking to the Eye. How many a diſtant Field, wherein ſcarce any Thing is to be heard, but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed Noiſe of Warriors, ſounding Drums, burſting Guns, hollow Moans, piteous Groans; and nothing to be ſeen but Smoke and Fire above, but Blood and Slaughter covering the Field below. And if we come nigher Home, we find our ſelves incompaſs'd with Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, Enemys threatning us by Sea and aſſaulting us by Land. How much of our Subſtance has been waſted! How many of our Lands vacated! How many of our Brethren of the Inland-Frontiers, are now mourning in Captivity! <hi>The Lord hear the Sighing of the Priſoner!</hi> How many others are fallen by the Hands of an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, whoſe tender Mercies are cruelty! And what Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes are yet carrying their Soul in their Hand; to ſecure their Subſtance, are jeoparding their Lives! And ſhould we extend our Proſpects forward, may we not without a Spirit of Prophecy, venture to ſay, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Expedition againſt an envious and jealous Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour go on, coming Wars will produce another <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> in <hi>America</hi>; that Army will be found contending with Army in our own Frontiers, and Multitudes of our own Children with their Garments roll'd in Blood! In ſuch a Situation of Affairs, 'tis mournful to think, there is ſo little of a martial Spirit to be found among us. Ah, Where is the Spirit of a <hi>Standiſh, Winſlow, Church, March, Lovewell,</hi> and many others, whoſe warlike Atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in former Times have conſecrated their Names,
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:005969_0029_1027190F2019AAA8"/>
and embalmed their Memories! What, did their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit die with them! and can there be no Reſurrection of it, eſpecially when the Government has ſo nobly exerted it ſelf herefor! Sure, the whole Diſpenſation of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence points us to the Neceſſity of a martial Spirit. The Language of GOD at this Day is that; <hi>Wake up ye mighty Men, prepare the War, anoint the Shield, beat your Plow-ſhears into Swords,</hi> and <hi>your Pruning-books into Spears, let the Weak ſay, I am ſtrong.</hi> But then, as we have heard, The martial Spirit muſt be accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with the religious one. 'Tis the want of this, that has drawn the Sword of GOD, and bath'd it in the Blood of Men. Yes, verily the Nations warring with one another is a Proof that GOD is contending with them; and whoever conſiders the melancholy State of Religion, either at Home or abroad, will find no Reaſon to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that <hi>GOD has whet his glittering Sword,</hi> and that <hi>his Hand hath taken hold on Judgment.</hi> Without this, I mean <hi>pure and undefiled Religion,</hi> we have nothing to expect, either from Skill or Valour. This then let me preſs, in a Manner that ſhall comprehend all Ranks and Orders of Men, but with a particular Eye to the Men of military Character. 'Tis not, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> becauſe I queſtion your Courage, that I have addreſs'd you this Day from ſuch a Text; but that I might be Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental of enobling it, by urging on you the Practice of Religion: This will put a Glory on your Courage, and give you Confidence of Succeſs. Here I ſhall mention but two Words of Command; both of which comes from your great Leader, even Him of whom the Father by a Voice from Heaven has ſaid, <hi>This is my beloved Son, hear Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi> Place then, <hi>Take up the Croſs.</hi> Let none think this a Duty incumbent only on the primitive Chriſtians, that were expos'd to Perſecution from the Civil Magiſtrate, who hated their Religion, though
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:005969_0030_10271912EB6D8DC0"/>
without a Cauſe. No, This is a Duty that runs par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel with Chriſtianity, and remains in its binding Force and Power till CHRIST ſhall come with his Crown. 'Tis not, I grant, every Croſs that a Man bears which will denominate the Obedience CHRIST demands, or intitle to the Reward he promiſes. Moſt Men make Croſſes for themſelves; in which Caſe they are Martyrs only to their own Folly. 'Tis well worthy our Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, that what is expreſs'd in one Evangeliſt by <hi>taking up the Croſs,</hi> is interpreted by another, by taking up <hi>his</hi> Croſs. <hi>Diſtinguit Crucem</hi> (ſays <hi>Aretius) hac Você</hi>; ſuam <hi>non Alienam Crucem affectare debemus.</hi> Yes, every Man has <hi>his</hi> Croſs; and Chriſtianity obliges him to take it up.</p>
            <p>This intends, <hi>firſt,</hi> The <hi>battl'ing</hi> with and <hi>ſubduing</hi> of thoſe <hi>Enemies</hi> that oppoſe the Deſigns of the <hi>Croſs of</hi> CHRIST. The Chriſtian Life is a Warfare; every Chriſtian, a Soldier by Profeſſion. At Baptiſm, he enters his Name in CHRIST's Muſter-Roll: And whenever he receives the other Sacrament, he takes an Oath of Allegiance and Fidelity to CHRIST, his Captain and his King. Now the Idea of a Soldier ſuppoſes Enemies: And the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of his Profeſſion is to conquer and deſtroy 'em. Agreably, this is our Caſe; the gracious Deſign of CHRIST is to train us up by the Exerciſes of Holineſs, for the Enjoyment of Himſelf in Bleſſedneſs. But alas, How many Enemies oppoſe this Deſign; ſome Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, ſome Carnal; rank'd under various Heads, and Potentates; <hi>the Luſt of the Eye, the Luſt of the Fleſh, and the Pride of Life!</hi> Theſe are dangerous Enemies; and the more ſo, for pretending Friendſhip to us. They appear delicate as <hi>Agag,</hi> that we are loth to annoy 'em; and then they are akin to us, born and bred up with us, and by long Acquaintance and mutual Indulgences, they are as a <hi>right Hand,</hi> or a <hi>right Eye.</hi> Now to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe theſe Enemies, to conquer and ſubdue 'em, this is like <hi>cutting off</hi> the right Hand, the working, uſeful,
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:005969_0031_102719148545F1F0"/>
honourable Hand; yea, 'tis like <hi>plucking out</hi> the right Eye, which requires great Self-denial, and puts to much Pain. This is killing, crucifying Work; but yet abſolutely neceſſary. Hence that of the Apoſtle; <hi>Mortify your Members which are upon the Earth, Fornication, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs, inordinate Affection, evil Concupiſcence, and Covetouſneſs, which is Idolatry; for which Things ſake the Wrath of GOD, cometh on the Children of Diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,</hi> (Coloſ. 3.5, 6.) In Compliance with which, the true Chriſtian, like his Maſter, is a crucified Man: Accordingly the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>I am crucified with</hi> CHRIST; and gives this as the Character of every true Chriſtian, <hi>They that are</hi> CHRIST<hi>'s have crucified the Fleſh,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>ſecondly,</hi> Taking up the Croſs, implys a <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Submiſſion</hi> to thoſe <hi>ſorrowful Things,</hi> which we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceieve at the Hand of GOD; and a <hi>cheerful Acceptance</hi> of thoſe Sufferings and Perſecutions, which he permits the Malice or Wickedneſs of <hi>Men</hi> to bring upon us:— In all the Afflictions which come from the Hand of GOD, ſaying, <hi>The Cup which my heavenly Father has prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for me, ſhall I not take it,</hi> tho' it be with a trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling Hand! <hi>Shall I not drink it,</hi> tho' with an aking Heart! <hi>Father, not as I will, but as thou wilt.</hi>— There are other Troubles proceeding from <hi>Men,</hi> and theſe are diſtinguiſh'd into thoſe which reſult from the Pride or Envy, Malice or Ill-Nature of others, in reſpect of our <hi>Perſons,</hi> and thoſe which are brought upon us on Account of <hi>Religion.</hi> In the former Caſe, we are <hi>in Patience</hi> to <hi>poſſeſs our Souls</hi>; while that is the Language of our Mouths, <hi>Let</hi> Shimei <hi>Curſe</hi>:— In the latter, not mere Patience, but Cheerfulneſs and Joy becomes us. So the Command of CHRIST, <hi>When they ſhall revile you, and ſay all manner of Evil againſt you falſly for my ſake, rejoice and be exceeding glad.</hi> Accordingly we find the Saints ſinging in a Priſon, <hi>rejoycing that they were coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted worthy to ſuffer Shame for the Name of</hi> CHRIST, and <hi>to fill up that which was behind of his Sufferings.</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We are to take up the Croſs, as that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends a <hi>Readineſs</hi> to undergo <hi>Death</hi> itſelf, whenever GOD ſhall call us hereto. True indeed we are not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily called to <hi>reſist unto Blood</hi>: Yet we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be ready herefor at the divine Call; and without this Readineſs, founded upon deliberate Tho't and Reſolution, through the Grace of CHRIST, we ſhall be in Danger of deſerting our Lord, like <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>turning our Back</hi> on his Cauſe <hi>in the Day of Battle.</hi> But this Diſpoſition being acquired, fixed, and ſettled in our Minds, through the Influences of the Divine Spirit, we ſhall then be likely to ſubmit to the Croſs, bid it wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and even glory in it. Yea, this very Diſpoſition is a taking up the Croſs, as truly as if we ſuffer'd on it: So <hi>Abraham</hi>'s having intended to offer up his Son, at the Command of GOD, was look'd upon as if he had actually done it; yea, he is ſaid to have done it, and to have receiv'd the Bleſſing therefor. — But I paſs to the other Word of Command, which is,</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi rend="sup">dly</hi>. <hi>Watch.</hi> — Watchfulneſs, my Brethren, is a Duty the moſt extenſive and important, and yet the moſt neglected of any in the Chriſtian Life. I ſay, the moſt neglected: Were any Man to aſk, What was the Sin reigning in an eſpecial Manner among Perſons of every Denomination, it might juſtly be anſwered, <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>watchfulneſs.</hi> To this is owing the Decay of Godlineſs in ſome, and the Want of it in others. This has ſtop'd the Progreſs of true Religion when of late Years it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>like a ſtrong Man rejoicing to run a Race</hi>; and it has opened the Gates to all Manner of Wickedneſs, ſo that <hi>the Enemy is come in upon us like a Flood,</hi> threatening a total Innundation, unleſs <hi>the Spirit of the Lord ſet up his Standard.</hi> Unwatchfulneſs breaths in every Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, defiles all Converſation, makes our common Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſinful, and deſecrates our holy ones: it has ſpoil'd the Tempers of many, and curdled their very Blood.—
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:005969_0033_1027191911C78768"/>
This Duty, nevertheleſs, is peculiarly advantageous; it diſcovers our Danger, and thereby leſſens it; calls forth the Graces of the Divine Spirit into lively Exerciſe, animates to Duty, and is the Life of it, gives us the moſt joyful Reflections upon it, and the pleaſing Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects of and longing for the glorious Appearance of the great GOD and our Saviour JESUS CHRIST.— But then this Duty is very extenſive, peculiarly ſo: As to the other Duties of the Chriſtian Life, one is neceſſary at one Time, another at another; but Watchfulneſs reaches to every Duty, in all Times and Places: It im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boſoms all other Duties, as the Air doth the Earth; and as all Things on the Earth would die, were it not for the Air that ſurrounds them, ſo would every Duty be a mere Carcaſs, and a very offenſive one, were it not for Watchfulneſs; which (by keeping the Heart, and looking unto JESUS) enlivens, ſtrengthens, ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, and perfumes it. Watchfulneſs, 'tis broad as the Law of GOD, and that is exceeding broad; long as the Chriſtian's Life, how far ſoever extended; deep as Hell in all its Temptations; and high as Heaven, whence it looks for the Saviour the Lord JESUS CHRIST, to come with his Reward. — Very briefly here I would ſay,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Watch over your <hi>Thoughts.</hi> Here Satan would fain keep his Forge, that he might hammer out thoſe Machinations, which wou'd diſhonour GOD, defile the Body, and damn the Soul. <hi>Keep then thy Heart with all Diligence; for out of it are the Iſſues of Life. — As a Man thinketh, ſo is he.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, Watch over your <hi>Words. — Life and Death</hi> (ſays <hi>Solomon) are in the Power of the Tongue.</hi> Sure then we ſhould ſet a Watch at the Door of our Lips; ſaying with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>I am purpoſed that my Mouth ſhall not tranſgreſs.</hi> The Want of Watchfulneſs here has
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:005969_0034_1027191AE3D022F8"/>
ſet many a Tongue on Fire of Hell, rais'd the greateſt Fires on Earth, and inkindled the Wrath of Heaven. Soldiers have an eſpecial need of a Watch here, ſince Profaneneſs has ſo greatly troubled the Camp of GOD.</p>
            <p>Again, Watch over the <hi>Senſes</hi> of your <hi>Body.</hi> With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Watch here, you will be in Danger of being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed into the the Love of Eaſe and Pleaſure, Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, and all Senſuality.</p>
            <p>Again, Watch over the <hi>Frame</hi> of your <hi>Spirit.</hi> This will guard you againſt all indecent Heats, ſour Diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, Mutiny, Rebellion; will teach the Officer to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and the private Centinel to obey; and all how to behave under a Defeat, on one Hand, or Victory on the other; and to acknowledge GOD in all. So <hi>Henry</hi> the 5th of noble Memory, when he defeated the <hi>French</hi> Army at <hi>Agincourt,</hi> twelve Times more numerous than his own, prepared for the Battle by fervent Prayer, and ſanctified the Conqueſt by exalted Praiſe; triumphing more in the Favour of GOD, than in all the Spoils of his Enemy. — But I muſt not proceed, — I am aware, that theſe Directions extend to Chriſtians in general, and may be uſeful to Men of all Denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:— And therefore <hi>what I ſay</hi> to the Company of Artillery, <hi>I ſay to all, Watch.</hi> Yea, you will eaſily ſee that they have a ſpecial Reference to the Soldiers, to whom they will in the Application be peculiarly uſeful.</p>
            <p>But to conclude all, and that I may animate every one to the ſpiritual Warfare, Let me try you with the Authority of CHRIST. Yes, <hi>He is thy Lord,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>worſhip thou Him</hi>; thy <hi>Leader,</hi> who ſays, <hi>Follow Me.</hi> — Again, Shall I point you to the Example of CHRIST? <hi>He has left you an Example, that you ſhould follow his Steps</hi>; has led you on to Battle, fought a good Fight, encountred and deſtroyed every
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:005969_0035_1027191FCA408EB8"/>
Enemy: <hi>Look</hi> then <hi>to</hi> JESUS, <hi>who for the Joy that was ſet before him, endured the Croſs, and deſpiſed the Shame.</hi> — Again, Shall I mind you, that as Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, you are profeſſed Soldiers, and have obliged your ſelves to <hi>endure Hardneſs as good Soldiers of</hi> JESUS CHRIST. — Again, Shall I tell you, that a <hi>Cloud of Witneſſes</hi> obſerve you, how you fight, or how you fly, conquer or yeild; and Record your whole Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour in the Annals of Heaven? — Again, Shall I tell you, that there is ſufficient Strength provided for and offer'd to you? Yes, JESUS is <hi>your Strength,</hi> as well as <hi>your Redeemer,</hi> and through Him you may do Valiantly. — Again, Shall I ſay, that <hi>Neceſſity is laid upon you?</hi> There is <hi>no Diſcharge in this</hi> ſpiritual <hi>War</hi>: Fight you muſt, or die; and that not only the firſt, but the <hi>ſecond Death,</hi> even that which conſiſts in a <hi>Lake that burneth with Fire and Brimſtone.</hi> Brave and Valiant as you are in your Conflicts with temporal Enemies, yet neglecting your ſpiritual ones, you will hereafter appear Cowards indeed; you will fly <hi>from the Face of Him that ſitteth on the Throne, and from the Wrath of the Lamb,</hi> cry to the <hi>Rocks</hi> to <hi>fall upon you,</hi> and <hi>the Mountains</hi> to <hi>cover you</hi>; but yet cry in vain, to Creatures as deaf to you, as you were to GOD. The GOD which you defied is come out againſt you in Battle-Aray; but Oh! <hi>Who can abide the Day of his Anger! Hast thou,</hi> O Man, <hi>an Arm like GOD?</hi> Or, <hi>Canst thou Thunder with a Voice like His?</hi> How will thou meet an armed GOD, Almighty Vengeance lowring on his Brow, and his Hand taking hold on Judgment? Where will be thy Courage, O Man, while the Sentence of Miſery thunders from the Mouth of thy Judge? Or where, — when the Execution of it comes on, and thou findeſt thyſelf <hi>going down to Hell, with thy Weapons of War,</hi> as the Prophet expreſſes it! On the other Hand, for thy Encouragement, conſider, that having been <hi>faithful</hi> to thy Leader JESUS
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:005969_0036_102719228A207BC8"/>
               <hi>until Death,</hi> thou ſhall then <hi>receive a Crown of Life.</hi> Thy Inſtruments of War ſhall then be laid aſide, all thy Enemies trampled beneath thy Feet; thy Captain ſhall be thy Judge, and thy Judge thy Friend, who will be ſure to approve thy Conflicts, reward thy Conqueſts, not with fading Laurels, but with the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands of Life and Immortality: Yea, <hi>Thou ſhall ſit down with</hi> JESUS <hi>in his Throne, even as He having overcome is alſo ſet down with his Father in his Throne,</hi> Amen. <hi>Even ſo, come,</hi> LORD JESUS.</p>
