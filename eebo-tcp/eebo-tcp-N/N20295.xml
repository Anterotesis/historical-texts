            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE following little Poem was publiſhed in London, in February <hi>1792.</hi> It happened that two of the principal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators, the emperor Leopold, and the king of Sweden, died in a few weeks after. The oppoſite effects, produced by the death of theſe two perſons, are very remarkable. From a view of the general character of the king of Sweden, and of the particular tranſactions of the laſt year of his life, there can be no doubt but he has determined to go any lengths with the powers which were then confederating againſt the liberty of France; and it is a conſolation to human nature, that the violent death of one ſceptred mad-man has ſaved the people of Sweden from thoſe hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid ſcenes of ſlaughter which now involve moſt of the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nations.</p>
            <p>The character of Leopold, in ſome of its leading traits, was
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:026618_0004_0FD2253CDD0949E0"/>
directly the reverſe of that of Guſtavus. The latter was prod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igal of wealth, and exceſſively eager for what is called military fame, without the capacity or the means of acquiring it; the former was affectedly pacific, moderate in moſt of his vices, and remarkable for nothing but his avarice. He had ſenſe enough to ſee that nothing was to be gained by a war with France; his avarice, had he lived, would have been a ſufficient guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antee againſt that event; and his death may be conſidered as the immediate cauſe of the war.</p>
            <p>The treaty of Pilnitz was doubtleſs fabricated in the court of Paris. The emperor agreed to it, for the purpoſe of duping the king of Pruſſia into meaſures which might ſecure the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the people of Brabant, whom he had pacified the year before by a cruel deception. His deſign was likewiſe to deceive the emigrant princes, who were then deceiving him; and to exhibit ſuch a menacing appearance, as, according to his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, would induce the French people to ſet down quietly under a limited monarchy; well knowing that, if they did this, their government would ſoon degenerate into a deſpotiſm, which would continue to give countenance to the general principle that had ſo long enſlaved the nations of Europe.</p>
            <p>That he never intended, or had relinquiſhed the intention, of executing the conditions of the treaty of Pilnitz by going to war with France, is evident from the following conſiderations: the French conſtitution was ratified, and the revolution ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be finiſhed, in September <hi>1791.</hi> A war, to overturn
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:026618_0005_0FD2253F76B52468"/>
that conſtitution, certainly ought not to have been deferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the enſuing ſpring; and as it would require an army of two or three hundred thouſand men, the winter muſt have been occupied in making the preparations. Leopold died ſuddenly, about the firſt of March. At that time no preparations had been made for offenſive hoſtilities. The number of troops ſent from Auſtria into the Low Countries, during the autumn and winter, was not more than was ſtipulated to be maintained there, and were ſcarcely ſufficient to enforce the deſpotiſm to which he had deſtined that unhappy people. Before the death of Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pold, the French emigrants at Coblentz began to deſpair. The hopes they had built on the treaty of Pilnitz had nearly van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed; the princes had an army of forty thouſand gentlemen to maintain; Louis was carrying on too great a ſyſtem of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at home, to be able to ſupply them with money from his <hi>civil liſt;</hi> they had exhauſted their credit in all the mercan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile towns in Europe; and Leopold, conſidering them in the character of beggars, began to treat them as troubleſome gueſts; for none of the objects of their demands could be flattering to his favourite paſſion. At laſt, to their great ſatisfaction, the emperor died; and his ſyſtem with regard to France was either never underſtood by his own miniſters; or it was laid aſide, in compliance with the predominant paſſions of his ſon; which happened to be for war, expence, and unqualified deſpotiſm.</p>
            <p>This young man began his career by a ſolemn declaration to all the powers of Europe, that he ſhould follow preciſely the ſyſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>em
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:026618_0006_0FD22540C92BA800"/>
of his father, with reſpect to the affairs of France. This de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration might be underſtood to mean the open and avowed ſyſtem, preſcribed by the treaty of Pilnitz, or the ſecret and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>explained ſyſtem, which was to avoid the war. It was univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally underſtood, as it was doubtleſs meant, in favour of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowed ſyſtem; whoſe object, announced in the treaty, was "<hi>to ſupport the rights of crowns.</hi>"</p>
            <p>From this moment, a ſpirit of hoſtility was provoked by the Court of Vienna, and encouraged by the French ambaſſador there, who, like their other ambaſſadors, was betraying the nation, to ſerve the king; till, on the <hi>20</hi>th of April, war was declared by the National Aſſembly. In this war the deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pots of Europe will try their ſtrength, and will probably ſoon be exhauſted.</p>

            <head>Note on Mr. Burke, referring to page 17.</head>
            <p>* Some of the author's friends in England, although they join with him in cenſuring the writings of Mr. Burke on the French Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are of opinion that the picture here drawn of that writer is too highly coloured; or at leaſt, that the cenſure is ſo ſevere as to loſe the effect that it might otherwiſe produce. It is impoſſible to ſay what effect, and whether any, has or will be produced by this poem; but, out of reſpect to the opinion above ſtated, it may be proper to make ſome obſervations on the effect that has already followed from the writings of Mr. Burke. I ſpeak not of what has taken place in England; where it is ſuppoſed that, contrary to his intentions and thoſe of the government that ſet him at work, his malicious attack upon liberty has opened a diſcuſſion which cannot be cloſed until the whole ſyſtem of deſpotiſm, which he meant to ſupport, ſhall be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned in that country. The preſent war with France is doubtleſs the laſt piece of deluſion that a ſet of hereditary tyrants will ever be able to impoſe upon the people of England.</p>
            <p>But this ſubject opens a field of contemplation far more ſerious and extenſive on the continent of Europe; where if Mr. Burke can view without horror the immenſity of the miſchiefs he has done, he will ſhow himſelf worthy of much higher attributes of wickedneſs than have yet been aſcribed to him. It is a painful taſk to traverſe ſuch a wide ſcene of ſlaughter and deſolation as now involves the nations of Europe, and then to lay it all to the charge of a ſingle individual; eſpecially when we conſider that individual as having for a long time before, enjoyed the confidence of all good men, and having at laſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed it from the worſt and vileſt motives; as he had eſtabliſhed his previous reputation by ſpeaking the language of liberty, and profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing himſelf to be the friend of national felicity. But it is not from a tranſitory diſguſt at his deteſtible principles, it is from deliberate obſervation and mature conviction, that I ſtate it as an hiſtorical fact, That the preſent war, with all its train of calamities, muſt be attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted almoſt excluſively to the pen of Mr. Burke.</p>
            <p>There is a peculiar combination of circumſtances which threw this
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:026618_0024_0FD22575EEFA5A18"/>
power into his hands, and which ought to be duly conſidered, before we come to a deciſion on the ſubject. The people of England had enjoyed for ſeveral ages a much greater portion of liberty than any other people in Europe. This had raiſed them to a great degree of eminence in many reſpects. At the ſame time that it rendered them powerful as a nation, it made them ſober, induſtrious and perſevering, as individuals; it taught them to think and ſpeak with a certain air of dignity, independence and preciſion, which was unknown in other countries. This circumſtance could not fail to gain the admiration of foreigners and to excite a perpetual emulation among themſelves. England has therefore produced more than her proportion of the il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious men of modern times, eſpecially in politics and legiſlation, as theſe affairs came within the reach of a larger claſs of men in that country than in any other.</p>
            <p>In a nation where there is an enormous civil liſt at the diſpoſal of the crown, and a conſtitutional ſpirit of liberty kept alive in the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple we muſt neceſſarily expect to find two parties in the government. In ſuch a caſe, as the king is ſure to carry all the meaſures that he dares to propoſe, the party in favour of the people are called the <hi>op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition;</hi> and it being always a minority, it gives occaſion for great exertion of talents, and is ſuppoſed to be the nurſe of every public virtue. Such has been the compoſition of the Engliſh government ever ſince the laſt revolution. The oppoſition has been the ſchool of great men; its principle diſciples have been the apoſtles of liberty; and their exertions have made the Britiſh name reſpectable in every part of the world. Mr. Burke had been for many years at the head of this ſchool; and from the brilliant talents he <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>covered in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous ſtation, he rendered himſelf univerſally reſpected. His elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence was of that flowery and figurative kind, which attract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed great admiration in foreign countries; where it was viewed, for the moſt part, through the medium of a tranſlation; ſo that he was conſidered, at leaſt in every country out of England, as the ableſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate of liberty that then exiſted in Europe. Even kings and tyrants,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:026618_0025_0FD2257967554A48"/>
who hated the cauſe, could not withhold their veneration from the man.</p>
            <p>Under theſe impreſſions, their attention was called to the great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent of the French revolution. It was a ſubject which they did not underſtand, a buſineſs in which they had no intention to interfere; as it was evidently no concern of theirs. But viewed as a ſpeculative point, it is as natural for kings as for other perſons to wait till they learn what great men have ſaid, before they form their opinion. Mr. Burke did not ſuffer them to remain long in ſuſpence; but, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten their underſtandings and teach them how to judge, he came forward with his "<hi>Reflections on the Revolution in France</hi>;" where, in his quality of the political ſchoolmaſter of his age, in his quality of the profeſſed enemy of tyrants, the friend of the people, the moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened leader of the moſt enlightened nation in Europe, he tells them that this Revolution is an abominable uſurpation of a gang of beggarly tyrants; that its principle is atheiſm and anarchy; that its inſtruments are murders, rapes, and plunders; that its object is to hunt down religion, overturn ſociety, and deluge the world in blood.— Then, in the whining cant of ſtate-piety, and in the cowardly inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of perſonal ſafety, he calls upon the principal ſovereigns of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope to unite in a general confederation, to march into France, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfere in the affairs of an independent power<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to make war with the principles which he himſelf had long laboured to ſupport, to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn the nobleſt monument of human wiſdom, and blaſt the faireſt hopes of public happineſs that the world had ever ſeen.</p>
            <p>Copies of his book were ſent in great profuſion by the courts of London and Paris to the other courts of Europe; it was read by all men of letters, and by all men of ſtate, with an avidity inſpired by the celebrity of the author and the magnitude of the ſubject; and it produced an effect which, in other circumſtances would have appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed almoſt miraculous; eſpecially when we conſider the intrinſic char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter of the work. M. de Calonne, about the ſame time, publiſhed a book of much more internal merit; a book in which falſhood is
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:026618_0026_0FD2257C27A5FA88"/>
clothed in a more decent covering; and in which there is more ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy and argument, to excite the champions of deſpotiſm to begin the work of deſolation. But Calonne wrote and appeared in his true char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter. It was known that he had been a robber in France, and was now an exile in England; and, while he herded with the Engliſh rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers at St. James's, he wrote to revenge himſelf upon the country whoſe juſtice he had eſcaped. His writings, therefore, had but little weight; perhaps as little as Mr. Burke's would have had, if his real object had been known.</p>
            <p>But this illuſtrious hypocrite poſſeſſed every advantage for decep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He palmed himſelf upon the world as a volunteer in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral cauſe of philanthropy. Giving himſelf up to the frenzy of an unbridled imagination, he conceives himſelf writing tragedy, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being confined to the obvious laws of fiction; and taking advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the recency of the events, and of the ignorance of thoſe who were to read his rhapſodies, he peoples France with aſſaſſins, for the ſake of raiſing a hue-and-cry againſt its peaceable inhabitants; he paints ideal murders, that they may be avenged by the reality of a wide extended ſlaughter; he transforms the mildeſt and moſt generous people in Europe into a nation of monſters and atheiſts, "heaping mountains upon mountains, and waging war with heaven," that he may intereſt the conſciences of one part of his readers, and cloak the hypocriſy of another, to induce them both to renounce the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter of men, while they avenge the cauſe of God.</p>
            <p>Such was the firſt picture of the French Revolution preſented at once to the eyes of all the men who held the reins of government in the ſeveral ſtates of Europe; and ſuch was the authority of the author by whom it was preſented, that we are not to be aſtoniſhed at the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. The emigrant princes, and the agents of the court of the Thu<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries, who were then beſieging the anti-chambers of miniſters in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry country, found a new ſource of impudence in this extraordinary work. They found their own invented fictions confirmed in their ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt latitude, and a rich variety of ſuperadded falſhood, of which the
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:026618_0027_0FD2257F26AE1D68"/>
moſt ſhameleſs ſycophant of Louis or of Condé would hare bluſhed to have been the author. With this book in their hands it was eaſy to gain the ear of men already prediſpoſed to liſten to any project which might rivet the chains of their fellow creatures.</p>
            <p>Theſe arguments, detailed by proper agents, induced ſome of the principal ſovereigns of Europe to agree to the treaty of Pilnitz; then the death of Leopold, as I have ſtated in the preface, unhappily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved the great obſtacle to the execution of that treaty, and the war of Mr. Burke was let looſe, with all the horrors he intended to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite. And what is the language proper to be uſed in deſcribing the character of a man, who, in his ſituation, at his time of life, and for a penſion of only fifteen hundred pounds a year, could ſit down de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberately in his cloſet and call upon the powers of earth and hell to inflict ſuch a weight of miſery on the human race? When we ſee Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exander depopulating kingdoms and reducing great cities to aſhes, we tranſport ourſelves to the age in which he lived, when human ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was human glory; and we make ſome allowance for the ravings of ambition. If we contemplate the frightful cruelties of Cortez and Pizarro, we view their characters as a compoſition of avarice and fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aticiſm; we ſee them inſatiable of wealth, and mad with the idea of extending the knowledge of their religion. But here is a man who calls himſelf a philoſopher, not remarkable for his avarice, the delight and ornament of a numerous ſociety of valuable friends, reſpected by all enlightened men as a friend of peace and a preacher of humanity, living in an age when military madneſs has loſt its charms, and men begin to unite in ſearching the means of avoiding the horrors of war; this man, wearied with the happineſs that ſurrounds him, and diſguſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the glory that awaits him, renounces all his friends, belies the doctrines of his former life, bewails that the military ſavageneſs of the fourteenth century is paſt away, and, to gratify his barbarous wiſhes to call it back, conjures up a war, in which at leaſt two millions of his fellow creatures muſt be ſacrificed to his unaccountable paſſion. Such is the condition of human nature, that the greateſt crimes have uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:026618_0028_0FD22580973A9820"/>
gone unpuniſhed. It appears to me, that hiſtory does not furniſh a greater one than this of Mr. Burke; and yet all the conſolation that we can draw from the detection, is to leave the man to his own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections, and expoſe his conduct to the execration of poſterity.</p>
