            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>I Suppose Every body that know any thing of the Author of this Paper, knows, That when he having some Years ago Travell'd a Long Journey, and was carry'd up into the Lunar World in a well known Engine, contriv'd for Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations for our famous <hi>High Church</hi> Men, and which was Call'd a <hi>Consolidator;</hi> at his return he gave the World some account of his Curious Observations.—But one Story he never yet told, and which seems reserv'd to the present occasion.—Be it Known to you all then, that the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>to the World in the
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:002281_0002_0FDAE3D2082FA078."/>
Moon, as I was passing thro' a great City a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout my Lawful Occasions—<hi>What my busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness was there, is Nothing to any Body:</hi> But I found the People in a great hurry, drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging a poor Taylor away to their Courts of Justice.—<hi>Lord have mercy upon the poor man thought I,</hi> what will become of him? For he Look'd to me Just as an English Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian would do if he were got into the hands of the high Church rabble; <abbr>(viz.)</abbr> Like a Man that Expected to be Murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them. Being mightily Concern'd you may be sure, to see the poor Man us'd thus, <hi>I Enquir'd who he was,</hi> and what was the Crime for which he was thus treated—I met with many relations Differing from one another about him, <hi>For the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple there tell the same Story a great many ways</hi> Just as they do here, <hi>as the humour takes them;</hi> but not to trouble you with several Relations of the Thing, the Substance of the Mans Case, it seems, was thus. The Man as I told you was a <hi>Taylor</hi> by his Trade; Now you are to understand, that tho' I did not find there was any of that foolish use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less sort of People call'd <hi>Poets</hi> there, yet they have <hi>their way</hi> of Satyrizing &amp; Ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Follies and Vices of the Place, as well as in other Countries; and it seems the <hi>Taylors</hi> are the Satyrs—for when any
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:002281_0003_0FDAE3D59E321A40"/>
Man, or Body of Men have play'd the Fool, or the Knave, or the Coward, or the Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard, or any Vicious prank, he that has a mind to Lampoon him, goes to a Taylor, and gets <hi>such a Coat made</hi> as such People are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally condemn'd to wear upon Publick Days, who upon Tryal are found Guilty of such or such respective Crimes: this Coat is carried about the Streets and hang d up, or shew'd particularly at or near the House of the Person, and is easily known by the Dimensions and Figures made upon it, who it <hi>belongs to:</hi> and it is call'd in their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage a <hi>Thocacterraca,</hi> in <hi>English,</hi> a <hi>Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senter</hi> or a Character Coat. But you must remember too, that there are Strict Laws, any Taylor making these Coats for Persons innocent of the Follies Described; &amp; when any Transgress that way, they are severely Punish'd especially when they make a Coat for a Man, and upon trying it on, it does not fit him. On the other hand, oftentimes it happens, that when a Man makes a <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter Coat</hi> for one Man, it fits <hi>another,</hi> and sometimes a <hi>great many.</hi> This is owing partly to the Ignorance of the <hi>Taylor,</hi> who does not take his measure right, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by Fools and Knaves, being in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try very often much like one another, but more especially by the ridiculous Folly of
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:002281_0004_0FDAE3D681938C98"/>
some Men, who when they see a Coat made, tho' it be the most ridiculing, and most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing thing in the World, they cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear, but they will be <hi>always</hi> trying it on, and endeavouring to make it fit themselves whether it will or no.—Nay they will stretch the Coat out of all manner or shape to see if they can make it fit them, quite contrary to the Taylors Design; as if know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves to be Fools they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous all the World should know it too. This is a great piece of Injustice to the <hi>Taylor,</hi> tho' perhaps it may be none to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; for I cannot believe; <hi>but Every Man IS just AS much a Knave as he would have the World believe him to be.</hi>—Just thus it fared some Years ago, with the Author of the Paper, Called, <hi>The Review,</hi> in the World <hi>on this side the Moon,</hi> when he happened in a Paper to be panting out the Character of a State Mountebank, a City Hero, a Coward to his Cause, a Fool, a Knave, and a Deserter of his Friends. One said, <hi>that's at me;</hi> another, <hi>that's at me;</hi> and the like: Nay, that would not serve them, but they must bring in their Friends too; <hi>Who does he mean by that?</hi> and, <hi>Who does he mean by this?</hi> That's such a Lord, that blue List Man, is my L—and his Garter; That Deserter of his Friend, or
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:002281_0005_0FDAE3D8099AB998"/>
that empty headed Magistrate, is the L—M—r; that Litigious Impertinent is Mr. Hill—d; that High-Church Buffoon, is Par—n Hig—s, and the like; when it was far from the thoughts of the poor Author, to do any of these Gentlemen so much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.—In like manner exactly it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in the Moon; <hi>the Story is this:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There had been some very Scandalous Fellow had done some ridiculous Thing, for which he deserv'd to be Expos'd, and some People had be spoke this Taylor to make a Coat for him; the Coat was wonderfully made indeed, every side of it was singular, as you turn'd it <hi>this way,</hi> it look'd <hi>one thing: that way</hi> another; to <hi>ones</hi> eye-sight it repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented <hi>one thing;</hi> to <hi>another,</hi> quite contrary; and all agreed, that never such a Coat was made before: If you turn'd it this way, it was a <hi>Fools Coat;</hi> that way, 'twas a <hi>Knaves Coat;</hi> on one side it represented a <hi>Lord Bishop;</hi> on the other side, a <hi>Lord Duke;</hi> on another, a <hi>Lord M—r;</hi> on another a <hi>Clergy Man,</hi> on another, a <hi>Thief:</hi> Worn this way it made a Man a <hi>States Man;</hi> that way, a <hi>Mountebank,</hi> that way a General that way a Coward; a strange Coat it was indeed, <hi>as ever I saw in my Life.</hi> The Man that bespoke it no sooner carried it along the Streets, <hi>as was usual in such Cases,</hi> but it
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:002281_0006_0FDAE3D987ABCE60"/>
rais'd a terrible Combustion in the Town; the People began to stare at one another, as if they were frighted—. The first that broke silence was a huge Tall Man, by his appearance a Man of Grandeur, for he had a blue List upon his Coat, which in that Country none but a few of the Prince No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility are permitted to wear—<hi>What D—'s that?</hi> says he—a <hi>Villian</hi>—a <hi>Rogue—why that Coat's made for me;</hi> and up he runs to the poor Man and begins to bluster.—<hi>Pray my Lord, Good my Lord,</hi> says the Man, <hi>it is not made for your Highness,</hi> it was made for your Neighbour <hi>such a one:</hi> you lie you Villian says my Lord, it was made for me, and I'll have you Hang'd, <hi>if there were no more Taylors in all the Moon. Indeed my Lord</hi> says the Man again, it could not be made for you, for it will not <hi>fit your Lordship:</hi> I ll try that, says his Lordship, and <hi>if it does I'll have you Hang'd immediately.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon which my Lord put the Coat on; but the poor Man was Confounded, when he saw, that with but the least stretching, it fitted his Lordship to a Hair.—And he expected nothing but Death. My Lord went away raging, in order to sent the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal Officers to take up the Man: but he might have sav'd himself the Labour, for the Coat was not carried much farther,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:002281_0007_0FDAE3DB09C15850"/>
but one cry'd, <hi>That—has made this Coat for me;</hi> another said, no, <hi>'tis for me,</hi> and almost every body that saw it challenged the Coat: at last the chief Magistrate of the Town happen'd to come along, and he fell in a rage, and cry'd out with an Oath, <hi>the Coat was made for him</hi> whereupon he Immediately seized it, and carry'd it into a great Assembly of that City, which was then Sitting, to complain of the Affront. This Assembly is call'd in their Language the <hi>Momonciculoc:</hi> I will not pretend to Knowledge enough in the Lunar Language to Translate it; Some think it may resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a <hi>Common Council.</hi>—Here he began to complain of the Affront, when of a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den a great Combustion rose among them in the Hall of the Assembly; one said <hi>the Coat is made for me,</hi> another said <hi>it is for me;</hi> and to be short, with my Story, no less than 114 of them Challeng'd the poor Man for bringing this Coat out to Expose <hi>them</hi> in <hi>particular.</hi> The Man was in great Distress,&amp; had no way at last to bring him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self out of this Broil, but by telling them the Name of the <hi>Taylor,</hi> who made the Coat: which having done, he made his Escape,&amp; the poor <hi>Taylor</hi> was sent for. The <hi>Taylor</hi> was a bold Fellow, &amp; fear'd no Colours: And Immediately went to them upon the first Summons; and being brought before them, they Examin'd him very strictly.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:002281_0008_0FDAE3DEA6F21F90"/>And as near as I can remember, the Examination was as follows; he is brought into a large Closet, where they usually Examine Witnesses, and the Coat being shew'd him, the <hi>Clerk</hi> appointed to Examine him, began the following Dialogue.</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Clerk.</speaker>
               <p>Did you make this Coat Sir?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Taylor,</speaker>
               <p>Yes I did.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>It was made to represent him that it represents Sir.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>But who is that Sir?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>Why I tell you Sir, says the Taylor briskly, him that it represents.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Well, but here are a great many Gentlemen who say it represents them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>What all of them?</p>

               <p>But here is my Lord A—, he says the Coat represents him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>His he try'd it on, and <hi>does it fit him?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Exactly.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>Tis impossible—pray look on the Coat, the Coat is a <hi>Fools Coat,</hi> and his Lordship is too much something else to be a F—l.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>But then it fits my L—B—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>That can't be neither; for turn it and you'l see 'tis a <hi>Knaves Coat,</hi> and every body knows my L—cannot be a Knave, it is not in his Head.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>But it may fit my Lord C—.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>No it can't neither for turn it again, and then 'tis a <hi>States-Man Coat</hi> and it is well known my Lord is no more a States-Man than he is a Conjurer.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Well, but <hi>they may think it fits them.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>Their Guilt may do much, but 'tis not good manners in me to think so.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Well, but what say you to the rest of the Gentlemen that Challenge it? pray give them Satisfaction.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>Why truly, as to the 114 Gentlemen belonging to the Great Hall, if it fits them all I cannot help it, they may take it among them, and then every one will have his share—<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> strange thing a Man cannot Dress up a Monkey but every one calls him Cousin.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>—And with this T. threw the <hi>Coat</hi> down in the middle of the Hall.</p>
