            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F
<q>the Publication of a Narrative of the Riſe, Progreſs and preſent Situation of Religion in <hi>Virginia,</hi> may not only gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify good People, but (as you give me Reaſon to hope) animate their Prayers for us, and alſo encourage Preachers to come into theſe Parts;</q> I ſhould charge my ſelf with a crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Neglect, did I deprive this Colony of theſe Bleſſings, by delaying or refuſing to publiſh the marvellous Works of the Lord among us. Such Matters are liable to Miſrepreſentations; and I doubt not but the State of Religion in theſe Parts has ſuffered the ſame Fate with other Facts reported by common Fame, and been mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified or diminiſhed to you. I ſhall therefore, Sir, with as much Brevity and Accuracy as the Caſe and my Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances will allow, give you <hi>an Account of the State of Religion among the Proteſtant Diſſenters in Virginia,</hi> not only in my Congregation in <hi>Hanover,</hi> but alſo in the Frontier Counties of this Colony, which are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally inhabited by Diſſenters; which, after Peruſal, you may preſent to the Publick, or doom to Oblivion, as your Prudence will direct. I look upon my ſelf under the moſt ſacred Obligations to maintain the ſtricteſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to Matter of Fact in my Narrative: and as my Reſidence in <hi>Hanover</hi> above three Years, and my Itine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:006657_0003_102975BEB02D63A8"/>among the vacant Congregations in the Frontier Counties, have furniſhed me with-peculiar Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Information, my Miſrepreſentations would be the more inexcuſable.</p>
            <p>My Deſign Sir, is not to inform the World of my petty perſonal Concerns, to boaſt of Proſelytes, or to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſe the Church of <hi>England</hi> here eſtabliſhed; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to avoid Suſpicions, I muſt ſuppreſs ſundry Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars that might be proper to mention in the Freedoms of amicable Converſation, but are not to be truſted to the Candour of a cenſorious World; and I have always tho't it an Inſtance of Imprudence pregnant with miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous Conſequences, when Perſons in ſuch Caſes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boſom themſelves to Mankind in general, with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guarded Liberties of intimate Friendſhip.</p>
            <p>It will not probably be worth while to give you any further Geographical Account of <hi>Hanover</hi> County, where the late Revival of Religion began, than that it is ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, I think, pretty near the Centre of <hi>Virginia;</hi> is a flouriſhing County, and generally very healthy to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons from all Nations; which I mention Sir, to remove your Scruple,
<q>Whether this Climate agrees with the Conſtitution of <hi>New-England</hi> Men?</q>
            </p>
            <p>I hope I may obſerve without the Umbrage of Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, what glares with irreſiſtable Evidence on the Eyes of the Serious of all Denominations among us, that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion has been, and in moſt Parts of the Colony ſtill is, in a very low State. A ſurprizing Negligence appears in attending on publick Worſhip; and an equally ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing Levity &amp; Unconcernedneſs in thoſe that attend. Family-Religion is a Rarity, and a ſolemn Solicitude about eternal Things is ſtill a greater. Vices of various Kinds are triumphant, and even a <hi>Form of Godlineſs</hi> is not common. The Clergy univerſally, as far as my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence extends, have embraced the modiſh Syſtem of <hi>Arminian</hi> Divinity, (tho' I allow my ſelf the Pleaſure to hope there are ſundry conſciencious Perſons among them)
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:006657_0004_102975C1B4E6CD08"/>and the <hi>Calviniſtic,</hi> or rather PAULINE Articles of their own Church are counted horrendous and inſufferable.— But I ſuppoſe univerſal Fame has ſuperſeded my Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; and therefore I willingly exempt my ſelf from the diſagreable Taſk.</p>
            <p>I cannot find there has been a diſſenting Miniſter ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled in <hi>Virginia,</hi> 'till lately, ſince its firſt Plantation. You no doubt remember what Dr. <hi>Mather,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Neal</hi> from him, relate of the ſending of Meſſirs. <hi>James, Knowles,</hi> and <hi>Thomſon</hi> into it from <hi>New-England,</hi> at the Invitation of ſundry of its Inhabitants, above a Hundred Years ago; and of their being compelled to depart the Colony by the Governour's Order, after preaching a few Sermons:
<note n="*" place="bottom">See <hi>Neal</hi>'s Hiſt. of <hi>N. England,</hi> Vol. I. p. 220. ſub an. 1642.</note> Since which, there have been hardly any Attempts made to obtain ſuch Miniſters, 'till a few Years ago; and many of the Populace knew little or nothing of any Denomination, but that in which they had been educated.</p>
            <p>I have Reaſon to hope Sir, there are and have been a <hi>few Names</hi> in various Parts of the Colony, who are ſincerely ſeeking the Lord, and groping after Religion, in the Communion of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> which I charitably preſume from my finding there were a few of this happy Character in &amp; about <hi>Hanover</hi> before the late Revival of Religion. Such were awakened, as they have told me, either by their own ſerious Reflections, ſuggeſted and enforced by divine Energy; or on read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome Authors of the laſt Century, particularly <hi>Bolton, Baxter, Flavel, Bunyan,</hi> &amp;c. Some of them were wont to attend on publick Worſhip in the eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed Church without much murmuring at the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments there; tho' they were ſenſible theſe were vaſtly inferior to what paſt Ages were favoured with, and often wondered if there were ſuch Doctrines taught any where in the World at preſent, as they found in the
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:006657_0005_102975C3473686F0"/>Writings of theſe good Men. Others of them, tho' they had no Objections againſt the Ceremonies of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> except a few who were ſhocked at the impracticable Obligations impoſed upon the Spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors in Baptiſm, were utterly diſſatisfied with the uſual Doctrines taught from the Pulpit. Tho' theſe were generally true, and would have been uſeful, in their Connection with the Scheme of evangelical Doctrines; yet ſo many neceſſary Truths were neglected, as rendered thoſe that were inculcated of very little Service. The whole Syſtem of what is diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by the Name of <hi>experimental Religion,</hi> was paſt over in Silence. The <hi>Depravity of humane Nature,</hi> the <hi>Neceſſity of Regeneration, and it's Pre-requiſites, Nature and Effects,</hi> the <hi>various Exerciſes of pious Souls according to their ſeveral Caſes,</hi> &amp;c. theſe were omitted; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out theſe, you know Sir, the fineſt Declamations on mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Duties or ſpeculative Truths, will be but wretched Entertainment to hungry Souls. Such a maim'd Syſtem is not the compleat Religion of JESUS, that glories in the amiable <hi>Symmetry,</hi> mutual <hi>Dependency</hi> and <hi>Subſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency</hi> of all its Doctrines, as its peculiar Characteriſtic. Had the <hi>whole Counſel of God</hi> been declared, had all the Doctrines of the Goſpel been ſolemnly and faithfully preached in the eſtabliſhed Church; I am perſwaded there would have been but few Diſſenters in theſe Parts of <hi>Virginia;</hi> for, as I obſerved, their firſt Objections were not againſt the peculiar <hi>Rites</hi> &amp; <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of that Church, much leſs againſt her excellent <hi>Articles;</hi> but againſt the general Strain of the <hi>Doctrines</hi> delivered from the Pulpit, in which theſe Articles were oppoſed, or (which was the more common Caſe) <hi>not mentioned at all:</hi> ſo that at firſt they were not properly <hi>Diſſenters from</hi> the original Conſtitution of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but the moſt ſtrict <hi>Adherents to</hi> it, and only diſſented from thoſe that had forſaken it, tho' they ſtill uſurped the Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination. But tho' ſuch Impartiality in preaching the
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:006657_0006_102975C64715A4F8"/>Goſpel might have prevented the Advancement of the Intereſt of the Diſſenters <hi>as</hi> a Party, it would have tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to promote the infinitely more valuable Intereſts of the bleſſed Redeemer: and had this been the Caſe, our Zeal and Induſtry to convert them to <hi>Preſbyterianiſm,</hi> would have been almoſt ſuperfluous, and quite diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned.—And here Sir, it may be proper to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, That when in this Narrative I ſpeak of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of Diſſenters in theſe Parts with an Air of Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, I do not boaſt of them as meer <hi>Captures</hi> from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but as hopefully <hi>ſincere Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes to living Religion,</hi> or at leaſt as lying open to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, and in the Way of more profitable Means. I cannot indeed but conſcienciouſly diſſent from ſome of the Peculiarities of that Church; and it tends a little to heighten our Satisfaction, when ſuch as agree with us in <hi>Eſſentials,</hi> and appear truly pious, do alſo agree with us in <hi>Circumſtantials;</hi> for as Agreement is the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation and Meaſure of ſocial Love, <hi>this</hi> muſt be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>extended with <hi>that:</hi> Yet as I am fully perſwaded <hi>the Kingdom of God is not Meat &amp; Drink, but Righteouſneſs and Peace and Joy in the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> and that Perſons of ſuperiour Piety and Judgment have uſed theſe Rites and Ceremonies with Approbation; I think the Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Men's Principles and Practice with Reſpect to theſe Things <hi>only,</hi> without being born again of God, is a wretched Converſion; and it would inſpire me with much greater Joy to ſee a <hi>pious Church-man,</hi> than a <hi>graceleſs Preſbyterian.</hi> I cheerfully embrace the Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of that illuſtrious Divine Mr. <hi>Howe,</hi>
               <note place="bottom">† See <hi>Howe</hi>'s Works, Vol. II. p. 474.</note>
               <q>
                  <hi>That without the Effuſion of the Spirit from high,</hi>
               </q> to faſhion the Hearts of Men into a Conformity to the bleſſed God, and to prepare them for a happy Immortality,
<q>
                  <hi>it matters little, and ſignifies to me ſcarce one Straw, what Party of us is uppermoſt:</hi> The moſt Righteous,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:006657_0007_102975CC36C656C0"/>
                  <hi>(as they may be vogu'd) will be but as Bryars &amp; ſcratching Thorns; and it is better to ſuffer by ſuch, than to be of them.</hi>
               </q> The chief Reaſon Sir, why I call upon you to congratulate the Increaſe of the Diſſenters here, and rejoyce in it my ſelf, is, becauſe I have Ground to hope that the Number of the Heirs of Heaven is augmented in ſome <hi>Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> tho' alas! not to an Equality; and to triumph on inferior Accounts, would argue the narrow Genius of a <hi>Bigot.</hi> — But to return.</p>
            <p>The Few that profeſs'd a Diſſatisfaction with the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Strain of Preaching in Church, and therefore ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther abſented themſelves, or attended with Murmuring and Reluctance, were generally counted whimſical Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and hypocritical Affectors of Singularity: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they could not but own their Sentiments ſingular; for they knew of none in the preſent Age of the ſame Mind with them; and therefore had no Proſpect of obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Miniſter to preach to them thoſe Doctrines they thirſted for. Their Notions, as far as I can learn, were ſound in the main; tho' intermix'd with ſome corrupt Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons verging towards <hi>Antinomianiſm,</hi> the oppoſite Extreme to that they had left. And tho' this rendered them more odious to their Adverſaries, and furniſhed them with Occaſions more plauſibly to expoſe them; yet, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Circumſtances as being deſtitute of a judicious Miniſter to inſtruct them in the Doctrines of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and caution them againſt Miſtakes; and as la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring under the Prejudices of Education, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with the Sallies of their firſt Zeal, which is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally imprudent and wild; I am more ſurprized at their Soundneſs and Regularity in moſt Things, than at their Miſtakes and Extravagancies in a few.</p>
            <p>In this Caſe about ten or twelve Perſons who are now Members of my Congregation, had been for ſome Time before the Revival of Religion which began in the Year 1743. One Mr. <hi>Samuel Morris</hi> (for I am not aſhamed publickly to mention his Name, notwithſtanding the
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:006657_0008_102975CF41A39DE0"/>Calumnies flung upon it by many) a Perſon of a forward, ſociable Spirit, who had for ſome Time been extremely anxious about his eternal State, &amp; unweariedly ſeeking Relief by all Means within his Reach, at length obtain'd a Diſcovery of that glorious Method of Salvation thro' Jeſus Chriſt, to which Sinners <hi>from all the Ends of the Earth look, and are ſaved,</hi> and where they univerſally agree to ſix all their Hopes, notwithſtanding the great Diverſity of their Circumſtances as to Situation, Education, outward In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, &amp;c. The diſtinct Relation he has given me of his Exerciſes at that Time and ſince, and the prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Piety of his common Behaviour, leave me no Room to be anxious about the Sincerity of his Religion; tho', as it is common in ſuch Caſes, his former pious Zeal to do Good, with a few very pardonable Imprudences that attended it, have fix'd an indelible <hi>Odium</hi> on his Character among many who oppoſed the religious Concern he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to promote. After this Diſcovery of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, his Soul was anxious for the Salvation of his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and inflamed with Zeal to uſe Means to awaken them. This was the Tendency of his Converſation; and he alſo read to them ſuch Authors as had been moſt uſeful to him, particularly <hi>Luther</hi>'s <hi>Comment upon the Galatians,</hi> which firſt opened to him the Way of Juſtification thro' Chriſt alone, and his <hi>Table-Diſcourſes;</hi> ſundry Pieces of honeſt <hi>Bunyan</hi>'s &amp;c. By thoſe Means a few of his Neighbours were made more tho'tful about Religion than uſual, and doubtful they had lived 'till then in a careleſs Ignorance of it; but the Concern was not very extenſive.</p>
            <p>I have prevailed, Sir, on my good Friend before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, who was the principal private Inſtrument of promoting the late Work, and therefore well acquainted with it, to write me a Narrative of its Riſe &amp; Progreſs from this Period 'till my Settlement here: and this, together with the Subſtance of what he and others have told me, I ſhall preſent to you without any material
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:006657_0009_102975D0F0322A50"/>Alterations, and perſonate him, tho' I ſhall not exactly uſe his Words.</p>
            <q>
               <p>The Reverend Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> had been in <hi>Virginia,</hi> I think, in the Year 1740, and at the Invitation of the Rev. Mr. <hi>Blair,</hi> our late Commiſſary, had preached in <hi>Williamſburg,</hi> our Metropolis, about 60 Miles from <hi>Hanover.</hi> His Fame was much ſpread abroad, as a very warm and alarming Preacher; which made ſuch of us in <hi>Hanover</hi> as had been awakened, very eager to ſee &amp; hear him; but as he left the Colony before we heard of him, we had no Opportunity. But in the Year —43, a young Gentleman arrived from Scotland with a Book of his Sermons preached in <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> &amp; taken from his Mouth in ſhort Hand, which with Difficulty I procured. After I had read it with great Liking &amp; Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, I invited my Neighbours to come &amp; hear it; and the Plainneſs, Popularity, &amp; Fervency of the Diſcourſes, being peculiarly fitted to affect our unimproved Minds, and the Lord rendring the Word efficacious, many were convinced of their undone Condition, and conſtrained to ſeek Deliverance with the greateſt So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitude. A conſiderable Number convened every Sabbath to hear theſe Sermons, inſtead of going to Church, and frequently on Week Days. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern of ſome was ſo paſſionate and violent, that they could not avoid crying out, weeping bitterly, &amp;c. and that when ſuch Indications of religious Concern were ſo ſtrange and ridiculous, that they could not be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by Example or Sympathy, and the Affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them would have been ſo unprofitable an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Hypocriſy, that none could be tempted to it. My Dwelling-Houſe at length was too ſmall to contain the People; whereupon we determined to build a Meeting-Houſe, meerly for Reading; for we knew of no Miniſter in the World whom we could get to preach to us according to our Liking; and having never been accuſtomed to ſocial <hi>extempore</hi>
                  <pb n="11" facs="unknown:006657_0010_102975D275961038"/>Prayer, none of us durſt attempt it in Company. By this ſingle Mean ſundry were ſolemnly awakened, and their Conduct ever ſince is a living Atteſtation of the Continuance and happy Iſſue of their Impreſſions. When the Report of theſe Sermons and the Effects occaſioned by reading them was ſpread Abroad, I was invited to ſeveral Places to read them, at a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Diſtance; and by this Means the Concern was propagated.</p>
               <p>About this Time, our abſenting our ſelves from Church, contrary, as was alledged, to the Laws of the Land, was taken Notice of; and we were called up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the Court to aſſign our Reaſons for it, and to declare what Denomination we were of. As we knew but little of any Denomination of Diſſenters, except <hi>Quakers,</hi> we were at a Loſs what Name to aſſume. At length recollecting that <hi>Luther</hi> was a noted Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former, and that his Doctrines were agreable to our Sentiments, and had been of ſpecial Service to us, we declared our ſelves <hi>Lutherans;</hi> and thus we conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued 'till Providence afforded us an unexpected Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of hearing the Rev. Mr. <hi>William Robinſon.</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>Here Sir, it may be proper for me to lay aſide the Perſon of my Informer for a while, and interrupt the Connection of his Relation, to give you ſome Account of the Travels &amp; Succeſſes of that zealous, faithful and laborious Miniſter of Chriſt, the late Mr. <hi>Robinſon,</hi> whoſe dear Memory will mingle with my ſofteſt &amp; moſt grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Thot's, as long as I am capable of Reflection. He was in the Miniſtry about ſix Years, and never took the Charge of a Congregation 'till a few Months before his happy and triumphant <hi>Exit.</hi> The neceſſitous Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of many Vacancies, and the Proſpect of more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive Uſefulneſs engaged him to expoſe his ſhattered Conſtitution, to all the Hardſhips &amp; Fatigues of almoſt unioterrupted Itinerations; and it has been my Lot to trace his Travels in ſundry Parts of <hi>Pennſylvania, Mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:006657_0011_102975D58494F940"/>and <hi>Virginia;</hi> and I cannot recollect one Place in which he had officiated for any Time, where there were not ſome illuſtrious Effects of his Miniſtry. He had a noble diſintereſted Ambition <hi>to preach the Goſpel, where Chriſt was not named;</hi> and therefore, by the Permiſſion of the Preſbyte y, he took a Journey thro' the new Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements in <hi>Pennſylvania, Virginia,</hi> and <hi>North-Carolina,</hi> in which he continued about two Years, oppreſs'd with the uſual Difficulties a weakly Conſtitution finds in tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling a Wilderneſs, and animated only by his glorious Succeſſes. He continued for ſome Time in <hi>Lunenburg,</hi> a County about 100 Miles S. W. of this, where (as I ſhall have Occaſion to obſerve more fully hereafter) a ſmall Number of <hi>Preſbyterians</hi> from the northern Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies were ſettled, intermixt with a Number of looſe <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians;</hi> and there he was the happy Inſtrument of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming many tho'tleſs Creatures, and founding a flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing Congregation. In <hi>Amelia</hi> alſo, a County ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what nearer this than the former, his Labours were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſively bleſs'd; and while he was there, or near it, ſome of the People in <hi>Hanover</hi> having had ſome imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Information of him, ſent him an Invitation to come and preach to them, tho' they knew very little of his Character or Method of Preaching, only that it was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common &amp; tended to awaken People. They ventured to make an Appointment for him to preach at their <hi>Reading-Houſe</hi> (if I may ſo call it) before they received any Promiſe from him by their Meſſenger; and with much Difficulty he came againſt the Day appointed. Some of the People were anxious to diſcover his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples privately in the Morning before he was to preach; but knew not how, 'till they fell upon the Device of aſking his Opinion of ſome Books they approved of. Upon his declaring his Approbation of theſe Teſts of Orthodoxy, they were tranſported with the moſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Expectations, and with eager Impatience attended him to the Place where he was to preach.</p>

I ſhall now re-aſſume the Perſon of my Informer, and proceed in his Narrative—<q>On the 6th of <hi>July</hi>—43, 
Mr. <hi>Robinſon</hi> preached his firſt Sermon to us from <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.3. and continued with us preaching four Days ſucceſſively. The Congregation was large the firſt Day; and as the Report of him ſpread, it vaſtly encreas'd on the three enſuing. 'Tis hard for the livelieſt Imagination to form an Image of the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Aſſembly on theſe glorious Days of the Son of Man. Such of us as had been hungring for the Word before, were loſt in an agreable Confuſion of various Paſſions, ſurprized, aſtoniſhed, pleaſed, enraptured! ſo that we were hardly capable of Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Government, and ſome could not refrain from pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly declaring their Tranſport: we were overwhelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Tho'ts of the unexpected Goodneſs of God, in allowing us to hear the Goſpel preached in a Manner that ſurpaſſed even our former Wiſhes, and much more our Hopes. Many that came thro' Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity were <hi>pricked to the Heart;</hi> and but few in the numerous Aſſemblies on theſe four Days appeared unaffected. They returned aſtoniſhed, alarmed with Apprehenſions of their dangerous Condition, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of their former entire Ignorance of Religion, and anxiouſly enquiring, what they ſhould do to be ſaved; and there is Reaſon to believe there was as much Good done by theſe four Sermons, as by all the Sermons preached in theſe Parts before or ſince.</q>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>Before Mr. <hi>Robinſon</hi> left us, he ſucceſsfully endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to correct ſome of our <hi>Antinomian</hi> Miſtakes, and to bring us to carry on the Worſhip of God more regularly at our Meetings. He adviſed us to meet to read good Sermons, and to begin &amp; conclude with Prayer and ſinging of Pſalms, which 'till then we had omitted. When we met next, we complied with his Directions; and when all the reſt refuſed, I read and prayed with Trembling and Diffidence; which Method was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:006657_0013_102975DD4FC61DD0"/>in ſundry Places 'till we were furniſhed with a Miniſter. The Bleſſing of God remarkably at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended theſe more private Means; and it was really aſtoniſhing to obſerve the ſolemn Impreſſions begun or continued in many, by hearing good Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes read. I had repeated Invitations to come to many Places round, ſome of them 30 or 40 Miles diſtant, to read; with which I generally comply'd. Conſiderable Numbers were won't to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, with eager Attention and awful Solemnity; and ſundry were, in a Judgment of Charity, thoro'ly turned to God, and thereupon erected Meeting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Houſes, and choſe Readers among themſelves, by which the Work was more extenſively carried on.</p>
               <p>Soon after our Father, Mr. <hi>Robinſon,</hi> left us, the Rev. Mr. <hi>John Blair</hi> paid us a ſhort Viſit; and truly he came to us <hi>in the Fulneſs of the Goſpel of Chriſt.</hi> Former Impreſſions were ripened, and new formed on many Hearts. One Night in particular a whole Houſe-full of People was quite over-come with the Power of the Word, particularly of one pungent Sentence that dropt from his Lips; and they could hardly ſit or ſtand, or keep their Paſſions under any proper Reſtraints, ſo general was the Concern during his Stay with us; and ſo ignorant were we of the Danger Perſons in ſuch a Caſe were in of Apoſtacy, which unhappy Obſervation has ſince taught us, that we pleaſed our ſelves with the Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>gathering</hi> of more <hi>People to</hi> the divine <hi>Shiloh</hi> than now ſeem to have been actually gathered to him; tho' there be ſtill the greateſt Reaſon to hope that ſundry bound themſelves to the Lord in an everlaſting Covenant, never to be forgotten.</p>
               <p>Some Time after this, the Rev. Mr. <hi>John Roan,</hi> was ſent by the Preſbytery of <hi>New-Caſtle,</hi> (under whoſe immediate Care we had voluntarily placed our ſelves to ſupply us. He continued with us longer
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:006657_0014_102975E04E88BBD0"/>than either of the former; and the happy Effects of his Miniſtrations are ſtill apparent in many Inſtances. He preached at ſundry Places at the earneſt Solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the People, which was the happy Occaſion of beginning and promoting the religious Concern, where there were little Appearances of it before. This, together with his ſpeaking pretty freely about the Degeneracy of the Clergy in this Colony, gave a general Alarm, and ſome Meaſures were concerted to ſuppreſs us. To incenſe the Indignation of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the more, a perfidious Wretch depoſed, he heard Mr. <hi>Roan</hi> uſe ſome blaſphemous Expreſſions in his Sermon, and ſpeak in the moſt ſhocking &amp; reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Manner of the eſtabliſhed Church. An Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was thereupon drawn up againſt Mr. <hi>Roan,</hi> (tho' by that Time he had departed the Colony) and ſome of the People who had invited him to preach at their Houſes, were cited to appear before the General Court, (which in this Government conſiſts of the Governour or Commander in Chief, and His Majeſty's Council) and two of them were fined <hi>twenty Shillings</hi> Sterling, beſides the Coſts, which in one of the Caſes would have amounted to near <hi>fifty Pounds,</hi> had the Evidences demanded their Due. While my Cauſe was upon Trial, I had Reaſon to rejoyce that the Throne of Grace is acceſſible in <hi>all Places,</hi> and that helpleſs Creatures can waft up their Deſires <hi>unſeen,</hi> to God, in the midſt of a Crowd. Six Evidences were cited to prove the Indictment againſt Mr. <hi>Roan;</hi> but their Depoſitions were in his Favour; and as for the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence mentioned juſt now, who accuſed him of Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy againſt God and the Church, when he heard of Meſſirs. <hi>G. Tennent</hi>'s and <hi>S. Finley</hi>'s Arrival, he fled, and has not returned ſince; ſo that the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was drop'd. I had Reaſon to fear being ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the Colony, and all Circumſtances ſeem'd to threaten the Extirpation of Religion among the Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in theſe Parts.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="unknown:006657_0015_102975E4D2919DC8"/>
In theſe Difficulties we lay, without any Perſon of a publick Character to appear in our Favour; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon we determined to acquaint the Synod of <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>York</hi> with our Caſe; hoping that a Synodical Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of it to our worthy Governour, the Hon. Sir WILLIAM GOOCH, might free him from the Miſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations under which he laboured, and procure us the Liberties granted to Proteſtant Diſſenters by <hi>the Act of Toleration.</hi> Accordingly four of us went to the Synod, <hi>May</hi> 1745, when the Lord favour'd us with Succeſs. The Synod being inform'd of our Difficulties, and preſuming they might be removed by an impartial Repreſentation of our Affairs, drew up an Addreſs to our Governour, and ſent the Rev. Meſſirs. <hi>G. Tennent</hi> and <hi>Samuel Finley</hi> to wait on his Honour to preſent it, and to officiate a few Days among us. Sir WILLIAM received them with Conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcention &amp; Reſpect, and granted them Liberty to preach in <hi>Hanover.</hi> By this Means the tremendous Cloud that hung over us was diſſipated for a Time, &amp; our languid Hopes were revived. Mr. <hi>Tennent</hi> and Mr. <hi>Finley</hi> continued with us about a Week, and tho' the Deluge of Paſſion in which we were at firſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed, was by this Time ſomewhat abated; yet much Good was done by their Miniſtry. The Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God were refreſhed, and ſundry careleſs Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners were awakened. Some that had confided before in their moral Conduct &amp; religious Duties, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the Depravity of their Nature, and the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of being renewed in the Spirit of their Mind; tho' indeed there were but few uneregenerate Perſons among us at that Time that could claim ſo regular a Character; the Generality of Profeſſors indulging themſelves in criminal Liberties, and being remiſs in the Duties of Religion; which alas! is too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the Caſe ſtill in ſuch Parts of the Colony as the late Revival did not extend to.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="unknown:006657_0016_102975E656F0DD20"/>
After theſe Gentlemen had left us, we continued vacant for a conſiderable Time, and kept up our Meetings for Reading and Prayer in ſundry Places; and the Lord favoured us at theſe Occaſions with his gracious Preſence. I was again repeatedly preſented and fined in Court for abſenting myſelf from Church, and keeping up unlawful Meetings, as they were called; <hi>but the Buſh flouriſhed in the Flames.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next that were appointed to ſupply us were the Rev. Meſſirs. <hi>William Tennent</hi> &amp; <hi>Samuel Blair.</hi> They waited on the Governour, and readily obtained his Permiſſion to officiate among us. Their <hi>Labours were not in vain in the Lord.</hi> They adminiſtred the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lord's Supper among us before their Departure; which was the firſt Adminiſtration of that heavenly Ordinance among us ſince our diſſent from the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and we have Reaſon to remember it 'till our laſt Moments, as a moſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Day of the Son of Man. The Aſſembly was large, and the Novelty of the Mode of Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion did peculiarly engage their Attention. The <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> were abundantly <hi>fed,</hi> and others were bro't to <hi>hunger and thirſt after Righteouſneſs.</hi> It appeared as one of <hi>the Days of Heaven</hi> to ſome of us; and we could hardly help wiſhing we could with <hi>Joſhua</hi> have delayed the Revolutions of the Heavens to prolong it.</p>
               <p>Meſſieurs <hi>Tennent</hi> &amp; <hi>Blair</hi> continued with us about a Fortnight, and immediately after their Departure, Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> came and preached four or five Days in theſe Parts; which was the happy Means of giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us farther Encouragement, and engaging others to the Lord, eſpecially among the Church-People, who received his Doctrines more readily than they would from Miniſters of the Preſbyterian Denomination.</p>
               <p>After his Departure, we were deſtitute of a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and followed our uſual Method of Reading and Prayer at our Meetings, 'till the Rev. Mr. <hi>Davies,</hi>
                  <pb n="18" facs="unknown:006657_0017_102975E96A3DFAE8"/>our preſent Paſtor, was ſent by the Preſbytery to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply us about ſix Week, in Spring, <hi>Anno</hi> 1747, when our Diſcouragements from the Government were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed and multiplied: For on one Sunday the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour's Proclamation was ſet up at our Meeting-Houſe, <hi>ſtrictly requiring all Magiſtrates to ſuppreſs &amp; prohibit, as far as they lawfully could, all itinerant Preachers,</hi> &amp;c.
which occaſion'd us to forbear Reading that Day, 'till we had Time to deliberate and conſult what was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient to do; but how joyfully were we ſurprized before the next Sabbath, when we unexpectedly heard that Mr. <hi>Davies</hi> was come to preach ſo long among us; and eſpecially, that he had qualified himſelf ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Law, and obtained the Licenſure of four Meeting-Houſes among us, which had never been done before! Thus when our Hopes were expiring, and our Liberties more precarious than ever, we were ſuddenly advanced to a more ſecure Situation. <hi>"Man's Extremity is the Lord's Opportunity."</hi> For this ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Inſtance of the Interpoſition of divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, we deſire to offer our grateful Praiſes; and we importune the Friends of <hi>Zion</hi> generouſly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur in the delightful Employ.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Thus, Sir, I have given you a brief Account of the Riſe and Progreſs of Religion here 'till my firſt coming into the Colony; and the Facts themſelves I know to be well atteſted, tho' the Order in which I have related them, is in ſome Inſtances prepoſterous.—I ſhall now proceed in my Narrative from my own Knowledge, and inform you of the State of Affairs ſince <hi>April</hi> 1747.</p>
            <p>The Diſſenters here were under peculiar Diſadvanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges for want of a ſettled Miniſter. By this they were not only deprived of the ſtated Miniſtrations of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, but alſo expoſed to great Difficulties from the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which could not be wholly removed while they continued vacant; for it was alledged, (this is no proper Place to enquire with how much Law or Reaſon)
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:006657_0018_102975EB011947D0"/>that 'till they were an organized Congregation, and had a Miniſter qualified, and their Meeting-Houſes lic<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>s'd, according to Law, they could not claim the Liberties and Immunities of the Act of Toleration. Beſides, the Itinerations of my Brethren, tho' occaſioned by Neceſſity, were miſconſtructed, as turning all Things upſide down, as a meer Artifice to wheedle People out of their Money, and as an Evidence there were ſuch prodigious Swarms of us to the Northward, that we were obliged to make Excurſions into diſtant Parts: When indeed the chief Reaſon was the ſmall Number of our Miniſters &amp; Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didates, which was vaſtly diſproportioned to the Vacan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies in <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> and much more to thoſe in <hi>Mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Virginia,</hi> (not to mention the Diſcouragements that would be naturally ſuggeſted to young Miniſters, at the Thoughts of removing to a ſtrange Colony, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from their Brethren, expoſed to peculiar Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigues, and the Embarraſsments of ſo limitted and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious a Toleration as they then had Reaſon to expect.) On theſe Accounts the Synod, and particularly the Preſbytery of <hi>New-Caſtle,</hi> were very ſolicitous to ſettle a Miniſter among them as ſoon as poſſible. I was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſent by ſaid Preſhytery into <hi>Hanover</hi> at the Time mentioned above, both to officiate for ſome Time, and to ſee if my Way ſhould be cleared to ſettle there. Upon my Arrival, I petitioned the General Court to grant me a Licenſe to officiate in and about <hi>Hanover,</hi> at four Meeting-Houſes; which after ſome Delay, was granted, upon my qualifying according to the Act of Toleration, i. e. taking the uſual Oaths to His Majeſty's Perſon and Government, getting the Meeting-Houſes recorded, and ſubſcribing the Articles of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> except the 34, 35, 36, and this Clauſe of the 20th,
<q>
                  <hi>The Church hath Power to decree Rites or Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, and Authority in Controverſies of Faith; and yet</hi>
               </q>—</p>

               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:006657_0019_102975EF780F8448"/>
I preach'd frequently in <hi>Hanover</hi> and ſome of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent Counties at this Time; and tho' the Fervour of the late Work was conſiderably abated, and my La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours were not bleſſed with Succeſs equal to thoſe of my Brethren; yet I have Reaſon to hope they were of Service in ſundry Inſtances. I have converſed with a few ſince, that were awakened at that Time; and ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry that had been under languiſhing Concern, were haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the Birth. The Importunities they uſed with me to ſettle were invincible; and upon my Departure, they ſent a Call for me to the Preſbytery, which, with three beſides, from other Places, all very neceſſitous, I took under Conſideration. I was fully convinc'd <hi>Hano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> ſtood in greater Need of a Miniſter than any Place I knew; and that if my Health permitted, and none of my Brethren could be prevailed upon to ſettle there, I could not refuſe their Call conſiſtently with Duty. After my Return from <hi>Virginia,</hi> I ſpent near a Year under melancholy and conſumptive Languiſhments, which I certainly expected would have conveyed me into the eternal World; and by this I hoped to be exempted from the diſagreable Obligation. In the Spring 1748, I began ſlowly to recover; tho' I then looked upon it only as the Intermiſſion of a Diſorder that would finally prove mortal. But upon the Arrival of a Meſſenger from <hi>Hanover,</hi> I <hi>put my Life in my Hand,</hi> and determin'd to accept of their Call; hoping I might live to organize the Congregation, and prepare the Way for ſome more uſeful Succeſſor; and willing to expire under the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigues of Duty, rather than in voluntary Negligence.— But I forget, Sir, that this Narrative may perhaps be preſented to the Publick, and indulge myſelf in an <hi>Egotiſm,</hi> as tho' I were writing only to a Friend. The only Apology I can make is, that ſome of my perſonal Affairs are ſo interwoven with thoſe of this Congregation, that I find it difficult to relate the latter, without uſing too great Freedoms in the former. However, you have
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:006657_0020_102975F3FA9321E8"/>my full Conſent to obliterate whatever you think un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of a publick View.</p>
            <p>My deareſt Brother, the Rev. Mr. <hi>John Rodgers,</hi> was ſent along with me to <hi>Hanover,</hi> to aſſiſt me for a few Sabbaths at my firſt Settlement. But when he offer'd himſelf in the General Court to take the Qualifications enjoined by Law, he was rejected, under Pretence that his Certificate not being granted by the Synod, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly that of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> but only by the Preſbytery, was inſufficient, (tho', by the Bye, it was as ſufficient as mine, which they had admitted; and given according to univerſal Preſident among Preſbyterians) whereupon he was obliged to return without preaching but one Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</p>
            <p>On this Occaſion, as well as all others, we had Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to acknowledge with the moſt dutiful Gratitude, the Condeſcenſion and Clemency of the Hon. Sir WILLIAM GOOCH, our late Governour, who always diſcovered a ready Diſpoſition to allow us all claimable Priviledges, and the greateſt Averſion to perſecuting Meaſures; but conſidering the horrendous &amp; ſhocking Reports ſpread Abroad concerning us by officious Malignants, it was no great Wonder the Council diſcovered a conſiderable Reluctancy to tolerate us. Had it not been for this, I perſwade my ſelf they would have ſhewn themſelves the Guardians of our legal Priviledges, as well as generous Patriots to their Country; which is the illuſtrious Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter generally given them.</p>
            <p>I obſerved, Sir, before, that I obtained the Licenſure of four Meeting-Houſes when I firſt came to the Colony. In <hi>October</hi> 1748, the People petitioned for the Licenſure of three more, which with great Difficulty was obtained. Among theſe ſeven, I have hitherto divided my Time, in Proportion to the Number of Diſſenters at each Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Houſe: Three of them lie in <hi>Hanover</hi> County, one in <hi>Henrico</hi> County, which lies Southward; one in <hi>Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line</hi> County, which lies Northward; one in <hi>Louiſa</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:006657_0021_102975F583F3F298"/>County, ſituated to the Weſtward; and one in <hi>Gooch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to the South-weſt of <hi>Hanover.</hi> The neareſt are 12 or 15 Miles diſtant from each other, and the Extremes about 40. My Congregation is very much diſperſed; and notwithſtanding the Number of the Meeting-Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, ſome live 20, ſome 30, and a few 40 Miles from the neareſt. Were they all compactly ſituated in one County, they would be ſufficient to form three diſtinct Congregations; but in their preſent Situation, I believe they could conſtitute but two large ones, each capable of affording a competent Maintenance to a Miniſter. At the lower Meeting-Houſe in <hi>Hanover,</hi> which I took more immediately as my Charge when I accepted their Call, there is a ſufficient Number to form a large Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but as it lies between that in <hi>Caroline,</hi> and that in <hi>Henrico</hi> which are but weak, it would ſeem cruel to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate it from them, as they could not each of them maintain a Miniſter of their own. The People about the four upper Meeting-Houſes are waiting for a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter with impatient Eagerneſs, and intend to reduce their Houſes into three.</p>
            <p>Were you Sir, to preach at any of theſe Houſes, where there is the ſmalleſt Number of Diſſenters, you would imagine there was a ſufficient Number of People to form a diſtinct Congregation at each of them; for where there are not above 15 or 20 Families that have fully join'd with me, you'l ſee perhaps 4 or 500 Hearers, and ſometimes twice that Number; the Church-People in general being very eager to hear. This I looked upon at firſt as a meer Curioſity after Novelty; but as it continues in general without Abatement, and in ſome Places ſeems to increaſe; I cannot but look upon it as a happy Preſage. This I have the more Reaſon to do now, as I have obſerved many of theſe neutral Hearers become at length thoroughly engaged, and ſundry of them bro't to be ſolemnly tho'tful. I believe I could number up 50 or 60 Families, who have thus been hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:006657_0022_10293C680E08A6C0"/>intangled in the Net of the Goſpel by their own Curioſity, or ſome ſuch Motive, ſince my coming here; and I have Reaſon to hope, that were there another Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter ſettled here, it would cauſe a very great Addition to our Number. Indeed this appears to me the moſt promiſing Circumſtance that at preſent attends us; for alas! there ſeems no great Proſpect of the Conviction of thoſe that are thoroughly proſelyted, and yet have reſted ſhort of real Religion (tho' bleſſed be the Lord, a few of them are awakened now and then) but when any of theſe tranſient Hearers, that are at their own Diſpoſal, and not under the Influence of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, &amp;c. who are already attached, do join with us, 'tis generally a Sign of ſome conſiderable Degrees of Conviction; as the Epithet <hi>New-Light</hi> (the uſual Brand with which we are here ſtigmatized) is ſo reproachful, that the Secure will not venture to incur the <hi>Odium.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are about 300 Communicants in my Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who make an external Profeſſion of real Religion. I am not fond of publiſhing a Calculation of Chriſtians; as I am ſenſible of the Fallibility of my Judgment in ſuch Caſes: but it is impoſſible for a Heart anxious for the Salvation of Men, to deny itſelf the Comfort of counting up at Times the Number of thoſe that appear ſuch in a Judgment of rational Charity; and I enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the pleaſing Hope that the greateſt Number of theſe Communicants are ſincere in their Profeſſion, and ſhall <hi>walk with Chriſt in White</hi> in the Fields of immortal Glory. Beſides theſe, there are many that are conſtant Hearers and cordial Proſelytes, who thro' a conſciouſneſs of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitneſs, or exceſſive Scrupuloſity, do not ſeek Admiſſion as yet to the Lord's Table.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ethiopia has</hi> alſo <hi>ſtretched forth her Hands unto God.</hi> There is a great Number of Negroes in theſe Parts; and ſometimes I ſee a 100 &amp; more among my Hearers. I have baptized about 40 Adults of them within theſe three Years, upon their making ſuch a Profeſſion of
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:006657_0023_102975FE765DB980"/>ſaving Faith as I then judged credible. Some of them, I fear, have apoſtatized; but others of them, I truſt, will perſevere to the End. I have had as ſatisfactory Evidences of the ſincere Piety of ſundry of them, as ever I had from any Perſon in my Life; and their art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Simplicity, their paſſionate Aſpirations after Chriſt, their inceſſant Endeavours to learn and do the Will of God, have charmed my very Soul. But alas! while my Charge is ſo extenſive, and my Labours parcelled out among ſo many, I cannot take ſufficient Pains with them for their Inſtruction; which often oppreſſes my Heart.</p>
            <p>There have been, Sir, a few Inſtances of unhappy Apoſtacy among us; but I count it a peculiar Bleſſing, that there have not been ſo many Backſliders here, in Proportion to the Number once awakened, as I have ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally obſerved in other Places, where there has been a great religious Commotion.</p>
            <p>There are a few that I know of at preſent under deep and promiſing Impreſſions, and ſundry languiſhing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der feeble Convictions: But in general, a lamentable Security prevails; and, as it generally happens in a Time of the Withdrawment of the divine Preſence, the faint Impreſſions that are made on ſome by the Dint of Preaching, ſoon wear off.—Oh! for a <hi>little Revival in our Bondage!</hi> In this Prayer Sir, I doubt not but you will heartily join, and endeavour to procure the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of others in ſo ſeaſonable a Petition.</p>
            <p>Laſt Sabbath I adminiſtred the Lord's Supper at one of my Meeting-Houſes; and there appeared more So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity and Affection in the numerous Aſſembly, than I have ſeen for ſome Months.</p>
            <p>I might Sir, have given you a <hi>particular</hi> Account of the Converſion of ſome Perſons here; as indeed there are ſome uncommon Inſtances of it: but it would oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupy too much of my Time, and ſwell this Hiſtory to an exceſſive Bulk. It may ſuffice in general to obſerve,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:006657_0024_1029760000621560"/>that abſtracting peculiar Appendages and in different Circumſtances, the Work of Converſion here has been generally carried on in thoſe Steps that are deſcribed by experimental Divines, as <hi>Alliene, Shepherd, Stoddard, Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel,</hi> &amp;c. And there's nothing confirms me more in the Truth of their Notions of experimental Piety, than the univerſal Uniformity and Agreement in Subſtance of the Exerciſes of thoſe that can make the faireſt Claim to ſaving Grace, however different their Reſidences, Education, external Means, &amp;c. be.</p>
            <p>There is one <hi>Iſaac Oliver</hi> here, a Miracle of a Man, whoſe Hiſtory, could I write it intelligibly to you, would be very entertaining. He has been deaf &amp; dumb from his Birth, and is now grown up to Manhood. The want of theſe Faculties rendered him wholly incapable of all humane Converſe &amp; Inſtruction, except by <hi>Signs;</hi> and as for the moſt of divine Things, they ſeem to me of ſo abſtract and ſp<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="5 letters">
                  <desc>•••••</desc>
               </gap>al a Nature, that the firſt No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of them can never be conveyed by this obſcure Medium: And yet (I mention it with grateful Wonder) I have the utmoſt Reaſon to believe he is truly gracious, and alſo acquainted with moſt of the Doctrines of Chriſtianity, and many Matters of Fact related in the hiſtorical Part of the Bible. I my ſelf have ſeen him repreſent the Crucifixion of Chriſt, the Swallowing and Ejection of <hi>Jonah</hi> by the Whale, &amp;c. in ſuch ſignificant Signs, that I could not but underſtand them. Some of his Signs whereby he deſcribed Heaven and Hell were alſo intelligible to me; but many of them about other Things, I could make nothing of. Thoſe that live in the Houſe with him, can hold an intelligible Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with him, and he with them, upon moſt of Things, with ſurprizing Readineſs; and he undoubtedly has the moſt ſignificant Geſtures of any Man I ever ſaw in my Life, which his Relations underſtand by repeated Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and uſe them to communicate their Tho'ts to him. There is ſo much of the devout Ardour of his
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:006657_0025_1029760186089610"/>Soul diſcovered in them at Times, as is really affecting; and I have ſeen him converſe in Signs about the Love and Sufferings of Chriſt, 'till he has been tranſported with Earneſtneſs, and diſſolved into affectionate Tears. The above Mr <hi>Morris,</hi> with whom he lives, has told me, that <hi>Iſaac</hi> informs him he had theſe Diſcoveries of divine Things made to him while in Bed, probably in a Dream; and that eight Years ago he appeared remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kably changed in Temper and Conduct. He ſeems ever ſince very conſciencious in the whole of his Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; generally delights to attend public &amp; domeſtic Worſhip, tho' he cannot hear a Word; and is obſerved ſometimes to retire for ſecret Devotion; tho' he ſignifies that he is praying with his Heart, when about his Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or in Company; which is peculiarly practicable to him, as in all Places he enjoys the undiſturbed Sere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Retirement. He diſcovers an expert Genius in thoſe Things he is capable of, particularly in ſundry mechanical Employments; and his Paſſions ſeem very vigorous: in any paſſionate Emotions, his whole Viſage and all his Geſtures are ſurprizingly expreſſive of the Temper of his Mind; ſo that he ſeems to ſtand in the leaſt Need of the Faculty of Speech of any Man I have known.—I could relate ſundry other remarkable Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarities concerning him; but as they are unintelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to my ſelf, or might ſeem incredible to thoſe that are unacquainted with him, I omit them.
<note n="*" place="bottom">'Tis the general Opinion of thoſe that are acquainted with him, and eſpecially of the Family where he lives, who have beſt Opportunities of obſerving him, that he can read. The firſt Evidence of it appeared when he ſeemed to be firſt under religious Impreſſions; for he was then obſerved to be frequently taking the Bible and looking into it: and ever fince, he gives the following Evidences of it: He frequently looks into the Bible, or other good Books, with great Intenſeneſs; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times points with his Finger to ſome particular Sentences, and tries to perſwade others to read them; and theſe Sentences, as the Family tells me, are peculiarly affecting, and worthy of diſtinct Notice. If you put a Book into his Hand inverted, he will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately turn it into a proper Poſition. When a Hiſtory, or the like, is put into his Hand, after looking into it a little while, he throws it away with Signs of its Uſeleſneſs; but give him a Bible, tho' it were of a Size and Character he never ſaw before, or ſome other good Book upon religious Subjects, he hugs it in his Boſom with Signs of the moſt endeared Approbation. He intimates by Signs, that the Almanack treats of the Sun, Moon and Stars, the Weather, &amp;c. I have opened the Bible in <hi>Jonah,</hi> and ſhewn it him; and after a little Peruſal, he has given me a very lively Deſcription of the Fate of that Prophet. — Many other ſuch Things are obſervable concerning him; but whether theſe are ſufficient Indications that he can read, and whether they are fit to be offered to public View, is wholly ſubmitted to your Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. If he can receive Ideas from viſible Characters, which to him cannot be the Signs of Words or Sounds, it muſt be entirely miraculous. Every One muſt ſee, that no Methods could be uſed to teach one to read, who has been entirely deaf and dumb from the firſt Point of his Exiſtence: And tho' we ſhould ſuppoſe him to have as expert a Genius as the firſt Inventors of Characters as the Signs of Words; yet, as he is wholly ignorant of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Language, it appears inconceivable to me how he could poſſibly find out the arbitrary Connection between Letters and Ideas, without the Medium of Words. But <hi>is there any Thing too hard for the Lord?</hi>—</note> So much,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:006657_0026_1029760311E45E38"/>however, I know of him, that I cannot but look upon him as a miraculous Monument of almighty Grace, that can perform its beneficent Purpoſes on Mankind, notwithſtanding the greateſt natural or moral Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and I ſubmit it to others Judgment, whether a Perſon ſo incapable of external Inſtructions, could be brought to know the Myſteries of the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven any other Way than by immediate Revelation. — Beſides the People here, ſundry of my Brethren, who have been here, particularly the Rev. Meſſirs. <hi>Samuel Blair</hi> and <hi>John Roan,</hi> can atteſt this Relation; tho' to ſome it may appear an hyperbolical Affectation of the <hi>Marvellous;</hi> or the Effect of popular Superſtition, which is wont to aſcribe ſomething prophetick or divine to thoſe that labour under ſuch natural Defects.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:006657_0027_102976090A8CBEA0"/>
I forgot to inform you, Sir, in its proper Place, that the Rev. Mr. <hi>Davenport</hi> was ſent by the Synod to <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nover</hi> laſt Summer, &amp; continued here about 2 Months. There appeared ſome Evidences then, and I have diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered more ſince, that he did not labour in vain. Some were brought under ſolemn Impreſſions, which ſeem to have a happy Iſſue; and many of the Lord's People were much revived, and can never forget the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it.</p>
            <p>Thus, dear Sir, I have given you a brief Narrative of the Riſe and Progreſs of Religion among us; and I doubt not but you will readily acquieſce in the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which after ſufficient Scrutiny I have drawn, <hi>That this is the Lord's Doing.</hi> I claim no <hi>Infallibility;</hi> but I muſt not under the modeſt Pretence of renouncing it, ſcruple a Matter atteſted with all poſſible Evidences, and ſo ruſh into <hi>Septiciſm.</hi> If I could form no Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſo public a Work, I ſhould renounce my Function this Moment; for with what Face can I pretend to promote a divine Work in the Converſion of Men, if I cannot have any <hi>ſatisfying</hi> Knowledge of it, when it appears? I act in the Dark, and promote I know not what. Indeed the Evidence of its Divinity here is ſo irreſiſtible, that it has extorted an Acknowledgement from ſome, from whom it could hardly be expected. The Rev. Mr. <hi>John Thomſon,</hi> who, tho' a Man of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and, I hope, Piety, unhappily oppoſed the late Revival in <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> with the moſt induſtrious Zeal, has repeatedly declar'd,
<q>That whatever our Miniſters had done elſewhere, they have undoubtedly done MUCH GOOD in <hi>Hanover;</hi> and that he heartily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced in it.</q> Were your Soul, Sir, contracted with the narrow Spirit of a Bigot, you would no doubt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge an ignoble Joy at the Tho't, that there are now ſome <hi>Hundreds</hi> of Diſſenters in a Place where a few Years ago there were not <hi>ten</hi> that I know of within a
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:006657_0028_1029760C1968F1A0"/>hundred Miles;
<note n="*" place="bottom">There are and have been in this Colony a great Number of Stotch Merchants, who were educated Preſbyterians; but (I ſpeak but what their Conduct more loudly proclaims) they generally upon their Arrival here, prove Scandals to their Religion and Country by their looſe Principles and immoral Practices, and either fall into an Indifferency about Religion in general, or affect to be po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite by turning Deiſts, or faſhionable by conforming to the Church.</note> but I aſſure my ſelf of your Congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulations on a nobler Account, becauſe a conſiderable Number of periſhing Sinners are gained to the bleſſed Redeemer, with whom, tho' you never ſee them in theſe Regions of Mortality, you may ſpend a bliſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Eternity in the divineſt Intimacy, and mutually aſſiſt each other in aſcribing immortal Praiſes to <hi>the Lamb that was ſlain, and has redeemed</hi> his People <hi>by his Blood, out of every Kindred, and Tongue, and People, and Nation.</hi>— After all, poor <hi>Virginia</hi> demands your Compaſſion; for Religion at preſent is but like the little Cloud which <hi>Elijah</hi>'s Servant ſaw; and ſometimes I am afraid of its unſeaſonable Diſſipation.

            <p>There is an immenſe Quantity of Land unſettled to the Weſtward of <hi>Hanover,</hi> between this and <hi>Miſſiſippii</hi>-River; to which People from moſt of the Northern Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, particularly from <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> and <hi>New-Jerſey,</hi> are yearly removing in vaſt Multitudes.

Tho' theſe Congregations have been hitherto deſtitute of the ſtated Miniſtrations of the Goſpel; yet the Ite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations of my Brethren among them, have been at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with very conſiderable Succeſs. Mr. <hi>Robinſon,</hi> as I intimated before, took a Tour thro' theſe Frontier Counties, and into <hi>North-Carolina,</hi> about ſeven Years ago. He underwent great Hardſhips in <hi>Carolina,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much Succeſs, by Reaſon of the Fewneſs of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants at that Time; who were generally ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultivated Savages, that there was little Proſpect of
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:006657_0033_10297619EAFCE200"/>doing them much Service without continuing a long Time among them to teach them the firſt Rudiments of Chriſtianity; and ſo ſcattered, that but very few of them could convene in one Place to hear. The Caſe is indeed happily altered there ſince that Time, as the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants are vaſtly more numerous, and ſome Perſons that had a religious Education are ſettled among them. A new Congregation, I think upon <hi>Pee-dee River,</hi> ſent a Petition to me laſt Year to be preſented to <hi>New-Caſtle</hi> Preſbytery for a Miniſter, ſubſcribed by more than a
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:006657_0034_1029761CF76DFCB8"/>Hundred Perſons, chiefly Heads of Families; and one of my Correſpondents there informs me, that they are very ſufficient to maintain a Miniſter. Our Preſbytery appointed Mr. <hi>James Finley</hi> to viſit them; but by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition he was prevented; ſo that they have lain wholly deſtitute hitherto, and are like to do ſo, unleſs they can obtain ſome foreign Aſſiſtance, beſides what our Preſbytery can afford them. Beſides this, I hear of ſundry other Places in <hi>North-Carolina,</hi> that are ripening very faſt for the Goſpel: And Oh! that the Lord would <hi>THRUST forth Labourers into that Part of his Harveſt;</hi> for I am afraid but few will go thither, 'till they are <hi>thruſt</hi> and conſtrained by an irreſiſtible Zeal, and a providential Concurrence of Circumſtances.—</p>

Mr. <hi>Robinſon</hi> continued, I think, 15 Sabbaths in <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenburg</hi> and <hi>Amelia,</hi> and left ſundry ſpiritual Children there behind him. A conſiderable Number of <hi>Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> who knew nothing of real Religion before, were awakened by his Miniſtry; and their Conduct ſince gives Ground for a charitable Judgment concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them. Sundry alſo that had removed thither from the Northward, and had a religious Education, and a Syſtem of orthodox Principles, were convinced of their unregenerate Condition, and that they had had but a <hi>Form of Godlineſs without the Power,</hi> who now appear ſolid Chriſtians.—At their repeated Solicitations, I ſpent about a Fortnight preaching among them the Beginning of this Month <hi>[June];</hi> and tho' they ſeem ſenſibly lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing for the Want of the Means of Grace, yet ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry give agreable Evidences of real Religion; and there is a Proſpect of doing much Service, were they furniſhed with a faithful Miniſter. I met with moſt Encouragement in a Part of <hi>Amelia</hi> County, where very few had heard any of my Brethren. The Aſſemblies were large even on Week Days, and ſometimes there appeared much Solemnity and Affection among them. There appears the greateſt Probability, that if they had faithful Preaching frequently, many of them would be turned to the Lord; and it was really afflictive to me, that the Neceſſity of my own Congregation conſtrained me to leave them ſo ſoon, and refuſe ſundry Invitations they gave me to preach in other Places in the County. I believe another Congregation would ſoon be gathered there, had they frequent Preaching.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Augusta,</hi> there is a great Number of ſolid and warm Chriſtians; ſome of whom were ſuch when they came thither, &amp; others have experienced a happy Change ſince. There was a pretty general Awakening there ſome Years ago under the Miniſtry of Mr. <hi>Dean</hi> (now at Reſt) and Mr. <hi>Byram;</hi> the Effects of which in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Inſtances are ſtill apparent; and the Itinerations of
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:006657_0036_102976231C324300"/>moſt of my Brethren before &amp; ſince, have been bleſs'd with Succeſs. I believe three Miniſters might live very comfortably among them.</p>
            <p>I have no general Acquaintance in <hi>Frederic</hi> County, tho' I have paſs'd thro' it, and preached frequently in ſome Parts of it: but I am credibly informed by ſuch of my Brethren as have been often there, that there has been a conſiderable Awakening there ſome Years ago, which has had a bleſſed Iſſue in many, and that the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation is in promiſing Circumſtances, and has been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring, tho' unſucceſsfully, to obtain a Miniſter, for ſundry Years.</p>
            <p>You will no doubt, be glad to have ſome certain In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of the State of Religion in <hi>Maryland;</hi> and therefore, tho' I now live at a great Diſtance from the Places there where it flouriſhes, yet as I preached at moſt of them formerly, when the religious Commotion was at its Height, and as I have heard of no remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Alterations in them ſince, I ſhall give the following conciſe Account; which you may depend upon as true.</p>
            <p>There has been a conſiderable <hi>Revival</hi> (ſhall I call it?) or <hi>firſt Plantation</hi> of Religion in <hi>Baltimore</hi> County, which lies along <hi>Suſquehannah</hi> River, bordering on <hi>Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania,</hi> where, I'm informed, Mr. <hi>Whittleſey</hi> (with whom I find, you are acquainted) is like to ſettle.— Of this Mr. <hi>S. Blair,</hi> if I remember rightly, gives an Account in, <hi>The Chriſtian Hiſtory;</hi> and therefore I ſhall ſay no more of it.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Kent</hi> County and <hi>Queen Ann's,</hi> which lie between <hi>Cheaſapeak</hi> Bay and <hi>Delaware,</hi> a Number of careleſs Sinners have been awakened and hopefully brought to Chriſt. The Work was begun and chiefly carried on by the Inſtrumentality of that favoured Man Mr. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binſon;</hi> whoſe Succeſs, whenever I reflect upon it, aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes me. Oh! he did much in a little Time; and who would not chuſe ſo expeditious a Pilgrimage thro'
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:006657_0037_102976263350EEB0"/>this World? There is in theſe Places a conſiderable Congregation; and they have made repeated Eſſays to obtain a ſettled Miniſter, but are not like to ſucceed 'till our Number is increaſed.</p>
            <p>There was a great Stir about Religion in a Place cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Buckingham,</hi> on the Sea-ſhore, about four Years ago, when I was there; but it was not then come to Matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. It has ſpread ſince, and iſſued in a hopeful Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion in ſundry Inſtances; and I am informed they are now ſufficient to conſtitute a Congregation, and are waiting for a Miniſter.</p>
            <p>But the moſt glorious Diſplay of divine Grace in <hi>Maryland</hi> has been in and about <hi>Somerſet</hi> County, which lies at ſome Diſtance from <hi>Cheaſapeak</hi> Bay on the Eaſtern Shore. It began, I think, in the Year 1745, by the Miniſtry of Mr. <hi>Robinſon;</hi> and was afterwards carried on by ſundry Miniſters that preach'd tranſiently there. I was there about two Months, when the Work was at its Height; and I never ſaw ſuch a deep and ſpreading Concern among People in my Life as then appeared among them: The Aſſemblies were nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, tho' it was in the Extremity of a cold Winter, and unwearied in attending the Word; and frequently there were very few among them that did not give ſome plain Indications of Diſtreſs or Joy. Oh! theſe were the happieſt Days that ever my Eyes ſaw, or are, as I fear, like to ſee. Since that, the Harveſt ſeems over there; tho' conſiderable Gleanings, I hear, are ſtill gathered; and many of the late Converts give the utmoſt Reaſon to preſume their final Perſeverance. There had been a Congregation of Preſbyterians there for many Years; but they were reduced almoſt to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing before the late Revival; when many of the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>People were brought under deep Impreſſions, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dially joined with them; ſo that now they form at leaſt one large Congregation; and after many friutleſs At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, they have lately been ſo happy as to obtain the
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:006657_0038_10297627D66CCC88"/>Reverend Mr. <hi>Hugh Henry</hi> for their Miniſter, a Youth of a good Genius and undoubted Piety, who will I truſt, be an extenſive Bleſſing to that Part of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony.</p>
            <p>I might, Sir, have been more particular on moſt of Things in this Narrative; but as a <hi>general</hi> View may perhaps be ſufficient to you and the Public, and is moſt convenient to me in my preſent Hurry, I have declined it.—The indigeſted Order and other Inaccuries you will eaſily diſcern, are proper Objects for your Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour and Generoſity; and I have no other Apology to make, but that the unavoidable Hurry of the Bearer on a Buſineſs of the greateſt Importance to the Intereſt of Religion in <hi>Virginia,</hi> in which we doubt not of your hearty Concurrence, will not ſuffer me to tranſcribe this firſt Draft.</p>
            <p>I ſhall prize it, dear Sir, as an ineſtimable Bleſſing, if you and others of the Lord's Servants and People in diſtant Parts, favour us with the Concurrence of your Prayers to promote the declining Work of Religion among us; which is the only Way I can expect the Aſſiſtance of moſt of them.</p>
            <p>The Conſtancy of your Correſpondence, Sir, affords me peculiar Satisfaction in my preſent ſolitary Situation: And if any of the ſacred Character, in any Parts of the Church where this Narrative may come, ſhould condeſcend to favour me with their Correſpondence, I ſhould moſt gratefully acknowledge it, and make them the beſt Returns in my Power. Our Acquaintance with the State of the Church in various Parts, quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies us to adapt our Prayers to it; and therefore ſuch mutual Intelligences may be of ſpecial Service to us in our Interceſſions.</p>

               <pb n="40" facs="unknown:006657_0039_1029762AE665F4C0"/>

            <head>APPENDIX.</head>
            <p>I At firſt intended, Sir, to have ſaid Nothing of a particular Reſtraint impos'd upon us at preſent by the civil Government; leſt I ſhould ſeem fond of raiſing the Cry of <hi>Perſecution,</hi> which is very indecent in the Followers of the uncomplaining Lamb of God, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially when there is in Truth ſo little Occaſion for it; or to fling injurious Reflections on His Majeſty's Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil for this Colony, for whom I have the profoundeſt Veneration on Account both of their honourable Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and their Accompliſhments for it; and under whoſe indulgent Adminiſtration we enjoy ſo many civil and ſacred Liberties.</p>
            <p>But as I know not, Sir, but this Narrative may come into the Hands of ſome who may have ſome Influence to ſecure our Priviledges, or procure their Enlargement, if it may be judged that we lie under any illegal Reſtraints; and as the Matter is not only public in this Colony, but has been lately laid before the Government in <hi>England</hi> by the Preſident &amp; Council, for Advice; I ſhall venture to give you the following ſhort, ſimple Narrative of it; without any tedious Argumentations upon it; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out injurious Aſperſions, which are far from my Heart.</p>
            <p>The General Court, as I informed you, have licenſed ſeven Meeting-Houſes for me to officiate in; and I ſhould not deſire to have their Number and my Fatigues encreaſed, were not the Circumſtances of the Diſſenters in <hi>Virginia</hi> extraordinary &amp; peculiar. There are a few
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:006657_0041_10297633E38A2CD0"/>of them in ſundry Counties beſides theſe in which the licenſed Houſes are, who are too weak to maintain a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of their own; and were they never ſo able, they could not obtain one in the preſent Scarcity of Miniſters. Theſe have given me repeated and importunate Invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to come and preach among them; but I judged it imprudent to comply till the Places were legally li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed. Upon this ſome of them, with a View to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain my Labours tranſiently among them, at leaſt on Week Days, and the Viſits of my Brethren in their Iti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, have petitioned the Courts of their reſpective Counties for Licenſes for Places convenient to them; but they have either been denied, or the Licenſe grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the County Court has been nullified by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil; which has diſcouraged others that they have made no Application. This is a Diſadvantage to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, not only as they are thereby deprived of the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Word, but as they are expoſed to the intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Hardſhip of carrying their Children ſo great a Way to be baptized.</p>
            <p>The Council has ſuperſeded a Licenſe granted by a County Court on the Preſumption, "<hi>That it does not belong to a County Court to proceed in ſuch Affairs;</hi> and, <hi>That a diſſenting Miniſter has no legal Right to more Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Houſes than one:</hi>" And theſe two Points have been ſubmitted to the Determination of thoſe to whoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince it belongs in <hi>England;</hi> but no Anſwer is yet arriv'd.</p>
            <p>The taking the Authority from County Courts of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtring the legal Qualifications to Miniſters and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſing Meeting-Houſes, would be no great Diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to us in <hi>Havover,</hi> becauſe we might eaſily apply to the Commander in Chief, or the General Court; and therefore 'tis of ſmall Importance with me how it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined; tho' it would occaſion a conſiderable Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty to thoſe that live 2 or 300 Miles diſtant from <hi>Williamſburg.</hi>
            </p>

               <pb n="43" facs="unknown:006657_0042_10297635ADACB020"/>
But the reſtraining a diſſenting Miniſter to but <hi>one</hi> Meeting-Houſe would be a prodigious Grievance to the People in their preſent Circumſtances.—This, Sir, is not a proper Place to debate the Legality of it, nor does it belong to my Province to determine it; yet I may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offenſively ſuggeſt the following Remarks upon it, as Matters of Speculation to the Curious, and of Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to thoſe in Authority.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty's private Inſtructions with Reſpect to Diſſenters, to the Governour or Commander in Chief, (ſo far as I can recoliect them from a tranſient View, which the Hon. Col. LEE, our late Preſident favoured me with) run thus <hi>verhatim,</hi>
               <q>You are to tolerate all Diſſenters (except Papiſts) who lead quiet and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offenſive Lives</q>—But how can ſuch Diſſenters be tolerated, who by Reaſon of Weakneſs and the Scarcity of Miniſters, cannot obtain a Miniſter of their own, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they may legally ſhare in the Labours of a Miniſter with other Places, which cannot be without a Plurality of Meeting-Houſes under the Care of one Miniſter?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Act of Toleration</hi> (which has been received by our Legiſlature
<note n="‖" place="bottom">This Act was received <hi>An, quart. Reginae Annae,</hi> in theſe Words, "If any Perſon being of the Age of twenty-one Years, or upwards, ſhall willfully abſent him or herſelf from Divine Service at his or her Pariſh Church or Chapel, the Space of one Month, (EXCEPT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ING AS IS EXCEPTED IN AN ACT OF PARLIAMENT PASSED IN THE FIRST YEAR OF K. WILLIAM AND Q. MARY, entitled, <hi>An Act for exempting their Majeſty's Proteſtant Subjects diſſenting from the Church of</hi> England, <hi>from the Penalty of certain Laws</hi>)—Every ſuch Perſon—being lawfully convicted, by Confeſſion, or otherwiſe,— ſhall forfeit and pay, for every ſuch Offence, the Sum of Five Shillings, or fifty Pounds of Tobacco."</note>) does not determine the Number of Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Houſes, but only gives a general Toleration to le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally qualified Miniſters to officiate in Places legally licenſed: And may it not be reaſonably preſumed from hence, That the <hi>Number</hi> is left to be determined ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the peculiar Circumſtances of particular Congregations?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="unknown:006657_0043_10297638B8998468"/>
Father; The ſaid Act expreſly ſays,—<q>That all the Laws made and provided for the frequenting of divine Service on the Lord's-Day, commonly called <hi>Sunday,</hi> ſhall be ſtill in Force, and executed againſt all Perſons that offend againſt the ſaid Laws, except ſuch Perſons come to ſome Congregation or Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of religious Worſhip, allowed or permitted by this Act.</q> But how can Perſons come to ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation or Aſſembly, unleſs a Place within their Reach be licenſed for that Purpoſe? If this Liberty be denied them, are they not obliged, according to <hi>the Act of To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration</hi> it ſelf, to attend conſtantly on Worſhip in the eſtabliſhed Church? And if ſo, where is their Toleration?</p>
            <p>Finally; It is a very common Thing in this Colony, and allowed expreſly by Law, that where the Pariſh is of great Extent, and cannot be divided into ſundry, each of them capable to maintain a Miniſter, to erect 2, 3 or 4 Churches or Chappels of Eaſe, for the Conveniency of the Pariſh, where the Miniſter officiates alternately, or in Proportion to the Number of People: And ſince the Reaſon for a Plurality of Meeting-Houſes among us, is the ſame; why is it not equally legal?—Sundry under Things might be ſuggeſted; but I forbear.</p>
