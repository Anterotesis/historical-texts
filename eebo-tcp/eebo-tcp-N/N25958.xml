            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE HORRORS OF A MONASTERY.</head>
            <p>IN the province of Catalonia, which forms the north-weſt corner of the kingdom of Spain ſtood formerly the monaſtery of St. Mark,—(at the commencement of this ſtory, which was in the 12th century, it is well known what an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal ſpirit of depravity and licentiouſneſs, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded every ſacred rank without exception,)—ſituated on a rock which looked into the wide ocean. This retreat, whether at one time the hiſſing waters awed, or at another their mirrored ſurface calmed the brea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> into devotion, ſeemed formed by the hand of nature for the abode of contemplation. On the other ſide, the fearful tops of the Pyrenees appeared to penetrate the ſkies, and brooded over the ſcene in ſhapeleſs grandieur. Rhodolpho was the owner of a large track of territory, which lay in the ſame province. His anceſtors had inhabited theſe for ſeveral ages ſignalizing themſelves in civil as well as military
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:034525_0005_0FFE192B611CB710"/>
capacities. Rhodolpho fell in one of the laſt battles that effected the expulſion of the Moors from Spain, and left behind him an only daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to ſucceed to his poſſeſſions. The lovely El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mira had juſt completed her 18th year at her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's death. Her qualifications every way ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, had attracted the notice, and won the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of Bernard, only ſon to the Count of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragon, a young nobleman equivalent in all reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects to the pretenſions of her merit. She was betrothed to him, and to their union there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained no other obſtacle, than the reſpect, on her part, due to a father's memory. In conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of this, it ſeemed proper to her guardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that a twelve month ſhould elapſe before the conſummation of their nuptials, and that this ſhe ſhould devote to religious obſervances for the departed ſpirit. She was accordingly removed to the monaſtery of St. Mark. She had a laſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview with her Bernard before ſhe bade a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary adieu to the world, when, after the moſt ſolemn proteſtations of mutual regard, and after ſhe had pledged her faith to acquaint him if any illneſs ſhould befal her, they took a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der farewell of each other. She then retired to the cloiſter, where eleven long months were ſpent in the ſociety <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ſaints, whoſe night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vigils, tears, abſtinence, and wretched appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, bore every mark of penitence and ſanctity. Her time paſſed on in a round of melancholy rites by day, and ſlumbers interrupted by the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night bell.</p>

Bernard, to be near the idol of his heart, had been the lowly inhabitant of a cottage hard by. He uſed to wander in the ſilent hour of night a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the ſhore, and when a light from above darted its beams upon the ſtillneſs of the ſcene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round him, imagination carried him to the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from whence it came. He fancied his bride then occupied in the ſolemn offices of religion, and his ſoul aroſe with her's to the throne of their common Preſerver. In theſe nocturnal watchings, he had frequently imagined at the intervals when the waves ceaſed to break upon the rocks, that he heard a diſtant confuſed ſound. ſimilar to that of revelling. At firſt he thought it might have been ſome illuſion of his ſenſes; but at length, when it was frequently repeated, it began to diſturb his quiet, and make him think within himſelf that all was not right. He wiſhed Elmira away from the abbey. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted acceſs to her, but it was denied him. This increaſed his anxiety. As the time, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, drew nigh, being now but a few weeks diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, in which ſhe ſhould come forth from he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſad reſidence, he determined within himſelf to wait with patience the fulfilling of it. His con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures were right. In Peter, abbot of the c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vent, beneath the garb of abſtinence and humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, was concealed a wretch of the moſt flagitious nature. He and ſome others of the monks, at the dead hour of night, uſed to ſteal out pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately by a ſubterraneous paſſage, to a place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from the abbey, and there to waſte the hours
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:034525_0007_0FFE192FC6B29980"/>
in debauchery and rioting.<note n="*" place="bottom">That there were ſuch receſſes in many convents is now completely aſcertained.</note> But this was not all, Peter was a monſter capable of more enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous actions: in the heat of his intemperance, he had conceived a brutal paſſion for Elmira, and he ſcrupled not to accompliſh his purpoſe by the moſt villainous means.</p>
            <p>There was a dungeon in the receſſes of the rock on which the Monaſtery ſtood, and to which it was joined by a long and winding vault. This had in former times been a lurking retreat for its owners, the lords of that place, when in times of trouble they were driven to the laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort. Hither then, Peter determined to have her dragged, that he might the more eaſily attain his horrid ends. He imparted his intentions to Francis, a monk as abandoned as himſelf, and who had formerly aſſiſted him in many a black tranſaction. Little delay was neceſſary. The ſecond night after their plot was laid, they went ſoftly to Elmira's apartment, and tapped gently upon the door; Elmira was on her knes; croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing herſelf; ſhe ſtarted up, and demanded, who knocked? She was anſwered by a voice which cried in a low whiſper, "Siſter, art thou alone?" Thinking that it was a nun, come to require her attendance at the ſick bed of one of the ſiſterhood, ſhe haſtened to admit her when Francis ruſhed furiouſly in upon her. With one hand he ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pt her mouth, and with the other preſented a dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to her breaſt threatning to put her to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:034525_0008_0FFE1935538FDBB8"/>
death, if ſhe ſhould make the ſmalleſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbance; Elmira, terrified, ſunk ſenſeleſs to the ground.</p>
            <p>The inhuman fathers, inſtead of ſuccouring, took an advantage of her illneſs, and their firſt buſineſs was, to bind a ſcarf they had prepared, ſo hard round her face, as to prevent her calling but if ſhe ſhould recover, on ſeeing whither they were going to take her. They then carried her along ſeveral galleries, nor met with any oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, till they arrived at the ſecret door which led into the vault. Here they ſet her down till one of them ſhould open it. She had now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely recovered her ſenſes. She attempted re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, but reſiſtance was in vain. She uttered a ſaint ſhriek; but the binding confined the found, and its echo was hardly perceived along the vault through which they were now leading her. They at length came unto the iron gate of the dungeon; it was ſecured by a bolt, which was removed, and the unfortunate Elmira puſhed in. She then heard the gate creak upon its hinges, the bolt once more faſtened without; and a while after, the diſtant ſound of the key turning cautiouſly in the further door, died away upon her ear; and ſhe was left in all the agony of ſilent horror. The monks now haſtened to the completion of their infamous plot. They laid along upon the bed of her they had remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, a block of wood, which Francis <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ad prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and disfigured, ſo to repreſent a dead body; with her lamp, yet burning, they ſet fire to the hangings and bed-cloaths; this they extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:034525_0009_0FFE1936D8B122F0"/>
when it had half conſumed them; the lamp was ſet at a diſtant corner of the apartment, ſo as to caſt a glimmering light upon the objects in it, and every thing ſo artfully diſpoſed, as to give it the appearance as if Elmira had been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally ſcorched to death.</p>
            <p>Theſe matters being arranged, Francis ſpread the alarm. This he did by ſtating ſhortly—That as he and the abbot had been retiring to their chambers, they were ſtruck with the ſmell of fire;—that they had traced it to the chamber of El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mira;—that they had arrived too late to reſcue, but had by their exertions prevented the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> from ſpreading any further.</p>
            <p>They lady abbeſs and ſeveral of the ſiſters came forth to the apartment, but the thick ſmoke which yet hung round it, and the two monks re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining cloſe at the bed-ſide, prevented them from approaching near enough, or diſcovering the deception. "Hope is at an end," ſaid the wicked abbot, "her pulſe has ceaſed to beat, and her ſpirit has ſought the manſions of the bleſt. Let me entreat you all then to retire. All aid is now fruitleſs. On the morrow at noon let us all here re-aſſemble, and the bell ſhall then toll to the ſad ceremony of her interment. Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Francis and myſelf ſhall watch all the night, and put up our prayers for the ſaint that is gone. Once more then retire." Elmira had been beloved in the convent. Her melancholy end was bewailed by the ſiſterhood, and they all ſadly and ſlowly retired to their reſpective cells,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:034525_0010_0FFE19385E19EAD8"/>
with eyes that were ſtreaming in unfeigned tears. When all was quiet, Francis conveyed a coffin from his chamber, in which they laid the ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious body, and nailing it down, they ſlipt ſoftly out to the diſtant retreat ſet apart for their revel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. There they ſaw the morning hours come round in wine and merriment, with as little un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concern as if nothing unuſual had happened. At the appointed hour every inhabitant of the abbey aſſembled to the doleful buſineſs of the day. Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is reſpected, even by thoſe that are moſt loſt to it; and the early fate of the beautiful Elmira, melted alike the upright and the abandoned, and wrung ſympathy indiſcriminately from the pious and the profligate.</p>
            <p>After the prayers for the deceaſed were fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, the bier was raiſed from the ground on the ſhoulders of eight friars, and the proceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion began in ſlow ſolemnity. Firſt went ſix monks, each carrying a flambeaux in his hand; then the lady abbeſs, followed by her nuns, two and two, with black vails drawn over their faces; next moved the coffin, covered with a cloth; and the wicked Peter, attended by the other brothers came laſt of all. They marched in deep ſilence till they arrived at the chapel, when the organ ſwelled an anthem, which the nuns ſang as they went along; and for ſome time after the muſic had ſtopped, the ſound rolled along the arches above till it was loſt in repetition. They now reached the aiſle, where they depoſited the body; and after ſinging a requiem to the interred re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of Elmira, returned to the chapel, where
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:034525_0011_0FFE193CB40E6A80"/>
divine ſervice employed them the remainder of the day; ſervice in which the abbot and his accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice joined in all the ferver of apparent enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſm.</p>
            <p>The impriſoned Elmira had paſſed the hours in melancholy conjecture, and trembling anxiety, that ſome ſtill more dreadful calamity awaited her. She feared, from the manner in which this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ad befallen her, ſhe was at the mercy of two ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage fathers, who might harraſs, might ſtarve, might murder her. No help was nigh. She was far from the ſound of mortal ſtep. Her Bernard—. Fancy never carried her that way, but her ſtreaming eyes confeſſed what a wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed proſpect was before her. Thus was ſpent a night and day, which the impenetrable darkneſs prevented her from counting; and her gloomy ſolitude made her imagination lengthen. At mid-night, Peter, with a little water in a flag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon he had hung round his neck, and a ſcanty allowance of the coarſeſt bread, repaired to the dungeon. A lamp which he held in his hand diſcovered to Elmira the receſſes of her darkſome priſon. She could caſt her eyes along ſeveral rows of arches, built of thick ſtones, down which the damps trickled on the ſides. Beneath her feet was the cold and ſolid rock. Near the iron gate, which was the only entrance to it, was a little round aperture, croſſed with two bars of iron; this ſerved to tranſmit the little circulation of air which breathed along the vault. At the other ſide of this aperture ſhe perceived her hood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed perſecutor. The lamp caſt its pale rays upon
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:034525_0012_0FFE193E379C38A8"/>
his haggard countenance, and ſhowed his eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balls, which intemperance had reddened and ſunk in their ſockets, rolling in paſſion. Stretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out his withered hand, he ſet down the bread and water within the iron bars. Then, in a ſof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened tone, addreſſed the wretched Elmira.—"Thou wilt doubtleſs wonder, ſiſter, at the ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly cruel, and unaccountable manner in which thou haſt been conveyed hither. But lend an ear a few moments to my defence, and I truſt ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe will ſubſide into pity. Preamble then is needleſs. Fair Elmira, I love thee. Conſent to my wiſhes, and thou ſhalt be inſtantly removed to a place where pleaſure ſhall court thee in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry varied form.<note n="*" place="bottom">In theſe ages of ſacred profligacy, thoſe monks, in a ſociety who were devoted to licentiouſneſs, had concealed retreats at a diſtance from the monaſtery, whether they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorted, and gave themſelves up to every ſpecies of volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſneſs.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Till this time to-morrow thou ſhalt have to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect on it:—If, then, thou ſhalt prove obſtinate, and ſpurn me, wo be unto thee. Meantime be aſſured, that all hopes of eſcape are vain.—Thy dirge was this day chanted, by weeping virgins, and thy ſuppoſed body laid low in the ground. Let no falſe expectation then elate thee. Here is wherewithal to ſuſtain nature. This ſhall to-mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row be renewed to thee—Farewell!"</p>
            <p>Having ſaid theſe words, he retired, leaving Elmira in a ſtate of mind not to be deſcribed. Aſtoniſhment, fear, contempt, grief, and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:034525_0013_0FFE19427A42DB20"/>
poſſeſſed her by turns, or rather, tore her breaſt together; and the hours glided on, in an agony, that no one was nigh, to pity or to ſoften.</p>
            <p>The accounts of Elmira's death had now ſpread beyond the monaſtery, and at length reached the cottage of Bernard. He hurried in frenzy to the abbe, and found the mournful report was too true For a while at firſt, he raved in wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. "Barbarians," he wou'd cry, "where have ye taking her? Wherefore did I not get on—one look of her, before the cold ground receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her? Scorched and disfigured as ſhe was, her remains would, to me, have ſtill been lovely; her delicate features, though the prey of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring flames, to me,—to me, would have ſtill retained all their former ſymmetry."</p>
            <p>Theſe emotions were too violent to be laſting. They ſoon abated, into a ſilent, ſettled, melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly; and Bernard knew, that the only object was gone, that could give the world to ſmile upon him. Determined to forſake it, to live and die in that ſpot, where ſhe, in whom his every wiſh, his every hope, had centered, had lived, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before him. This deſign, he communicated to the monks; and next day, with the uſual <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emnities, he was admitted into their order.</p>
            <p>During the foregoing night, Peter had as uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, deſcended to the dungeon, with the food of Elmira. Setting it down, he called her by her name; he was anſwered by a deep fetched <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> was continued along the vault. "Haſt thou," ſaid he, "been pondering on my words? Beauteous Elmira, what anſwer ſhall I expect? ſpeak, I am all patience." "Peace wretch!" re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied Elmira, "nor add to my ſufferings by thy horrid importunities. To one ſo far ſunk in the abyſs of vice, to aim to drag the innocent beſide thee;—ſo abandoned to impiety, as to imagine all around thee, equally unprincipled with thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Integrity almoſt forbids reply—Begone, then, and diſquiet me no more. Away; I defy thy utmoſt malice."</p>
            <p>The virtue and dignity of Elmira ſtuck a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary awe into that breaſt, which had long, till that inſtant, been a ſtranger to every finer feeling Muttering curſes within himſelf, he ſlowly departed, nor preſumed the harſh reply, which at another time his corrupt heart would have gloried in.</p>
            <p>We muſt now ſuppoſe him, for ſeveral enſuing nights, ſtealing out with Elmira's ſuſtenance. She continued as inflexible as before, and Peter, though determined upon taking ſome ſtep, as yet heſitated what that ſtep ſhould be.</p>
            <p>It happened once, that walking acroſs her pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſhe treaded on ſomething hard, that was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached from the pavement. She took it up, and at night, when the abbot came, by the light of his lamp ſhe caſt her eyes with horror on a ſkull. This inflicted on her a deeper ſhock than any thing ſhe had yet undergone. But to ſpeak her fears could ſerve no purpoſe, and ſhe was accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:034525_0015_0FFE1946DDBD9238"/>
conſtraind to ſilence. This appearance will be explained in the ſequel.</p>
            <p>One night, when ſtillneſs reigned thro' all the convent, one of the monks, whoſe name was Henrique, ſoftly opened the latchet of Bernard's door, whoſe griefs kept him waking, "Bernard," ſaid he, advancing. "I have ſomewhat of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to communicate; but, if now you ſeek the pillow of repoſe, we will defer our conference to another occaſion." "Alas!" ſaid Bernard, "there is no repoſe for me. Sir, I beſeech you, ſit, and proceed: I am well-rivetted in attention." "Let us not, then, waſte our moments," anſwered Henrique, "firſt, then, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> abbot of this place is a fiend unfit for the ſociety of even the worſt of men. "Peter! nay ſtart not, the ſame;—I have reſided within theſe walls five long years, and I could rehearſe ſuch things as would freeze thy blood in ſilent horror—would ſwell thy breaſt in fierceſt indignation. The nightly rioting which thou muſt already have been invited to partake of, is the ſmalleſt of his offences. If thou wouldſt know to what extent his guile can ſtretch,—fly—fly this place. He and his accomplice, Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis, ſeek your life." "I will believe, and yet, alas! what cauſe have I given them—what is it ſhould tempt them to ſo wonton—ſo unprovoked an outrage?" "The anſwer to that is ſhort and eaſy," interrupted Henrique, "they have two motives to gain by your deſtruction. Firſt, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly diſpatching you, they will give out, that you have died a natural death. This they will do in the hope that your father, having no other heir, will, in a miſtaken devotion, bequeathe his
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:034525_0016_0FFE194C5E700DA0"/>
lands to that monaſtery which contains the body of his ſon. In the ſecond place, given altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to licentiouſneſs themſelves, can you not ſee how neceſſary it is for them to be rid of one, who may detect, and at length diſcloſe their ways. I would not have eſcaped ſo long, did I not ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſeem to give into their intemperance, that I might one day have an opportunity of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them fully to light. That opportunity has now arrived; I have heard of thy virtues Bernard, before thou didſt relinquiſh that world, they once did honour to; and ſince I ſaw thee, I have marked them, and ſatisfied myſelf. Thou art, as yet, untainted with the manners of this place, thou art, as yet, a man whom I can truſt. Say then, wilt thou aſſiſt me in a project I have form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by which an innnocent perſon may be reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from diſtreſs, and juſtice overtake the hooded hypocrite" "Go on, go on, Henrique," cried Bernard eagerly,—"ſecretly diſpatching, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> natural death! Oh! my friend, theſe words have ſtruck deep into my ſoul, Elmira, Elmira, thus have they done with thee:—Oh! cruel that they were. Could not thy purity, thy cherub in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, plead for a little mercy at their relent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs hands?</p>
            <p>"Henrique," ſaid he, a little more compoſed, <q>forgive theſe tranſports of diſpair.</q>
            </p>
            <p>"I am more intereſted than thou conceiveſt in thy narrative; haſten then, haſten to the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it. By every ſacred tie that theſe mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:034525_0017_0FFE194DE3C424A8"/>
have violated, I ſwear there is not a peril I will not encounter, to ſift the records of this ſcene of bloodſhed to the bottom."</p>
            <p>"There are here then," reſumed Henrique, "ſome diſtant concealed places, which we muſt firſt diſcover. My apartment is in the fartheſt end of ſeveral galleries, and in a remote part of the convent. At different times, ſince I firſt came hither, I have heard low noiſes at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, like the locking of doors. I never could diſcover what they meant exactly, or the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe part whence they proceeded. I once hinted it in preſence of Peter, whoſe countenance was inſtantaneouſly and viſibly altered, to a livid paleneſs. He in vain endeavored to conceal his emotion from me. I did not, however, then ſeem to notice it, nor broached the ſubject a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, leſt I ſhould give him cauſe to perceive my ſuſpicions, when a further and a ſtricter conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on his part, might prevent detection upon mine. Some little time ago, in the middle of the night, I heard a diſtant noiſe of two perſons ſtruggling, from one of them I diſtinctly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a faint ſcream, and preſently the locking of the door I had formerly obſerved."</p>
            <p>"Ah!" exclaimed Bernard, "it is too true. It was, it was Elmira."</p>
            <p>"There is a woman here in diſtreſs," reſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Henrique, "I am ſure of it, and now is the time to reſcue her. Through a chink, I yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day remarked the abbot and his partner in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt

converſation. It was then I marked, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other broken ſentences, theſe words: "What ſhall we do with her," cried one. "Let her ſtarve," replied the other. "Ha! ſayeſt thou," cried Bernard in extreme agitation, while a thouſand thoughts fluſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croſs his brain; "what then is to be done?" "Put off your ſhoes," ſaid Henrique, "give me that lamp, and follow me." They now went without the ſmalleſt noiſe to the cell of Henrique.</p>
            <p>Henrique and Bernard were going to proceed in their ſearch, when the former quickly extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed the lamp, and laying hold on Bernard's arm, "Stand," ſaid he ſoftly, "I hear a noiſe." A light ſtruck <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>croſs the gallery, and in a little time after, they ſew Peter glide before the cell without obſerving them. In a few minutes they heard a door opened. Henrique inſtantly ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured out, and went as ſwiftly as caution would allow him, to the place whence he gueſſed the noiſe came. He applied his ear cloſe to the wall. He heard the ſound of footſteps, which reverbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated along the vault. He called on Bernard, who joined him. "Remain here," ſaid he, "till I go and follow him."</p>
            <p>He groped for the door, which he found at length half open. He went forward along ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral paſſages, and down three or four flight of ſtairs, till he at laſt came to a turn of the vault, where he perceived the beam of rays from Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's light; he judged it prudent to go no farther.
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:034525_0019_0FFE19524ADA3A90"/>
He awaited the breaking of the ſilence, with a beating heart. At length he heard the abbot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with theſe words: "Moſt wayward of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſtill to reject thy happineſs; but it is well, and thou haſt rouſed my vengeance,—prepare thyſelf. Three days longer thou ſhalt have to deliberate. If thy reſolve be ſtill the ſame, the next morning, Elmira, thou ſhalt die."</p>
            <p>Henrique had now learned enough. He hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried back to his friend. They reſought the cell of the former. There they remained till the abbot returned, locked the door of the vault, and meaſured back his ſteps till they were loſt in ſilence. Henrique now repeated to Bernard the words he had heard. Bernard inſiſted upon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly awaking the monks; but was prevailed by the other to reſtrain his motions, and reflect how ſtrong a party they had to contend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt.</p>
            <p>"Here," added he, "I have procured ſome cords; tying theſe together, we can let ourſelves down from the window, and truſt to Providence to guide us ſafely down the rocks. We may, then, eaſily procure horſes, and be to-morrow early at the caſtle of the Count your father. There we will ſpeedily aſſemble as many vaſſals as will ſerve our purpoſe, and the juſtice of our cauſe ſhall give us ſtrength to force our march back to the monaſtery, ere the time expire for Elmira's deſtruction." The propoſal inſpired with ardour, they ſet about the execution of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

The full moon ſhone forth in all her ſplendor, not a breath of wind glided along the ſtillneſs of the waters, and the moon-beams ſporting on their boſom, diſplayed all nature arrayed in ſable ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty. After a little ſearch, they ſound a deſcent ſloped more gradually than the others, this they attempted, and aſſiſting each other, arrived at length upon the ſhore. Bernard caſt a wiſhful look on the Abbey. A ſudden chillneſs ran through him. Something whiſpered within his breaſt that he ſhould ſee Elmira no more; but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn was now impoſſible. They, therefore, bent their way to the cottage where Bernard uſed to reſide. Having awaked the faithful peaſant who was the owner of it, they were furniſhed by him with horſes. They made him promiſe to have the neighborhood aſſembled on the ſecond night, that they all might join in their cauſe, for theſe were attached to Benard while he dwelt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, and their honeſt hearts would prompt them to ſhew their gratitude, by riſquing their lives for him.</p>
            <p>After a little refreſhment, which the cottager brought out to them, and being provided by him with money, they ſet out full ſpeed; they had to travel the whole breadth of Catalonia. They ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to meet freſh horſes in the way, which they did not deſpair of, as the Saracens had left in every part of Spain their breed of Arabian courſers, which were the fineſt in the world. They flew then ſwiftly along a beautiful valley at the foot of the Pyrenees, where nature had
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:034525_0021_0FFE195955BB9D28"/>
laviſhed her bounties on the plain. The ſtill moon rode above, and pointed out their way with her ſilver lamp.</p>
            <p>The beaſts of the field, the fowls of the air, the very elements were huſhed in repoſe. No ſound was heard but the clattering of their horſes hoofs.</p>
            <p>The poor animals had now exhauſted their laſt remains of ſtrength. Bernard, who knew every bit of the road, ſeeing a light at a little diſtance from it, ſaid, it came from the caſtle of a friend of his, and diſmounting, went quickly on, requeſting Henrique to follow with the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. Bernard rouzed a ſervant, who knowing him, inſtantly procured him the beſt horſes in the ſtable. Henrique did not make his appearance, but the time was too precious to be ſpent in ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him. Bernard ſet out alone, charging the ſervant that if his friend ſhould arrive, his maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhould receive him. He now proceeded with incredible velocity, being better mounted than before.</p>
            <p>The purple ſtreaks along the heavens proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the break of day. The miſts were gradually diſperſing. The birds began to chirp their greet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the opening dawn, and at length the ſun burſt from the horizon behind him, and poured a ſtream of glory on the world. Laſt of all, the peaſants came forth to their daily toil, and began to lead their cattle to the brook. Bernard in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of one of them, how far it was to the caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:034525_0022_0FFE195AE1E2F510"/>
of Arragon, and found he had as yet but a little more than half completed his journey. He exchanged horſes with the peaſants as he went along, making up to them with money the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion, where there was any, and he at length arrived two hours before noon at his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's houſe, which ſtood upon the eaſtern fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers of the province.</p>
            <p>He briefly told his errand to the Count, who gave inſtant orders, that an hundred horſe ſhould aſſemble in the court with all precipitation. Meanwhile, Bernard was prevailed on to retire to reſt.</p>
            <p>He threw himſelf on a couch, but the agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he laboured under made ſleep a ſtranger to his eyelids. He ſtarted up, and with a hurried ſtep walked up and down the room, often look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out if the horſes were arrived. At length, worn out with the exceſſive laſſitude his long journey had occaſioned, he ſunk to the ground, and was viſited by a deep ſlumber. But even there, his buſy imagination refuſed to be a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> peace; it preſently carried him to the priſon-houſe of Elmira; he ſaw the malignant arm of Peter raiſed, graſping a knife to point it at her breaſt. In ruſhing between them in a fit of deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration, the fancied effort awoke him. He went once more to the window, and ſaw with pleaſure that all was ready. He flew down to the court, bade an affectionate adieu to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and mounted his proud courſer, which ſtood rearing his head on high, and impatient to be gone. He let looſe the reigns and led the way.</p>

An hundred fiery ſteeds, ſnorting in the height of blood, bounded together from their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines, and ruſhed impetuous o'er the plain.—Their angry hoofs diſdain the ground they paw; and, rapid as the whirlwind's progreſs, they quickly vaniſhed from the ſtraining ſight. They purſued their road, till the ſhade of night deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending, and the exhauſted ſpirits of their horſes, warned them to ſeek ſome place of ſhelter. This they found in the caſtle where Bernard had the former night obtained the relief he wanted, but loſt the partner of his way. Here they remained for the night, but could get no intelligence of Henrique. Conjecture was fruitleſs, and ſearch was delay. In the morning then, early refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with new vigour, they reſumed their route, nor halted till they arrived within ſight of St. Mark's. Here they were joined by the peaſants collected by the faithful cottager, who gave them the following information:—That the Abbot, fearing, as they ſuppoſed, the deſign of the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitives, had obtained, from a tow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> at a little diſtance, an armed force to defend his cauſe. That this he had repreſented as a juſt one, that the troops had entered the abbey the foregoing day, and that in appearance, their numbers were ſuperior to thoſe of Bernard.</p>
            <p>This ſtatement was a true one, and Peter ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving, from the walls of the convent, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative fewneſs of his adverſaries, and conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that, after ſo long a march, he might now take advantage of their being feeble and fati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued, judged that he would be the moſt politic

ſtep, to ſend out his freſh troops immediately up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, in order to cut them off before they gathered new ſtrength either in men or in ſpirits. This he did accordingly, and the gates being thrown open, Bernard perceived, with anxiety, a long train of diſciplined forces, march out, and advancing towards him. He was now however forced into an engagement. Drawing up his men therefore on the advantageous ſtation, he firſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed them in a ſhort ſpeech; he ſtated ſhortly the juſtice of their cauſe, from which they might rely on having on their ſide the avenging hand of Heaven, which they could truſt would exert itſelf to the deſtruction of impiety. His little line was formed by ſetting the peaſants in the middle, with fifty of his own horſemen on each ſide. He thought by this ſtratagem, that if the enemy ſhould fall upon the weakeſt part, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers might incloſe, and thus gain the advantage over them.</p>
            <p>After giving them directions ſo to do, he took his poſt at the right end, and they all waited the coming up of their opponents in a ſilent expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Theſe at laſt arrived, and the onſet began. Both parties ran furiouſly on each other, ſwords claſhing on ſwords, clouds of duſt ariſing up on high, the hiſſing of javelins, the impetuous plunging of horſes whoſe eye-balls were red with fury, and who daſhed out beneath their feet the brains of fallen heroes; clamours of exultation, mingled with the groans of expiring wretches, preſented a ſcene of ruin and of horror.</p>

Bernard was wading in blood through the thickeſt of the fight. Love and vengeance arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with Herculean ſtrength, and he ſpread terror and deſtruction wherever he went. At firſt, the troops of Peter aſtoniſhed, yielded to the fiercneſs of the attack; rallying, however, the overpowered him with their numbers, fell on his men, now weary and worn out, and obliged them to retire in every direction. They were now reduced to the laſt extremity, and in a ſhort time would have all inevitably periſhed, had not the attention of both parties been arreſted by a troop of horſemen who were advancing rapidly towards them. The arm of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>aughter was ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended for a moment, and they ſtood both anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly awaiting the iſſue. Theſe galloped into the middle between the two contending bands, and after looking earneſtly firſt on the one, and then on the other, they fell with violence on the troops of Peter, whom they routed with a great carnage, and were left entire maſters of the field.</p>
            <p>Bernard and their leader now ran into each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's arms. It was Henrique. Having loſt his way on the night that Bernard left him, he wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered onward unknowing where he was till the morning, when he was directed to the very town whence the troops were obtained for the defence of St. Mark. This was a conſiderable way off, and he arrived in it but a few hours af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the troops had ſet out for the monaſtery. He <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

of men from a neighbouring garriſon were called in. Theſe he headed, and with theſe it was he reſcued the ſinking ſoldiers of his friend. They now found that their loſs had been inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, and they entered the monaſtery with a ſhout of victory.</p>
            <p>A ſhout of victory! Ah! little thought they how ſoon it ſhould be changed into woe unparal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leled, and wretchedneſs irremediable.</p>
            <p>We muſt now relate what happened to Elmira, after the departure of Bernard and Henrique. Peter and Francis finding, or at leaſt fearing they were diſcovered reſolved to viſit Elmira no more, but to leave her to ſtarve where ſhe was already confined. The damps of the cavern had fallen on her tender limbs unuſed to hardſhip; a chillneſs ran thro' her veins, and ſhe felt that her latter end was approaching; her ſcanty proviſion was gone, and the hard-hearted Peter had never renewed it. Overwhelmed with ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and hunger, and deſpair, ſhe fell upon the flinty pavement, ſhe put up a prayer for forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to her perſecutors, for bleſſings on her Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard, then ſtretching her body at full length, a miſt gathered upon her heavy eyes, ſhe heaved a deep ſigh, and all the reſt was oblivion.</p>
            <p>Bernard, as ſoon as he entered the monaſtery, ordered the abbot and his partner to be ſecured and put in chains. He then took a key from the breaſt of the former, which opened to the entrace of the dungeon, and ſeazing a taper he had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to be brought, he ruſhed to the relief of
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:034525_0027_0FFE19694C253508"/>
Elmira. Before he unbarred the iron gate, he called on her by name; a cold ſhivering ſeized on every joint: with a tremulous voice he called again; but not the ſmalleſt ſtir was heard within, ſave the mournful echo of his own-words. He burſt open the gate, and entering, beheld Elmira on the bare ground, pale and lifeleſs. In agony he ſunk beſide her, and lay ſenſeleſs for ſome moments; then ſtarting up, he flew to the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment where the two monks were guarded, He upbraided them in the language of diſtraction. Monſters, murderers, was it not enough to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray, to perſecute, to murder, helpleſs innocence; but your callous breaſts could ſee her pine in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined miſery. But let me not waſte the time in words, which is the due of vengeance and of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice; drag them inſtantly, my ſoldiers, hence; away with them, and follow me.</p>
            <p>Bernard, now, and one half of his followers, proceeded to the capital town of the province, leading Peter and Francis bound in chains, amid the hootings and execrations of a concourſe of people. Its judges were in court. They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded an immediate trial. The dark annals of the monaſtery in many a former year were reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Multitudes of witneſſes appeared, not only from thence, but alſo from the adjacent county, who, with many empty coffins, brought from the aiſle of the chapel, bloody inſtruments of death from the cell of Francis, and ſculls and other bones from the dungeon, all conſpired to accuſe and to convict them. The guilt was evident, and they were condemned to die on the morrow.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:034525_0028_0FFE196ED3A39680"/>
Bernard paſſed a ſleepleſs, joyleſs night; at ſome moments he would ſtart up, ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>e wildly round him, and rave in all the madneſs of deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair. At others he would lay down his head in ſpeechleſs anguiſh, and after <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> his eyes long on one ſpot, burſt into a flood of tears. The buſtle which had lately buoyed up his ſpirits, had ſubſided in melancholy; and he now had nothing left but death to wiſh for.</p>
            <p>Next day, many thouſands were collected to behold the execution of Peter and Francis. The ſcaffold on which they were to ſuffer was hung with black, and erected on a plain behind the town. Thither the train proceeded. Before, marched a troop of the ſoldiers of the place, to ſlow martial muſic, trailing their ſpears along the ground. The coffins of the monks followed, mounted on carriages, and drawn by horſes. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of the prieſts of the town came next, in their pontifical robes. Then the Abbot and Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis guarded by ſoldiers, with their hands tied behind them, their feet bare, and labels on their backs declaring their crimes; they were follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by men carrying ſculls and daggers from the abbey. Chief magiſtrates and officers of the town were next in order, and Bernard, at the head of his horſemen, brought up the rear.</p>
            <p>The monks, hardened in iniquity, had deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to brave their fate to the laſt. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, that as Elmira was now no more, little inquiry would be made concerning the manner of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:034525_0029_0FFE1970596480E8"/>
the death; they therefore denied this, and every other accuſation againſt them, as a conſpiracy to effect their ruin. They perſiſted in the aſſertion that Elmira had been burnt to death, and prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to meet their fate with this lie upon their lips.</p>
            <p>Bernard, whoſe head had hung all the while in deſponding anguiſh, raiſed it in won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that ſuch depravity exiſted upon earth. At that moment Henrique appeared on the ſcaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, leading in an object which attracted every eye: "'Tis ſhe, 'tis ſhe herſelf," exclaimed the tranſported Bernard, and claſped the living Elmira to his heart. The effort was too much; he fell back in an exceſs of joy in the arms of Henrique. The violence of his paſſion ſoon aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and recovering, he led his charming bride from the ſcene of execution.</p>
            <p>Henrique had carried her from the cavern gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his arms, and laid her on a bed, where he diſcovered ſome ſigns of returning breath; theſe, with care, he foſtered, and gradually reſtored her to life and joy. Anxiety to meet her Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard gave her ſtrength, and feeble as ſhe was, ſhe ventured forth to join him.</p>
            <p>Shame now overwhelmed the abbot and the companion of his infamy. Seeing themſelves de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected, they confeſſed every thing, and diſcloſed a catalogue of enormities they had been guilty of too long, and too ſhocking to ſuffer relation. Elmira had prevailed with Bernard to intreat a remiſſion at leaſt an alleviation of their ſentence;
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:034525_0030_0FFE1971DFA09E60"/>
but their offences were now too general, and too glaring to be forgiven; their gloomy ſouls did not dare to raiſe a thought to heaven; they laid their heads upon the block amid the curſes of the populace, and they died impeninent and unpitied. They found in their laſt moments, that no hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy, however artful, can long conceal a wicked heart; and that the perpetrators of guilt are, in the days of their utmoſt affluence, deſpiſed, and in thoſe of their utmoſt need, deſerted by all, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by their accomplices.</p>
            <p>Bernard now prepared to ſet out with Elmira for the caſtle of his father. He beſeeched his friend to accompany him; but this Henrique de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined, aſſuring him, that he ſhould be ever near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to his heart, but that it was long ſince he had learned to mortify, within his breaſt, all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of taſting the pleaſures of this ſcene of uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty; that his only wiſh was now to retire to ſome ſequeſtered ſpot, where he might dedicate the remainder of his days to heavenly contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Bernard accordingly obtained for him that place which the impious Peter had diſgraced, and he was accordingly elected to the abbacy of St. Mark.</p>
            <p>The nuptials of the happy lovers were now ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnized with every mark of joy. Henrique ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the knot that united them forever; and after taking an affectionate farewell of him, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by eaſy journeys to Arragon. There they were received with tenderneſs by their common father, and there they dwelt in uninterrupted
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:034525_0031_0FFE1976321C4EE0"/>
peace for many years, happy in the affections of all their vaſſals, and bleſt with a numerous off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring.</p>
            <p>Henrique repaired to take poſſeſſion of his new office. He effected a thorough reformation in St. Mark, and under his government the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent long retained a reputation for the purity of its morals, and the ſanctity of its inhabitants.</p>
            <p>At the deſire of Bernard, he had this narrative written over its gates, with the following inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in letters of gold:—<q>HAPPINESS IS EVER IN STORE FOR INNOCENCE AND INTEGRITY; ITS ARRIVAL MAY BE LATE, BUT IT IS CER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TAIN.</q>

            <head>THE HEIRESS OF DEVON.</head>
            <p>EDGAR, the Sovereign of England, was brave, generous, and humane; but nature, as if to prevent the portrait from being too per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, flung into his compoſition pride, rancour and revenge.</p>
            <p>Thoſe paſſions which in their bloſſom might by ſelf-exertions, the admonitions of the worthy, or the prevalence of a good education, have been checked, were now by neglect ſprung to a bane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful luxuriance, and caſt a dark ſhade around him.</p>
            <p>While the wiſe ſaw from many acts of his vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues what might have been expected from him; they alſo beheld from the oppoſite extremes of his character the ſad infirmities of human nature. Humbled by the conviction, the arrogance of ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boaſted ſtrength was vaniſhed, and proſtrate with pious awe they caſt the beſeeching eye to that power whoſe hand could alone wipe away the ſtig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma of error, and who with benignant mercy
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:034525_0033_0FFE197BE837A398"/>
could alone uphold the ſinking heart, and ſave it from the contamination of illicit purſuits.</p>
            <p>Virtue and vice thus blended in his diſpoſition, and each bounding each, prevented his being beloved or diſpiſed. The latent influence of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue caſt a varniſh over the enormities of vice; he was therefore obeyed, but it was without reſpect; accuſed, but without malice.</p>
            <p>Miſguided by a ſuperſtitious and enthuſiaſtic ſet, who tarniſhed the religion they profeſſed, he appeared as an implement in their hands to execute the moſt flagrant exceſſes.</p>
            <p>To be the ſcourge of iniquity, the rewarder of virtue, the guardian of his people, the patron of every polite and beneficent art, had no charms for Edgar.</p>
            <p>Reflection never ſtepped in to bear him up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the tide of corruption; his hands never wreathed the laurel to twine around the brow of ſteady rectitude; he ſeduced innocence from its path, and ſtung the ſoul of gentleneſs with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidy and woe.</p>
            <p>Edgar's every feature marked the impetuoſity of his paſſions; his eyes darted forth the fire of youth; his hardy cheek was crimſoned with the glow of conſcious majeſty; his perſon was ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant, ſtriking, and inſinuating; his air was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to announce his rank, he moved as if words were at his command, and ſpoke as if they
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:034525_0034_0FFE197EC2A4A2C0"/>
were to pay him homage; the refinement of lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury, the duplicity of an hypocrite, and the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtry of a courtier, rendered him ſkillful in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſpecious wile; he was, in ſhort, in his form, exquiſitely lovely, and in thoſe hours when deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to pleaſe, his manners were irreſiſtable.</p>
            <p>Had he united to thoſe accompliſhments the wiſh of doing right, he would have been adored. The brave intrepid generous nature of Britons would have paid him that heart-felt homage which power can never exact; from the bright promiſe of his youth they would have anticipated the maturity of years, and beheld him gliding down the vale of time encircled with honour, veneration and gratitude.</p>
            <p>The latitude he gave to the vices of the monks was returned by their extenuating his, and while he commited acts marked by the names of profli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacy and ſacrilege, declared him worthy to be enrolled amongſt the martyrs celebrated with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown, and to be canonized as a ſaint.</p>
            <p>The innocent and the coquette were alternate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his prey; beauty for him never ſpread her net in vain, and the court was a ſcene of depravity.</p>
            <p>The moſt diſtinguiſhed of his male favourites was Ethelwald, a noble Baron, now in the meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian of his manhood. Nature ſeemed to have formed him in her faireſt mould. He had happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſcaped the total corroſion of vice; but miſled by cuſtom, and bribed by ſelf-intreſt, he often
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:034525_0035_0FFE1981A10F70A0"/>
joined in the revels of the night, and mixed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the bachanalian crew of Edgar, flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe exceſſes which he ſecretly beheld with deteſtation.</p>
            <p>He appeared equally formed to ornament a court, to command with ardour and ſuccſs in the battle, or join with fleetneſs in the rapid chace; his manners were cultivated to refinement; his ſoul had that intrepidity which led him into dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, yet there was that gentleneſs in his diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition which rendered him ſedulous to diffuſe peace and benevolence on all within his reach.</p>
            <p>His nerves were ſtrung with elaſticity, the fire of his eyes was tempered by lambent beams of gentleneſs, his ſun-burned cheek was tinged with the peach's bloom, and like his royal maſter he was ever ſucceſsful in the field of love.</p>
            <p>But the beauties of the court now no longer pleaſed them, for at this period love ſwelled the wings of fame, and waſted to the ears of Edgar the charms and accompliſhments of the Earl of Devon's daughter, the lovely Elfrida.</p>
            <p>She was unknown to the ſons of riot and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of diſſipation; beneath her father's roof ſhe attainad the utmoſt elegance, and bloomed and flouriſhed encompaſſed within his woods.</p>
            <p>Edgar prone to variety, fickle as the winds, and ever eager in purſuit of pleaſure, panted to behold this fair being, and perſonally know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:034525_0036_0FFE1985D6736FC0"/>
ſhe merited thoſe encomiums, bordering on extravagance, which were laviſhed on her.</p>
            <p>He no longer revelled in delight, his ear re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the loud uproar of mirth with diſguſt, the banquet was unreliſhed by him. After indulging his thoughts a few days, he diſmiſſed the crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded levee, and taking Elthelwald with him, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired to his cloſet where he unboſomed his ſoul:—"I burn, I die," ſaid he, "to behold the fair Elfrida, I am a ſtranger to reſt, my ſoul is occupied with undeſcribable emotions, imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſelecting all the lovelineſs of the ſpecies, centers it in one object, and preſents it continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to my views as if to tantalize my wiſhes. Even in my ſlumbers ſo much is my mind obſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed with the idea of her cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

            <p>Ethelwald's heart beat high at the confidence repoſed in him by the King; he immediately pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:034525_0037_0FFE19875C345E10"/>
for his excurſion, and the next morning was deſtined for it.</p>
            <p>Ere morning had unlocked the gates of light, Ethelwald, with a few choſen domeſtics, private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly left the court.</p>
            <p>They travelled with ſuch expedition, that the ſecond day the awful woods of Devon appeared in view; its lofty turrets, with its towering and ivy-covered ſpires, from rich amphitheatres of woods, the caſtle roſe in conſpicuous majeſty; the ſublimity of ancient grandeur, and the elegance of a more refined architecture, were diſplayed in it; the dark foliage of the trees was contraſted by the light green of paſtures and ſhrubberies, amongſt which were ſcattered ſhade grottos, and arborous receſſes; rivers here wantoned in divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſious meanders; here ſtreams ruſhed down the ſcraggy ſides of mountains, their impetuous fall came with hoarſe murmurs to the ear, while cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer by degrees they flowed in tranquil currents along the woody vale.</p>
            <p>Ethelwald made his domeſtics ſtop near the Abbey of—, where they were to find ſhelter for the night, while he proceeded on his embaſſy with one faithful ſervant.</p>
            <p>The ſky was now ſhaded by the clouds of even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing—the birds were warbling their cloſing lays—the peaſant whiſtled o'er the way to his peaceful cottage—the flocks faintly lowed as they repoſed under various ſhades—the foreſts ruſtled to the

breeze—the air, tempered into coolneſs, gave to the ſenſes delight and energy—the glow-worm lights its little lamp, as if vainly wiſhing to emulate the ſtars which glittered in the firmament—from innumerable brakes appeared the faint taper of the peaſant, while eminently conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous was ſeen the caſtle blazoning an artificial day.</p>
            <p>But every buſy ſound that fluctuated on the gale ſoon died away, and Ethelwald, in paſſing through a glin, found the caſtle and the cots hid from his view by the obſcurity of woods. Not a noiſe diſturbed the profound ſilence, ſave one ſolemn knell from a neighbouring abbey, calling the monks to the oriſons; it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>He ſtopped the career of his courſer, the reins wore gentley ſlacked, and ſudden awfulneſs took poſſeſſion of his ſoul; he gazed, admired, and meditated on the ſcene.</p>
            <p>Raiſing his eyes he at length exclaimed: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>And ſhall I, ſaid Ethelwald, bluſhing as he aſked his heart the queſtion, ſhall I (ſenſible of the truth of what I have ſaid) be again ſeduced to the vortex of a court—ſhall I.</p>

            <p>The gates were inſtantly flung open; the mien, the habit of Earthwald announced him of a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble rank, and the ſervants conducted him to a magnificent hall gilded with varied lamps, where at a ſplendid banquet the family were aſſembled.</p>

               <pb n="37" facs="unknown:034525_0040_0FFE199151F67708"/>
The Earl of Devon had now attained the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the vale of years, but it was that green old-age which nature beſtows on the children of temperance; like the hardy ever-green he bloom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the winter of his day, health preſerved her glow upon his cheek, his limbs retained their elaſticity, and his eyes beamed with the luſtre which expreſſed the feelings of his ſoul. His noble dame, to all the ſoftneſs of the matron united the dignity of illuſtrious deſcent, and the complacency of benevolence.</p>
            <p>Ethelwald apologiſed for his intruſion. The Earl interrupted him: Welcome cried he, to our hoſpitable, roof, and thrice welcome the chance which conducted you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> it.</p>
            <p>The baron was placed in a chair near Lady Devon, who ſmiled with the benignancy of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liteneſs and hoſpitality upon him.</p>
            <p>The heart of Ethelwald panted as he raiſed his eyes to look for Elfrida.</p>
            <p>Three young ladies were ſitting at the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> but all ſo equally and ſo exquiſitely lovely, that Ethelwald was ſtruck with aſtoniſhment. Which e'er ſhe is, thought he, why has fame, in boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of her charms, been ſilent in the praiſes of thoſe ſo equally lovely. Should diſcord again fling forth her golden apple, like the boy Paris, I ſhould be at a loſs to determine.</p>

Harmony, preſiding at the repaſt, encreaſed its pleaſures, and diffuſed ſocial and ſweet content around. The Earl and his noble Lady inſiſted on retiring early, from conſideration of their gueſt whoſe fatigued frame required the refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of balſamic ſleep. He <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>as conducted to a magnificent apartment, and after diſmiſſing the attendants, his fancy began to ruminate on all he had beheld.</p>
            <p>He could not poſſibly imagine which was Elfri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, or who thoſe young ladies were. Such matchleſs perfection, exclaimed he, reigns amongſt them all, that even the caprice of taſte cannot fix on one as the moſt intereſting object.

               <pb n="39" facs="unknown:034525_0042_0FFE19945EE3B700"/>
The Baron early awoke, and aroſe. Aurora now looked down benign on the children of this world, and ſhed her ſweeteſt influence upon it at once to regale every ſenſe.</p>
            <p>Ethelwald from his window viewed an exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and beautiful demenſe, and longing to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the ſweets of morning, he opened a little door in his chamber which led him into a cloſet, that by another door, with a gentle deſcent of ſteps, conducted him into a ſhaded and ſloping avenue.</p>
            <p>The flowers glowing in the prime of beauty diffuſed their choiceſt odours, the birds, flitting form bough to bough, ſwelled their little throats with reſponſible warblings; while at periods he diſtinguiſhed the rude yet harmleſs whiſtle of the peaſants: perceiving through many brakes and opening, in a ſurrounding grove ſome of them driving their lowing flocks to paſture, or others tilling that earth from which they were to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port a fond and helpleſs blooming progeny.</p>
            <p>Ethelwald walked on, for all was new and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanting to him; art, that wretched imitator of what is perfect, had long caſt his miſts before his ſenſes, the deluſions were now vaniſhing, and he worſhiped Nature the hand-maid of the creation.</p>
            <p>Say ye, gay ſcenes, he cried, where have ye been ſo long bid, or why was I ſo long abſorbed in the vortex of diſſipation as to be inſenſible to your pleaſures.—Hail, ſcenes, that at once give
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:034525_0043_0FFE19974FFB00E0"/>
delight and energy to the ſoul; every gale is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing, every ſpot ſtrikes with beauty, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very bough is alive with the melody of nature. As he ſpoke, he found himſelf at the termination of the avenue, in a valley encompaſſed with woods of an awful and majeſtic appearance. This he immediately concluded was the peculiar ſpot the Earl and his family choſe for the ſcenes of recreation, as pavillions were ſcattered around, intermixed with arbours of ſweet and cluſtering ſhrubs. A clear river glided along with gentle murmuring, which would ſooth a romantic or melancholy dipoſition; but an object the Baron now perceived at once excited ſurprize and rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.—A young female was dancing to the ſoft ſound of a flute on which a boy played, whoſe lovelineſs rendered him a proper attendant for her.</p>
            <p>She realized all thoſe ideas of beauty which Ethelwald had before painted to his imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; the charms he beheld laſt night with tranſport were now faded or only diſcerned in the back ſhade. Her robes were of white and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ure; and their light drapery did not diſguiſe a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> moulded with the ſofteſt ſymmetry; the lily and the roſe freſh culled (dew yet glittering on their balmy boſoms) formed an ornament for her waving treſſes, as ſhe often, with the ſportive gaiety which generally reſults from innocence, bent over the reflecting ſurface of the water, it gave her back her own image with all that earth or heaven could beſtow to make her amiable. Tell me, ſaid Ethelwald, ſtarting forward with the involuntary impetuoſity of ſurprize, are you hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:034525_0044_0FFE199CD397E650"/>
or divine; are you a young ſhepherdeſs who ſings blithſome at return of day, or as I am more inclined to believe the genii of thoſe woods.—She fixed her blue eyes on him for a few moments with leſs aſtoniſhment, than archneſs.—Stranger, ſaid ſhe, if you ſuppoſe me a ſhepherdeſs, why was I diſturbed, or if a genii do you not dread my reſentment for your intruſion? As ſhe ſpoke ſhe looked towards a pavillion; Ethelwald let fall the hand he had ſnatched, and beheld with wonder (proceeding from their unexpected ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance) Lord and Lady Devon followed by a numerous, retinue approaching.—</p>
            <p>They greeted him with cordiality. We did not ſuppoſe you were ſo early a riſer, Baron, ſaid Lord Devon, accuſtomed as you have been to ſcenes far different, we purpoſed however ſoon ſending for you to enjoy with us the freſhneſs of the morning; let me introduce to you another branch of my family—Elfrida. Elfrida! cried the Baron, retreating a few ſteps, and is it her—his heart ſmote againſt his boſom—for a moment the flutterer ceaſed to throb—oh! Edgar, Edgar, he ſilently exclaimed, why, why was thy Ethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wald ſent on ſuch an embaſſy. Lead on Lady Devon, ſaid the Earl; ſhe preſented her hand to the Baron, and they repaired to the pavillion where breakfaſt with an elegant ſumptuouſneſs was ſpread, while the artleſs ſounds of pipes and tabors ſtole from behind.</p>
            <p>Here, ſaid the Earl, my family and I enjoy the cool, the ſilent, and the fragrant hour; here
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:034525_0045_0FFE199E59223828"/>
we offer up prayers to that Power who diſpenſes thoſe gifts around us—When I view you bright refulgent orb of day, methinks it calls upon the ſons of affluence to contribute with benevolence to the happineſs of others; and ſweet, ſurpaſſing ſweet, is that office above all others, gladſome to the heart that hour which with bliſsful conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs it can ſay I have aided to the felicity of one of humankind.—I have long, Baron, retir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this ſeat of my anceſtors, for ſerene tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity is required for thoſe powers which in the morning of life have been buſily employed—El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frida is my only daughter, and thoſe three young Ladies kinſwomen to Lady Devon.</p>
            <p>Oh, happy ſociety, cried Ethelwald, where every moment is worthy of being recorded on an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals that ſhall never be eraſed; where virtue in her moſt celeſtial from (here his eyes involuntary turned to Elfrida) appears in view.</p>
            <p>From the pavillion they roamed through the contiguous part of the demeſne; all was contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to diverſify the proſpect, the rudeneſs of one ſpot ſetting off the elegant cultivation of another, and an air of ſimplicity preſiding over the whole, rendered it fit for the peculiar reſidence of bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence and peace.</p>
            <p>A bell at length ſummoned them to a magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent banquet in the hall; which the quaint jeſt, the jovial laugh, the winning politeneſs that reigned, made more delectable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="unknown:034525_0046_0FFE19A1310D01C0"/>
In the evening the Earl conducted Ethelwald to a ſpacious ſaloon blazing with the variegated luſtre of innumerable lamps. The ladies he found habited in a ſtile of more ſplendour, though not leſs taſte than in the morning. Here were aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled a gallant ſhew of neighbouring barons with their noble dames and daughters. Ethelwald had the ſupreme felicity of being ſeated next El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frida, who ſhone above her gay companions with a ſurpaſſing lovelineſs. A large curtain, which hung at the termination of the ſaloon, ſoftly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe to the ſound of an inviſible minſtrelſey, and diſcovered a luxuriant and romantic ſcenery.</p>
            <p>The entertainment conſiſted of a youth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencing his purſuit after happineſs, in which Prudence and Pleaſure ſeverally ſolicit to be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen for a guide. Faſcinated by the ſhewy exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior of the latter he puts himſelf under her tute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage; the trying viciſſitudes to which ſuch a choice neceſſarily expoſed him were ſtrongly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplified; worn out by his afflictions, and on the point of plunging into the gulph of deſpair, he is prevented by the interpoſition of Patience, who brings at her right hand her gay attendant Hope; they calm his perturbations, and aſſure him if he relies on religion, a power whoſe autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity they all own, he will ſhortly diſcover the retreat of Prudence who will be his ſmiling guide to the region inhabited by happineſs. He finds her as they promiſed; ſhe leads him to the deſired dome, which was adorned with all that could charm without dazzling the eye; Virtue who preſided over the entrance immediately gave
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:034525_0047_0FFE19A31E10C318"/>
him admittance, introducing him to the bright inhabitant of the place, who was ſurrounded by the powers of innocent feſtivity, ornamented with all that could gain upon the ſoul; her firſt ſmile gave him a fore-taſte of the bliſs he is about en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying—Cheerfulneſs now enters with her bright bugle-horn, announcing a banquet the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of partaking it; Virtue immediately gives her a commiſſion to invite thoſe ſhe pleaſes—Cheerfulneſs immediately tripping forward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached Elfrida and Ethelwald; ſhe bound his temples with laurel, and placed on the ſnowy forehead of Elfrida a garland of roſes.</p>
            <p>Elfrida bluſhed—'twas a bluſh of pleaſure; the Baron was in extacies, every ſenſe was intoxica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; his cheeks burned with the fire of his ſoul; he graſped her hand, he ſpoke inarticulate—'tis tranſport, 'tis happineſa—Elfrida ſhe called us to her court.</p>
            <p>He led her on; the company followed. The young domeſtics who had ſupported the allegori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal play ranged themſelves around and ſung al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternately.</p>
            <p>The party at laſt ſeparated; Ethelwald began to be rouſed from the tumults of pleaſure.—He ſighed in wiſhing for a power to detain them all, ſince by their means he would have an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of gazing yet a little longer on Elfrida; but he was obliged to retire to his chamber, where he ſpeedily diſmiſſed the attendants.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="unknown:034525_0048_0FFE19A74FDD8218"/>
Here in the ſilence of night forgotten thoughts began to obtrude; the active powers ſo delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully called forth were ſinking into calmneſs, and he recollected the occaſion of his viſit to the caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of Devon.</p>
            <p>Oh Edgar, cried he, with a voice wildly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed, into what a ſituation have you thrown me; this is a trial indeed, could you not have foreſeen if beautiful as pictured, Elfrida could not be viewed by the fire of youth, the ſenſibility of a feeling mind, without danger? My ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, you have blaſted my peace; your hitherto kind hand has uplifted the dagger for my heart—ſhe muſt be your's—the tongue of Ethelwald even eloquent as it will be on ſuch a ſubject can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not paint her beauties. My queen, muſt then thoſe thrilling emotions be covered with cold reſpect? I ſhall behold you too when withdrawn from the buſtle of a court, I ſhall witneſs the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene joys of happy love,—Diſtraction is in the thought; Edgar, the moment of thy union diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troys me, for earth has no counterpart of Elfri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da. He ſat down, his head reſting ſullenly on his hands.</p>
            <p>A ſudden ſenſation ſeemed at length to rouſe him; he ſtarted up, tranſports gleaming from his eyes; they were however quickly ſucceeded by a profound gloom.</p>
            <p>Fly from me, he exclaimed, yet thoughts fraught with horror, ſhall I violate his confidence? ſhall I, ſo late unblemiſhed—oh never, never,
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:034525_0049_0FFE19AD05803400"/>
ſhall the fair bloom of honour be blighted by an act of Ethelwald's.</p>
            <p>The night waned apace; he haſtily undreſſed and flung himſelf into bed; he ſlept, but his ſlumbers were diſturbed by an inconſiſtent fancy, he wandered through wilds haunted by ſpectres; fit emblems of every woe which tortures man; he now beheld Elfrida in his view, he ſtrained her to his panting breaſt, anon ſhe was torn from him and encircled in Edgar's arms.</p>
            <p>He ſtarted from his pillow, and cold dew broke upon his cheek—Viſions of night, cried he, how you torture me; Edgar, by my hopes of felicity, I cannot relinquiſh Elfrida to you.</p>
            <p>A heavineſs again ſtole upon him from which he was ſhortly rouſed by the ſound of an horn; be beheld the ſun beaming into the apartment with an inviting radiancy, and dreſſing precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tately deſcended to the hall where the family prepared for the chace were taking refreſhments.</p>
            <p>The Earl choſe Ethelwald Elfrida's knight for the day; he aſſiſted her to mount; the proud ſteed neighed and pawed, and appeared as from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct to know the treaſure he carried. Her long treſſes eſcaping from the artleſs encloſure of a ribbon, waved with a ſoft motion of the breeze; her heightened colour gave greater luſtre to her eyes. She was more an angel—the Baron more undone.</p>
            <p>The ſtag ſoon yielded its tranſient life; and the heat now becoming oppreſſive, the ſteeds
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:034525_0050_0FFE19AA280AABE0"/>
were forſaken, and they entered a boat which conveyed them to a ſmall iſland in the midſt of a large lake. A ſudden whirl in the water fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened (or at leaſt had the appearance of doing ſo) Elfrida; ſhe caught the Baron—what throbbing emotions ruſhed upon his heart from the faint preſſure of her hand. His dark eyes beaming on her ſeemed to ſwear eternal love and loyalty to her.</p>
            <p>A grotto, in the centre of the iſland, was their receſs; here domeſtics habited as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſes greeted their entrance, and a white flag which ſerved for a table diſplayed their ſtore, much fitter indeed for the palace of luxury than the cell of a derviſe; but being ſerved in a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar ſtile made thoſe impreſſions which were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired. The grotto was lined with moſs; firs and old-oaks waved around it; and the ſmaller, though more gay progeny of nature, impregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the ſportive gales. The flitting birds, by gladſome notes, appeared declaring their joy for ſuch a retirement; ſoft muſic ſtealing along the water completed the delights that were here aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled.</p>
            <p>All is enchantment, exclaimed Ethelwald, with an involuntary air of amazement—yes, ye gay ſcenes, ye ſmiling beings, my aſtoniſhed mind regards you as the beautiful prodigies of creation.—Why, oh (continued he with a more ſerious air) not ſooner known? my paſt life appears like a blank, 'tis only now exiſtence opens upon me.</p>
            <p>Thus, ſaid the Earl, do my family enjoy thoſe recreations which heaven moſt graciouſly has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:034525_0051_0FFE19AE9D801020"/>
us, without deeming it an infringement of its right. After a performance of the firſt great duties, I wiſh to unbend their minds, and by ſo doing give them a higher reliſh for thoſe amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of which they thus innocently partake.—Alas! Ethelwald was unable to attend to him; he was diſtracted by conflicts, the laſticity of his ſoul ſeemed to himſelf for ever broken; he long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the midnight hour of privacy and ſilence. His fame, his honour, ſtood upon a precipice, and he wanted reſolution to preſerve them; his love for Elfrida was paſſion in exceſs; a paſſion encreaſed by the apparent obſtacles between them; hurried on by its impetuoſity, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e recoiled from the voice of reaſon. Generoſity, the early and hitherto conſtant inhabitant of his ſoul, was baniſhed by the impulſe of ſelf-gratification; he forgot his obligations; Edgar was no longer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded as an indulgent maſter, but one who would blight his happineſs. Images of deceit for the firſt time ſullied his probity; he felt all their horrors, but there was the prize in view, and Ethelwald conſented to be a traitor to poſſeſs Elfrida.</p>
            <p>He now began to do as all thoſe who err, to call on ſophiſtry and ſpeciouſneſs to palliate his crime; he repreſented to himſelf the inconſtancy of Edgar's diſpoſition, which was too habitual to ſuppoſe would be conquered even by Elfrida; knowing this, cried he, ſhall I not endeavour to ſave her from deſtruction, from the miſery her gentle ſoul would feel when neglected by the moſt changeable of mankind. I can eaſily deceive him by ſaying ſame has exagerated; but though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:034525_0052_0FFE19B17B658548"/>
of him, too glorious a prize to be aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned by a ſubjected deſirous of aggrandiſement. In every other reſpect I vow the moſt inviolable fidelity to him; my tale believed, each obſtacle is removed. There is a language in Elfrida's eyes—the Baron bluſhed with rapture at the thought which flatters hope—her parents anticipate her wiſhes: with me ſhe has nothing to dread from the inſtability of love, or the capriciouſneſs of my diſpoſition. In my caſtle ſhe ſhall enjoy all thoſe domeſtic pleaſures ſhe has experienced from her infancy. Our children will bloom like the young ſhrubs of the foreſt beneath the ſhelter of parental indulgence.</p>
            <p>Ethelwald now panted to execute his project; beſides, he knew the impatient monarch, ill brook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a delay, might diſpatch a courier after him, and another courier the Baron ſaid might be more faithful than me.</p>
            <p>By the declining beams of the next day's ſun he determined on departing; when he declared his intention, he watched Elfrida as he ſpoke; her cheeks were overſpread with paleneſs, her eyes turned to the ground, ſhe ſeized the firſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of retiring in ſilence.</p>
            <p>Noble Ethelwald, exclaimed the Earl, my dame and I will often requeſt the repetition of your viſit; ye be aſſured we will never encroach on your politeneſs by urging your ſtay longer that is agreeable to you; no, believe me, I think a
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:034525_0053_0FFE19B6F94B9270"/>
retreat like this would be too inglorious for you now in the zenith of youth and its active powers. May the favourite of Edgar purſue the courſe of honour with ſucceſs, and may he uſe each inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of unfolding with wiſdom to the ſoveriegn the beauty of virtue, and the delight reſulting from the amity of the ſubject.</p>
            <p>Ethelwald's grateful heart dictated a thouſand things for the urbanity of his entertainments; but its fullneſs oppreſſed him, and his lips quivered vainly to ſpeak. There are moments when ſilence is moſt expreſſive of what we feel.</p>
            <p>He ſought Elfrida; ſhe was in a ſequeſtered bower in the garden, whither his eyes had traced her from an arched window.</p>
            <p>Pardon, lady, ſaid he, my intruſion, but I come to bid adieu. Elfrida looked, (an uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned ſpectator would have imagined ſhe had a conſcious knowledge of ſomething particular he was about to ſay) ſhe interrupted him, mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed heſitatingly the proſpect.</p>
            <p>There is now but one proſpect, replied the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, ſmiling, I can view with pleaſure. Yes, Elfrida, he exclaimed, throwing off the ſtudied formality of his air, there is but one lovely work in the creation I now regard with tranſport. The Earl and his lady ſolicit me to repeat my viſit, but I dare not without thy permiſſion; ſay ſhall I again be welcome, or will you give me cauſe to rue your father's hoſpitality.</p>

She bluſhed, ſhe looked round, ſhe looked down; her eyes met the ardent ones of Ethelwald; Baron, at length, exclaimed ſhe with a glowing ingenuity, if you return, you ſhall find Elfrida, like her parents, can diſtinguiſh merit. Ethelwald was at her feet; her hands were ſeized in his, they were preſſed to his heart, to his lips. If I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn—can it be called life when from thy ſight.</p>
            <p>The moment arrived for his departure; he ſighed adieu to the caſtle of Devon; his ſteed though ſwift beyond idea, kept no bounds to his impatience; he at length reached the palace, and gained an inſtantaneous interview with Edgar.</p>
            <p>That monarch, whoſe ſtriking characteriſtic was being carried away in an impetuous purſuit after whatever obtruded itſelf on his fancy, had, ſince the idea of an union with the Heireſs of Devon, pictured an angel to him; no reliſh for any amuſement, and he experienced an uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querable laſſitude 'till the period of Ethelwald's arrival.</p>
            <p>Well, my Baron, cried he, his tongue falter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through an exceſs of impatience, has fame been juſt, is ſhe more or is ſhe leſs than we expect.</p>
            <p>Edgar ſtammered—he felt all the ſhame and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonies of diſſimulation but he could not retreat from the intended ſcheme, without the reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Elfrida; yet moſt gladly did he ſcreen his eyes under the dark plumage of his helmet

from the quick glances of the king.—Leſs, f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>r leſs than we expected is Elfrida, ſaid the Baron. Is this poſſible, was thrice repeated; moſt true, my fire, nor ever would ſhe bring pleaſure to thy arms. Edgar expreſſed his mortification by a ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len ſilence of a conſiderable duration. Never, cried he, ſhall I believe the babbling nonſenſe of a few individuals, who probably never beheld her they deſcribed a prodigy.</p>
            <p>Ethelwald, fearful of exciting ſuſpicion poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned the moment of declaring his intention of wedding her. Almoſt trembling with anxiety, he at length divulged his purpoſe, and intreat the ſanction of his ſovereign.</p>
            <p>Edgar remonſtrated againſt ſuch an union; he mentioned many of illuſtrious deſcent, of ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did fortunes, with appearance far more pleaſing than that which Ethelwald had painted Elfrida, who might be happy to accept his hand.</p>
            <p>The Baron pleaded the capriciouſneſs of their choice, the uncertainty of his being the object, above all the favourable ſentiments of the family of Devon owing their origin to the kindneſs graciouſly ſhewn to me by you my royal maſter.</p>
            <p>Since thus reſolved, replied Edgar, you have our free permiſſion to unite at pleaſure your deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny to that of the houſe of Devon; from our protection expect every emolument; thy worth, thy valour, merit this return; thou wilt not, Ethelwald, be ever leſs acceptable for wanting a
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:034525_0056_0FFE19BE36E39ED8"/>
handſome wife, though a pleaſing circumſtance in our eyes. Baron, ſaid he, reſuming his ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, believe me tenderly intereſted in thy welfare; thou art now entering upon n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>w con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nections, but never afford them an opportunity of weakening the eſteem thy ſovereign ſtill wiſhes to conciliate.</p>
            <p>This language almoſt over-powered Ethelwald—his ſoul recoiled at its own idea—the black and hideous fiend of ingratitude ſwam before his view—my maſter, my king, he cried—he pauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, his knees ſmote each other—the image of Elfrida roſe in the mildneſs of beauty—ſhe muſt, ſhe muſt be mine, he cried within himſelf. He bent one knee to the ground; he cought the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended hand of Edgar, his own ſhaking at his touch; he aroſe, and fled with precipation from the preſence.</p>
            <p>Kneeling in his chamber, he imprecated deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truction on his head if ever again he violated that faith due to a ſovereign, who unbending from the height and haughtineſs of power, conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended to him with the familiarity of a friend. Speedily did he trace the road leading to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of his happineſs. He ſtopped at the abbey, from whence he viewed the ſpires and battlements of Devon caſtle. He diſpatched a courier for it with a letter declaring all his wiſhes. He reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned the moments for his return; the diary told him they were of the accuſtomed length, but he counted by the throbbings of an impaſſioned heart. The domeſtic returned—he brought a ſummons, yet more a letter fraught with amity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="unknown:034525_0057_0FFE19BFC0F20120"/>
The Baron vaulted on his courſer—he was breathleſs when he reached the caſtle-gate—he ruſhed into the Hall—the Earl received him.</p>
            <p>Thy return is indeed unexpected, ſaid he, but more welcome (if poſſible) for being ſo.</p>
            <p>Ethelwald looked at him with a wiſhful eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs—the Earl interpreted it. Far be from me, he cried, to ſully the native garb of ſincerity (which has ever marked my days) diſavowing the pleaſure I received from the proſpect of thy alliance, which thy noble birth and high eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with thy ſovereign render deſirable even to our ancient houſe.</p>
            <p>But mark me, Baron, when I ſay theſe advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages fade into inſignificance before me if not ſupported by virtue; aſſured of thine from the acclamations of the exalted, and the leſs clamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous voice of the retired, I ſanction thy hopes.</p>
            <p>Lady Devon entered at this inſtant; the tears ſparkled in her eyes, and extending her white hands, my heart, noble Ethelwald, ſaid ſhe, bows yeilding to thy requeſt, and when the virgin reſerve of Elfrida candidly allows her to ſpeak, ſhe will declare her acquieſcence to our wiſhes.</p>
            <p>Ethelwald would have uttered the ebullitions of his ſoul, but all was rhapſody and inconſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; he attempted to bend his knee to the ground, but was prevented; they conducted him to their daughter; ſhe met him with a beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:034525_0058_0FFE19C3FAD0A018"/>
diſorder; ſhe was deſired to welcome him; her tongue faultered, but her dark blue eyes were eloquent.</p>
            <p>Her father witneſſed her confuſion, and wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to terminate the period of ſuſpenſe.</p>
            <p>Though the commencement of our acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance has been ſhort, ſaid he to the Baron, yet our friendſhip appears ſtrong as if the growth of years; but ſympathy is the cement of ſouls; fame united mine to your's long ſince. The bluſhes of Elfrida confeſs the dear ſecrets of her ſoul. I am an enemy to the frigidneſs of puncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio; each moment of the ſwift period of exiſtence ſhould I think, be uſefully employed and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently enjoyed. Receive then youth my daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; ſecure of thy honour, the laſt branch of the houſe of Devon is intruſted to thy care; ſweet will be the ſhade thou ſhall afford to guard it from each blight, nor will the parent ſtream itſelf lack nouriſhment from the—he ſtopped, a tear trickled down his reverend cheek. Lady Devon ſobbed—oh, Ethelwald, my newly adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſon, ſaid ſhe, with uplifted hands, if thou ever ceaſe to cheriſh my darling expect to forfeit the ſmiles of heaven.</p>
            <p>He withdrew his enfolding arms from Elfrida and bent his knee to the ground, the fire of his ſoul darting from his eyes—yes, lady, ſaid he, may I forfeit the ſmiles of heaven, and may the hour in which Ethelwald ceaſes to regard Elfri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, as the firſt object in the creation, be his laſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="56" facs="unknown:034525_0059_0FFE1ACB07430240"/>
The nuptuals were ſoon ſolemnized with that ſplendour befitting their rank. The peaſantry, whom the Earl conſidered as one great family, were made to rejoice on the occaſion, an infant lips were taught to hail that hour with bleſſings in which Ethelwald and Elfrida united their fates.</p>
            <p>They ſoon repaired to the Baron's caſtle; it had long been forſaken by him; he now beheld it with an awful tranſport; he led with an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſtic glow its blooming miſtreſs round the ſpacious apartments once inhabited by many a noble dame, their hovering ſpirits he imagined <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>igh, and called for the ſanction of their bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings.</p>
            <p>The nobles thronged around to pay their tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of reſpect; the vaſſals exerted their artleſs ſkill in rural ſports; and many young and gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant knight diſplayed his ſkill in tournaments to gain a ſmile from the fair bride.</p>
            <p>Intoxicated with the completion of felicity, Ethelwald forgot the danger of expoſing Elfrida to view; he recollected it not till too late; then aſſuaged his alarms by the hopes the king would no more make enquiries concerning her. But an alarming thought ſuggeſted is not quickly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled; the joys of Ethelwald now diminiſhed before his apprehenſſions; he fully proved that the heart conſcious of an error taints the liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſcenes; nay, every bleſſing is oppreſſive if convinced of not deſerving its poſſeſſion; vainly would nature court him to be bleſt whoſe ſoul knew the pollution of vice.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="unknown:034525_0060_0FFE19C584AF95C0"/>
A change of the ſaddeſt kind now ſtole upon the bridal pleaſures of Elfrida. Her noble father, on his return to his ancient ſeat, was ſeized with a malignant diſorder, which lady Devon caught by her attendance on him. They wiſhed to avoid diſturbing the happineſs of their children; they delayed ſending till her preſence would have been unavailing; they committed their parting benediction for her to a truſty domeſtic; they ſurvived each other but a ſhort time, and expir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with no other ſorrow on their ſouls than that proceeding from not beholding her.</p>
            <p>Blameleſs throughout life, retroſpection with them was attended with hope and ſerenity; they had cheriſhed religion and benevolence, and they ſound them ſupports when this world was fad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away.</p>
            <p>The thoughtleſs they had reclaimed by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, and the precepts of tender wiſdom; of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten had they repleniſhed the pilgrim's ſcrip, and cheared the penurious cottage of the peaſant.</p>
            <p>Altered were the ſhades of Devon, its hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table gates were cloſed, nor did the caſements admit the chearing rays of the ſun; no longer the gay ſhepherd revelled in its meads, nor echo return the blythſome nots of joy.</p>
            <p>Many years after the name of Ordun, Earl of Devon, or his noble dame, could not be mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without the tribute of tears.</p>

Elfrida's anguiſh ſurpaſſed deſcription. Ethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wald ſtrove not to controul its tumults; the voice of nature he knew muſt firſt be heard; he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned her to the melioration of time, her good ſenſe and religion. When her mind began to regain ſome degree of its wonted calmneſs, ſhe wept upon the Baron's breaſt—now, ſpouſe of my affections, ſhe exclaimed, thou art the only guardian left Elfrida. And by that ſacred title, he replied, by every endearing tie may I watch over the moſt precious gift of Heaven.</p>
            <p>Time now rolled on and fond Ethelwald ſtill faſcinated to the confines of his caſtle; he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got what the departed Earl had ſaid of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now in the zenith of his youth and its ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive powers, when thoſe laurels are to be acquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed whoſe bright foliage ſhall ſhade the ebbing period of mortals exiſtence. Laid in the inglo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious lap of indolence, its enervation impercep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibly ſtole upon him; love, or rather the idolatry of paſſion, took wholly poſſeſſion of his mind, and made him forgetful of the duties incumbent on him. Even love itſelf was hurt by ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. Elfrida, whoſe ſoul breathing the genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine emanations of vivacity, required ſcenes fit to feed its fires; a weariſome laſſitude ſhe now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to feel at the uniformity of all around; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putually accuſtomed to the ſight of Ethelwald, her eyes loſt the delight of novelty, nor did her breaſt beat tumultuous reſponſes to his voice. She began to think of other pleaſures, ſhe knew not how to obtain them, and ſig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The king at firſt was ſurpriſed at the ſecluſion of his favourite—he felt hurt—he enquired, and heard too much. In the firſt paroxiſms of rage and diſappointment, he vowed by the ſpirit of offended loyalty to puniſh the perfidy of Ethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wald. Even in his cooler moments, he was ſtill determined. After ſome little deliberation he diſpatched a courier to inform the Baron he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed taking the amuſement of the chace in the foreſt of Harwood, and would paſs a few days at his caſtle.</p>
            <p>'Twas now the ſtorm burſt tremendous on his head; he ſhuddered, he experienced the dire horrors of an illicit plot; he beheld the gulph of deſtruction yawning before him, and ſaw no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat. He fled to the apartment of the Baroneſs—he caught her to his boſome—he even wept over her—he ſaw the proſpect of loſing her. She was amazed at his emotions, and eagerly enquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the cauſe.</p>
            <p>In a diſtracted and inconſiſtent manner he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed her of all. He fell at her feet—her robe was enfolded in his trembling arms—his cheeks were dyed in paleneſs—he beſought her to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give the impetuoſity of that love which tempted him to tarniſh the luſtre of his honour.</p>
            <p>My wife, my beloved, the hand of violence, he exclaimed, may wreſt thee from me. Oh, do thou, I conjure thee by all our hopes of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, endeavoured to leſſen thy attractions. Alas! I have ſtill no hopes, My Elfrida muſt be ever too exquiſitely lovely.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="unknown:034525_0063_0FFE19CE20E7D7E8"/>
When recovered from her firſt aſtoniſhment, ſhe quickly comprehended his meaning; ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired him to fear nothing from her want of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; then expreſſing a wiſh to be alone, he retired.</p>
            <p>Elfrida continued a conſiderable time in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fround meditation; then ſuddenly ſtarting from the ſeat, Bertha, cried ſhe, to her moſt favoured attendant, are you not a little ſurpriſed at what we have juſt now heard. The Baron has played us rather falſe; yes, ſaid ſhe, traverſing with haſty ſteps her chamber, then ſtopping before a mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, a diadem would not have been unbecoming this brow, nor would this hand looked very ill in wielding a ſceptre.</p>
            <p>Yes, madam, I really think the Baron has played a truant game; Oh, ſurely, Queen would have been much better than a ſimple Baroneſs; beſides, I ſhould have been your majeſty's maid of honour, the Lady Bertha, and my two little brothers pages—Queen Elfrida, a moſt beautiful title, we ſhould have had our envoys, our pleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potentiaries, our ſtate days, while all the people would be ſhouting, long live the glorious Queen Elfrida.</p>
            <p>The Baroneſs flung herſelf in a muſing poſter on a ſofa—her mind never before was under the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of ſuch agitations—brought up in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate preſence of her parents, her vanity had hitherto been controuled, but now all paſſions of particularly aſcribed to her ſex were rouſed even
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:034525_0064_0FFE19D269F87DD8"/>
at the dangerous period, when laſſitude had weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened the ſtronger faculties, and the firſt ardour of love was deadened by the continual preſence of Ethelwald.</p>
            <p>She was informed ſhe might have been united to a ſovereign, brave, generous, beautiful; with him have ſhared the glory of conqueſt, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of nations, and the admiration of mankind.</p>
            <p>Houſe of Devon, ſhe exclaimed, how little art thou indebted to Ethelwald—but for him thou might have been elevated to regal pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, perhaps immortal fame; but his ſhackles have bound my hands, and the daughter of Ordun ſhall ſupport them with calmneſs; yet never ſhall her high-born ſoul aſſiſt his mean deſign; ſhe will at leaſt prove to the royal Edgar ſhe was not ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy as depictured of ſharing his honours.</p>
            <p>Ethelwald was compelled to ſet forward to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his ſovereign. Edgar panted for revenge, but diſſimulation was now neceſſary for the black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his intentions. He met the Baron with a ſmiling aſpect, chid him with gentleneſs for his long ſecluſion from the court, but vowed for the future to break in upon his domeſtic ſyſtem of tranquillity.</p>
            <p>The faint heart of Ethelwald was cheered by this reception, but it again ſmote its tenement when leading to the Baroneſs's apartment. To ſequeſter her he knew would have been impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:034525_0065_0FFE19D5452BD270"/>
even a pretext of illneſs muſt have excited ſuſpicion.</p>
            <p>The folding doors were flung open by two fair boys. Elfrida reſted on a ſofa, the youngeſt of her attendants ranged around; but what horrors blaſted the eyes of Ethelwald on beholding her ſurpaſſing lovelineſs. Her habit conveyed an idea of ſplendor without heavineſs; a robe of pale blue careleſſly ſpotted with ſilver fell far beneath her feet; the delicacy of her waiſt was diſplayed by a confining girdle of pearls: her boſom poliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and white beyond compare was faintly ſhaded by the decorating lace; her ſhining treſſes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound to ſhew the luxuriance of their growth, had now no other covering than a light veil, which falling back in ſeemingly artleſs folds diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered a face the model of human beauty.</p>
            <p>She aroſe with a kind of dignified diſorder, ſhe ſtept forward, her knee touched the ground to pay her firſt obeiſance to her King; the reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs glow of modeſty mantled quick upon her cheek; her lips ſcarce emitted a ſound; nor was one articulate ſave the tremulous word of wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come.</p>
            <p>Edgar gazed upon her with aſtoniſhment, he was transfixed like a ſtatue, and his eyes alone evinced his animation.</p>
            <p>All is loſt, cried Ethelwald to himſelf—his crimſoned cheek changing to the hue of death.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="unknown:034525_0066_0FFE19D96CFD5968"/>
The King recollected himſelf; he could have fallen proſtrate to implore Elfrida's forgiveneſs, for permitting her continuance in ſuch a poſture; he raiſed her, reſeated her on the ſofa, himſelf beſide her. Lady, ſaid he, we and our court can ſcarcely pardon the Baron for concealing in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidious ſhades ſuch perfections. If anxious for a reconciliation, he muſt no longer monopolize from the world ſo valuable a treaſure—he glanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at Ethelwald—the hand of diſmay was buſy with his features, and marked too legibly the emotion of his ſoul.</p>
            <p>Thou art my victim, ſaid the king to himſelf, thou ſhall no longer triumph in treachery, the ſoft hand I have touched ſhall yet be mine.</p>
            <p>It was his wiſh, however, to diſſipate the fears he excited; he only therefore treated Elfrida with the politeneſs due to her ſtation. To the Baron, he behaved with aditional complacency; repeatedly aſſured him he would no longer allow him to be retired from court.</p>
            <p>The Baroneſs called forth every charm. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a few trifling excuſes her voice accompanied the lute—'twas thrilling melody—nor did her manner leſs delight; and Edgar felt in being robbed of the heireſs of Devon he loſt the moſt perfect of her ſex.</p>
            <p>Ethelwald at night attended him to his apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment—Baron, exclaimed the King, (when alone with him) you have not acted quite well to me, yet imagine not, he continued, (perceiving his
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:034525_0067_0FFE19DAF26B2E48"/>
agitation) my nature ſo ſeverely harſh as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe pardon to a crime of love; it is what a man oft will in his own breaſt find a pal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ation for; but if you deſire I ſhould be reconciled to you, you muſt conduct the Baroneſs to court; her charms ſhould not be concealed from the world, nor can I longer bear thy enſtrangement from me.</p>
            <p>My moſt gracious fire, my too kind, too in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent maſter, ſaid Ethelwald, ſinking at his feet, I have not merited this clemency; 'tis an agravation of my crime—but if the ſtricteſt vows, the ſincereſt reſolutions of unſhaken fidelity can extenuate my conduct, Ethelwald for ever ſhall not be recorded in the black volumes of perfidy and guilt.</p>
            <p>The King appeared affected, he raiſed him, he preſſed his hand, he reiterated his profeſſions of kindneſs. The night waned away; the chace was to commence early the enſuing morning, and they ſeparated.</p>
            <p>Elfrida, who dreaded the remonſtrances of the Baron for acting ſo contradictory to his wiſhes, pretended to be aſleep when he entered her apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and when he roſe by the firſt dawn of light her eyes were cloſed by its balſamic influence.</p>
            <p>Ethelwald's happineſs now ſeemed ſupreme; he had flung off that weight of apprehenſions ſo long oppreſſive; the bright effuſion of returning peace tinctured his brown cheek; the fire of his eyes was re-lightned; the chords of his ſoul re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:034525_0068_0FFE19DDD1CA0808"/>
their elaſticity, with flattering prognoſtics of vibrating no more but to the ſound of gladneſs—he reſembled a wretched mariner, who, toſſed by the whirl of winds and waters, attains at length the haven of ſecurity.</p>
            <p>A numerous retinue attended the King and Ethelwald, and in the mazy winding of the foreſt of Harwood they purſued the timorous ſtag.</p>
            <p>The King at length declared his fatigue; and expreſſing a private wiſh to the Baron of ſeeking a place for repoſe, they ſoon dropt the party and penetrated into the tangled and obſcure paths. Diſmounting from their ſteeds they proceeded into the centre of the foreſt, where the interwo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven branches of old oaks hid the pure light of day.</p>
            <p>Here the King ſtopped, and withdrawing his arm from Ethelwald's, Baron, ſaid he, this is a moment for private conference I have ſighed for.</p>
            <p>My ſire does honour to his vaſſal, he replied. Yes, reſumed he, I have longed, I have almoſt died to tell you, you are a baſe, perfidious traitor; did'ſt thou ſuppoſe I would ſuffer thee to enjoy the fruits of thy deception? I thought you had known the high and vindictive ſoul of Edgar bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Ignoble Ethelwald I triumph over thee; that wife on whom thy eyes for the laſt time have feaſted ſhall be mine ere thy clay-cold coverlet is green—thus, exclaimed he, drawing a dagger he had concealed beneath his habit, may this
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:034525_0069_0FFE19E0AB9637E8"/>
hand deſtroy all who ſhall dare to diminiſh the happineſs of Edgar.</p>
            <p>Ethelwald ſtaggered at the blow which pierc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his breaſt; tis juſt, he groaned—but oh, my wife! my El—frida, he would have added, but a convulſive writhing cloſed his lips, and ſenſeleſs he dropped back.</p>
            <p>The enſanguined ſteel fell from Edgar—his hand ſeemed nerveleſs—he would have fled, but the entangling brambles faſtening in his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, impeded his progreſs—he ſtopped pant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing—his eyes involuntary faſtened on the pale viſage of the youthful Baron.</p>
            <p>'Tis a bold deed I have atchieved, he cried, 'twas deſerved;—yet, how horrible is death—ſo unprepared too; how gaily tinged was his cheek by that blood my dagger drank.</p>
            <p>He extricated himſelf with precipitation from the baneful ſhades, leaving the boſom of the once gallant Ethelwald to be covered by the falling verdure of the foreſt.</p>
            <p>The King was breathleſs as he gained his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants; they ſurrounded him with aſtoniſhment, and ſupported him from the ſteed he could no longer ſit. In faltering accents he anſwered their enquiries; they were ſuddenly aſſaulted by va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grants, he eſcaped with difficulty; Ethelwald—he was unable to proceed, the horrid reſt was gueſſed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="67" facs="unknown:034525_0070_0FFE19E38907E7A8"/>
The piercing cries and lamentations of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtics row ſmote his ears. Oh where, they cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, diſtractedly flying about, where are the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters that ſpilled the blood of gallant Ethelwald.</p>
            <p>The King deſired to be borne to the caſtle; there Elfrida was deviſing new ſchemes to give a permanency to that admiration ſhe perceived kindled in his eyes.</p>
            <p>A murmuring noiſe now reſounded through, the caſtle, by degrees it approached nearer to her apartment; the moſt aged of the domeſtics ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wildly in. He is gone, they exclaimed; he is loſt forever. Oh, Lady, the hand of violence and barbarity has deſpoiled thee of thy Lord.</p>
            <p>Ghaſtlineſs and horror overſpread the features of the Baroneſs; a kind of conſcious guilt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded her ſoul; ſhe ſcreamed faintly, and fell without ſenſe upon the boſom of Bertha.</p>
            <p>She was ſoon reſtored to reaſon, and the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſorrow, yet not that excruciating bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſorrow which would have been her por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had her love for the Baron continued with its firſt ardour; ſhe wept his fate, but her tears flowed not from the ſprings of agony.</p>
            <p>Edgar remained at the caſtle; propriety might have forbidden his ſtay, but he hearkened not to its pleadings; there was a guilty tranſport felt under the roof with Elfrida.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="68" facs="unknown:034525_0071_0FFE19E660B2F8C0"/>
He had it reported to her that the body of Ethelwald was vainly ſought for by his deſire, and as ſoon as decency would permit ſolicited and obtained an interview.</p>
            <p>The ſurpaſſing lovelineſs of the Baroneſs amaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his enthralled heart; her waning colour, her tears that inceſſantly flowed, the ſolemneſs of her habit all worked upon the dormant powers of ſenſibility.</p>
            <p>He experienced a trembling confuſion; his eyes were averted; but with horror they faſtened on ſome ſcattered habiliments of Ethelwald; the deed however was accompliſhed, nor could he feel compunction with the prize in view; he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered his compoſure and endeavoured to ſooth her. At length he imperceptibly led her into the path he deſired, and mentioned, though with heſitation, his wiſhes.</p>
            <p>Elfrida hung back at the propoſal; the reſerve of female modeſty revolted at this ſpeedy mention of another choice; ſhe refuſed to anſwer, loſt in an anxious embarraſſment.</p>
            <p>Lady, cried the ardent monarch, I wiſh not to encroach on the rites due to the memory of Ethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wald, but ſurely when fulfilled I may expect you to liſten to my ſuit. Know, Lady, I have a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or right to thee, and but for his deceptions might have taſted the ſweets of thy virgin affections; he is gone, however, and let it not be ſaid, Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar diſplays the faults of him who moulders to
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:034525_0072_0FFE19E939DD2BE0"/>
primeval duſt. Oh! raiſe thy benign eyes upon me, nor let me find that the daughter of Ordun has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the vaſſal with more approbation than a King.</p>
            <p>He was ſtopped by the riſing impetuoſity of his emotions.</p>
            <p>The idea of Ethelwald was fading from Elfri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da's ſoul; ſhe beheld at her feet a ſuppliant in a young lovely ſovereign; ſhe forgot what was due to her departed lord; to the proud virtues of her parents; ambition and vanity like tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents bore upon native delicacy; ſhe promiſed to be Edgar's when the term of mourning was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired, and in that moment ſullied the hitherto pure brightneſs of her fame.</p>
            <p>Let the young and blooming daughters of her ſex; from her example, beware how they ſuffer an inordinate paſſion to gain admittance into their boſoms; inſinuating its entrance, but diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult its expulſion; and may in one moment pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate them from that height of virtue which an unblemiſhed adherence of her rules had ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated them to. To unite again was not proper, but this ſpeedy contract; there was the wound to fair propriety.</p>
            <p>The king left the caſtle. The perturbations of Elfrida's mind ſubſiding; unoccupied, it ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly pointed out to her the ſolitarineſs of her preſent condition; a dull ſilence reigned through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the caſtle; the domeſtics ſhe imagined re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded her with a gloomy reſpect; in her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence the gay pipe of the ſhepherd ceaſed; joy,
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:034525_0073_0FFE19EAC3666450"/>
fleeted from before her, and the old battlements ſhe thought often ſhook with an ominous vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence.</p>
            <p>Unable to ſupport thoſe ideas, ſhe reſolved on repairing to the ſeat of her nativity, taking with her only thoſe ſervants particularly belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to her. Here other emotions were awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; the remembrance of the parents ſhe had loſt, of her lord cut off in the bright bloom of manhood, ruſhed upon her heart, and with it an agonizing ſhame at the idea of the little reſpect ſhe paid their manes in ſo ſoon entering upon a new engagment. Her ſacred word however was pledged to Edgar. To diſſipate her melancholy ſhe ſtrove to rouſe the paſſions of vanity and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition; fruitleſs were thoſe efforts; an oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ſadneſs marked her as its own, and Elfrida, like a young flower blown on by untimely winds, daily faded.</p>
            <p>One evening's cloſe ſhe proſtrated herſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the portraits of her parents; the wildneſs of ſorrow agitated her fancy, and ſhe thought the brave Ordun, and his chaſte dame, bending down with an indignant wafture, deſired her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture; ſhe ſcreamed, the cry drew the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate domeſtics; they raiſed her from the ground, and wiped off the chilling dews which ſtole upon her cheek.</p>
            <p>Fraught with the ſuperſtition of the times, the Baroneſs reſolved on endeavouring to quiet her agonies in fulfilling an awful duty, by repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to an abbey two leagues from the caſtle, and
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:034525_0074_0FFE19F042CF3530"/>
getting the holy fathers to offer up prayers for the ſouls of her departed friends.</p>
            <p>As ſhe made a merit of undertaking this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately, ſhe commanded her attendants not to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach her apartment till ſummoned; from which, by a ſmall door, ſhe deſcended at the firſt glimmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of day, attired in a plain, though coloured robe, to avoid the ſuſpicions of paſſengers of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what ſhe really was.</p>
            <p>Abſorbed in the profoundeſt meditations, ſhe unwittingly turned unto a wrong direction; the path was through a wood wild and perplexed, and ſhe vainly ſtrove to extricate herſelf.</p>
            <p>Unuſed to ſojourn alone, fears of dire nature encompaſſed her. She fled forwards with preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitation, the clearneſs of the atmoſphere chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſhe expected the violence of the impend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtorm would burſt on her unſheltered head.</p>
            <p>In this moment of diſmay her ſight was bleſſed with the view of a female gathering faggots.—Siſter, ſaid the panting Elfrida, flying to her, haſt thou the poſſibility of affording me refuge till the ſtorm is paſſed over?</p>
            <p>The female, whoſe back was to her, now haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily turned round, and by a ſtart ſeemed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs her aſtoniſhment at the object before her; nor was Elfrida's leſs. She was habited in the weeds of a pilgrim, but the coarſe guiſe had not the power to hide t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> beauties of her form; a
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:034525_0075_0FFE19F1C972F200"/>
gentle fire played in her dark eyes; the winning graces of truth and ſimplicity overſpread her face, while her colourleſs cheek, with a fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gile delicacy, ſeemed to declare her though in the firſt dawn of youth, the daughter of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction.</p>
            <p>Gentle lady, cried ſhe, in a ſweet voice, wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to the refuge I can afford you.</p>
            <p>She turned down a little ſheltered path which brought them to a kind of groteſque hut, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of unpoliſhed planks covered over at the top with the foliage of the foreſt.—Father, ſaid the ſtranger, entering firſt, you will not chide the chance which led hither this fair gueſt.</p>
            <p>Elfrida beheld a man of an emaciated though majeſtic form; a reſiſtleſs ſweetneſs was caſt over a countenance where care ſat deeply en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven; nor could the tear of pity be with-held on viewing thoſe white looks that ſeemed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a ſofter pillow than ſorrow for repoſe. A little boy ſtept on a bed of ruſhes on whoſe face the mildeſt beauties of his early ſtate were painted.</p>
            <p>The female recruited the fire with her ſmall bundle of freſh gathered faggots; involuntary ſighs broke from the Baroneſs—were thoſe deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate hands, ſhe cried, formed only for that rude office, ye Powers!—but who ſhall dare to murmur at the deſtiny of thy creatures?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="73" facs="unknown:034525_0076_0FFE19F350331070"/>
She was preſſed to partake of a vegetable feaſt. The old man expreſſed his ſurprize at her wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering in that loneſome foreſt unprotected. In her turn ſhe aſſured him that ſhe could not have ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed ſuch valuable inhabitants concealed in it, and that ſhe believed their days had not always rolled on in the obſcurity of retirement.</p>
            <p>And yet, lady, he replied, contentment often dwells in the boſom of obſcurity—though rude our ſtation yet virtue ſpreads a poliſh around. The bleak winds of winter often ſtrip us of cur leafy covering, but there is a ſoul to warm and ſupport. Lady, thou will perhaps wonder at an old man who avers he would not change this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable hut for many of the proudeſt palaces. The tortures too often incurred by a ſplendid ſtation would be a poor recompence for poverty united to quietneſs. Can the poſſeſſion, think you, of a neighbouring ſeat, known by the title of the Caſtle of Devon, aſſuage the guilty hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of its too beautiful miſtreſs.</p>
            <p>Ha! cried Elfrida, with irrepreſſable emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, then ſuddenly checking herſelf for fear of a diſcovery, I thought fame had given her an unſullied character.</p>
            <p>Alas! replied the old man, 'twas well the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Ordun and his Lady lived not to witneſs the declenſion of her worth; her virtues reſiſted not the aſſailments of vanity and ambition, and ſhe conſents to wed the murderer of Ethelwald.</p>

What ſayeſt thou, cried Elfrida?</p>
            <p>'Tis rumoured, anſwered he, that the Baron fell by the hands of Edgar in the foreſt of Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood: his deception perhaps merited ſome pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment, but not one of this barbarous nature—unhappy Ethelwald, thou fell like a towering pine of the foreſt in thy gayeſt prime, unmourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed too by thoſe moſt dear. Theſe eyes, which never beheld thee, weep thy fate; oh may the profligate Edgar, he continued, awfully raiſing his eyes, find every promiſed joy be blaſted; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>Elfrida in a moment comprehended the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and ſaw one whom the artifices of Edgar had undone.</p>
            <p>Thy emotions, he rejoined, have betrayed thee; yet am I miſtaken, looking at Elfrida, if contumely will ever proceed from thoſe lips; Thou indeed meriteſt no ſhame, the purity of thy ſoul is unſtained, and 'tis on Edgar alone its accumulation ſhould fall. Lady, 'tis true, we have not always been ſecluded in the boſom of this mean retirement. I ſhall not enumerate the name or valourous atchievements of my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitors; right noble was their lineage. I was early left an orphan, hereditary fires animated

A young baron, highly exalted, promiſed to patronize my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes; but, alas! his heart was faſcinated by the charms of my wife, and on her diſhonour the fabric of proſperity was to have riſen—oh! thought of horror and agony.

We fled from him who would have proved the ſerpent of our peace; but poverty was our weeping hand-maid, and Maud, like a flower blaſted, withered away. In her expiring mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſhe took the infant Elflida in her feeble arms—Spouſe of my heart, cried ſhe, Oh calm the laſt agony of Maude, and liſten to the adjura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her who dies for involving you in woe; let this fair bloſſom be devoted to the ſervice of her Creator, nor let her know ought of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies and depravities of life; within the pure and peaceful walls of a convent ſhe eſcapes the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits of the licentious, and with the calmneſs of happineſs walks forward to eternity.—She heard my ſolemn vows of compliance; a faint joy fluſhed over her cheek. 'twas the laſt ebb of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the ſeal of death was imprinted on her. With a ſacred enthuſiaſm I flew to execute her deſire; Elflida was borne by me to a convent whoſe ſuperior was a relation of mine, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived

               </gap> by painting the tedious years of ſorrow. Peace was an alien except at diſtant periods of viſiting my child. I beheld her grow up with all her mother's beauties; my heart felt a holy tranſport at the fair offering I had made my crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.—Supreme! I cried, many are the manſions in thy court; Oh may our little group yet meet even in the loweſt of them, and feel the beatitude of thy glory.—A ſevere diſtemper ſeized me, which confined me many months to my ſolitary home. Muſing one night on the conſtant ſubject of my thoughts, a wailing murmur ſtole upon my ears, and I beheld my child beſide me—wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and horror were caſt around her; vainly her out-ſtretched arms would have claſped me; her fixed eyes looked dimleſs on me. Elflida, I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed—no, her ſpectre, ſay how have thy ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred vows been broken? Why haſt thou left the convent walls?—The hand of violence—fits ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped her furthet utterance.—Oh, lady, I lived to hear the ſacrilegious Edgar had violated my child. Where, ye profeſſors of religion and virtue, where were the denunciations of thy wrath for this impious deed; alas! the regal power of the abandoned wicked wretch withheld thy coward tongues, and the vices of the ſovereign pallia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or burried by them in oblivion—Edgar, and his gay companions, from a frolic habited themſelves as pilgrims, and repairing to the convent ſolicited alms. Elflida was amongſt the
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:034525_0080_0FFE19FEED3B25B8"/>
daughters of piety who liſtened to the fictitious tale of diſtreſs; the unhallowed Edgar ſighed for the poſſeſſion of her charms; by violence ſhe was that night carried off to a palace ſome leagues diſtant; here Edgar, in his proper ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biliments, appeared and endeavoured to calm her fears. Lady, perhaps you know nature has adorned him with the moſt eſtimated of her gifts; Elflida found her terrors ſubſiding, yet ſolemnly vowed not to ſurvive the deprivation of honour.—Daughter of innocence, cried the accompliſhed villain, do you imagine I would lead thee into improper connections? no, the fond Edgar wooes thee to his arms by honourable methods. A private ceremony took place. El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flida was his victim. Yet, amidſt the bliſs ſhe imagined ſhe poſſeſſed, ſhe ſighed for me. At length the hour drew nigh in which, expecting to be a mother, ſhe beſought to preſerve her fame to be acknowledged.—Arrogant Elflida, exclaimed the enraged king, didſt thou imagine I would ſubmit to ſuch a bondage, or raiſe thee queen of my people? Preſumptuous girl! retire to thy father, the patron of wiſdom, he will toll thee ſuch folly is not to be found in the world.—I fled with the betrayed innocent to this loneſome ſpot; here the rightful heir of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland was born; a ſovereign's wife ſtooped to the loweſt offices.—Oh, lady, thou canſt not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if a parent's wrongs call down imprecations; I foreſee the period when his long catalogue of crimes ſhall he held to his view by the fiends of conſcience. Remorſe too ſhall ſeize Elfrida; her

charms fading through its influence ceaſe to pleaſe, the tottering diadem drop from her head, and the laſt branch of the houſe of Devon ſhall be held up to future ages a dire example of the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility of female ambition.—</p>
            <p>Oh, ſay not, cried the baroneſs, with wildneſs, the blaſts of heaven will thus fall upon me. I am the monſter you have curſed—I am Elfrida! She fell panting on the earth. I am weak, I am ill, will you not aſſiſt me.—Aſtoniſhment prevented their utterance.</p>
            <p>Old man continued ſhe, ſpringing up, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned ſtrength, thou haſt rouſed the dormant feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of remorſe; you raiſed a whirl wind in my breaſt; wilt thou refuſe to give it peace? Here ſtrike, let the daughter of Ordun periſh by thy hand, life is not to be borne.</p>
            <p>Alas! ſaid the old man to his weeping child, we are undone—this violence of paſſion is not the true fruit of repentance, and ſhe who cauſed the blood of an huſband to be ſhed will ſtrike a dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to Elflida's boſom and England's heir.</p>
            <p>What, cried Elfrida, diſengaging her hold, her eyes caſt up, am I that wretch, is guilt ſo ſtamped on my forehead? Oh! noble Ordun, thou liveſt not to hear thy offspring loaded with infamy: Am I that wretch that would raiſe the aſſaſſin's hand? but learn to know the height of that ſoul thou haſt wronged.—Liſten to my vow, continued ſhe, bending on her knees, that by

every thing ſacred, even by the murdered Ethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wald himſelf, I never will change my widowed ſtate, but with all the fervor of my power aid Elflida and her infant ſon.</p>
            <p>Lady, cried the old man, I have wronged thee; the right noble blood of Devon lodges in thy veins; for this may heaven ſhed its eaſe upon thy troubled mind, and the ſpirit of Ethelwald regard thee with the mildneſs of mercy.—While I, cried Elflida, thus lowly bending, promiſe to cheriſh my gartitude for her who will become the friend of Edgar's baniſhed wife.</p>
            <p>The good Norluff now accompanied Elfrida to the abbey, where the requiems were to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed for the ſouls of the departed.</p>
            <p>Elfrida was now diveſted of an oppreſſive weight; the conſciouſneſs of acting right diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a tranquility over her, and in thoſe many hours ſhe ſpent in Norluff's cottage ſhe was ſtrengthened by the conſolations of religion and arguments of reaſon. Here ſhe endeavoured to deviſe ſome project for reſtoring Elflida to her right.</p>
            <p>The expected moment of Edgar's arrival at laſt came, as announced; the mangled form of Ethelwald ſeemed to weep before her; her revolt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heart could ill ſupport her in diſſembling a welcome to his murderer, the inarticulate ſounds died away, and ſhe fainted in his arms eagerly opened to embrace her.</p>

The King was ſhocked at her confuſion; he ſtrove to aſſwage it, and apparently ſucceeded; no longer period would he allow to vain ſcruple or delays, and in two days his happineſs was to be completed.</p>
            <p>Early the deſtined morning they met in the great hall; Elfrida agreeable to the time covered with a long veil; Edgar ſeized her hand, that hand which had to lately ratified the youthful Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron's hopes.</p>
            <p>The prieſt proceeded to his office—the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction was pronounced—the impatient monarch ſnatched off the veil to ſalute his bride; what fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries flaſhed from his eyes when he beheld a face far different from Elfrida's, a face too well remembered.</p>
            <p>Oh! ſave me, cried Elflida, ſinking to the earth, oh! ſave me from his rage.</p>

ſpirit ſhall bend to ſupplications if Edgar will liſten to the voice of reaſon.—Chance, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the hand of Providence, conducted me to the cot where worth and ſilent injuries were concealed; could I violate the dear chaſtity that deſcended hereditarily from the nobleſt of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to me by uſurping another's rights? El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flida was thy betrothed, thy truly lawful wife—with her you will experience a reciprocal paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion—with me (her ſoul ſoftening by the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of Ethelwald's affection) thy joys muſt have been blaſted; let thy pride too, inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thee to forget the woman indifferent to thy love, make thee accept one repaying it with ardour; thy miſguided eye alone could find new beauties in me, for in what is not Elflida my equal?</p>
            <p>Edgar turned from her in a ſullen muſing. She continued—let the voice of nature aſſiſt my ſuplications. Here Bertha entered with the young Edward whom ſhe placed in her arms. Behold the babe of Elflida's affection, the ſmiling miniature of its ſire.</p>
            <p>Edgar was touched, his arms involuntarily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panding received the child, it liſped in his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

hands were preſſed on her boſom, her dark eyes were ſuffuſed in tears, and the paleneſs of deſpair reſted on her cheek. And can I by a word ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate this woman to primeval beauty?—he look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the Baroneſs—alas! grief was deſpoiling her of bloom, and her eyes had no longer radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to dazzle.</p>
            <p>Riſe, Elflida, cried he, till we acknowledge thee partner of our heart and realm.—She heard the extatic words, but they deprived her of the power of obeying them.</p>
            <p>Elfrida ran to her—riſe, Elflida, ſaid ſhe, noble even in thy ſorrows; riſe, acknowledged queen, and let the moſt affectionate of thy ſubjects pay thee her obeiſance.</p>
            <p>She was enfolded in the arms of Edgar, the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent and the child—unutterable emotions la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured in his breaſt, he felt the pure and native feelings of man; the ſweet glow of acting right, a luxury hitherto unknown, nor could he in that bliſsful hour refrain exclaiming,—to what joys have I been a ſtranger.</p>
            <p>The venerable Norluff now entered the hall; he knelt down in the midſt of it; he beſought heaven with uplifted hands and eyes to encircle with glory that woman who had redreſſed their injuries; he implored peace for her widowed days, and ſome portion of that balm ſhe miniſtered to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſo benignantly,—He was raiſed and ſaluted by the King.</p>

The retinue of Edgar now requeſted to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to their Queen. The bluſhing Elflida was preſented, and their loyal hearts dictated the ſincereſt congratulation. From her they tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the baroneſs; their plaudits broke forth for the nobleneſs of her conduct.</p>
            <p>A coſtly banquet was prepared—alas! how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like the feaſts once given in Devon caſtle, of joys departed never to return; the remembrance oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied Elfrida's mind; her guſhing tears, her wan cheek, diſturbed the reigning feſtivity, and called forth ten thouſand horrors within Edgar at the cruel deed he had prepetrated on the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Baron.</p>
            <p>She ſtole towards the cloſe of evening to the chapel, where the monument of her parents was erected; ſhe flung herſelf on the cold marble, and implored that power who witneſſed her ſelf exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, her return to propriety, to obliterate her errors.</p>
            <p>Here the laſt branch of the houſe of Doven mourned with ſad laments the viciſſitudes of life; poſſeſſed of ſufficient wealth to gratify the moſt extravagant deſires, ſhe was an example to the ambitious and the vain, that felicity cannot be purchaſed by a mere external ſtation—her ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ties were ſevered, and what could prove a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence.</p>
            <p>Say, ye children of ſenſibility, can the gifts of fortune yield comfort to your ſouls, if the bonds of death encloſe your moſt endeared connections</p>

human thought, could only tell. I am regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with horror, know I am not a phantom eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped from the regions of the dead; Edgar's dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger was not ſucceſsful; I endured exiſtence that I might render my puniſhment complete by the union of Edgar and Elfrida; that period is now arrived, and this dagger ſhall take a ſurer aim than Edgar's.</p>
            <p>The King, with a piercing cry, ruſhed on his uplifted arm—for this righteous heaven be prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, he ſaid, my hands are unſtained by the pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of his blood.</p>
            <p>Oh! ſpouſe of my ſoul, cried Elfrida, whoſe ſobs her painful exceſs of joy expreſſed while her feeble arms were ſtretched to him. He repulſed her with averted looks. Miſtaken Ethelwald, exclaimed the King, ſhe is true and loyal—be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold my bride.</p>
            <p>He gently diſengaged himſelf from Edgar. Daughter of Ordun I have wronged thee, he ſaid, a guſh of tears, tears of exquiſite joy burſt from him, and he ſunk upon her boſom.</p>
            <p>The aſtoniſhed, the affectionate domeſtics, ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed tumultuous in; they wept aloud, they kiſſed their robes, they bleſſed the almoſt miraculous re-union.</p>

To Him, he cried, whoſe ſhield was caſt over me, be the voice of thankſgiving and gratitude raiſed. Providence, Edgar, rendered thy blow unſucceſsful. The ſun was departing when I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gained my ſenſes; here in the bitterneſs of my ſoul I implored heaven to appeaſe the juſt reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my ſovereign by my death. A rude ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rol reſounded near me, and in a few moments I beheld a young peaſant who in my boyiſh days had often attended me in my ſports; diſmayed by my ghaſtly appearance he was retreating with horror, when my voice withheld him. He flew forward, he bent over me—the gay, the gallant Ethelwald thus mangled! I periſh, I cried—Oh, never, while I can ſuccour or aſſiſt. He left me with precipitation, and ſhortly returned with his mother, who helped to convey me to their cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. Henry offered to fly to my caſtle. Oh, ſtop thy raſhneſs! I exclaimed, would you ſink me in diſtruction; 'twas the moſt dear, the moſt eſteemed, that ſtruck; a delirium ſeized me, and with the wildneſs of ſorrow I divulged my ſecrets. The old woman applied healing herbs to my wound, and in their ſequeſtered cottage ſhe and the faithful Henry watched over me with unaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting tenderneſs; 'twas they, when reaſon retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, withheld my hand from terminating life; I ſometimes thought of ruſhing to my caſtle, of dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a willing victim at your feet; again, of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately ſeeking Elfrida, if conſtant, and eſcaping to foriegn ſhores. Henry was at laſt prevailed on to viſit the caſtle; there from the afflicted ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants he learned the Baroneſs had conſented to wed the King when the mourning period was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired.

The meaſure of Ethelwald's woes was now completed; I reſolved to endure life as a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for my crime till your union, then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire in your preſence.

Oh! who ſhall not acknowledge the benignancy of Heaven. Humbled to the duſt let the children of mortality adore that power whoſe rewards ſo infinitely exceed their deſerts.</p>

            <head>THE GENEROUS LADY.</head>
            <head>TRANSLATED FROM THE FRENCH.</head>
            <p>AN amiable young lady was one day walking with her little dog, on the banks of a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver which bordered on a delightful wood: and as ſhe was there muſing on the verdant turf, this little beaſt, which was rambling about, entered the wood, which he had no ſooner done than he ſet up a great cry, and returned ſeemingly terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied towards its miſtreſs. Eliza, (for this is the lady's name) paid ſcarce any attention to it at firſt; but finding it would not quit the place from which it inceſſantly came and returned bark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, her curioſity led her to ſee what occupied the attention of this little animal. She imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to be nothing of any moment, as it always returned without receiving the leaſt injury, and likewiſe that what ſeemed to concern it, appeared to be on one ſide the wood; the lady therefore went there to inform herſelf of the reaſon of it: but how great, how vaſt was her ſurprize, when ſhe ſaw behind a large buſh, a young cavalier ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

blood, which had dyed the adjacent turf: his face was pale, and disfigured, ſeeming ſtill deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to conclude its unfiniſhed ſpeech. At this ſo horrible a ſpectable, the hairs of Eliza's head ſtood on end; her legs failed her, and being ſeized with a cold ſweat, had almoſt dropped into a ſwoon. But the firſt emotions being paſt, and the lady returning to herſelf, ſhe conjectured it might be ſome one that had been attacked by thieves, and who in his preſent condition, ſtood in need of immediate aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>Reſuming freſh courage, ſhe approached the wounded perſon, and ſpoke to him: but alas! he had neither ears to hear, nor eyes to ſee. Eliza, therefore, judged it expedient to haſten all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſuccour. She therefore began ſearching for the wounds, in order to bind them as well as ſhe could, and ſtop the blood which proceeded from them. One was on the cheſt, one on the right breaſt, and one on the left thigh, from the latter of which ran a greater quantity of blood than from the two others. As her handkerchief, and that of the cavalier's, were only ſufficient to bind two of them, ſhe was obliged to tear her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> dreſs for the third, as her gown, which was of ſilk embroidered with gold would have inflamed them.</p>
            <p>After ſhe had done this, ſhe went in ſearch of ſome one, to carry the wounded perſon to her caſtle; and luckily, in her way ſhe met with two men and a woman, who were going to a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:034525_0093_0FFE1A2563CE4E38"/>
village. She immediately called to them, and having related what ſhe had ſeen, ſhe ſent the woman to her caſtle, to deſire the ſervants to go in immediate ſearch of ſome phyſicians and ſurgeons in different places. She then returned with the two men to the cavalier, that they might bring him away without delay. Fortunately one of them had an empty ſack with him, ſo that by cutting two ſtrong poles, which was paſſed through it, they made a very convenient litter. They cavalier was placed thereon, and carried gently to the caſtle, where the lady, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied him, ordered him to be put in her own bed, her chamber being nearer than either of the others. As the ſurgeons were not as yet arrived, ſhe gave ſome cordials to this unhappy man, who began to ſhow ſome ſigns of life.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs the cavalier was as yet inſenſible. Eliza having a deſire to know the name and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of this new hoſt, ſhe ſearched his pockets, to ſee whether ſhe could find any papers or letters which might inform her in ſome degree who he was. There were ſome for different perſons at Paris; but as they were all ſealed, ſhe did not chuſe to open them, as ſhe would rather have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in ſuſpence, than to have done it; but in a ſhort time, ſhe found in another place two pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, which were not ſealed, the one was direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for a particular road, and the other a bill of exchange, addreſſed to a banker at Paris; in the latter of which ſhe learned that the name of the young cavalier was Alvar, and that he came from Germany.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="91" facs="unknown:034525_0094_0FFE1A2990E71A48"/>
Some time after the phyſicians and ſurgeons ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, they examined and probed the wounds, and unanimouſly agreed that they were not dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous; which gave inexpreſſible joy to the lady. She deſired a phyſician and ſurgeon to ſtay; ſhe treated them generouſly, and begged them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peatedly to pay every poſſible attention to the young cavalier. As the loſs of blood was the only occaſion of his weakneſs, they made no doubt but they ſhould ſoon be able to recover the ſtrength he had loſt. And indeed the were right, for the prudence of the phyſician, the ſkill of the ſurgeon, reſt, and good nouriſhment, re-eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the cavalier in leſs than five days. The lady over-joyed to ſee that her great care for Alvar would be the means of her reſtoring him to his life, frequently came with extreme anxiety to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigate as much as ſhe poſſibly could, the ſtate which he was in. She related nothing but what was agreeable during his illneſs, and cauſed vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and inſtrumental muſic to be played before him, which greatly aſſiſted his ſpirits. As ſoon as he was able to eat, ſhe ordered the table to be placed by his bed-ſide, and two of her compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, with the phyſician and ſurgeon to keep him company. But it is very remarkable, that the lady never aſked the cavalier, how it had happened he was ſo ill-treated. It was now ſix weeks ſince the fatal day of his misfortune, when Eliza, who was in the parlour with Alvar (and whom ſhe knew to be well enough not to fear a relapſe,) aſked how, and by what means he had been ſo barbarouſly treated: Alvar began thus:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="92" facs="unknown:034525_0095_0FFE1A2B179CCCC0"/>
"This accident, ſays he, "is in conſequence of an adventure that befel me at Cologne, and which has been the occaſion of my quitting that pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ce for ever." Eliza would not aſk him what that adventure was; but Alvar, perceiving it was only through politeneſs, explained himſelf, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing thus: "This adventure, Madam, is by no means unworthy your curioſity, and though it calls ſad ideas to my mind, it is nevertheleſs highly neceſſary that I ſhould often think of it, as it is the ſubject of my conſolation. I was," added he "in love with one of the firſt, and, without flattery, the moſt amiable young lady in Germany. I was prefered before all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Judge yourſelf my inexpreſſible hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs! ſhe was granted me; they looked upon me not as her lover but as their ſon. One day as I was in the country, walking in a little park, I heard ſome one ſpeaking in a low voice to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and as I approached nearer behind a thick buſh, I heard very diſtinctly theſe words. "No; I tell you, as long as love ſhall favour us, aſſure that I will never marry Alvar; neither will I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to be his wife, unleſs you abandon me." Gueſs, Madam, my aſtoniſhment, and how much it was augmented, when I perceived that an in famous valet was the Medor, of this angel; and that whilſt ſhe was ſpeaking to him in this ſtrain, her head was reclined on him, and her boſom polluted with the hand of this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> wretch. I cannot deſcribe my feelings; I experinced every thing that rage could inflict the moſt cruel on me
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:034525_0096_0FFE1A2CAA99DE58"/>
I ſat down on the graſs, and heard my perfidious love repeat, with a thouſand oaths, that ſhe would forever adore this monſter, even in caſe her lot ſhould oblige her to be another's. This valet exhorted her not to break them: and, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having ſpoken in ill terms of me, he kiſſed her inceſſantly. I was not able to contain the rage I was in. I cried out, O! perfidious wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es: and drawing my ſword, ruſhed into the wood, the entrance was on the other ſide, the curſed valet had time to make his eſcape; and as for my traitreſs, I neither deigned either to ſtab or ſpeak to her.</p>
            <p>I then mounted my horſe (for her father's ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles were cloſe by), and returned to the city, informing the maſter of the houſe, that I was not well. My countenance made it viſible to every one; when I arrived at Cologne I went to bed; but the deſpair and grief that agitated my heart, would not permit me to remain there, I ſoon aroſe again, remounted my horſe, and went out of the city attended only by one ſervant, and travelled without knowing whither I was going; till be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing worn out with laſſitude and ſorrow, I arrived at a vallage, whoſe name I have forgot, and went to bed, without eating or drinking. As ſoon as I laid down I ſhed a flood of tears, when ſleep ſurpriſed me in that ſtate; but it continued but a very ſhort time, for being interrupted by ſudden agitations and ghaſtly dreams, the image of my misfortunes preſented itſelf before me, and awaked me immediately. I was neither fatigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or weakened, I felt nothing but ſadneſs and
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:034525_0097_0FFE1A2F88C018D8"/>

               </gap>, that my life was greatly deſpaired of. When I began to grow better, I received a letter from the father of my traitreſs. "I am not ſurpriſed at your proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing," ſays he to me, "that I do not know what to think of you, in granting you my daughter, I ſhould never have expected to have been treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this manner. Juſtify your conduct to me, and know with whom you have to deal." This letter threw me into a great embarraſſment. The reſpect which I always had for the father of this unworthy girl, and that friendſhip joined to the eſteem, which we ſhould always ſhew for the ſex, made me extremely uneaſy, as I knew not how to juſtify myſelf, without diſcovering to him the infamy of this deteſtable woman. For ſome days, as I was conſidering an anſwer, two cavaliers from Cologne arrived at Aix la Chapelle. They came after me, told me, that I was not ignorant that they had been the lovers of Chione (for that was the name of my traitreſs); they added that they came to revenge her, and to be revenged themſelves, for the contempt which I had ſhewn her, after having been preferred before all my rivals. "What kind of revenge do you deſire?" ſaid I to them: "will you aſſaſſinate me here, or will you fight any where elſe like brave men?" "We will," anſwered they, "meet you with ſword and piſtol, when and where you pleaſe."</p>
            <p>Well, gentlemen," ſaid I, "you will find me

to-morrow morning at three o'clock, at the back of the city, where he who ſhall be conquerer, ſhall eſcape where he thinks proper. They ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted the offer; and the pleaſure I felt in being killed or revenged of my rivals, for the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of my traitreſs ſeemed to inſtill into me ſo much bodily ſtrength, that I forgot that I had been ill.</p>
            <p>The time being come they drew lots, which of them ſhould engage firſt; for the worthy perſon, for whom they came to find me, was to be given in marriage to him who ſhould kill me. The firſt conteſt was with the ſword, and I had the happineſs to give ſuch a ſtroke to my enemy, that he fell as though dead on the ground. The ſecond was with piſtol, when my other enemy did not fare much better; I broke his left ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the ball entering towards the breaſt, and, to complete his misfortune, the horſe miſſing his bridle, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

ſcrivener had antedated by ſix days by reaſon of my giving a few crowns extraordinary. My friend made ſo good uſe of it, that all my eſtates were ſecured two days after he had received my letters. As for me I left Aix la Chapelle, after having taken the meaſures which we thought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to keep both him and myſelf from trial, and from that time I never have known what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came of my two rivals.</p>
            <p>I went to another of my friends, which was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> days journey from Aix la Chapelle; I remained there incognito for ſome time, where I was ſo oppreſſed with grief, that it rendered me like one ſtupid. At laſt, I embraced this faithful friend, and ſhed in his boſom a flood of tears, without his being able to get any thing more from me. I ſoon after ſet out for France, and went diſguiſed through bye-roads (for notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding my precaution, the affair was diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed), when one evening I arrived at a tavern, where I refreſhed myſelf a little, and joined in converſation with the landlady, who, though ſhe was a little ſwarthy, knew very well how to draw people in. As ſhe was a fat merry dame, and one who ſeemed to know how to fell her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, I endeavoured but in vain to eaſe my mind, by diſcourſing with her. In the interim, my ſervant going to the ſtable, overheard two men talking, when one whiſpered to the other, and ſaid, "was not that him?" And as ſoon as he went in, they followed after. He obſerved without ſeeming to take any notice, that they examined him in ſeveral things, and he did not
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:034525_0100_0FFE1A381EDC5460"/>
doubt but it concerned me, for which reaſon he came and informed me of it. I immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered of the means to avoid the ſnares that were laid for me. My valet entruſted a maid-ſervant with the whole affair, and ſhe promiſed us we ſhould get away ſafe, and have a guide to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct us to Limberg. She kept her word, for ſhe had previouſly ſent the horſes and guide, to the end of a bye lane, where ſhe conducted us. I ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at that town, and made three days ſtay; and the fourth, as I was going out on ſome poſt horſes, my ſervant ſaw the very ſame men he had ſeen in the ſtable; he came and informed me of it. About the middle of the day, I alighted at an inn, and went to ſleep in a pleaſant orchard, cloſe by the road ſide; when I awaked I ſaw four men well mounted armed, two of whom ſeemed to be the ſervants of the others, and they appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be the men in queſtion. I thought at firſt they were going to diſmount at the ſame inn, and by that means I could view them the better, but they perſiſted in their journey. From this place I went to Cambray, to ſee an aunt, where I ſtaid two days, and the third I mounted my horſe, and came to Rheims, where I remained a whole day; during which time my ſervant ſaw theſe four ſneaking fellows again, of whom I have juſt been ſpeaking: he told me of it, but I did not believe him; and leaving that town I ſet out for Meaux, where I have an uncle; and in paſſing through the wood where you found me, I ſaw theſe envious cowards diſcharge their piſtols at me.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="98" facs="unknown:034525_0101_0FFE1A3DA82F3B40"/>
Two of them fired without ſpeaking a ſingle word. One wounded me on the cheſt, the other miſſed me. My ſervant was ſo frightened, that he made off with all ſpeed; when I was immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ſurrounded by four men. I laid hold of my piſtol, and making to one of the four with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to be revenged at leaſt of him, for the cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardice of his gang; but I had no ſooner fired than my horſe threw me, and having daſhed me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a tree, I felt ſuch a terrible pain in my ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, that I fell proſtrate to the ground. I had nevertheleſs ſtrength enough to get up again, and poſt myſelf againſt a tree, near the place where you found me. Then the perſon at whom I had fired deſired the others not to meddle with me, ſaying, that he alone would ſhew them the merits of each of them. The villain ſaw that my life was at his pleaſure, he came to me ſword in hand; I parried ſome thruſts which was all I could do, at laſt I received one on my thigh, and I fell. The outrageous man immediately leapt on me; put one of his feet on my breaſt, and laid hold of my wriſt with both his hands, in which I held my ſword, and took it from me, uſing at the ſame time the moſt abuſive language; he then took off the ring which I had on my little finger, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had got it (for I had not power to ſpeak) he ran my own ſword into my body, ſaying, "know that I am James, the lover of Chione."—I can aſſure you, madam, continued Alvar, that notwithſtanding the condition I was in, I made this reflection, that ſuch a lover was well worthy ſuch a traitreſs. After this I know not what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came of my aſſaſſins, or of myſelf; and I moſt

certainly ſhould never have ſeen the light, had not your great and unwearied care for me reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red me to life."</p>
            <p>When Alvar had finiſhed this adventure, he caſt his eyes on Eliza, and perceived that thoſe of that generous lady were bathed with tears, and that her face was full of fire. "No one can feel," ſaid ſhe, "more indignation than I have at the recital of your misfortunes; but you will not be leſs ſurpriſed, Sir, than I have been, when I tell you that there has happened to me an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, very ſimilar to what you have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating. I will give you a faithful narrative of it: the more I think of it the more I am ſurpriſed at the reſemblance.</p>
            <p>I was born at Blois, of a rich and ancient fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. I loſt my father and mother before I attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thirteen years of age; and was entruſted to the care of an uncle, who was as fond of me as of his own child. I was in my eighteenth year, when the nephew of one of the greateſt noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in Germany, came, with his uncle into France, to an eſtate which bordered upon that which my father had left me. I was there at the time with my uncle. The vicinity of our habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, having given the young nobleman (whoſe name was Beraldus) frequent opportunities of converſing with me, I ſoon gained his affection; and his uncle alſo was ſo fond of me that he wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me for his niece. He ſpoke to mine, who received the propoſal with the utmoſt pleaſure. I was informed of it, and as Cupid's darts had
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:034525_0103_0FFE1A4209960290"/>
already pierced me, my conſent was readily granted. The time was almoſt come, when the marriage was to be conſummated. The uncle of my intended huſband was gone to take a ſhort voyage, and we only waited his return.</p>
            <p>As I was one evening in my chamber, reading the nineteenth book of Telemachus, I heard Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raldus coming up; I immediately hid myſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the curtain in order to diſquiet him. He came in, looked about, and not ſeeing me, aſked the chamber-maid (who came up with him) where I was, ſhe told him ſhe thought I was in the arbor in the garden. "There let her ſtay, (ſaid he)—my dear Martina, let us profit by a happy moment, which Heaven has ſent us; come my deareſt life! into the arms of a man who love and adores you more than any one elſe in the world." He was going to place her on his knee, when ſhe ſeated herſelf by him, and began to reproach him for the manner in which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted himſelf towards me, and for attending too much to the things which concerned me; for caſting his attractive eyes too often on me, and that the day before, he had eat an orange which I had peeled, though ſhe had forbid him to do it: "You know (ſaid ſhe) what I have done for you, and the condition into which I am brought, for having loved you too much; I have ruined myſelf and you alſo." When ſhe had ſaid this ſhe wept: and Beraldus throwing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at her feet extricated himſelf as well as he could, from the reproaches ſhe had caſt on him. He kiſſed her feet a thouſand times, and ſwore,
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:034525_0104_0FFE1A439494FF48"/>
with execrable oaths, that he, from his ſoul, loved her infinitely better than he did me; and that was he his own maſter, he would marry her in ſpite of every thing: but he was grieved to think it was his misfortune, to depend on an uncle whom he durſt not contradict, who had already thought of making him marry a perſon whom he hated to the greateſt degree, and that it was to avoid ſuch a lot, that he determined to marry me, as he had no great averſion to it: "For though I may have loved her, (ſaid he) yet you may aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure yourſelf, I ſhall no more." He promiſed to give her evident marks of it when he had marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, as he ſhould then be maſter, and that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ſhe might reſt aſſured ſhe ſhould be his greateſt favorite.</p>
            <p>After all this excellent diſcourſe, Beraldus clung round Martina's neck, and after having comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf anew with uninterupted kiſſes, and freſh proteſtations of love, he carried her to a couch. As I was not able to withſtand ſuch a ſcene, I made a ruſtling behind the curtain, which Beraldus no ſooner heard, than he took flight; but the coquette had the aſſurance to come and look, and, upon ſeeing me, endeavoured to ſtrike me with a dagger, which ſhe had with her, but I parried the blow, and ſhe immediat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly ſwooned away. I took the poignard from her, hid it, and called ſome women to carry her out of my room, and take care of her. But ſhe eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in the night, without my ever knowing what became of her after. As for my part, after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:034525_0105_0FFE1A4919F26138"/>
well weighed the affair, I thought it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary my uncle ſhould know it. You may judge his ſurprize when I told him of it; but I cannot deſcribe to you his indignation. Old as he was, he mounted his horſe, and went in ſearch of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raldus, but, luckily for him, he was not to be found. The next day my uncle wrote to his ſon, who was at Paris, to repair to him immediately, to go with him to demand reparation for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults he had made me, if the uncle of my traitor, at his return, did not give him ſufficient reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>During the time that Beraldus was at his uncle's, he had learnt, and was acquainted with the manners and cuſtoms of our houſe: he knew my uncle ſlept ſeveral hours about noon, and that moſt of the family did the ſame, except myſelf, who went generally into a little bower, which was ſituated at the farther part of the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, to keep me from ſleeping, and likewiſe the heat. As I was one day there, occupied with reading the life of a ſacred perſonage, I was ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly ſurprized by two men maſked, who imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately laid hold of me, and ſtopt my mouth with a handkerchief, covered my body with a cloak, and carried me over a low wall, where they had placed a ladder on each ſide. They put me in a coach and four, and drove me off, accompanied by two other men on horſeback. I endeavoured to cry out, but they paid no regard to it; for the horſes went full ſpeed till we came to a kind of wood, which was about three leagues from my houſe, where there were relays; and ſoon after
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:034525_0106_0FFE1A4A9E0D8AE0"/>
they were put in, one of the men, unmaſked him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and I perceived it was Beraldus. I was not at all ſurprized at it, for I thought on my way, that he was the author of this cruel action. The villain looked at me obliquily, and with as much impudence as though I had been a proſtitute, with whom he wanted to divert himſelf; and thoſe looks made my whole body tremble, for the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers which I expected to encounter. After ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving looked at me ſome time without ſaying any thing, he was going to ſpeak, but he knew not how, or where to begin. However, with a great deal of difficulty, he very coolly aſked par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for what he had done, and making but a bungling preamble, made me underſtand that it was merely for want of opportunity, that he did not explain himſelf more fully to me. I made no reply. He then aſſured me that every reſpect poſſible ſhould be paid me, and that I ſhould be as ſecure where they ſhould conduct me, as in my own houſe: that by marrying me, he made no doubt but he ſhould ſatisfy me of the regard he always had for me, and afterwards, he would let me ſee, by the moſt inviolable friendſhip, and the greateſt ſubmiſſion, that he wiſhed nothing ſo ardently, as to repair the faults for which he had given me ſo juſt reaſon to be incenſed againſt him, I told him that his conduct in its preſent ſituation, might, in part, remove the bad opinion I enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained of him; but as for marrying him, that ſhould never come to paſs, though it was at his pleaſure to ſave, or take away my life, which<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſuited him beſt. "You will ſoon change
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:034525_0107_0FFE1A4D7AA3AC48"/>
your mind," replied he. "No," replied I, "I never ſhall."</p>
            <p>After having travelled the remainder of the day, and part of the night, we came to an anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent caſtle, which had no other building near it, where there was a woman, whoſe features old age had ſhrivelled up, of an olive-coloured complex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, a curved and ſharp pointed chin, an aquiline noſe hung over her mouth, and fine red purple eyes; ſhe had a daughter who appeared to be as old as herſelf, and I am ſure as ugly. They gave me a very friendly reception; and it was at that time (and not before) that I ſaw all the perſons that came with me: there were two of Beral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus's friends, and the ſon of the old woman I have juſt been ſpeaking of.</p>
            <p>They led me into a room, which ſmelt ſo ſtrong of herbs, that it was enough to turn any body's brains; there were ſcarce any chairs one could ſit on; the wall was full of chinks, though it was the beſt room in the houſe, and the beſt furniſhed. On one ſide of this, I ſaw another, which I imagined was allotted for Beraldus; I was not miſtaken. But notwithſtanding the condition I was in, I reſolved to arm myſelf with courage, and to be revenged, though at the expence of my life. Fortunately I happened to have the dagger I took from Martina.</p>
            <p>They brought me chocolate, tea, coffee, ſweetmeats, and excellent wines; all which I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="105" facs="unknown:034525_0108_0FFE1A4F062FC550"/>
I ſhall paſs in ſilence the exhortation which the old woman, her daughter, Beraldus, and his friends, made me, to determine me to marry him.</p>
            <p>A ſly prieſt was alſo amongſt them, who find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it in vain to talk to me, had the impertinence to ſay, "that if he was in Beraldus's place, he would ſoon find out a method of obliging me: "think where you are," ſaid he, "and do not force us to uſe violence, when we wiſh to treat you with lenity."</p>
            <p>Theſe words were as a prediction of what was to happen, and which really did. I had often times a mind to ſtab myſelf, in order to avoid violence, which I ſo much dreaded, and which I expected would be uſed. After having ſhed a torrent of tears, and ſent my prayer to Heaven, I opened my boſom, and after having put the point of the dagger to it, I was going to pierce my heart, that I might rid myſelf of the trouble I was in, and the danger to which I was expoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: but a divine hand had ſtopped me and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented we from committing ſuch a raſh action. At the ſame time, I regretted having hindered Martina from putting an end to my life. As I could ſleep neither night or day, it brought me ſo low that I dreaded as much again the ſight of the barbarous Beraldus.</p>
            <p>As I was one day praying to Heaven with great fervency, and with many tears, to deliver me from the wretched ſituation. I was in, and that I might not be the occaſion of grief and
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:034525_0109_0FFE1A548767D408"/>
ſhame to my family, Beraldus came in: his eyes ſoon informed me of the wickedneſs of his heart; and ſeeing the confuſion I was in, he immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly took advantage of it, telling me, without the leaſt ceremony, "that if I made the leaſt reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> proproſals, he was determined to ſpare nothing;" and was going, at that very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to carry himſelf to the laſt extremity. I was ready to faint away; but Heaven furniſhed me with ſurpizing vigour. I looked at my trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous villain with ſo much indignation, that he was obliged to keep his eyes on the ground. Nevertheleſs, he had the aſſurance to lay hold of me, and being in great rage, he carried me up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the bed; but while he was ſeeking to diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour me, I diſengaged one of my hands, and having dexterouſly armed it with my poniard, I pierced his back ſo ſuddenly, that it penetrated his heart; I have ſtill the dagger by me ſtained with the blood of my traitor, and which I will one day ſhow you.</p>
            <p>"How rejoiced I am," ſaid Alvar, "but what became of you afterwards?"</p>
            <p>Having thus murdered him, I went to the head of the ſtairs, to liſten if I could hear any thing; I went down without meeting with any body, and renewing my courage, I haſtened in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a craggy and dry road, which the ſun imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately darted its rays on. I expected to find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body here; but after going three hundred yards, I met a countryman, who was as ſurprized at ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me, as I was ſorry to ſee him. After h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

paſſed me, he turned about ſeveral times to look at me, and as he was going towards the caſtle, I made no doubt but he would relate what he had ſeen. In this thought I called to him. "You appear to be a good ſort of a man," ſaid I, "pray will you do me a ſervice?" "With all my heart," ſaid her "Where are you going?" replyed I; "I am going to the caſtle, ſaid he, to fetch ſome nets for ſome gentlemen who are fiſhing at the end of this road." "Well, my friend, ſaid I, "if you will conduct me ſecretly to a town which I ſhall name to you, here is a purſe of gold which I will give you; but you muſt come immediately." The poor countryman, who had never ſeen ſo much money in all his life, was tranſported with joy: "Very willingly," ſaid he, "but let me go home and fetch my mule, which you ſhall ride on, and afterwards I will go with you to Rome." "Can<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

               </gap> by St. Peter, (for he is my protector, and that of our pariſh alſo), I hope not to live another hour if I do not come and take you away immediately. I muſt let my wife know that I muſt leave her for a little while." "Where is your houſe?" ſaid I: "It is near the river," anſwered he; "I ſhall take my mule, and ſend my ſon to carry the nets to the gentlemen; and without making any ſtop, I will return to you" I gave him ſome du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cats for his wife, and told him; that he muſt go, and return as ſoon as poſſible; that I ſhould go and ſit in the ſhady part of the road." The poor
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:034525_0111_0FFE1A57939DE190"/>
man flew like lightning: I repoſed myſelf a little in the place I had marked to him. What elſe could I do? I could not ſtop him; and if I had not put confidence in him, I ſhould certainly have been betrayed. After I had ſtayed here a little while, I quitted it, and went even out of the road, upon a riſing ground, from whence I diſcoverd a houſe, which I imagined to be the countryman's. It was a little time after I had been on this emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, I ſaw a man on a mule coming from the houſe, and this was the perſon I ardently wiſhed for. He came with all ſpeed, and, as ſoon as he had joined me, I got his mule, and told him he muſt conduct me on one ſide of Blois, through bye roads, that I might not be diſcovered: and when we had paſſed through a few fields, I told him more abſolutely, the name of the place I wanted to go to: and he promiſed me I ſhould be there before eight o'clock in the morning.</p>
            <p>What was my joy when on the mule? and how much muſt it be increaſed, when I was within ſight of my own houſe, which you yourſelf may ſuppoſe, after all the dangers I had met with, and the misfortunes I had undergone!</p>
            <p>As ſoon as I reached home, I flew into my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle's room; but his countenance, far from ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the leaſt marks of joy, repreſented to me a mournful ſadneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="109" facs="unknown:034525_0112_0FFE1A5A980DCE70"/>
"Has nothing happened to you?" ſaid he. "Nothing," ſaid I, "which can render me unworthy of you." The good man threw himſelf round my neck, ſhedding tears of joy, calling me repeatedly, his deareſt niece. Soon after I related to him the whole of my adventure. He then told me what he had done to find out what was become of me: and whilſt we were in the moſt affectioned emotions, Beraldus's uncle came in; he was juſt returned from his voyage, and knew nothing of his nephew's conduct. My uncle deſired me to relate it.</p>
            <p>He paid ſuch attention to it, that it was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther interrupted by ſpeaking, or by the leaſt geſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; except when I came to the death of his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew; I wanted to explain to him the reaſons which had actuated me to it. He told me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late it ſimply; as he was only ſorry at his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo eaſy a death: for had he been alive (as he wiſhed he had), he ſhould have expiated his crime with the greateſt torments.</p>
            <p>After I had related every thing, he aſked my pardon, and alſo my uncle's, for all that had happened to me. He deſired to know what other ſatisfaction we required; and aſſured me, that he looked upon the affair in the ſame light as if it had been done to his own daughter.</p>
            <p>He afterwards had a pen and ink, and with drew into another room, to-write to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of Blois, to deſire him to give preciſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:034525_0113_0FFE1A601593F0E8"/>
for all thoſe perſons who favoured the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize of the infamous Beraldus, to be immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly arreſted.</p>
            <p>The governor; who took care not to diſoblige ſo great a nobleman, gave ſuch ſtrict orders, that all the villains were taken, as well as the old wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and her daughter, put into priſon, and part of them hanged. The prieſt himſelf was taken, and ſent to his biſhop, who puniſhed him ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely.</p>
            <p>My uncle ſet out a few days after for Verſailles, to aſk my pardon of the king, which he did in the preſence of the queen. This amiable prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs condeſcended to ſay, that if the king par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned me, ſhe would beſtow on me her greateſt encomiums, and likewiſe a mark of her eſteem; giving my uncle at the ſame time a ring, which ſhe took off her royal hand, ſhe deſired he would preſent me with. Here it is, ſaid Eliza, ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it Alvar. He looked at it, but his eyes were more fixed upon her hand, which, till then, had only beheld in the lovely Eliza, a benefactreſs; but now began to ſee an amiable perſon. The reſemblance of their adventures, had awakened his imagination: thoſe eyes which were ſtill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dewed with tears, and that fire which he had obſerved in Eliza, had made a great impreſſion on him. In fine, this converſation produced the moment in which that pleaſing ſympathy was to diſplay itſelf, which unites, better than any thing, two bodies which are made to love one another.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="111" facs="unknown:034525_0114_0FFE1A619B3CBF70"/>
I paſs by the reſt of Eliza's adventure, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated in what manner ſhe was ſent for to court by the queen, after having obtained her pardon; but as ſhe was ill, it ſerved as an excuſe for her not going. Soon after, having ſold all her eſtate to her firſt couſin, after her uncle's death, ſhe retir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a great ſum of money into a convent; but being tired with the fooliſhneſs of the nuns, and hearing there was an eſtate to be ſold in the neighbourhood of Meaux, ſhe bought it. "And I am very glad I have it," ſaid ſhe, looking at Alver, "ſince it has been the means of my doing you a ſervice." They were then interrupted by ſome perſons coming in, which was diſagreeable to neither, as they were both at a loſs what to ſay more.</p>
            <p>Eliza ſoon after Alver had been at her houſe, had conceived a paſſion for him which was daily increaſing, and which ſhe was afraid he would perceive; and Alvar was in the ſame ſituation. For as he not only ſaw in her his benefactreſs, but a woman of the greateſt virtue and the moſt amiable qualifications, he found it was not in his power to ſtifle a paſſion he was no longer maſter of. What! ſaid he to himſelf, am I then born to be the continual victim of love? Into what misfortunes has it thrown me? Scarce am I ſaved from ſhipwreck, but I am thinking to reimbark? But after having well weighed theſe paſt reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the merit, the virtue, the beauty, the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and the generoſity of Eliza, preſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to him. How can he refuſe her eſteem, accompanied with ſo many excellent qualities?
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:034525_0115_0FFE1A6322758880"/>
how happy would he have been, had they been placed in Chione, nothing could have equalled his felicity? but ſince he has found them in Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za, who has alſo inſpired him with ſentiments of tenderneſs, why ſhould he oppoſe a love which may cauſe the happineſs of his life, and ſerve as a recompence for what he has already endured? The ſimilitude of their adventures, and his life ſaved by the cares of this amiable lady, is not all this (I ſay) a mark that heaven has deſigned them, the one for the other?</p>
            <p>Theſe are the reaſonings which Alvar's good-ſenſe and gratitude ſuggeſted, and thoſe reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings increaſed his tenderneſs greatly. Still he had determined to make Eliza believe he was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to leave her, and early the next morning he went into her room to ſound her upon it, telling her "that he thanked her for the many favors ſhe had conferred on him, and to aſk her permiſſion <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o continue his travels?" Eliza giving Alvar a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chevious, though tender look, anſwered him, ſmiling, "Surely you are in a great hurry! do you think that after being here ſo long a time <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ill, we are not to have the pleaſure of your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany now you are well? No, no, Sir, I am ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible you are too polite to leave us ſo ſoon." "Ah!" ſaid Alvar, caſting a piercing glance on Eliza—"What," replied Eliza, "you ſeriouſly intend to leave us?" "No, Madam, anſwered he, falling at her knees, and embracing them tenderly, "no, I will never be ſeparated from you, my life ſhall be entirely devoted to you, for my heart is not able to teſtify ſo much as you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:034525_0116_0FFE1A674FFFF668"/>
the love I bear you. I adore you, and if you will accept of me, ſuch as I am, I ſhall eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teem myſelf the happieſt of men." Eliza then ſeating herſelf on a ſofa, ſaid, "I have ſhewn you too much already, to prevent me from concealing the reſt. I have a great regard for you, and the deſire, I have to be your's is too ſtrong to reſiſt: is heaven ſtill laying ſnares for freſh misfortunes? I hope not; but if it is, I love you too much not to run the riſk of it: eſteem the freedom I have taken in declaring my ſentiments to you, by a natural confeſſion: time will let you ſee, that to the purity of my inclinations there is joined a conſtancy and chaſtity, which nothing can change; ſo I ſhall make your happineſs, provided you know how to enjoy it."</p>
            <p>One would have in writing all that they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to each other, to expreſs what they ſaid, tender, ſweet, and pleaſing; as for me, I cannot deſcribe all the affection, or joy, which diffuſed itſelf through their ſouls: I can neither repreſent to you thoſe looks, thoſe airs, and thoſe ſweet eyes, which ſpeak better than words can expreſs, and which a perfect and happy love alone, knows how to ſpread itſelf on thoſe it inflames; whoever has thoroughly loved, will eaſily conceive it: but nothing can inform the others.</p>
            <p>They were married ſoon after; he went to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris to receive his money, and they now live in the ſweeteſt harmony in the world, the more they know each other the more they love one another; and Eliza has given to her happy ſpouſe, the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt children in the univerſe, as the fruit of their marriage.</p>

            <p>M. De Curſol returned one day from taking a ride round his grounds. As he paſſed by the wall of a burying-place, adjoining a ſmall village, he heard ſome groans which ſeemed to come from that quarter. This worthy gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man had too tender a heart to heſitate one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to fly to the aſſiſtance of the unhappy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who ſeemed to be in diſtreſs. He inſtantly alighted, gave his horſe to the ſervant who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended him, and at one leap ſprung over the wall of the burying-place. Standing on his tip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toes he looked every where about him, and at laſt perceived in the farther corner a grave which ſeemed to have been lately covered with earth. Upon this grave was ſtretched a boy, about five years of age, who wept bitterly. M. de Curſol came up to him, with an air of tenderneſs, and ſaid to him, what are you about there, my little friend?</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>The Child.</speaker>
               <p>—I am calling upon my mother. They laid her here yeſterday, and ſhe don't riſe again.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>M. de Curſol.</speaker>
               <p>—It is probable that ſhe is dead, my poor child.</p>

               <speaker>The Child.</speaker>
               <p>—Yes, they ſay that ſhe is dead; but I cannot believe it. She was in good health the other day, when ſhe left me with our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Suſan! She told me that ſhe would come back again, and ſhe has not done ſo, My father and little brother are going, and the other chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the village will have nothing to do with me.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M. De Curſol.</speaker>
               <p>—They will have nothing to do with you? And for what reaſon, pray?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>The child.</speaker>
               <p>—I don't know; but when I want to join them, they drive me away, and leave me quite alone. They likewiſe ſay much ill of my father and mother. This gives me ſtill the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt pain. O my mother, riſe! riſe!</p>
            </sp>
            <p>The tears trickled down M. de Curſol's cheeks.</p>
            <p>You ſay that your father and brother are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe gone. Where are they gone to?</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>The child.</speaker>
               <p>—I don't know where my father is; but my little brother went away yeſterday to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother village. There came a gentleman as black as our curate who took him away with him.</p>

               <speaker>M. de Curſol.</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>The child.</speaker>
               <p>—I live with our neighbour Suſan. I ſhall ſtay with her till my mother returns, as
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:034525_0119_0FFE1A6FDE06E7A8"/>
ſhe promiſed me. I love Suſan much; ſhe is a ſecond mother; but I love ſtill more the mother who is here (pointing to the grave). Mother! mother! what makes you lie ſo long? When will you get up?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M. de Curſol.</speaker>
               <p>My poor boy, you may call her as long as you pleaſe, but ſhe never will get up.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>The child.</speaker>
               <p>—Well, then, I ſhall lie here, and ſleep by her. Ah! I ſaw them put her into a great cheſt. How pale ſhe looked! and how cold ſhe was! I ſhall lie here and ſleep by her.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>M. de Curſol could not refrain long from weeping. He took the child in his arms, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced him tenderly, and ſaid to him, what is your name, my dear friend?</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>The child.</speaker>
               <p>—They call me Jacquot when I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have well; and at other times they call me Jack.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>M. de Curſol ſmilled in the midſt of his tears.</p>
            <p>Would it be agreeable that I ſhould take you to Suſan?</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Jacquot.</speaker>
               <p>O! yes, yes, my dear gentleman.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>Jacquot ran before M. de Curſol as faſt as his little feet could carry him, and led him to Suſan's door.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="117" facs="unknown:034525_0120_0FFE1A72BA75F910"/>
Suſan was not a little ſurpriſed at ſeeing the gentleman come into her cottage with little Jac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quot, who pointing towards her with his little finger, and running to lay his head upon her lap, ſaid, "Here ſhe is; ſhe is my ſecond mother." She could not have expected ſo extraordinary a viſit. M. de Curſol did not ſuffer her to remain long in doubt. He told her the ſituation in which he had found the little boy; expreſſed to her the pity with which the ſight had inſpired him, and begged that ſhe would inform him concerning the child's parents.</p>
            <p>Suſan preſented him with a ſeat cloſe by her own, and thus began her narrative:</p>
            <p>The child's father is a ſhoemaker, who lives in the next houſe. He is an honeſt, ſober, induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man, well made, and ſtill young. His wife was a good figure, but had bad health; ſhe was induſtrious and frugal. They were married ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven years, lived very well together; and would have been a moſt happy couple, had they been in ſomewhat circumſtances. Julian had nothing but his trade; and Madeline, who had been an orphan, brought her huſband very little money, which ſhe had ſaved in the ſervice of a worthy curate, who lives about nine miles from this place. This little money was applied towards purchaſing a bed, a few articles of furniture, and a ſmall ſtock of leather, for him to carry on his buſineſs. Notwithſtanding their poverty, they made a ſhift to live during the firſt years after marriage, by their induſtry and frugality. But they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:034525_0121_0FFE1A759583C448"/>
and this brought them into difficulties. They would however have been ſtill able to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, had it not been for ſome misfortunes which befel them. Poor Madeline, who worked daily in the fields, that ſhe might bring home a little money to her huſband at night fell ſick in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of fatigue; and her illneſs continued the whole harveſt and winter. Medicines were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſive. On the other hand, work did not go ſo well on as formerly: for many of Julian's cuſtomers dropped off, from an apprehenſion that they would not be well ſerved in a houſe where there was a ſick woman. At length Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deline recovered, but her huſband's buſineſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came no better. They were under the neceſſity of borrowing money to pay the phyſician and apothecary. A total ſtop was now put to Julian's buſineſs; he had loſt all his cuſtomers; and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deline could gain nothing by work, becauſe her ſtrength was diminiſhed, and no body would em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy her. In this ſituation, the rent of the houſe, and the intereſt of the borrowed money, entirely ruined them. They had hardly bread to their teeth; but they were happy if they could get a bit to give their children.</p>
            <p>On hearing theſe words little Jacquot retired to a corner, and began to ſigh.</p>
            <p>It now happened that an unfeeling man, who was landlord of the houſe, finding that they were not in a condition to pay him the two quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters rent which they owed threatened Julian that he would arreſt him. They begged him to
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:034525_0122_0FFE1A787180F940"/>
have patience till the harveſt; becauſe then they might earn ſome days wages by working in the fields; but neither their entreaties nor their tears cold have any effect upon him, though he was the richeſt perſon in the village. It was with great difficulty that they prevailed with him to ſpare them only one month; but he ſwore, that if at the expiration of that time, they did not pay him the whole ſum, he would expoſe all their effects to ſale, and have Julian caſt into priſon. Nothing was then to be ſeen in this poor family but ſuch ſadneſs and diſtreſs as might have ſoften<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a heart of ſtone. You may be aſſured, Sir, that my heart was often pained within me, when I heard the lamentation of theſe poor neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and could give them no aſſiſtance. I once went to their creditor, and begged that he would have compaſſion on their diſtreſs, I told him, that if it was neceſſary, I would pledge my ſhift for the payment of his debt, though it was the only one I had. But this had no effect upon him. You are a miſerable wretch as well as them; replied he; this is what I get by letting tenements to ſuch a parcel of blackards. Ah! Sir (here the tears trickled down Suſan's cheeks), I could patiently endure that reproach, if that were all; but how much greater is my ſuffering to be only a poor widow, and not able to afford a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny comfort to theſe honeſt people! But to return to our unfortunate neighbours: I adviſed Made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line to go and throw herſelf at the feet of the curate, whom ſhe had ſerved ſome years as a faithful ſervant, and beg that he would advance her a little money. She ſaid that ſhe would
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:034525_0123_0FFE1A7B4EC2C348"/>
ſpeak of it to her huſband; but that he would have great reluctance to apply to the curate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he might imagine that he had fallen into all this diſtreſs by bad conduct. Three days a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go ſhe brought me as uſual her two children, and begged that I would take care of them until the evening. She was going herſelf to the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring village, to apply to a weaver about the ſpinning of ſome flax for the payment of their debt. She never could think of having recourſe to the curate, her old maſter; but her huſband re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to make the the application inſtead of her; and he is gone for that purpoſe this very day. I have taken the charge of the children whom I love much, having been preſent at both their births. Madeline, at parting claſped them in in their arms, and embraced them as if it was for the laſt time ſhe ſhould ever ſee them. I think I ſee her at this moment! Her eyes were full of tears, and ſhe ſaid to the eldeſt: don't cry, Jac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quot, I ſhall ſoon be back again, and will come to take you home. She took me by the hand, thanked me for promiſing to take care of her children, embraced them once more, and went away.</p>
            <p>Some time after, I heard a noiſe in their houſe; but thinking ſhe was gone out, I ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to have been occaſioned by a faggot that had fallen on the floor; and therefore was not uneaſy about it. However the evening came on and afterwards the night; and ſtill I ſaw nothing of my neighbour's return. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> thought of going to her houſe, to ſee whether ſhe had gone home
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:034525_0124_0FFE1A7D5BF0ADF0"/>
to lay aſide her flax, before ſhe ſhould come to take away the children. I found the door open, and went in. My God! how I was ſtruck with aſtoniſhment at ſeeing Madeline lying dead at the foot of a ladder! I ſtood motionleſs, and as cold as a ſtone. I knew not what I ſhould do. At laſt, after endeavouring in vain to raiſe her up, I ran for the ſurgeon, who immediately came, felt her pulſe, ſhaking his head in the mean time, and ſent for the magiſtrate. The people belonging to the police and the ſurgeon examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in what manner ſhe had died; and their vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict was, that either ſhe had been killed by the fall, or that not being able to call for aſſiſtance, ſhe had expired in a fainting fit.</p>
            <p>I eaſily conceive how the accident may have happened. She had gone home to take out of the garret a ſack for holding the flax; and her eyes being dim with weeping, ſhe had not ſeen clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to place her foot upon the uppermoſt ſtep of the ladder in going down, and ſo had fallen with her head foremoſt upon the pavement. Her ſack, which lay by her, ſhews that this had been the caſe. The magiſtrate, however, view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the matter in a different light. He gave or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that the body ſhould be intered next morning before break of day, without any ceremony, at the extremity of the burying-ground: and he would iſſue a proclamation for diſcovering what was become of Julian. I offered to keep the two children with me: for though I find difficulty enough to earn my own ſubſiſtence, I ſaid to my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf:
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:034525_0125_0FFE1A830AB6B8B8"/>
God Almighty knows that I am a poor widow, and if I ſhould have the charge of theſe hapleſs children, his gracious providence can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able me to ſupport them. The little brother of this one has not continued with me long. So late as yeſterday, ſome hours after Madeline was buried, the worthy curate, in whoſe houſe ſhe had ſerved, called to ſee her. He knocked for ſome time at the door; and nobody opened it, he came to my window, and aſked me where Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian the ſhoemaker was, who lived in the next houſe. I anſwered that if he would take the trouble to come in for a moment, I had many things to ſay to him. He came in, and ſat down juſt where you are. I told him all that had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened. He immediately burſt into tears. At length I told him, that Julian had expreſſed a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of applying to him in the preſent difficulty. He appeared ſurprized, and aſſured me that he had not ſeen Julian. The two children came to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him; he embraced them affectionately; and Jacquot aſked him whether he could not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake their mother who had ſlept ſo long a time. On hearing the child ſpeak in this manner, the tears ruſhed again into the eyes of the worthy curate; and he ſaid to me: Good woman, I ſhall ſend to-morrow for theſe two children and keep them about my houſe. If their father returns, and ſhould be in a condition to ſupport them, I ſhall reſign them whenever he deſires it. In the mean time I ſhall take care that they be proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly educated. I was not much pleaſed at this I have the affection of a mother for theſe little children; and ſhould be much diſtreſſed to ſee
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:034525_0126_0FFE1A848FDC0F00"/>
them taken away from me ſo ſoon. Sir, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed I, I cannot conſent to be ſeparated from theſe children; I am accuſtomed to them, and they are likewiſe to me. Very well, good woman, ſaid he; then you muſt give me one of them, and I ſhall let you keep the other, becauſe I know that you will be very careful of it: I ſhall now and then ſend you ſome little matter for its ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. I could not but readily comply with the good curate's propoſal. He aſked Jacquot if he was willing to go with him. To where my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is! replied Jacquot; oh! yes, with all my heart. No, no, my little friend, I don't mean where ſhe is; it is to my pretty houſe, and my pleaſant garden. No, no, leave me with Suſan; I ſhall go every day to viſit my mother; I'd ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther go there than to your garden. The worthy curate immediately deſiſted from vexing the child, who went and hid himſelf behind the curtains of my bed. He told me that he ſhould ſend his ſervant to take away the younger one, who would have given me more trouble than the elder; and he left me a little money for the ſupport of this one.</p>
            <p>This, Sir, is all that I have to inform you concerning Jacquot's parents. What increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes my uneaſineſs is, that Julian is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, and that a report has ſpread that he has gone to join a band of ſmugglers, and that his wife killed herſelf out of vexation. Theſe lies have ſo circulated through the village, that they are the common talk even of the children; and when my Jacquot wants to join them, they drive
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:034525_0127_0FFE1A8613A75F40"/>
him away, and threaten to beat him. The poor child vexes his heart perpetually, and he now on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly goes out to throw himſelf down upon his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's grave.</p>
            <p>M. de Curſol liſtened to Suſan's narrative with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpeaking a word, but not without feeling the ſtrongeſt emotions of ſympathy. Jacquot now came back to her. He looked at her with an air of affection, and frequently called her his mother. At length M. de Curſol ſaid to Suſan, Good woman, you have behaved very generouſly to this unfortunate family; God will ſurely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward you for it.</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Suſan.</speaker>
               <p>—I have done nothing but what I ought. We are placed in this world to aſſiſt each other. I always thought that I could do nothing more acceptable in the ſight of God for all the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies I have received of him, that by endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as much as was in my power to alleviate the diſtreſs of my poor neighbours. Ah! if I only could more effectually do it! But I have nothing in the world except my cottage, a ſmall garden, which produces me a few herbs, and what I can earn by the toil of my hands However, during eight years I have been a widow, God has ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported me decently, and I hope he will all my life-time.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Suſan.</speaker>
               <p>—I ſhall leave the care of that to him who cloathes the field with flowers, and the trees with leaves. He has given me hands to ſew and ſpin; I ſhall exert them to clothe our little orphan. When people know how to pray and work, they never want for any thing.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>M. de Curſol.</speaker>

               <p>And I am related to both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties by religion and humanity. So that I ſhall not allow you to have the whole honour of doing good to this orphan, when God has beſtowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me more means than you for that purpoſe.

Truſt me with the care of Jacquot's education; and ſince that you are ſo accuſtomed to each other, and that you deſerve for your benificence, all the kindneſs which has attachment to his mother in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpires me with, I ſhall take both of you home to my houſe, and become your protector.

            <sp>
               <speaker>Suſan.</speaker>
               <p>—It is chiefly becauſe I am attached to the place where I was born, and where I have lived ſo long a time: and beſides, it would be impoſſible for me to ſuit myſelf to the ways of a great houſe, and to the ſight of all the people in it. I am not accuſtomed to eaſe, or delicate liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; I ſhould fall ſick if I had nothing to do, or if I ſhould eat of finer meat than I have been uſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Let me therefore remain in my cottage with my little Jacquot.

But if you will aſſiſt him from time to time with a little money to pay his fees at the ſchool, which he may follow, our gracious God will not fail to repay you a hundred fold: at leaſt Jacquot and I ſhall make it conſtantly a part of our daily prayers.

               <speaker>M. de Curſol.</speaker>
               <p>—Very well. I ſhould not wiſh to make you unhappy by my propoſal. I ſhall let Jacquot live with you, ſince you are ſo well together. Speak to him often of me, and let him know that I have taken upon me the charge of a father, as you have, on your part, that of the mother whom he ſo much regrets. I ſhall ſend you every month what will be neceſſary for your ſupport: I ſhall frequently come to ſee ye both; and my viſits will be as much on your account as on his.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>Suſan lifted up her eyes to heaven, and touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſkirt of M. de Curſol's coat with her lips: then ſhe ſaid to the child: Come, Jacquot, kiſs the hand of this gentleman; he will be your father.</p>
            <p>Jacquot kiſſed M. de Curſol's hand, but ſaid to Suſan; how can he be my father? he has got no apron before him.</p>
            <p>M. de Curſol ſmiled at the natural ſimplicity of Jacquot's queſtion; and laying a purſe down upon the table: Adieu, excellent Suſan, ſaid he: adieu, my little friend; it will not be long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you ſee me again. He then mounted his horſe, and rode directly to the curate who had taken the younger of the orphans.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="128" facs="unknown:034525_0131_0FFE1A917B212178"/>
He found the curate employed in reading a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which drew tears from his eyes. After the uſual civilities, M. de Curſol informed the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy paſtor of the cauſe of his viſit, and aſked him whether he knew any thing concerning the father of the unfortunate children.</p>
            <p>Sir, anſwered the Curate, it is not more than a quarter of an hour ſince I received from him this letter, written to his wife. He has addreſſed it ſo me, with this paper containing ſome money, that I may ſend them to his wife, to conſole her tor his abſence. His wife being dead, I have opened the letter: here it is, be ſo good as to read it. M. de Curſol ſnatched the letter with eagerneſs and read what follows:</p>
            <floatingText type="letter">
               <body>
                  <opener>

                  </opener>
                  <p>It gives me great uneaſineſs to think that you have been in pain about the cauſe of my abſence; but allow me to tell you what has happened. As I was on the road going to the Curate, I began to think what I ſhould gain by ſoliciting his benifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence. I ſhall only get out of one debt to incur a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, ſaid I within myſelf; and I ſhall be perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unhappy with the thoughts how to repay him. For me, who am ſtill young, and able to work, to go to aſk ſo much money! I ſhould be thought either a debauchee, or an indolent fellow. The Curate is the perſon who married us, he loves us as his own children; but ſhould he deny my requeſt with contempt! or not be in condition to aſſiſt us! But ſhould he even advance me the money for a

twelvemonth, can I be certain of having it in my power to pay him? and if I ſhould not pay him, muſt I not appear in the ſight of a robber? I ſhould in that caſe have deceived him. This is what I ſaid to myſelf, my dear Madeline, and I afterwards ruminated how I might be able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate you and me from our preſent difficulties in an honeſt way. I knew not what courſe to take. I poured fourth many a ſigh to God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty. At laſt the thought ſtruck me in the head, and I thus ſaid to myſelf: you are yet young, and of a ſtout healthy conſtitution; where is the harm if you ſhould go and become a ſoldier for ſome years? You can read, write, and caſt up accounts pretty well; you may yet make the fortune of your wife and children; at leaſt you may be able to diſcharge your debt. Reflect that if you behave yourſelf ſoberly, and pick up a little money, you can ſend it to Madeline. While I was indulging theſe thoughts. I ſaw two ſoldiers coming up at a diſtance behind me. They joined me in a very little time. They aſked me where I had come from, which way I was going, and if I ſhould not like to ſerve the king? I immediately anſwered in ſuch an air as if I had no taſte for the buſineſs. They continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed however to urge me, and promiſed me fifty crowns of liſting money. I told them that on condition, I ſhould enliſt for ſix years. Done, anſwered they. Come along with us, and it ſhall be inſtantly concluded. They carried me before an officer. They meaſured my height, and aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed if I could read, write, and caſt up accounts;
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:034525_0133_0FFE1A989EB9D840"/>
and when I anſwered in the affirmative they deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered me the money. In this way, my dear Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deline, I am become a ſoldier to get out of our difficulty. I ſend you the fifty crowns. I ſhall not keep any of it. Pay immediately the thirty that I owe, and the ſix francs of intereſt. Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the reſt to the uſe of yourſelf and our little family the beſt way you can. Take care of your own diet, that you may the ſooner recover ſtrength. Get ſome cloaths for our children, and put them to ſchool as ſoon as poſſible. I know that you are prudent and induſtrious; but with all that, you will have enough to do. Have patience! I ſhall receive five pence a day of pay. I ſhall ſee if I can ſave one penny to two pence every day, and ſend it to you at the end of the month. In a little time I ſhall aſk for leave to come and ſee you. My dear Madeline, don't vex yourſelf. Put your truſt in God; ſix years will ſoon paſs over. I ſhall then return to you, and we ſhall be able to ſupport our little family. My officer has promiſed to write to the bailiff about preſerving my corporation right. Bring up our children well; keep them at home, and inſtil into them a taſte for working. Pray with them daily. Speak to them much of the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of our heavenly Benefactor, and of the duties of life. You are very capable of inſtructing them in what is neceſſary. Live in the fear of God: pray to him concerning me, and I ſhall pray for you in return. Send me an anſwer as ſoon as poſſible. You may give your letter to the Curate, who will forward it to me.

            <p>M. de Curſol's eyes were filled with tears dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reading of this letter. As ſoon as he had finiſhed: here, cried he, is one who may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a good huſband, a good father, and an honeſt man! Mr. Curate, we ought to take great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in doing good to ſuch excellent people.

            <head>THE CORNISH CURATE.</head>
            <p>TO pourtray one's own life with impartiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and to lay open with candour the movements of the heart; to dare to confeſs its merits; is perhaps as difficult a taſk as can well be conceived; but, actuated by a regard for the happineſs of thoſe who have not yet determined on their future courſe of life, and hoping that my ſtory may ſerve either to direct or to deter, I venture to lay it before the public.</p>
            <p>I was born in a diſtant country in a remote cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the kingdom. My parents were above indigence, and their honor above imputation. A family pride, which had been handed down through a ſucceſſion of generations, prevented them from ſtooping to the drudgery of trade: while their hereditary eſtate, being inſufficient to ſecure a genteel independence to themſelves, was of courſe too limited to enable them to provide for the contingency of a numerous offspring.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="134" facs="unknown:034525_0137_0FFE1AA56BADEE38"/>
I was the third ſon, and of courſe had but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to expect. My father early intended me for the church, and I was placed under an approved maſter, at a celebrated grammar-ſchool. My di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, let me ſay it, ſince I can without vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty make the aſſertion, ſoon procured me the good-will of my maſter; and the meekneſs of my diſpoſition, the favor of my ſchool-fellows, of whom I was in a few years conſidered as the chief, and on every public occaſion ſelected by my maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to prove his own diligence, and diſplay my acquiſitions. In ſeven years I finiſhed my career of claſſical education, and left the good old gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman with tears of filial affection; who height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened my feelings by the ſympathetic regard which was conſpicuous in his own looks.</p>
            <p>And here I cannot forbear fondly indulging my fancy with a retroſpective view of thoſe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py days, thoſe years of unmingled felicity, when care has not planted her ſting in the human breaſt, or thought launched out into ſcenes of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture action, where miſery ſo often daſhes the cup of life with her better draught!</p>
            <p>There are, I Believe, but few perſons, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever happy they may have been in their progreſs through life, who have not made the ſame reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and recurred with pleaſure to thoſe cloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs hours, when the taſk, or the dread of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, were the worſt ills that could befall them: when the joys of the heart were pure and unalloyed, the tear ſoon forgot, and the mind indifferent to what events might occur. If the fortunate have made theſe reflections, well may
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:034525_0138_0FFE1AA6F137CEC8"/>
I; who have journeyed on one dreary road, ſince I firſt entered the path of life, and ſcarcely have known thoſe intervals of bleſs which the mendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant himſelf is not forbidden to taſte!</p>
            <p>From the grammar-ſchool I was removed to the univerſity of Oxford, and entered on the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Exter-college. The diligent appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation which had marked my former ſtudies ſoon rendered me conſpicuous in the univerſity; and I was complimented on every occaſion, as a youth of uncommon genius, and unwearied aſſiduity. My heart began to be elated with the applauſes which were ſo laviſhly beſtowed upon me; I was animated to get farther exertions of application; and in four years, took my batchelor's degree, and with an eclat which has ſeldom diſtinguiſhed a leſs diligent ſcholar. I ſoon became the object of univerſal admiration in the univerſity; my future greatneſs was prognoſticated in the moſt flattering terms, as one who would be an honor to literature, and a luminary in the church; but theſe compliments, however ſoothing to the youthful <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap>, only operated to diſtreſs me. The leſs aſſiduous could not endure me to bear away the palm of genius on every public occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and the proud, the honored, and the great, began to affect a ſupercilious contempt in my preſen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="4 letters">

The charms of ſcience, and maxims of philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, could neither inſpire me with fortitude, nor lull my ſenſibility. Too partial, perhaps, to my own merit, I was impatient of the ſlighteſt appearance of diſreſpect; and my feelings were, about this time, put to a moſt ſevere trial, by the death of my father, after ſo ſhort an illneſs, that I was prevented from receiving his laſt benedic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This calamity more deeply affected me than all my ſubſequent misfortunes; it was the firſt I ever ſuffered, and the keen edge of delicate ſenſibility had not yet been blunted by a frequent repetition of miſery. I reſigned myſelf into the arms of melancholy; and ſecluding myſelf from the impertinent or affected condolers of my own loſs, indulged that exquiſite kind of ſorrow which ſhuns the obtruſion of the world.</p>
            <p>By my father's will I found myſelf entitled to 5001. which was all I had to combat the world, and eſtabliſhed myſelf in life; but had I been ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by my patrimony what the prudent call perfectly eaſy, my grief would not have been leſs poignat, or my feelings leſs acute.</p>
            <p>As my finances would no longer decently ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port me at college, and my affliction for the loſs of a beloved parent ſtifled every throb of ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and forbade me to launch into a more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive courſe of life, I embraced the firſt opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of an ordination, at once to ſeclude myſelf from ſecular employments, and to gratify my ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentary and ſtudious diſpoſition.</p>

To engage in the moſt ſacred offices, without a more laudible view, may be excuſed in the eyes of an unthinking world, but muſt certainly ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a man highly culpable in the ſight of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: and, thought I am not conſcious of ever diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracing my profeſſion, except my poverty and misfortunes may be thought to have degraded it, I have often reflected with ſhame that I was not influenced by worthier motives.</p>
            <p>Having aſſumed the ſacred habit, I ſet out for my native place with a pain and reluctance I had never before experienced. I reflected, that I was now not only bidding adieu for ever to the ſeats of the muſes, and leaving behind me ſome valuable friends, to whom I was attached by a ſimiliarity of ſtudies; but had likewiſe the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy conſideration to ſupport, that I had no longer a father to receive me in his longing arms, or a faithful friend to guard me from the decep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the world. At the ſight of my native manſion, the tears guſhed involuntarily from my eyes; I was overcome with contending paſſions: and could ſcarcely ſupport myſelf into the room where my relations were ready to receive me, before I fell lifeleſs on the floor, and enjoyed a temporary ſuſpenſion of thought, and a conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent relaxation from miſery.</p>
            <p>On recovering, I found the whole family anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iouſly attentive to my welfare: and my mother, from her apprehenſions for me, was in a ſtate lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle better than that from which I was reſtored.
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:034525_0141_0FFE1AB0DE92D3F8"/>
She, however, ſoon regained ſtrength to bleſs God that I was ſafe, and that ſhe had lived to ſee me in holy orders.</p>
            <p>Regardleſs of ſecuring any little advantage that might have accrued to me from my acceptance of accuracy, I continued ſome time with my mother and elder brother, proſecuting my theological ſtudies with much application, and only allowing proper intervals for exerciſe or company. Time, the grand reſtorer, aſſiſted by thoſe doctrines of chriſtianity which are peculiarly comforting to the afflicted, brought me by degrees to a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary campoſure of mind. I gradually regained my wonted ſerenity; and was ardently looking forward to my future deſtination, when a freſh accident plunged me into the depths of miſery, and not only taught me to deſpair of finding friendſhip in a heart where the maxims of virtue are not inherent, but convinced me that the ties of blood may be burſt aſunder at the inſtigations of paſſion, and a brother with leſs reluctance ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced than a ſenſual appetite abandoned.</p>
            <p>To alleviate the grief occaſioned by a beloved partner's loſs, my mother had requeſted the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of a young lady, named Olivia, the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a neighbouring clergyman. She had ſo often viſited in our family; and being nearly of my age, was my conſtant companion in every childiſh purſuit; but as the impreſſion on the breaſt of infancy is evaneſcent as the morning dew, or the bloom of the roſe, her remembrance had been almoſt effaced from my mind; and,
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:034525_0142_0FFE1AB2642134E0"/>
during the time which we had recently ſpent to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, I had not left a ſingle emotion in her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor, nor treated her with more attention, than the fair, the lovely, and the young, have always a right to expect from the manly and unpoliſhed heart.</p>
            <p>It being now the vernal ſeaſon, I happened, one fine ſerene evening, to rove, with a book in my hand, to a conſiderable diſtance from home; till finding the ſhades of night ſuddenly ſurrounding me, I haſtened to return. My neareſt way was through tangled woods and unfrequented paths, and on this I gave the preference; but before I proceeded far, a female voice reſounded from a neighbouring copſe. Shrieks, entreaties, and prayers, which became more languid as I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached, ſeemed to be poured out in vain, and the voice died away in broken murmurs. With all the expedition the humanity could inſpire, I flew towards the place; but, judge my ſurpriſe and ſenſations, when I beheld Olivia ſtruggling in my brother's arms, and ſeemingly overcome by her exertions! At the ſight of ſuch an unwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come intruder, my brother ſeemed confounded with ſhame; he inſtantly forſook his lovely prize; and, with eyes darting indignation, quitted the ſpot without uttering a ſingle word.</p>
            <p>Wounded to the ſoul with his baſeneſs, and melted by the piteous ſituation of the lovely object who lay ſtretched on the earth in a ſtate of inſenſibility, I was ſcarcely maſter of my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. However, I ſoon ſummoned a ſufficient de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:034525_0143_0FFE1AB40A3EE8D8"/>
of reaſon to attempt her revival; and I had the happineſs to find that my exertions were not in vain. As ſhe opened her fine blue eyes, and looked me full in the face, I felt an emotion which I had never before experienced. She ſtarted back at the fight of ſuch an unexpected deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; and notwithſtanding my utmoſt endeavors, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſed into the ſame melancholy ſtate. At length I again found means to reſtore her; when burſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into a flood of tears, "Eugenius," ſays ſhe, <q>may every bleſſing attend your life! May hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſhower its choiceſt favors on your head! and may ſome lovely and fortunate fair reward your virtue for preſerving mine!</q>—<q>My dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Olivia!</q> exclaimed I, with all the enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſm of love, <q>the hand of heaven ſeems conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous in this deliverance: and, if I may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to expreſs the wiſh that lies neareſt my heart, may the ſame power make me the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting guardian of that virtue which I have been ſo miraculouſly enabled to ſave!</q>—<q>My deliverer,</q> ſweetly returned the ingenuous fair, <q>is entitled to every acknowledgment I can make; conduct me to my father, and lodge under his ſheltering roof the child who is at his diſpoſal.</q> With this requiſition I immediately complied; and as we agreed that it would be prudent to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal the rude aſſault of my brothr, which the malevolent world might have repreſented more fatal than it really was, we reſolved to aſcribe the lateneſs of our arrival to the fineneſs of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>vening, and the charms of the ſeaſon, which had attempted us to linger beyond our intended time.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="141" facs="unknown:034525_0144_0FFE1AB85B19CA38"/>
The apology was eaſily admitted; and as I was invited to ſtay, I eagerly embraced the offer, as well to paſs more in the company of Olivia, as to recover ſufficiently from my perturbation of mind before I met a guilty brother's eye.</p>
            <p>Next morning I took leave of Olivia and her father; and during my walk; felt a dejection of ſpirits, and heavineſs of heart, which could not have been exceeded, if I had been the perpetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of villainy, and not the protector of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence. The mind ſeems often prophetic of its own fate, and intuitively to foreſee the ſtorm that futurity is about to diſcloſe. I approached my brother with looks of indignation and pity; but, before I could utter a ſingle word, unlocked his bureau, "Receive," ſays he, <q>your patrimony, and immediately quit the houſe! I diſclaim for a brother the wretch who can fruſtrate my wiſhes merely to gratify his own, and this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the more deteſtable maſk of ſentimental hypocriſy!</q> Stung to the ſoul, I replied, <q>The power who ſees the rectitude of my views, and by means has defeated, the villainy of yours, will abundantly provide for me! I renounce an alliance with your ignominy, with the ſame pleaſure as you diſclaim me for a brother: but let me caution you to beware, left your paſſions precipitate you into irretrievable ruin!</q> With theſe words I ruſhed into my mother's apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and, falling on my knees, beſought her benediction, before the opportunity was forever cloſed. Too well acquainted with what had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, ſhe bathed my face with her tears; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailing
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:034525_0145_0FFE1AB9DF0573B8"/>
wailing her hapleſs ſituation, encouraged me to hope for a ſpeedy reconciliation, bidding me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on her unalterable love.</p>
            <p>Alas! ſhe lived but a very ſhort time to real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ize her wiſhes; for within three weeks, ſhe fell a matyr to her grief, occaſioned by the brutal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence of my brother, in conſequence of her partiality to me.</p>
            <p>An outcaſt from my family, and equally diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualified by the delicacy of my feelings, and narrowneſs of my circumſtances, from elbowing my way in the world, I ſcarcely knew which way to direct my ſteps. Love, however, which can illumine the darkeſt hours of life, prompted my return to Olivia, that I might tell her how much my misfortune attached her to my heart. I revealed to the dear charmer my true ſituation, and concluded by aſking her advice reſpecting my future conduct. She immediately referred me to her father's ſuperior experience; and I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly communicated to him my fixed reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of engaged in accur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, without aſſigning the moſt diſtant reaſon for quitting my brother's houſe. In conſequence of this communication, I had in a few days the happineſs to be informed, that an old gentleman, the rector of Crowan, a village near Falmouth, was in immediate want of a clerical aſſiſtant.</p>
            <p>To him I preſently applied, and without heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation cloſed with his offer of allowing me twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty pounds a year; but as this ſum would barely
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:034525_0146_0FFE1ABF6249D8E8"/>
find me in board, my patrimony began rapidly to decreaſe.</p>
            <p>Olivia, I need ſcarcely ſay, in the mean time engaged all my thoughts. Our love was mutual and ſincere; and intereſt, that powerful incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to modern contracts, was entirely overlook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by both, as her fortune was ſtill inferior to my own. In a few months ſhe conſented to be irrevocably mine, and then I thought my felicity beyond the reach of fate. From this pleaſing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion, however, I had the misfortune ſoon to be awaked; for finding my income very inadequate to my expences, I began to ſhudder at the tho'ts of involving a beloved wife in want and miſery. Theſe gloomy preſages were too ſoon realized by the death of my aged patron; an event which wholly deprived me of employment. This ſtroke was followed by the birth of a ſon; which, tho it ought to have taught me economy, and ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulated my exertions, only tended to lull my cares, and deaden my ſenſe of want.</p>
            <p>After vainly endeavoring to obtain another cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, and being diſappointed in my expectations of a ſmall living by the machinations of my aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned brother, Olivia's father was attacked with a paralytic ſtroke, which compelled him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign the care of his cure to me. The whole a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount of his living did not exceed fourſcore pounds a year, and conſequently little could be allowed for the maintenance of a curate. My Olivia was again pregnant; when I found that, excluſive of ſome trifling articles of furnature and
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:034525_0147_0FFE1AC0E7F77DB8"/>
books, I had ſcarcely 100l. left: and, to add to my diſtreſs, a ſecond paralytic ſtroke, and ſoon after a third, deprived me of a valuable friend; whoſe effects, when diſpoſed of and his debts diſcharged, produced only about threeſcore pounds for his daughter's portion.</p>
            <p>Being now deſtitute of every friend, my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther remaining irreconcilably inveterate, and a native baſhfulneſs of diſpoſition for which the world is not always candid enough to make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per allowances, having prevented me from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending my connections, or ſecuring many friends, I was in ſuch a diſtreſsful ſituation, that my mind began to ſink beneath its burden, and to become weary of ſtruggling with its fate.</p>
            <p>The proſpect, however, again brightened; and I obtained a very deſirable curacy of thirty pounds a year, by the intereſt of a young baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, who had accidentally ſeen Olivia and her two infant children, and expreſſed the warmeſt deſire to ſerve us. As a preſent proof of his friendſhip, he applied to the rector of his pariſh, of which he was himſelf patron, to accept my ſervices in the room of a young man, whom an unfortunate and ill-requitted attachment had juſt hurried to an untimely grave.</p>
            <p>To Padſtow I immediately removed with my deareſt Olivia, whoſe kind ſolicitude for me was the only conſolation of my life: and who, far from blaming for that anxiety which continually clouded my aſpect, kindly ſympathized in my griefs, and endeavored, by the moſt endearing
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:034525_0148_0FFE1AC26E43C3E8"/>
fondneſs, to reconcile me to life. Sir Thomas Smith, by whoſe interpoſition I had obtained my preſent eſtabliſhment, likewiſe contributed all in his power to render my ſituation eaſy; continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally loading the children with preſents, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering me the loan of any ſum I might have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for. Of this offer I too imprudently and fatally availed myſelf, by borrowing two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds. To corroborate our good opinion of his generoſity, he bade me make myſelf per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly eaſy in my ſituation; for, on the preſent incumbent's death, the living ſhould be inſtantly mine. I thanked him with an ardour that mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the expreſſions of form. But, alas! I had to deal with a man of the world; and found too ſoon that I had placed my dependence where I had nothing to hope, and poured forth my grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude where my execrations only were due.</p>
            <p>This unprincipled young man was our conſtant viſitor, and encouraged our extravagance merely that he might have an opportunity of ſupplying our wants. My Olivia was charmed with his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion; and as virtue cannot readily ſuſpect that artifice which it never practiſed, ſhe congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulated me—ſhe congratulated herſelf and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren—on the advantages we were likely to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive from a friendſhip which neither of us could ſuppoſe to be intereſted. The contrary, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, ſoon appeared! Olivia, whoſe beauty was rather improved than diminiſhed, was invited to celebrate with me a chriſtmas feſtival at Sir Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas's. A blameable politeneſs to my ſuppoſed
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:034525_0149_0FFE1AC7F91290B0"/>
friend eaſily induced me to drink more plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the wine, with which his board was profuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly covered, than my conſtitution would bear; and as I ſoon felt its effects, I was conveyed to bed in a ſtate of ebriety and ſtupefaction. On Olivia he likewiſe had the ſame ſhameful deſign; but guarded by the laws of delicate propriety, ſhe reſiſted his moſt earneſt ſolicitations. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, as he attached himſelf entirely to her, his paraſites and dependents, who ſaw plainly that he had views upon her virtue, retired one after a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, leaving Olivia and him alone together. Immediately on this he ſhut the door; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching her attention for a few minutes to an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ed him again to wound her ears with his unhallowed vows; proteſting, his conduct ſhould be made known to an injured huſband, who would make him ſeverely repent of his temerity. With all the inſolence of conſcious ſuperiority he then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened the door, and with a ſmile of contempt informed her that ſince ſhe refuſed his friendſhip,
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:034525_0150_0FFE1AC981915E00"/>
his fortune, and his love, ſhe ſhould feel the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of his reſentment. Theſe threats, it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident the baſe villain muſt have prepared to put in execution previous to his diabolical invitation; for, before I deſcended next morning to break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt, I was arreſted at his ſuit on my note for two hundred pounds, which I had preſſed him to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept on his lending me that ſum; and that it was not in my power to ſatisfy one half of the demand, I was hurried away to priſon.</p>
            <p>My proſpects were now entirely blaſted. What, ignominy, and diſgrace, preſented themſelves to my view, in the moſt hideous aſpects; and I could have laid down my life without a ſigh, had not a faithful and affectionate wife, with two infant children, bound me to them with ties of indiſſoluble regard. My confinement I was truly ſenſible could only add to their miſery; yet the moſt unfortunate cannot, without reluctance, let go thoſe attachments which are ſo firmly rooted in the ſoul, or bid farewell to mortality with a ſtoical apathy.</p>
            <p>But, O God! my heart bleeds afreſh at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection of the ſcene I am now going to deſcribe—My Olivia, unable to ſupport this ſeparation from me, requeſted leave to make my room her habitation.</p>
            <p>The fatal requeſt was granted. For a few days I was ſurrounded by my wife and children: they cheared the priſon gloom—But, can I proceed!—I was ſoon deprived of theſe comforts for ever!
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:034525_0151_0FFDC6CA1A6C7338"/>
In three ſhort weeks after my commitment, they were carried off by an epidemical fever: and theſe eyes, which never beheld the miſery of a ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er without beſtowing the alms of pity's tear, were doomed to behold a wife and two innocents preſs the ſame untimely bier.</p>
            <p>The pathos of language is too weak to expreſs my ſenſations; I became delirious, and my own hands had nearly perpetrated a deed my ſoul ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hors—for now I had no more to loſe! And, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious heaven! if at that trying junction I ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned thy juſtice, forgive me! for affliction laid its iron hand too heavy upon me.</p>
            <p>Be degrees I fell into a ſettled deſpondency; and ſince I entered this miſerable room, four years have rolled away their melancholy hours, in which I have hardly beheld the face of a friend, or been ſoothed by the voice of a relation. The machinations of my unnatural brother, who leagued with Sir Thomas on account of his cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to me, have prevented me from obtaining my releaſe, and ſeem to ſhut the gates of mercy on my fate. My only expectation of deliverance is by the hand of death, for whoſe ſpeedy approach my prayers are continually offered up.

            <p>BY a youth of toil, of activity, of danger, De Rivieres, a French officer, had obtained an honorable old age, and a moderate competence of the gifts of fortune.

Pauline De Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vieres would be allowed by every one, but an antiquary, to poſſeſs a form equally perfect with that of the <hi>Venus</hi> of <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> and a face infinitely more pleaſing, by a ſuperior expreſſion of ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſenſibility. Pauline had a heart feeling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alive to every tender emotion, and entirely devoted to her father. She watched his every look,—prevented his every wiſh,—and ſecluded herſelf from the world, in order that ſhe might
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:034525_0154_0FFE1AD4EE41E370"/>
not neglect any one of the duties a child owes to the author of its exiſtence. The bleſſings, the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of a father, amply recompenſed her for this attention; and De Rivieres often exclaimed with rapture, that the ſun of his life would ſet calm, peaceful, and ſerene.</p>
            <p>The autumn of the fourth year of their retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the completion of the ſeventeenth year of Pauline's life, had now arrived, and the father reſolved to celebrate the event with a rural <hi>fete.</hi>—Dancing formed a part of the joyous entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and Pauline was ſelected by the Count De B—as partner for the evening. The Count's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks on the exquiſite grace with which ſhe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted herſelf in the dance were, from the lips of a man of faſhion, very flattering to a fond father; and Pauline herſelf was not without certain ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as agreeable as they were novel. From this period an acquaintance commenced between the family of De Rivieres and the Count, who was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually forming parties of pleaſure to entertain them. With all the openneſs, the generoſity of a ſoldier, De Rivieres, imputed this conduct to civility; and conſequently admitted the Count to intimacy and friendſhip.</p>
            <p>The Count was not blind to the favorable im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions he had made: he ſaw that the father e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed him; and from the delicate confuſion, which his ſudden appearance always ſpread over the cheek of Pauline, he drew a very fair infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that he had created in her breaſt a ſentiment in its nature more tender than that of friendſhip.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="152" facs="unknown:034525_0155_0FFE1AD7CD6B12E8"/>
The utmoſt freedom of intercourſe ſubſiſted now between De Rivieres and the Count, who, in an excurſion to the borders of a beautiful lake, threw out in the moſt delicate manner a ſuppoſition of the confined circumſtances of the former. De Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vieres, incapable of any reſerve with a friend, gave a very candid account of his fortune, declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in concluſion, that tho his circumſtances were not affluent, they afforded the means of eaſy and comfortable ſubſiſtance. An air of thotfulneſs was diffuſed over the Count's features during the remainder of the walk. He did not, for ſome days afterwards, viſit the habitation of De Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vieres, who was at a loſs to find a reaſon for his abſence. Pauline too had <hi>her</hi> fears; but theſe ſhe kept within the ſilent ſolitude of her own bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom.</p>
            <p>At length the Count baniſhed the aprehenſions of the family by his preſence. His countenance no longer wore a penſive or melancholy air:—it beamed with pleaſure and ſatisfaction.—The cauſe he diſcloſed in an evening walk with De Riviers. "It had afforded him," he declared, "infinite uneaſineſs to find that a man, who had ſerved his country with honor, ſhould be ſo ſcantily reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. In looking forward to futurity, he had alſo beheld how adequate the fortune he could leave his daughter would be to her ſupport."—This was touching on the tendereſt ſtring. A father's ſorrow betrayed itſelf in ſtrong emotions, and ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>wed that the idea had never ſtruck him ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly before. The Count continued his diſcourſe—"Under the impreſſion of the ſuggeſtions he
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:034525_0156_0FFE1AD98B422808"/>
had ſtated, he had taken the liberty to make uſe of his intereſt at Paris, which he had every reaſon to believe would be of the higheſt advantage to him, if he ſhould honor him by the acceptance of it."—De Rivieres was overwhelmed with grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude at the propoſal: he comprehended all the benefits which might reſult to Pauline; and he therefore did not heſitate a moment in accepting it. The Count appeared delighted with his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy acquieſcence; and an early day was fixed for the departure of De Rivieres for the metropolis.</p>
            <p>Pauline was ſoon made acquainted with the plan; and however diſtreſſing the ſeparation from her father might be, ſhe could not but feel the moſt grateful ſentiments for the Count. How lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle could the innocence of the daughter, or the generous ſoul of the parent ſuſpect, that the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt deſigns of villiany lurked under the angel form of a benefactor!</p>
            <p>The day for the departure of De Rivieres at length arrived. Pauline melted with affliction; nor was the heart of the old ſoldier free from the moſt ſorrowful emotions. He embraced his daughter, and bleſſed her. Then leading her to the Count, "Generous friend," he exclaimed, "I commit to your charge, during my abſence, a treaſure infinitely dearer to me than life. A fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther has nothing, ſave his God, more ſacred than his child. Count! may I have no reaſon to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent the confidence I repoſe in you!" The Count received Pauline with the warmeſt aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of protection; and De Rivieres, after one more tender embrace of his daughter, and an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:034525_0157_0FFE1ADF1543F458"/>
ſqueeze of her new guardian's hand, tore himſelf away.</p>
            <p>Pauline, after the departure of her father, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned herſelf wholly to the influence of affliction. The Count, while he endeavored to pour the balm of comfort into her wounded heart, was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with this exerciſe of ſenſibility.—Critical judge of human nature, he knew that in the moment of ſorrow the heart is more feelingly alive to tender ſenſations; and, if the expreſſion may be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, more <hi>porous</hi> than in the hour of feſtivity and joy. In the firſt flow of grief, he told her not "the tale of love;" but his attention ſo unweari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, his aſſiduity ſo delicate, could not fail to produce ſentiments of gratitude, of friendſhip—
<q>A Friendſhip in Woman is ſiſter to Love.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The lenient, aſſuaſive power of time, her own endeavors, and the Count's diligence, at length reſtored her to ſome degree of tranquility, which received additional ſtrength from her protector's repeated aſſurances of the ſpeedy return of her father.</p>
            <p>It was on one of thoſe evenings when the wind, as if unwilling to diſturb the lulling ſtillneſs and ſerenity, ſteals through the groves in gentle ſighs, ſcarce touching the leaf that ſoftly whiſpers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponſive to the breeze, Pauline was tempted to enjoy the univerſal calm, the Count accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her. A boſom of apathy indeed muſt he poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs, who on ſuch an evening feels no increaſe of
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:034525_0158_0FFE1AE09A9D1858"/>
ſweet emotion. It was not ſo with Pauline—Every <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ibre of her heart thrilled with delight and harmony. Will it derogate from her virtue to ſay, that, for a moment her father was forgotten? The Count felt that the time was favorable; and he was reſolved that it ſhould not eſcape him—he diſcloſed a tale, "ſoft as the zephyr's ſighs." It was heard without anger—it was anſwered with a permiſſion to hope.</p>
            <p>The Count had now laid a foundation, on which his future ſchemes were to be erected.—Next day a letter came from De Rivieres to his daughter—replete with the obligations which the Count had conferred on him—and with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes he had received from the miniſter, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of ſo powerful a recommendation.—Pauline was in rapture, and the Count was not leſs enchanted with the ſmiles ſhe beſtowed on him. A ſhort elyſian month ſucceeded; and each day was now expected to reſtore a beloved father to his daughter's longing arms. One morning, after the expiration of the month, the Count paid his accuſtomed viſit earlier than uſual; his brow was clouded—melancholy was ſtrongly marked in every expreſſive feature. Pauline beheld the change, and her boſom panted with quivering fear. "Any new intelligence from my father?" ſhe exclaimed in an eager, yet tremulous tone of voice: "I have letters, Pauline, from Paris; but"—"Oh! give them me—my father—no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident has happened to him!" The Count was ſilent, but taking from his pocket a letter, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered it to her trembling hands. For a moment
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:034525_0159_0FFE1BE9D45C5B48"/>
ſhe held it, fearful of breaking the ſeal—a tear fell on the ſuperſcription. At length, with a kind of wild impatience, ſhe tore it open. Scarce, however, had ſhe caſt her eyes on the firſt line, when ſhe ſunk lifeleſs on the floor, Some hours elapſed ere ſhe was reſtored to reaſon and to woe. On opening her eyes, ſhe threw them round the room—"My father! Oh! my father in priſon!" The exclamation produced a return of fainting fits, which continued during the remainder of the day. At night "tired nature's ſweet reſtorer" cloſed her eyelids; and the next morning ſhe awoke with ſomewhat more calmneſs, tho with a heart ſtill overwhelmed in the depth of ſorrow.</p>

                  <p>The Count ſuffered the firſt flow of grief to paſs without interuption. He then waited on her in obedience to her own requeſt—Grief, he obſerved had made great ravages on her cheeks; but in ſtealing thence the roſe, it had left, in the drooping lily, a more faſcinating charm, a ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger expreſſion of tenderneſs. Pauline began by informing him of her determination to ſet off in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly for Paris, in order to alleviate the diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of her father by ſharing them. The Count endeavored firſt to perſuade her from her purpoſe, by painting the horrors of a priſon in the moſt gloomy colors. Pauline ſhuddered at the pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;—but her reſolution was not ſo weakened. The Count then informed her, that her father, in his letters to him, had commanded her not to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit him. Pauline was ſurpriſed—ſhe wept—ſhe ſighed—but the commands of a father ſhe held ſacred. Feeling an irreſiſtible impulſe to give full vent to ſorrow, ſhe roſe, and apologizing to

the Count for leaving him, retired to her cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.—There ſhe indulged in all the "<hi>luxury <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

For two ſucceeding days the Count did not make his appearance.—She thought his abſence extraordinary—ſhe felt it unkind. The third day his ſervant brought a letter from him: it contained but this ſhort ſentence; <q>Pauline! the fate of your father is in your hands:—it is in your power to unbolt his priſon doors, and to reſtore him to liberty and happineſs.</q>—</p>

            <p>Pauline read the lines with ſenſations of ecſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and deſired to ſee the Count immediately.—He came—ſhe preſſed him to explain himſelf—he obeyed with ſome heſitation;—offered to pay her father's debts;—but the return he demanded was her perſon. She ſtarted with horror at the infamous propoſal,—caſt a moſt indignant frown at the Count,—but remained ſilent. His former ſoftneſs, his wonted delicacy, ſeemed now to have vaniſhed.—With the moſt ſupercilious air, he exclaimed, "Triumph then, madam, in your virtue, ſince it keeps a father in priſon;" and immediately walked out of the room.</p>
            <p>Pauline, who had with difficulty reſtrained her tears from flowing, now gave them copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous vent Lamentable, indeed, was her ſituation!

ſeparated from an impriſoned father, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that ſhe had given her affections to an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject totally unworthy of them, yet in the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries which her father endured, her own diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment was almoſt forgotten, or ſeemed a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle "<hi>light as air.</hi>" The departing words of the count ſunk deep into her heart: ſhe weighed her own happineſs with that of her father; ſhe doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed whether to neglect any means of ſetting him free deſerved the name of virtue; and this doubt, by the frequent indulgence of it, was at length reduced to a certainty. With a mind agitated, diſtracted, ſhe wrote a ſhort billet to the count, in which ſhe acquainted him, that ſhe was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to acquieſce in his propoſal. He had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected this effect, and therefore was not ſurpriſed at it. On the wings of impatience he flew to his afflicted <hi>protegee</hi>—he found her on her knees—hardened as his heart was, he felt a momentary ſenſation of pity.—Stifling it however, he ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the hand of Pauline, and poured forth a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of grateful acknowledgments. She did not anſwer them; but diſengaging her hands, lifted them up to heaven—her eyes ſtreaming with tears—"God of all!" ſhe lobbed out, <q>thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt the purity of my intentions:—thou art able to penetrate into the motive of my conduct:—on my afflicted head, Oh! therefore lay not the heavy hand of thy diſpleaſure!</q>
            </p>

Pauline was in conſequence completed. Her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's ranſom thus dearly paid, ſhe inſiſted on his immediate liberation. The count affected an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant compliance, and ſoon after informed her that the debts of De Rivieres were diſcharged; but that he intended to remain a ſhort time in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris on buſineſs of importance. This was not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually what ſhe wiſhed: ſhe had expected a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from her father: ſhe wept, but was obliged to appear contented.</p>
            <p>Two months had now elapſed ſince the fatal day on which ſhe had ſurrendered her honor. The count's tenderneſs had for ſome time gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally decreaſed. Her tears that flowed inceſſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, her uneaſineſs at her father's long delay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came tireſome and offenſive to him. He reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to get rid of them—The taſk to ſuch a heart was not difficult. In the moſt unfeeling manner, he diſcloſed to her the villainy of which he had been guilty;—and informed her, that her father was ſtill in priſon, where ſhe was now at liberty to viſit him. To deſcribe Pauline's ſenſations at this diſcovery would require the utmoſt efforts of a Sterne's genius, and is perhaps beyond the powers of language. After a long ſeries of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſive fits, ſhe loſt entirely the faculty of reaſon. In this ſituation, by means of that impoſing ſubtlety which the inſane often poſſeſs, ſhe ſtole out of the houſe with an intention of travelling on foot to Paris. How her tender frame endured the fatigues of ſuch a journey, or how ſhe accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed it, is known to him only, who "<hi>tempers the wind to the ſhorn lamb.</hi>" She arrived in the
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:034525_0163_0FFE1AE7E2CED7C8"/>
metropolis on that memorable day, in which the Baſtile was ſtormed and taken by the people. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible to the firing of the cannon, and to every object around her, ſhe ſeated herſelf on a ſtone at the gate of the priſon. Her attention was at laſt ſomewhat rouſed by the ſhouts of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.—She lifted up her head.—Two ſoldiers were ſupporting an old man, whom they had juſt libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from one of the dungeons. Pauline glanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her eyes towards him, and immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cogniſed her father. Her reaſon returned in an inſtant—ſhe darted through the crowd, and fell at his feet—"Oh my father! behold your Pauline." His ear quickly caught ſhe well-known ſound—he threw his arms round his daughter's, and ſank down with her in that fond embrace.</p>
            <p>The crowd, affected at the ſight, withdrew to a reſpectful diſtance. Every tongue was huſhed into ſilence, while every heart melted with ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy. As ſoon as De Rivieres could ſpeak, he enquired how ſhe came there.—"The count De B—informed me that you were in priſon."—De Rivieres haſtily interrupted. "Oh! execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble villain!—Oh, ſon of infamy—To him I flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered myſelf I ſhould owe riches and honors.—How cruelly was I deceived!—I arrived in Paris with fond hopes of obtaining future happineſs for my child—I was ſeized, and ſent to the Baſtile. The count, the perfidious count, was the occaſion of it."—Pauline ſtarted with horror—"But the letters,"—ſhe exclaimed, "they contained intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence far different from the preſent."—"What letters? I ſent none." Pauline ſhuddered—
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:034525_0164_0FFE1AEDB8CB3710"/>
None!—Oh God!" She reſted her head upon her father's neck, ſcarce able to breathe. On his repeated enquiries in the meaning of her laſt exclamation, ſhe briefly related to him the deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laid treachery, which the count had practiſed; informed him of the letters, and the ſubſequent propoſal—"But, my Pauline" ſaid the father, with eager interruption, "rejected it"—Oh! pardon—pardon! acquieſced<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to releaſe a father from priſon."—De Rivieres eyes flaſhed fire:—he clenched his hand, and held it to his forehead, but ſpoke not a word. He ſurveyed his child with looks of anger and reproach. Pauline trembled, and fell on her knees, claſping, her hands for pardon. The flood of tenderneſs returned immediately into the father's breaſt. He raiſed Pauline, and folded her in his arms—"My God!—my God! thou, haſt filled up the meaſure of my woes—but—but thy will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

De Rivieres felt his end approaching faſt:—he called his child to his bed ſide—"Pauline!

            <p>Pauline, oppreſſed, convulſed with grief, could not utter a word.

            <p>THE benevolent heart which perſiſts in an act of beneficence, notwithſtanding all the malicious cenſures of meaner minds, incapable of underſtanding its noble and diſintereſted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, is doubly praiſe-worthy; and it ſometimes happens that it does not loſe its reward in the ſenſe even of the votaries of ſelf-intereſt, inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent of that which it receives from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs of doing good to others.</p>
            <p>Lucinda Harvey was a young lady of a moſt amiable perſon, and a truly generous and ſuſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible heart. She had loſt her father in her early youth, and had lived with her mother, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided in a village at no great diſtance from Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, on a ſmall jointure. They were not rich, but they were ſatisfied and happy; and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:034525_0167_0FFE1AF72A79B7E0"/>
of their deportment procured them the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teem and friendſhip of all their neighbours.</p>
            <p>I happened, that, one evening, as ſhe walked out in a little cloſe behind the houſe, ſhe found a female infant of about a twelvemonth old, lying on the ground, and crying piteouſly. The child had evidently been deſerted a few hours before, by ſome perſon, who had left it there to periſh, or be preſerved by chance. Lucinda took it up, and brought it in to her mother. Every enquiry was made to diſcover the perſon who had thus deſerted it, but every enquiry proved fruitleſs. The child, however, by its beauty, and helpleſs ſituation, won ſo much on the feeling heart of the tender Lucinda, that ſhe perſuaded her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not to reſign it to the rigours of a pariſh maintenance; but let it be brot up with them, as if it were her faſten. "It can require but little," ſaid ſhe, "and who can ſay how amply Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence may repay us." The infant had hanging round its neck, when it was found, the minature portrait of a gentleman, with the air and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of which Lucinda felt herſelf much impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and frequently noticed to her mother the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legance of the figure, and how ably the painter had diſplayed his art.</p>

But in the world in which we live, it is not to be ſuppoſed that ſo good, ſo generous a deed, ſhould entirely eſcape the inſinuations of the mean, or the cenſures of the malignant. The tea-table tattlers, Miſs Vapid, Miſs Reſtleſs, Miſs Prattle, and Miſs Sneer, met on the occaſion, and decreed, <hi>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>As Lucinda's perſonal and mental accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments had given much ſecret offence to many of her female acquaintances, the deſtruction of her character became a delicious treat to them, and more than one gentleman of fortune, who was on the point of making honorable and advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous propoſals to Lucinda, were deterred from it by theſe buzzing ſlanders. Still, however, ſhe remained firm; ſhe ſtill treated the child as her ſiſter or daughter; deigned to give no anſwer to the baſe inſinuations of little minds; nor would ſhe as her mother wiſhed, conſent to leave the place where ſuch baſe reports had been circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, ten long years had rolled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and Lucinda had not even received any ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:034525_0169_0FFE1AFA3A5CA0C8"/>
offers of marriage; and as ſhe was now eight and twenty, tho her charms yet ſhone in all their luſtre, her envious rivals enjoyed their tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, and began to hope the time approaching, when they might confer on her the title of Old Maid.</p>
            <p>About this time it chanced that a Mr. Horton, a gentleman who had gone out to India ſome years before, and very rapidly made a fortune, returning home to enjoy the fruits of his good ſucceſs in his native country, purchaſed a houſe and eſtate in the neighborhood of the village in which Lucinda and her mother reſided. He met with Lucinda at the aſſembly, and being pleaſed with her converſation, made ſeveral viſits to her and her mother. Lucinda had remarked, the firſt time ſhe ſaw him, the ſtrong reſemblance there was between his features and thoſe of the portrait ſhe had found on the deſerted Laura, for by that name ſhe had called the child ſhe had found and protected: and this reſemblance excit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in her breaſt a kind of eſteem for him, before ſhe became acquainted with the good qualites of his heart and underſtanding.</p>
            <p>But the ſcandalous reports that had been ſo long circulated to the diſcredit of Lucinda, were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriouſly tranſmitted to Mr. Horton's ear; the conſequence of which was, that his viſits became much leſs frequent, and his behaviour to that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſenſibly different from what it had hitherto been.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="167" facs="unknown:034525_0170_0FFE1AFD17814DB0"/>
Lucinda, now, for the firſt time, felt that the venomed ſhafts of ſlander could reach her, and deſtroy her peace tho Mr. Horton had too much politeneſs to give even the ſlighteſt hint of the cauſe of the alteration in his behaviour towards her, ſhe eaſily conceived from what ſource it aroſe, and the firſt opportunity that preſented, related to him with equal candor and emotion, the ſtory of her finding the child, and the ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent attacks made on her character by malicious ſcandal. This ſhe declared, and declared with the truth, was the firſt time ſhe had felt any pain from theſe inſinuations, and the firſt time ſhe had ever attempted to defend herſelf, and ſhe had on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done it now becauſe ſhe could not bear to loſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 words">

               </gap> me he would liſten for a moment to ſuch falſe and malicius ſuggeſtions, when he had heard the truth. She ended by ſhowing him the picture ſhe had found with the child.</p>
            <p>Mr. Horton viewed the picture with equal ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe and emotion; he inſtantly knew it for his own portrait, and the child for his own daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. "Madam," ſaid he, "your innocence is apparent indeed; ſuffer me to confeſs my folly and my fault. This picture is my portrait; it has marks on it which preclude all doubt, and your Laura is my daughter. Before I went to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia, I had a connection (not greatly to my ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor) with a woman of mean character, by whom I had this child. I left with her what money I
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:034525_0171_0FFE1B029D1E6C08"/>
could ſpare, and made ſeveral remittances; but could never learn what become of her. Since my return I have made every enquiry, but have only been able to learn that ſoon after I left her, ſhe went to live with ſome fellow of a character ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar to her own, and has not been heard of ſince. It is probable they abandoned the child as an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſment. Your tenderneſs and generous kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs have preſerved it! and if I am ſo fortunate as to be agreeable to you, my hand, my fortune, and my heart, ſhall be yours."</p>
            <p>In a ſhort time after, Lucinda was married to Mr. Horton, and, triumphing over every ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ſuggeſtion, became, by law, the mother of her adopted child.</p>

the emancipation of its country, on an elevated and advantageous ſpot, near which the majeſtic Frome now winds its way thro the fertile Dorſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian meadows, Harold, a potent and ambitious Dane, held a ſtrong and well-fortified caſtle, and ſtretched over all the adjacent country the iron rod of unfeeling deſpotiſm. In the plenitude of unoppoſed power, he became notorious for thoſe acts of violence and oppreſſion, which rendered his unhappy vaſſals ever uneaſy and inſecure, even in poſſeſſion of the ſimple rights of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>On the verge of his ample dominions, in the moſt diſtant and intricate receſs of an extenſive and gloomy foreſt, the oppreſſed Edmund—tho deſcended from a long race of worthy Britons—fixed his humble reſidence, removed as far as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible from the vicinage of his imperious lord, to whom he failed not to pay due homage and cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary tribute.

Harold had ſelected all the fineſt youth of his domains, of whom where com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the guards of his caſtle. Edgar therefore was enrolled in the number; and with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt reluctance, doomed to waſte his prime, confin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

within the fortreſs, ſubſervient to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates of the wretch he deſpiſed. The arouſed indignation of the honeſt plebeians was ſcarcely reſtrained from burſting forth into action, by the whiſpers of caution, or the admonitions of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. Yet cruel deſtiny waited to inflict a deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er wound on the peace of Edmund! Druſilla, the adored partner of his bed, was confeſſedly one of the moſt lovely women of her day: in her, to a beautiful face, an intelligent mind, and a ſweet diſpoſition, were united a ſuperiority of fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, and the moſt exact ſymmetry of features—
<q>
                  <l>Grace was in her ſteps; heav'n in her eyes;</l>
                  <l>In ev'ry geſture dignity and love.</l>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The fame of this accompliſhed female could not fail to reach and intereſt the ear of ſuch a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuary as Harold. By his authoritative com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, the fair victim was torn from the arms of her diſtracted huſband, in order to gratify the lawleſs appetite of that tyrant. On her arrival at the caſtle, the beauties of her perſon and the firmneſs of her behavior, impreſſed a kind of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verential awe and aſtoniſhment on all who ſaw her. Such dauntleſs and intripid virtue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded even Harold himſelf, who ſought in vain to win her to his deſires, by the moſt ſpecious arts and ſeductive promiſes, determining, if poſſible, to conciliate her favor by kind and gentle means, rather than force her inclination by auſterity and violence. Day after day he repeated his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>views, and redoubled his fruitleſs ſolicitations; during which time ſhe experienced the greateſt marks of reſpect, and was allowed every indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:034525_0175_0FFE1B0E15AC1498"/>
ſave that of liberty, and the ſociety of a beloved huſband, whoſe de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>r idea was ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to her mind, and thoſe whoſe fate ſhe mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with inconſolable anguiſh.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile the generous Edwin, unknown to Druſilla, with great difficulty and danger, had found means to give information to Edmund, and concert a ſcheme for the delivery of the fair cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. Many of the guard were in his intereſt; and, as their lord was held in equal deteſtation, many others waited only for an opportunity to do juſtice to themſelves, their friends, and their country, by launching the bolt of vengeance on the devoted head of the common enemy.</p>
            <p>Edmund was much eſteemed by the little cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of his friends; and, fired with reſentment for the injuries he had ſuſtained, they vowed to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſe the cauſe and aſſiſt his enterprize.</p>
            <p>Things at the caſtle now began to wear a more ſerious aſpect. Impatient of repeated repulſes in his illicit purſuit, Harold, growing irritated and enraged, commanded Druſilla to be confined to the dungeon, with a view to enforce that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance, which kindneſs and artifice had attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in vain; and ſhe was given to underſtand, that he had fixed a time, beyond which his forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance would be no longer dallied with.</p>
            <p>The important day, deſtined for the ſacrifice of virtue, at length arrived. Druſilla had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared herſelf for the iſſue. She had concealed, under her flowing robe, a daggar which ſhe had
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:034525_0176_0FFE1B0F999D9A18"/>
fortunately ſecured, and reſolved to have recourſe to, if reduced to ſuch an exigence, in defence of her honor. The evening cloſed dark and tempeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous; the country was huſhed to reſt; not a ſound was heard, ſave that of the driving ſtorm, howling thro the ſurrounding elms, and beating againſt the gloomy battlements, when ſhe receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the dreaded, tho not unexpected, ſummons, She was conducted, in reſpectful ſilence, to the great hall of the caſtle, where the haughty chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain waited to receive her. He was ſeated on a throne of ſtate; and the apartment was hung a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round with all the pompous inſignia of war, the victorious trophies of his conquering anceſtors. Every appearance ſeemed adapted to impreſs ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and demand ſubmiſſion. The guards were ordered to withdraw; when, with his own hand, he bolted the maſſy folding-doors, while his eyes ſparkled with libidinous triumph.</p>
            <p>As the long-purſued ſtag, after having forded the rapid river, ſcaled the lofty cliff, and pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated the thickeſt wood, finding every expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ineffectual, ſtands at bay, and fiercely turns his antlered front on his blood-thirſty foes; ſo ſtood the dauntleſs heroine, alone, collecting all her fortitude to oppoſe the aſſailant of her virtue.</p>

He ſaid; and ruſhing forwards to ſeize her, ſhe ſnatched the fatal weapon from beneath her robe, and plunged it in his boſom. He recoiled a few paces; planted his hands on the wound; ſunk down; and, with a deep groan, expired.</p>

            <p>She had ſcarcely leiſure to reflect on her criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſituation, before her ears were aſſailed with ſounds of tumult and confuſion; from which ſhe immediately conjectured, that the cataſtrophe was by ſome means diſcovered, and ſhe expected
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:034525_0178_0FFE1B142FF4A450"/>
no leſs than to be dragged to inſtantaneous execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The ſounds approached ſtill nearer: the doors were violently agitated, and, in a moment, flew open. A number of armed men ruſhed in. With an exultant mein, and a mind ſuperior to dread, ſhe exclaimed—"Vaſſals of a tyrant! behold your lord! My triumph is complete! Here—here, wreck all your rage! But ſpare my Edmund! Spare—" "Beſt, and braveſt of women! (cried Edmund, ruſhing forward, and claſping her to his breaſt), ſpare thy ſolicitudes; even in this place thou art ſafe. Theſe, all theſe, are our common friends; they are no longer the panders of vice, but the protectors of virtue: to theſe I owe my introduction to this impregnable fortreſs. Edwin's courage and conduct inſpired them with ardour to let down the draw-bridge, and force the ſtrong doors; and, had not thy va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorous hand anticipated the deed, even now the tyrant had fallen, amidſt his own guards, by the arms of thoſe on whom he relied for protection. This very ſpot is now become the ſeat of liberty! On theſe walls WE fix her flowing banners!"</p>
            <p>Mutual joy, congratulations, and unfeigned vows of eternal concord and amity, concluded the ſcene; when, loaded with ſpoils, and exult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their recorable receſſes of the foreſt; and, in defiance of every oppoſition, long enjoyed the bleſſings which their heroiſm had ſo nobly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured.</p>

            <p>SERENA Granville, with a figure lovely as if formed by the fingers of Love, poſſeſſed a mind fraught with every accompliſhment, of the moſt refined and delicate taſte.

She deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed the cruel deſpotiſm of tyrannizing over a generous heart; and ſhe heſitated not to confeſs the power which he poſſeſſed in her boſom. For family-reaſons, two months were to elapſe before the day could be appointed for their union.

               </gap>ither. "I would venture my life," cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Serena, "that he is a conceited fellow; a creature who can admire none but himſelf. I have a ſtrong inclination to play him a trick."—"How do you mean? you do not know him."—"That is of no conſequence. I will write to him, that I am violently in love with him, &amp;c. &amp;c. ſubſcribe a falſe name; and deſire him to direct to the Salopian Coffeehouſe, where my ſervant ſhall call for his reply."—"Good heavens, Sere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na! what an inſtanteneous arrangement! You are ſurely not ſerious?"—"Yes, ſerious as when I ſhall my give hand to Frederick, and vow to be his for ever, I will write the letter this moment:" She ſeized a pen, and immediately began to ſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Julia was thunderſtruck. "What is your intention? The young man will certainly anſwer your letter."—"That is what I want. I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply again; and ſo on, till I have worked him up almoſt to madneſs with curioſity! and then I throw away my quill, and leave him like an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed knight, dropped by the fairies in a wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Diſcovery is impoſſible."</p>
            <p>When ſhe had finiſhed her epiſtle, ſhe read it to her friend. It contained an eloquent avowal of a fervent attachment, which ſhe could no longer conceal; that her heart, hand, and fortune wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his acceptance; and that ſhe ſhould anticipate, with trembling anxiety, his reply, addreſſed to

Miſs Lucretia Manners, to be left at the Salopi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Coffeehouſe. In vain were all the remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances of Miſs Cecil againſt the imprudence and dangers of this ſcheme. Her couſin perſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in her deſign; declaring, that it was only a frolic; and there could no evil conſequences en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue, as he could never find them out; and they would ſurely not be ſuch fools as to betray their own ſecret. Accordingly, the next morning, ſhe ſent off her <hi>billet-d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uxe,</hi> directed to Richard Wade, Eſq. St. James's Hotel.</p>
            <p>The following day, at noon, ſhe ordered her ſervant to call at the Salopian, and inquire for a letter, addreſſed as ſhe had deſired. The two girls, from different motives, were equally anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious for the return of the footman. At laſt he entered, and gave into the impatient hands of his young lady the wiſhed-for ſcroll. When he left the room, ſhe tore open the ſeal, and peruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with a greedy eye; then read, with a voice almoſt ſuffocated with laughter, a long ſtring of rhapſodies. He commenced with an inundation of praiſes of generoſity of her diſpoſition, that could ſo nobly burſt thro the diſgraceful ſhackles bound round her ſex, by the united efforts of all mankind, to render him happy by the confeſſion of a paſſion ſo flattering to his warmeſt wiſhes. He concluded by ſaying, that if the beauty of her perſon but half equalled the charms of the mind which dictated her letter, he ſhould for ever eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teem it the moſt bliſsful moment of his life that preſented him to her view. He ended by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſting as immediate interview. Serena was
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:034525_0184_0FFE1B26ADDF39A0"/>
mad with joy at the ſucceſs of her plot, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly ſat down to ſcribble an anſwer. Julia a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain urged her to deſiſt; but all to no purpoſe: ſhe would plague him yet a little longer. In this imprudent conduct ſhe continued for near a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, writing and receiving letters every day; and, in almoſt every one of them, inventing new excuſes for denying a perſonal converſation. Richard Wade's impatience, in each ſucceeding epiſtle, increaſed ſo much, that he could hardly find reaſons for her refuſals, which could appear of any conſequence, as in his replies ſhe had ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to combat, and conquer them all. Miſs Cecil grew more alarmed; and begged her, for Heaven's ſake, to give it up; for ſhe dreaded the moſt diſagreeable effects, ſhould it be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered: but Serena was obſtinate, declared that it was impoſſible, and continued the correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
            <p>One morning, when Miſs Granville ſat alone in the drawing-room, waiting the return of her ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant from the Salopian, ſhe inſenſibly fell into a reverie; and, leaning her blooming cheek on her white arm, which reſted on the ſopha, her thots wandered from the anticipation of that day which was ſoon to give her to her dear Frederick, to the elegant ſailor, and his diſappointment, when ſhe ſhould drop anſwering his letters. At this moment, the gentle Cavendiſh entered; he had ſtolen the firſt inſtant from military duty, to ſpend a few bliſsful minutes in the ſociety of his adored Serena. He approached her unperceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:034525_0185_0FFE1B28352197D0"/>
and, tenderly taking her hand, in a voice, ſweet as the ſofteſt ſigh of love, demanded what was the ſubject of her reflections. She ſtarted at the ſound of his loved accents, and bluſhed at the queſtion. The idea that any other man than himſelf ſhould for one inſtant poſſeſs her thots, ſtruck a chill to her heart: the vivid glow of ſhame, which diffuſed itſelf over her cheek, flaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ray of truth on her underſtanding; and her ſoul acknowledged, with gratitude and ſelf-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, the rejected remonſtrances of her friend.</p>
            <p>As the heavenly orbs of Frederick were bent on her's with ineffable tenderneſs, he beheld with wonder and anguiſh, the confuſion into which his queſtion appeared to have thrown her. "Have I given you pain, my Serena? I was impertinent; but, believe me, I did not intend it. Will you pardon me?" He preſſed her hand, to give force to his aſſevaration. "I have nothing to pardon; you did not hurt me: I was only aſhamed to ſpeak the truth; for I was realy thinking of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing." She bluſhed ſtill deeper, as ſhe uttered this falſehood, and caſt her eyes down to conceal her embarraſſment. The penetrating orbs of Cavendiſh were fixed on her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>: he obſerved its changes with an unaccountable anguiſh; and unconſciouſly drooping her hand, with a deep ſigh, roſe from his chair, and advanced to the window. At this inſtant, the door burſt open, and a young man ruſhing in, flung his himſelf at the feet of Miſs Granville, exclaiming—"Have I found my myſterious love! By Heaven, no earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly power ſhall tear your lovely form from this
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:034525_0186_0FFE1B2CA145F1C0"/>
faithful boſom!" Suddenly riſing, he claſped her to his breaſt. Cavendiſh, who ſtood petrified with aſtoniſhment and indignation, now ruſhed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; and, ſeizing Wade by the arm, rudely pulled him from his hold, and demanded who he was.</p>
            <p>"This lady's lover and protector, Sir," repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he, in a threatening tone. Serena, wild and dumb with terror, threw herſelf into the arms of Frederick; who ſmothering his paſſion cried—"You are certainly mad, Sir! This is a woman of virtue, and my betrothed wife; I therefore deſire you to leave this houſe inſtantly." "No, Sir, I ſhall not, without ſhe accompanies me. I have letters under her own hand, declaring her love for me, and her abhorrence of all other men. She will not deny it; but I ſuppoſe, you are the perſecuting coward ſhe complains of." The azure eyes of Cavendiſh ſtaſhed all heaven's lightings; he caſt the frantic Serena from his arm; and ruſhing forward—"Intruding, inſolent villain! your blood ſhall blot the falſehood." So ſaying, he drew, and made a furious paſs at him with his ſword. Wade expected it; and, parrying the thruſt, made a lounge at him, and ran him thro the ſide. The unfortunate Frederick fell; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> he advanced to Serena, who ſtood rivetted like a ſtatue of Deſpair. "Come, my Lucretia! let us fly this place, my life is in danger." "Monſter! murderer!" ſcreamed ſhe; and giving him a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent puſh from her, threw him to the ground, and flew ſhrieking out of the room. In this fall, he ſtumbled over a part of Frederick's ſword, as it leaned againſt the lifeleſs form of its maſter.
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:034525_0187_0FFE1B2F7966D6E8"/>
before he could recover himſelf, it ran him quite thro the thigh; and he dropped, bleeding and faint, beſide the body of him he had ſlain. All the horrors of his ſituation ruſhed on his mind. He knew not him he had killed—perhaps an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured man; and he had forfeited his own life for, perhaps, an abandoned woman!</p>
            <p>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> In a few minutes, the room was crowded with people. Julia flew into the apartment; and, ſeeing the breathleſs form of Cavendiſh on the floor, and near him the young ſailor bleeding to death, an explanation of the whole affair ruſhed on her memory. She flung herſelf between the two bodies; and, tearing off her white drapery, attempted to ſtaunch the wounds of both; while ſhe beſought, for God's ſake, that ſome one would fly for a ſurgeon. Her commands were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly obeyed. Serena was held in a ſtate of madneſs at the door, by her mother and two ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, begging that ſhe might be ſuffered to go in, and die on the boſom of her Frederick. The ſurgeon arriving, ordered <hi>her</hi> to her cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber—to which ſhe was hurried, raving of her folly and miſery—and immediately proceeded to the aſſiſtance of the two unfortunate officers. Mr. Wade was yet ſenſible; the bandages of Miſs Cecil had ſtopped the effuſion of blood: but poor Cavendiſh lay without motion or ſenſation. As the ſurgeon advanced to the ſide of the young ſailor, he by a ſtrong exertion repulſed him, and begged that he would firſt examine the wound of his antagoniſt, which he hoped was not mortal. Mr. A—obeyed his deſires; and, ordering the
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:034525_0188_0FFE1B325542F288"/>
ſervants to lay Cavendiſh on the ſopha, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every one, but his own aſſiſtants, to leave the room. When the ſurgeon had examined and dreſſed the wounds of the young men, he ſaw them carefully put to bed, and ordered them to be kept in profound quiet. As he was going down ſtairs, Lady Granville, in a ſtate of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, ſent for him into her <hi>boudoir,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated him to tell her if there were any hopes for Mr. Cavendiſh. Mr. A—ſaid he would not flatter her: his wound was not mortal; but his loſs of blood had been ſo great, that the moſt fatal conſequences might be expected. "But the other gentleman, (continued he), if he is kept free from a fever, will certainly recover." "Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> other gentleman, (replied ſhe), I know nothing about. Indeed, I am ignorant of the whole af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair. My daughter flew into my chamber, ſcreaming—"He is killed! Cavendiſh is kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led!" and this is all I know of the terrible ſcene, as ſhe has ever ſince been in a ſtate of delirium. At theſe words, the phyſician, who had been ſent for to Serena, while Mr. A—was with her lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, entered the room, and told Lady Granville that her daughter was in a high fever, and muſt be kept compoſed, elſe he could not anſwer for her life.</p>
            <p>In this ſtate of diſtreſs and anxiety things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue for three days. Miſs Cecil, who knew well the thotleſs tranſaction of her coſin, imagined too truly the cauſe of this fatal cataſtrophe; and, while all the parties yet lived, ſhe earneſtly
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:034525_0189_0FFE1B352F2FE520"/>
ſought an opportunity of explaining ſo ſad a myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery. She tenderly loved her friend: ſhe mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the wild vivacity of diſpoſition that had ſeduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her into ſo imprudent an action; and her heart was wrung with agony for her preſent, and if ſhe lived future ſufferings. The inſinuating gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſs of Frederick Cavendiſh had made too deep an impreſſion on her eſteem, not to draw down the bitter tears from her eyes, when ſhe contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plated his unhappy fate. But the beautiful, the deceived Wade! when his lovely idea ſhot acroſe her diſtracted fancy, her whole ſoul was torn with torture: the thot of his dying, of his recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and of that recovery's diſgraceful, horrid conſequences, almoſt bereft her of her reaſon; and, impelled by the anguiſh of the moment, ſhe flew to the entrance of his apartment, with what deſign ſhe knew not. As ſhe gently opened the door, ſhe found that he was in a profound ſlumber; and, commanding the nurſe to go and lay down for a few hours, promiſed to watch by her charge till her return. She remained near half an hour in the room; Richard awaking from his ſleep, and heaving a deep ſigh, ſtretched forth his arm and drew aſide the curtain. When his dark eyes met thoſe of Miſs Cecil, he felt an unuſual emotion at his breaſt: an emotion of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, hope, and dread.</p>
            <p>She aroſe; and, gently advancing nearer to him, inquired in a tremblig voice—which too plainly expreſſed the intereſt which ſhe took in his ſituation—how he found himſelf. He replied, that he was better than he wiſhed to be; for the
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:034525_0190_0FFE1B36F46B8E40"/>
feelings of his mind were more than he could endure with fortitude. "If my adverſary dies," continued he, "and I ſurvive, even ſhould I eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape the puniſhment of the law, I ſhall over be wretched at the recollection of ſo dreadful an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of my credulity and raſhneſs." He was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding to give Miſs Cecil a narrative of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence between him and Miſs Granville; firſt, expreſſing his anxiety and doubts about the myſtery which enveloped the whole affair; when Julia interrupted him, by ſaying, that ſhe knew it to well, and long ago had warned her couſin of its evil effects. "But," continued ſhe, "had I felt the diſtant foreboding of this its fatal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion. I would have uſed commands, inſtead of entreaties, to have ſtopped the deception." "De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception! How, Madam, was it deception? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I am a ſtranger to your friend! What could be her meaning?" "An idle frolic, without deſign or end, but to entertain herſelf. She thot to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſe her whimſical moments with an adventure, which certainly was innocent, tho imprudent. She conceived, that ſhe could lay it aſide when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhe pleaſed; but, alas! how agonizingly otherwiſe has been its termination!"—Agoniz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, indeed! Moſt probably, ſhe has tendered both her own heart and mine miſerable for life. Horrid as muſt be my feelings, yet how much more racking muſt be hers, when ſhe recollects that it was her conduct that put the ſword in my hand, and plunged it into the boſom of her affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anced huſband! Could ſhe imagine, that any man would receive ſuch letters as thoſe which ſhe wrote to me, and not feel his whole ſoul fired
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:034525_0191_0FFE1B3C9C72AF30"/>
with curioſity? At leaſt, the impetuoſity of <hi>my</hi> nature ſpurned at reſtraint; and my impatience hurried me to the coffeehouſe, where I watched till her ſervant called for my letter: when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned home, I followed him; and theſe, theſe, are the overwhelming conſequences!" His ſtrength was exhauſted, and he ſunk back on his pillow. Julia, conſcious that ſhe was hurting the man, for whom—the feelings of her heart too forcibly told her—ſhe felt that in reality which her couſin ſo fatally feigned, haſtily aroſe; and, entreating him to compoſe his mind, ſaid ſhe would ſnatch the firſt opportunity to impart the truth of the melancholy ſtory to Cavendiſh; whoſe principal danger, ſhe believed, reſted on the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured ſtate of his ſpirit. He caught her hand; and, fervently preſſing it, ſhe darted out of the room, the ſoft touch of his hand thrilling to her inmoſt ſoul. In the evening, ſhe ſent up her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate compliments to Mr. Cavendiſh; and, if he would admit her, ſhe would be happy to watch an hour by him alone. He replied, that he wiſhed to ſee her. She aſcended the ſtairs, her heart beating with hope and fear of the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of what ſhe was going to reveal</p>
            <p>When ſhe entered his chamber, and drew near his bed, ſhe beheld the late blooming Frederick pale as marble: the effulgent luſtre of his azure eyes was almoſt extinguiſhed; the laſt gleams of its fading light ſeemed reſting on the dark horizon of death, as if to take a laſt view of the world, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ers; and gazed at her with an expreſſion that
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:034525_0192_0FFE1B3E21E0A738"/>
needed no explanation: it penetrated to her heart, and ſhe, burſt into tears. Recovering herſelf, ſhe ſaid, "Mr. Cavendiſh, will you—can I hope for your pardon? I have been, in a great part, the cauſe of the diſmal ſcene that is now before me." "You, Julia! How? For Heaven's ſake, explain; and either diſſipate my ſuſpicions, or convince me they are true, and end my tortures by killing me. O! is Serena unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of my love?" Miſs Cecil, with a faultering voice, interrupted by many ſhowers of tears, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed the whole tranſaction; only a little alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the truth, by as much as poſſible meliorating the folly of her friend, and taking the blame on herſelf. When ſhe ended, the dejected orbs of Frederick beamed with renovated radiance; he claſped his hands in an extaſy of joy. "O! my God, I thank thee! Julia, my kind friend! fly to my unhappy Serena: tell her that I forgive her; ſpeak peace to her ſuffering ſoul; and tell her to live for me. To know that my dear girl is innocent, and yet fondly loves me, has infuſed new life into my dying frame. Fly, my dear Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia, and render your ſweet friend as happy as my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf!" She roſe, her eyes overflowing with tears of rapture; and, advancing to the door, turned back two or three ſteps, and faintly breathed, in a trembling voice, "And may I not alſo tell the unfortunate Wade, that you forgive the raſhneſs which, endangering your exiſtence, has brot him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the verge of the grave?" "Yes, Julia; tell him every thing that you would wiſh me to ſay."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="190" facs="unknown:034525_0193_0FFE1B3FD119B750"/>
Julia flew to the chamber of Miſs Granville: her delirium was ſubſided; but it had left on her languid frame a ſlow fever, and on her mind a deep and ſettled melancholy. Miſs Cecil, with ſome difficulty, gained her couſin's attention. Nowithſtanding her utmoſt precaution, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected and bliſsful intelligence rendered her al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt frantic with joy. Nothing now was want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but the recovery of all parties, to make them perfectly happy. A few weeks gave once more ſtrength to their limbs, and beauty to their features: Health caſt her dazzling rays around their forms; ſo powerful an effect had the ſereni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their minds over the compoſure of their frames. Frederick Cavendiſh, and Richard Wade, entered the drawing-room together. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rena, overwhelmed with conſciouſneſs, burſt into tears, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ung herſelf on the breaſt of her cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin. Her lover flew forward; and, gently raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her from her boſom, encircled his graceful arms around her yielding waiſt; and, while his tears mingled with hers, imprinted the hallowed kiſs of pardon and affection on her trembling lips.</p>
            <p>The ſympathiſing heart of Julia heaved almoſt to burſting, and the lucid drops of extatic emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion fell on her ivory arms; when the well-known touch of the ſoft hand of Richard Wade, rouſed her from her bliſsful trance.

The charms they employ to break the enchantments, are flattery, falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, proteſtations to the Deity to witneſs <hi>their love!</hi> The ſpell ſucceeds: the tower, with all its gilded turrets, ſhakes, and tumbles in ruins!</p>
            <p>Let me behold the conſequences of this crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal conduct. A lovely daughter is brot up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the care of, what is commonly called, the fondeſt parents. She is deluded under the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of marriage, or, allow that the deluſion ſucceeded without ſuch promiſe: the fond pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents tear their hair and weep bitterly; but
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:034525_0196_0FFE1B4B1B1FE8A0"/>
they order their daughter to be driven from the houſe. They weep for the diſhonor that has hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to their name; and to cure this diſhonor they ſpread the infamy; and drive out their deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent to repeat the crime.</p>
            <p>The hiſtory of the counteſs, is not ſufficiently known. I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> contains an awfully intereſting leſſon to parents, and diſplays the fatal effects of a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous treatment of their offspring. It was the apprehenſion of a rigorous treatment from a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of a violent temper that occaſioned the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries of Maria Feodorovna. She was a lady of diſtinguiſhed rank and fortune, the only daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a nobleman.</p>
            <p>During the early period of her life, her edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation was anxiouſly attended to by the beſt of mothers, whoſe ſoul bore upon it the impreſſion of every noble feeling and virtue. The mother, while ſhe held her favorite daughter before the glaſs, ſaw an exact copy of herſelf in form of body; and the never-ceaſing ſmile upon the cheeks and lips of Maria ſeemed to beſpeak an equally beautiful copy of her mind. The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther died: and the youthful Ruſſian counteſs, from the love and care of her mother, from the polite and elegant round of a court, and from the ſociety of her dear Markoff, who was enrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured with this amiable female, was hurried by the haughty baron to a diſtant eſtate amid the wilds of Ruſſia.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="194" facs="unknown:034525_0197_0FFE1B4CC7BB9D40"/>
Here, ſurrounded with deſerts, nor viewing one object that could bring ſome happy compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in thot between them and paſt ſcenes, the lovely Maria exhauſted her boſom in ſobs, and watered her pillow with tears.</p>
            <p>The ſociety of count Markoff could have lighted up this deſert, and diſpelled thoſe tears. Diſappointed ambition had occaſioned a miſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding between the two families, and the name of Markoff was forbid even to be mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the houſe of the baron. His fondneſs for his lovely daughter could not overcome his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence of his ſucceſsful rival, the father of young Markoff; nor permit him to entertain the moſt diſtant idea of that connection which he knew was the ardent wiſh of the youthful pair. His brows darkened with rage, when he ſaw one of his blood who wiſhed not deſtruction to the houſe of Markoff.</p>
            <p>Maria was kept in perpetual agony by this unfortunate diſpoſition in her parent, yet forced to affect an indifference to all ſhe loved, while ſhe daily drooped and pined in ſilent melancholy. But no affectation could bring back the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> health which had lately painted her cheeks; and her languid ſmiles and action were diſeaſed co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies of that lively manner which had diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her in happier days. The innocent mirth, un<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mixed with care, born in the lap of childhood, and expiring with it, was never again to return. Maria was not even deſtined to enjoy that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs to which her virtue entitled her. In vain
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:034525_0198_0FFE1B4E4F2C8580"/>
had a mother inſpired her with every noble and virtuous ſentiment; in vain had nature endowed her with a perſon the model of beauty, and with an exalted ſoul; in vain had fortune laviſhed riches, extenſive domains, and thouſands of ſlaves ready to kneel at her feet whenever ſhe appeared.—The meaneſt of theſe ſlaves was to poſſes Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria.</p>
            <p>Count Markoff, diſregarding every dictate but that of love, and the dangers which Maria had repreſented to him as the certain conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of any attempt to viſit her, left his reſidence near Moſcow, and journeyed toward that ſpot, which was to give him an interview with his lovely angel. Diſguiſed in the habit of a pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, he arrived within ſight of the baron's pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, and ſaw the roof which contained within it all his heart panted for! The breaſt of Markoff until this inſtant felt not the idea of diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: a ſoldier, he had been accuſtomed to cut his way thro every difficult paſs with his ſword. The parent of Maria guarded the avenue he was now approaching.</p>
            <p>With money he purchaſed the ſervices of ſome perſons who frequented the baron's houſe. He got, by their means, a letter conveyed to Maria. Upon reading this epiſtle, love overcame in her too every dictate of prudence; ſhe loſt recollec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her father being at that inſtant in the houſe; and hurrying on her cloak, ſhe ran down ſtairs, and into the fields then covered with ſnow. Her recollection returned—her heart
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:034525_0199_0FFE1B53D3B08AE8"/>
failed within her—her limbs refuſed to do their office—ſhe ſtood trembling before the wintry ſtorm! She called to her aſſiſtance a ſlave; and pretending ſome other cauſe for her illneſs, was aſſiſted to reach her chamber without the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the awful parent who had occaſioned her diſtreſs.</p>
            <p>Maria, overcome with grief, and now giving up every thot of viewing her beloved Markoff, ſunk upon her bed in ſits of deſpair and madneſs, Reaſon again reſumed her feat; a letter was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched to Markoff at a neighboring village, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring him, if he valued his own and her life, to leave the place, and return to Moſcow, where there might be ſtill a poſſibility of their meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Having ſigned and ſealed this letter, ſhe held it in her hands, without know what ſhe did. She broke the ſeal of her letter, and, ſeizing the ardent pen, gave that utterance it afforded to her paſſion; and amid the effuſians of ardent love ſhe mentioned the attempt ſhe had made to ſee him.</p>
            <p>Markoff's boſom could not contain the emotions of his ſoul on reading this letter. The cool, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential, firſt part was overturned by the conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing poſtſcript.</p>
            <p>Maria ſtood at the window, looking toward the village. "No," ſaid ſhe to herſelf, "he muſt not come.—I have forbid him, as he values my life. Let me endeavor to compoſe myſelf. Having reſolved, and executed my reſolve by
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:034525_0200_0FFE1B5557838030"/>
that letter, we muſt wait for a happier period, why this fever of deſire in my ſoul yet to behold him? I will avert my eyes from the village—Oh, how I ſhake!—Can he leave me, and obey my mandate? Will he not ſtand upon that ſnowy plain, and wave his handkerchief? The village is ſurrounded with woods—can Markoff be gone without making me one ſignal of love! Ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful man! No! no! no! Where am I? Did I hear him ſpeak? Maria! Markoff!"</p>
            <p>The night cloſed: the diſtracted Maria walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in her chamber, ſtill ſearching thro the gloom for Markoff—ſtill wiſhing to ſee, not him, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> rather ſome friendly ſpirit bearing his ſhape and air. A peaſant near to the windows held out a letter. Maria anxiouſly enquired, but with a ſoft voice, from whom it came. It was the count Markoff himſelf! "Where is the count?" ſaid Maria; and ſtretching out her hand for the let<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter. "My Maria!" replied the count; and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hold of the branches of a tree which ſtood near the window, he climbed up, and entered it.</p>
            <p>The young lady ſtared wildly at him, unable to refit or to ſpeak. He aſſured her, he would inſtantly depart, when he had once impreſſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her lips the ſeal of love. He threw his arms eagerly around her, and held her to his panting breaſt.—The hours glided away unſeen; nor were they awakend from their dream, but with the ſtepes of the baron approaching to the chamber door. The imagination of a woman, which
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:034525_0201_0FFE1B56DD4C80E8"/>
is ever quick, either to her relief, or to her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truction, ſuggeſted to Markoff to hide himſelf in an empty cheſt, which happened to be in the room. The baron's viſit was to enquire, as he often did, after his favorite child; as he had heard ſomething of her indiſpoſition. At times, when the recollection of the family of Markoff was loſt, he behaved as a fond father, but this dreadful recollection was never loſt for a day's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance.</p>
            <p>The baron left his daughter, without the leaſt ſuſpicion of the preſence of the ſon of his rival.</p>
            <p>Maria approached the fatal cheſt. She opened it. The count was aſleep, or affected to ſleep. He was aſleep, to wake no more! The head of the cheſt had been in a hurried moment, ſhut cloſe upon him, or had fallen ſo. There remains no doubt that the count, upon feeling the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency, and want of air, could have relieved himſelf, and perhaps had gently attempted to do it; but finding his attempt attended with ſome noiſe, which might have betrayed a woman whom he valued more than life, to the rage of a father, he had ſummitted to death.</p>
            <p>It is impoſſible for the imagination to conceive the ſituation of Maria when ſhe found the lifeleſs corpſe of Markoff! She continued for ſome time to believe that the count was affecting ſleep, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached him for playing the fool. At laſt ſhe pulled him with ſome violence and anger: the body fell again into the cheſt. She ſcreamed;
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:034525_0202_0FFE1B5B2A828D98"/>
and fortunate would it have been had the baron heard this cry of horror. Dreadful as her ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was, the idea of her father's wrath added to her miſery. Mad with agony, ſhe claſped the body of the count, calling upon his name, and, at calmer intervals, uſing every endeavor to reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tore him to life in vain.</p>
            <p>The ſilence of the night was diſturbed with the ſighs, the ſhrieks of Maria, now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining upon the corpſe, now at her window tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her hair, and imploring heaven to end her exiſtence. The morning began to dawn—ſhe rouſed from her diſtracted melancholy, and thot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of what the light of day and her furious fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were to diſcover. The ſlave who is appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed watchman to every houſe thro out Ruſſia is the only perſon readily to be procured during the night, and is generally and elderly man. He is employed in the meaneſt offices during that part of the day not alloted to ſleep.</p>
            <p>To this wretched domeſtic, whoſe lodging is a ſort of crib within the gates, the unfortunate Maria applied. The ſlave at her coming kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and touched her ſhoe with his forehead, crav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her protection. She deſired him to riſe, and informed him he ſhould have it, as well as a ſum of money, if he would keep a ſecret, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſerve her: ſhe diſcovered her misfortunes, and deſired that he would remove the corpſe, and bury it in the adjoining foreſt. The ſlave felt a conſequence he had never felt before. She gave him money, but he knew that the baron would
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:034525_0203_0FFE1B5E0A82A4B0"/>
give him more to betray her. That ſlave, who but a moment before had never dared to look up at the daughter of his lord, and who was accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed to eſteem both as deities. on whom his all, his very life depended: that wretch, who was happy to find a bed in the corner of her father's ſtable, and daily receiving chaſtiſement from the care of his ſurly maſter and fellow ſervants, who look down upon the watchman as an inferior be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, dared at once to poſſes the perſon of Maria! He began, without much ceremony, to uſe free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom with the counteſs. Overpowered as ſhe was with deſpair and grief, ſhe ſtruck the villain: for a moment ſhe forgot her ſorrows, and, reſuming the dignity of her rank, ſhe bade him begone. But it was too late: the ſlave knew her ſecret, nor was they any other aſſiſtant to be had. The villain knew this: and, pretending to go to the baron to inform him, Maria called him back. He obeyed with ſullen importance. He took the ſilver and gold trinkets which ſhe now added to the firſt preſent—he followed her toward her chamber—he ſtopped ſuddenly, and ſwore if ſhe did not come to his embraces, he would directly acquaint the baron with all. Maria, in her turn, fell upon her knees to the ſlave: ſhe entreated and beſought him, with every ſoothing expreſſion, and with a promiſe of freedom and wealth. She hold the ſlave, while he endeavored to rid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in order to proceed to the baron's bed-room. She fainted in the ſtruggle to detain him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="201" facs="unknown:034525_0204_0FFE1B60E56C98D0"/>
The villain turned, beheld his prey, and ſeized upon it.</p>
            <p>The ſavage reſorted to the chamber, where lay the corpſe of Markoff. He carried it to the woods, and cutting the throat, and otherways disfiguring it, left it a prey to animals leſs feroci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous than himſelf.</p>
            <p>Maria awoke to a new ſcene of woe. The baron obſerved the melancholy brooding upon her mind, and gueſſing that the cauſe related to the deteſted family of Markoff, abuſed her with his uſual rudeneſs. The ſlave renewed his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes, and with the ſame threats of informing the baron, adding, that he would accuſe her of the murder of the count.</p>
            <p>Maria, as yet guiltleſs, committed a fault un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming of her rank and innocence: but the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation againſt her is ſolely for the want of forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. A crime once committed, appears leſs hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: this lady had as yet committed none; but ſhe knew of her diſgrace, and felt herſelf degraded, and in her own eyes, an outcaſt of ſociety. The ſlave not only threatened to accuſe her of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but of proſtitution with count Markoff.</p>
            <p>Maria might have perhaps got over the dread of her father's wrath; but the accuſation of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and proſtitution, not merely to the count, but to the vileſt of her father's domeſtics, was a ſtumbling-block that ſhe had not ſtrength to paſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="202" facs="unknown:034525_0205_0FFE1B63C452CBD8"/>
It is always dangerous to imagine ourſelves paſt recovery in any ſituation. To avoid a public, ſhe ſubmitted to a private ſhame. Familiarity made the ſlave now inſolent: he forced her even to come to his wretched hovel, and diſmiſſed her with contempt.</p>
            <p>The wretched Maria never again beheld with a ſmile the morning dawn. Her eyes dejected, her color pale; ſhe ſtarted from her glaſs, and, throwing her clothes careleſſly about her, ſhe ſupported with pain, while with her father, the appearance of eaſe and happineſs.</p>
            <p>The ſlave to multiply his gains, dragged her to ſome neighboring cottage, where were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally aſſembled, at the dead hour of night, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of the wealthy inhabitants of the country. The hour arrived when Maria was to be freed from contamination; and it muſt be ſuppoſed that ſhe had before entertained the idea of extri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating herſelf, and this idea had ſupported her ſinking mind, and had prevented her too from freeing herſelf by ſuicide. Reflection had paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſhameful courſe that ſhe walked in, and ſhe ſaw no end to her ſorrows. The pride of rank, rouſed with repeated inſult, determined upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge. Famale nature yet revolted, and ſhe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed ſeveral opportunities to eſcape.</p>
            <p>The brutal raviſhers formed themſelves into a club. Maria was the ſacrifice at their feaſts, and was treated with every ſhameful indignity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="203" facs="unknown:034525_0206_0FFE1B654AB6D028"/>
The moment of vengeance at laſt comes. Her tyrants, overwhelmed with liquor, ſlept npon the benches of the cottage. Maria ſaw, and her good angel approved the period of freedom and juſtice. She trembled as ſhe approached the ſlave. She invoked Heaven to give her reſolution, and, pulling the knife from the belt of the ſavage, plunged it into his heart. Her fortitude rekind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the ſtroke. She proceeded on to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther villains, who belched their drunken fumes in their ſlumbers, and planted a dagger in every breaſt.</p>
            <p>Maria had no ſooner completed the work of vengeance, than ſhe fled home. She beheld from her windows the riſing ſun, and ſhe imagined herſelf in a new world! "Mark<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>off," ſaid ſhe to herſelf, "will be here! Theſe are the elyſian fields: I will go out and met him." She wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the foreſt which covered his body. She knew the ſpot, and kneeled upon his tomb. Her voice denied utterance; her tears watered his grave, and ſhe ſtrewed upon it her flaxen hair. Still awed by her father, ſhe concealed from him her ſorrow, and affected eaſe and mirth.</p>
            <p>The idea of having committed murder often threw her into fits of deſpair. She thot to eaſe her conſcience by making a confeſſion to her prieſt. The aſtoniſhed prieſt had never witneſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuch a confeſſion. The wretch betrayed the ſecret to his wife. The minions of <hi>juſtice</hi> were ſoon in ſearch of Maria. The relation ſpread thro out all the empire. Her Imperial majeſty, having ordered a ſtrict examination into the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:034525_0207_0FFE1B6B001F99D8"/>
acquitted this unfortunate lady, and took her under her immediate protection.</p>
            <p>Tired of life, now that her ſhame was public, ſhe would have preferred death to all other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection. She begged the empreſs to allow her to retire to a monaſtery; and here, ſecluded from a world where <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>he ſound no reſt, ſhe endeavors to forget all but her God and her Markoff. Her cell is ſmall but neat. A few religious books compoſe her library. The picture of Markoff hangs upon her lovely boſom.—She calls it her ſaint, and kiſſes it with ſervent devotion. Her firſt office in the morning is prayer: ſhe then goes to the bath, repeats this in the afternoon. She ſeldom wanders beyond the monaſtic walls; or, if ſhe does, ſhe traverſes the gloomeſt wood, or ſits by a rivulet which encircles her abode; and here, with folded arms and downcaſt eyes, implored the forgiveneſs of heaven. The even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bell, the ſhepherd's evening horn, warns her to return to prayers and repoſe.</p>

            <head>AN INTERESTING HISTORY.</head>
            <p>IN a village in the ſouth of France, lived a pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, whoſe only wealth conſiſted in thoſe mental poſſeſſions which adorn greatneſs and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify poverty. He had acquired, by his integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Induſtry, the approbation of the maſter whom he had long ſerved as under-bailiff, and the eſteem of all his neighbors. In his hours of leiſure, he delighted in the diſcharge of his parental duty, by cultivating the native graces of an only child. Emma, at the age of eighteen, was lovely in her perſon, gentle in her manners, and virtuous in her principles. Their cottage was the ſcene of ruſtic peace, and their little gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den a bower of intermingled ſweets.—Bernard had long ſerved, with fidelity and zeal, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis of Clairville, who poſſeſſed a ſumptuous chateau, and extenſive domains in the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.—Juſtice, generoſity, and innate excellence of heart, were his characteriſtics; and he was the idol of the ſurrounding country.—Emma aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted

            <p>The duty and affection of Emma was unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralleled: oft would ſhe climb the verdant ſteep, or wander in the ſilent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Sometimes, in the ſeaſons of feſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, Emma would join in the rural dance with the villagers, or chaunt her melodious notes to the ſoft flutes of the youthful peaſants.</p>

Enquiring the name of the deceaſed, one of the peaſants informed him, that in their maſter, the Marquis de Clairville, they had loſt the beſt of lords, and moſt generous of patrons; the tears which rolled down his cheeks as he ſpoke, gave evidence of his feelings: Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert diſmounted from his horſe, and giving charge of it to his ſervant, mingled with the pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantry, and, moving ſlowly, arrived with them at the church, about half a mile diſtant, where the remains of Clairville were to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 words">

He placed himſelf near the grave: before the ceremony was ended, and while a ſolemn dirge was chanting, he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the mourners to fall back, and form on each ſide an opening, thro which he beheld ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing a group of village maidens, with baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets of flowers on their arms, which they ſtrew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in profuſion over the coffin. Albert's atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was ſoon attracted toward the lovelieſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject he had ever beheld; ſhe was diſtinguiſhed from her companions by a ſuperior elegance of mien and grace of features, ſhe wore a veſt of white ſtuff, fitted to her ſhape, and round her

When ſhe had emptied the fragrant contents of her baſket, ſhe bent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one knee upon the brink of the grave, then raiſing her tearful eyes of celeſtial blue to heaven, ſhe ſeemed to breathe a ſilent prayer for the ſoul of the departed Marquis; then, accompanied by the village maidens, ſhe retired from the ſpot, paſſing thro the vacancy which again was formed for them. Albert followed the ſweet mourner, who, bidding adieu to her aſſociates, moved down the church, looking around with anxious eyes, as if in queſt of ſome object intereſting to her affections.—Suddenly, ſhe ſprang toward a venerable old man, who was tottering to the porch, and throwing around him her fair arms, ſhe ſupported him to a ſeat, where, placing her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by him, they paſſed ſome moments in the elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent ſilence of unaffected grief. Never had Albert beheld ſo beautiful a picture.—It was Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, ſupporting on her boſom the ſilver head of Bernard, while from her eyes tear after tear, in quick ſucceſſion, dropped on his furrowed cheek!—The ſtranger reſpected too much their mutual grief to interrupt it, and perceiving the funeral train returning from the grave, he accoſted one of the peaſants who was neareſt to him, and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly inquired the name of the maiden who ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to lead the young group that ſtrewed flowers at the grave. The peaſant gave Albert every
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:034525_0212_0FFE1B76CEE4D208"/>
information which he deſired, and as the day was declining faſt, he offered the traveller a bed at his cottage, which being contiguous to that of Bernard, proved a temptation not to be reſiſted. Honeſt Pierot led Albert a ſhort cut thro ſome fields, and after having recommended his gueſt to the attentions of his wife, he haſtened to the caſtle gates, in queſt of the ſervant whom Albert had ordered to wait there his return.</p>
            <p>In this humble but neat dwelling, the young ſtranger determined to reſide ſome days, under pretence of exploring, at his leiſure, the exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive domains of the caſtle, but in reality to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce himſelf to the lovely Emma and her father. The impreſſion, which her artleſs beauty made on his heart, was of ſo ſerious a nature, that he indulged the hopes of making her his wife, if he found, on acquaintance, her mind as charming as her perſon, and ſhe would accept his proffered vows.</p>
            <p>We muſt make a ſhort digreſſion while we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the ſtate of the family affairs of the late Marquis, for ſome years before his deceaſe.—He had been married, late in life, to an amiable wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, by whom he had an only ſon: having paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the winter at Paris, he was unexpectedly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led away to attend ſome important buſineſs at Clairville-caſtle: he ſet off immediately, leaving his lady and infant ſon, then about three years<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> old to follow. After the fatigues of a buſy day, on the evening that he expected the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <pb n="210" facs="unknown:034525_0213_0FFE1B7B106718C0"/>
to arrive, he was waiting her approach upon a terrace which commanded his fine park. As his anxious eyes were turned toward the grand ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, which led to the caſtle, he perceived one of the domeſtics who had been left to attend her, advancing, with as much ſpeed as the tired ſtate of his horſe would allow. The Marquis haſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed toward him, to receive tidings of his belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wife, but what were his ſenſations, when the ſervant informed him, that the carriage of the Marchioneſs and her ritinue, had been attacked by an armed banditti, who ruſhed out of a caſtle. The attendants, who were likewiſe armed, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded the carriage, and for ſometime made a ſtout reſiſtance, but he had every reaſon to fear, that, overpowered by numbers, they had ſcarce a chance of defending their miſtreſs from the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of theſe aſſaſſins, and in all probability they had fallen victims with her to the murderous ſwords of their aſſailants. The meſſenger of theſe dreadful tidings had been tempted by an early flight to eſcape to the caſtle, impelled by the feeble hope of gaining them ſome aſſiſtance; but the road being ſolitary which led to the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teau, he had met no human being on his way. The Marquis loſt no time in uſeleſs lamentations, but inſtantly arming himſelf and ſeveral of his brave domeſtics, who were ready to encounter any danger for ſo beloved a maſter, they mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their horſes, and in a ſhort time reached the fatal ſpot. They here found a ſpectacle of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror: the mangled bodies of the ſervants lay life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs round the carriage, in which the murdered
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:034525_0214_0FFE1B7CA4797A88"/>
Marchioneſs and here two women remained, with wounds yet bleeding! In the midſt of this deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, the Marquis ſought in vain his infant ſon, whoſe abſence inſpired, amid his ſorrows, a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret and preſaging hope, that he had been either reſcued or preſerved. He placed himſelf and his followers in ambuſcade in the wood for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of the day, with a view to ſurpriſe the villains ſhould they return at night, and either revenge this horrid maſſacre, or fall in the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt: his hopes were vain: the wretches, ſated with their bloody deeds, approached no more the fatal ſpot. Early on the enſuing morning, they began to remove the ſlaughtered victims: they had been joined by all the neighboring villagers, who aſſiſted in the ſad office. As they were raiſing ſome of the lifeleſs attendants, they were ſtartled by a groan from one of the bodies: on an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate ſearch, they found a dying ſtranger, whom they concluded to be one of the banditti, who had probably, from being concealed under ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral dead bodies, eſcaped the recollection of the villains. They raiſed and ſupported the wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wretch, hoping if he recovered, by the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a ſurgeon, who had followed the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis, by his orders, to this ſcene of death, and had in vain attempted to reſtore the Marchioneſs and her unfortunate ſuite, they might obtain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of the fate of the young Marquis.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="212" facs="unknown:034525_0215_0FFE1B8235DCBDF8"/>
He ſeemed to revive a little by an effect which the attention had upon him. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis aſſiſted in ſupporting him, while the ſurgeon poured a cordial down his throat.—His facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in ſome degree appeared to return, he gazed on the Marquis and attempted to ſpeak, but in vain.—Clairville then addreſſed him thus;—</p>
            <p>"I conjure thee by the hopes of mercy here and hereafter, tell me, if thou haſt power to ſpeak, <hi>where</hi> is my ſon?—<hi>does</hi> he ſurvive? An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer <hi>that</hi> queſtion only for the preſent, and I will wait the event of thy recovery for further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation."</p>
            <p>The dying man, made repeated efforts to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulate, but for ſome moments he remained ſpeechleſs: at length he faintly uttered, "young Clairville lives." He could no more; the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion overcame him; and ſucceſſive convulſions ſeizing his whole frame, he expired in agonies.</p>
            <p>The confeſſion, in the midſt of ſo ſevere an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, long kept alive in the boſom of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis ſome feeble embers of expiring hope: he returned to the ſolitary caſtle, ſo late the ſcene of all his happineſs where he ſhut himſelf up for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral days to give vent to the firſt emotions of his ſorrow. The ſuſpence, which he yet endur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, relative to his ſon's deſtiny had ſuch an effect upon his ſpirits, that he determined to retire wholly from the world, and to implore, in the ſolitude of his caſtle, the misfortunes of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily:
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:034525_0216_0FFE1B83B9EFF090"/>
but he did not ſo much yield to the impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of grief, as to be regardleſs to his tenants and dependents: his generous nature would not permit him to be unmindful of their intereſts. They had long been the objects of his bounty: they now became the children of his adoption; and, loſt to domeſtic felicity, he centered all his remaining conſolation in diſpenſing happineſs to all around him. Years followed years, in this manner; every ſearch after his beloved ſon had been fruitleſs; he had long ceaſed to indulge the flattering proſpect, which he had at firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained, of recovering his treaſure; and tho his pious reſignation permitted him not to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur at the degrees of Providence, yet no ray of hope cheared his declining age.</p>
            <p>He beheld death approaching with that ſecret ſatisfaction, which anticipated a bleſt re-union with thoſe dear objects, who had already ſo long partaken of the rewards of innocence and virtue. On the deceaſe of the Marquis, his eſtates de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved by inheritance, on the Baron of Moren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zi, who was of a haughty, cruel character, and revengeful; whoſe reaſon and actions were ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to his paſſions; and who ſcrupled not the commiſſion of any exceſs, to gratify his ambition, avarice, or ſenſuality.</p>
            <p>Over theſe vices he had, by art and cunning, drawn a veil, which impoſed on ſtrangers; and to unfold which, a conſiderable ſhare of ſagacity and penetration was requiſite; on thoſe whom his
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:034525_0217_0FFE1B85424669A8"/>
heart ſecretly deteſted, he could ſmile with eaſe. A character ſo hypocritical could not fail of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming the averſion of the adjacent country: for however the deceiver may conceal his vices, in the formalities of courts and public life, they will always appear in their true light to thoſe, to whom they are objects of neither fear nor regard.—His new vaſſals and dependents received a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimen of that treatment which they were in fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to expect, from the firſt moment of his arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val at his new abode.</p>
            <p>They had collected together in the court of the caſtle, to celebrate his approach. "Wherefore," ſaid he, as he deſcended from his carriage, "are you aſſembled here with gloomy faces and fable habiliments?—Is this the welcome you give your new lord? I think you might have ſpared theſe trappings of woe for a departed maſter, to wait with joy the commands of his ſucceſſor. An uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal ſilence ſucceeded this ungracious harangue, which ſo exaſperated the baron, who expected to be received with acclamations of pleaſure, that he broke forth in the following words "De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, you minions of that indolent ſupineneſs, which marked the character of him whom you mourn in vain;—quit my caſtle, and if you have any buſineſs to tranſact, I refer you to my ſtew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, who has attended me hither, and who will impart to you my commands." Awed and ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſilence, the humble train retired from the preſence of a man, whoſe dominion over them promiſed nothing but the exertion of tyranny and oppreſſion. In a day or two after his arrival, the
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:034525_0218_0FFE1B881AC93550"/>
ſyſtem of affairs was entirely changed. The old ſteward was diſcarded and his place ſupplied by a man, who had gained the confidence of the baron by the abject ſervility of his flattery.</p>
            <p>The faithful ſervants were diſcharged, and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by others, who had been the inſtruments of his vices. Bernard only, and a few more, who from the meanneſs of their ſituations had eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped his notice, were ſtill permitted to occupy their ſeveral departments. Inſtead of the conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion, with which their late lord had treated all around him, the new maſter of theſe domains kept them at an awful diſtance; and never permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the plaints of poverty to reach his ear, or the groans of oppreſſion to plead for mercy: ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing virtue never obtained redreſs from his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, nor innocence from his juſtice. He had lived a life of luxury and debauchery, which had involved his private fortune in difficulties, from which his great acquiſition was calculated to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate him. A multitude of importunate credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, diſturbed the firſt moments of his ſmiling fortune; and inſtead of appropriating to the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his debts, a part of the princely revenue, the enjoyment of which he ſo little merited, ſuch was his mean avarice, that he immediately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to the axe ſome lofty rows of venerable trees, for many ſucceſſive centuries the greateſt pride and ornament of the caſtle of Clairville.</p>
            <p>We now return to Albert, who ſoon gained that introduction, at the cottage of Bernard, which he ſo anxiouſly ſought, and by frequenting the ſociety of this worthy old man, he had daily
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:034525_0219_0FFE1B8DA5D85AC0"/>
opportunities of ſeeing, and converſing with his lovely daughter.—Powerfully charmed at firſt fight by her perſonal attractions, he now found, on acquaintance, an irreſiſtible faſcination in the ſuperior beauties of her mind. Nature had form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her ſentiments, juſt, delicate, and virtuous, and her education had for two years received great advantage from a frequent intercourſe with a lady of birth and diſtinguiſhed talents, who had, on the deceaſe of her huſband, retired into a ſmall habitation, ſituated in a vale near Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard's cottage: this amiable widow had lived many years in the great world, and had partaken both of its proſperity and adverſity, ſufficiently to ſhew her the inſtability of fortune: with her beloved lord, ſhe had had loſt the ſuperfluities of life; but ſatisfied with competence, ſhe devot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the remainder of her days to ſolitude and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
            <p>She conceived for Emma, then juſt fifteen, a ſtrong attachment, and eaſily obtained Bernard's permiſſion for his daughter's frequent viſits. The good woman delighted in cultivating a mind whoſe capacity and genius promiſed every ſucceſs. Emma read aloud for hours, uninterruptedly, to her kind patroneſs, and with an attention, that impreſſed upon her memory every thing worthy to be retained; and the ſubjects were conſtantly calculated to improve the morals and enlarge the underſtanding. At the end of two years, death ſtopped the progreſs of Emma's education, by ſuddenly depriving her of this moſt excellent friend; her little income reverted to the family of her huſband, and ſhe had nothing to leave the
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:034525_0220_0FFE1B8F2AD0E448"/>
child of her adoption, but the ſimple furniture of her little dwelling. Emma mourned with af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate regret, a loſs ſo great, but determined to perſerve in thoſe ſtudies, for which ſhe had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired ſo correct a taſte, and which ſhe was hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily enabled to do, by becoming the poſſeſſor of the valuable and ſelect collection of books, which formed the ſmall library of the deceaſed. But riſing very early in the morning, Emma was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to purſue her favorite employment, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out treſpaſſing on thoſe hours, when her filial duties or domeſtic cares demanded her attention.</p>
            <p>Young Albert ſoon diſcovered in the converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Bernard's lovely daughter, a well inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed mind, and an underſtanding which blended the artleſs ſimplicity of rural life, with the more refined ſentiments of cultivated education.</p>
            <p>The mental accompliſhments of Emma comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the conqueſt which her beauty had begun in the heart of Albert; nor was it long ere a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocal and gentle flame was communicated to her boſom. The ardent lover, in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moment of aſpiring hope, declared his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and offered at her feet his honorable vows. She bluſhed modeſtly, and referred her aſſent to her father's will. The heart of Bernard, at this unexpected propoſal, felt all at her father's rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but the ſtrict rectitude of his ſentiments checked the momentary joy, and with that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity which marked his character, he declined ſo unequal an alliance, and repreſented to his
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:034525_0221_0FFE1B90B24A09E8"/>
young friend the impropriety of his forming any union unſanctioned by his family. "Accept our gratitude," ſaid Bernard, "for the honor which you intend us: were you leſs diſtinguiſhed by rank and fortune, I ſhould be proud to call you ſon. Emma's only dower is virtue, and her birth is too humble for her to become your wife. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhall falſe vanity, or ſordid intereſt, betray me to an action at which my conſcience would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt. I will ſtill be worthy your eſteem, and the child whom you have honored with your love ſhall merit, at leaſt by her conduct, the rank to which you would generouſly raiſe her. But you muſt meet no more: this is the ſtern decree of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſullied virtue and irreproachable honor. Return to your native country, with every wiſh that grateful friendſhip can beſtow." Albert had liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened in ſilent admiration to the word of Emma's venerable father: when Bernard ceaſed to ſpeak, he thus replied, "Could I offer a diadem to your incomparible daughter, ſhe would, by accepting it, confer, and not receive the honor. I would not have preſumed to ſolicit her affections or her hand, could I have admitted a doubt of my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's approbation of a choice directed by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and ſanctioned by virtue. I will renew no more my humble ſuit ill <hi>authorized</hi> by him to <hi>demand</hi> the hand of Emma: Farewell! my return hither ſhall be as rapid as the impatience of love and hope can render it." Thus ſeparated the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable Bernard and the youthful Albert; nor could all the moving rhetoric of the latter prevail up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the father of Emma to permit a parting ſcene</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="219" facs="unknown:034525_0222_0FFE1B9505E09BB0"/>
Bernard returned not to his cottage till Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert had quitted the village: when he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, Emma advanced to meet him, her eyes ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged with tears: ſhe preſented him with a letter which Albert, retiring to write for a few moments before he mounted his horſe, had ordered his ſervant to leave as he paſſed the door. It breathed the language of eternal love, and aſſured her, that as he quitted her only to accelerate their union, ſhe might ſoon expect his return to claim her promiſed hand: Bernard fold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the letter when he had read it, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it in his pocket, thus addreſſed his trembling daughter, who waited ſilently her fate: "Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, my child, how you ſuffer your heart to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray your happineſs; truſt not to the proteſtations of a lover. An inconſiderate vow is more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently broken than kept.—You may be the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent object of Albert's affections, but man, by nature inconſtant, can eaſily transfer his heart to ſucceſſive objects. The world will, probably, ſoon efface you from his remembrance; or ſhould he even ſtill retain his faith unſhaken, can you flatter yourſelf that his family will admit into their ſociety an humble villager, whoſe birth they would proudly deem unworthy their alliance?—Never ſhall my Emma's hand be united to a huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band unſanctioned by the authority of his parents.—Make, therefore, every effort, my beloved child, to conquer a prepoſſeſſion fatal in its ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, and hopeleſs in its effects. You have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet deceived me, and I have that confidence in your diſcretion, which perſuades me you will

               </gap> by a clandeſtine conduct, act unworthy of your own ſpotleſs character." Emma funk at the feet of her venerable fire, and embracing his knees, "Never, never," exclaimed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he, while tears rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led down her pale cheeks, "ſhall your child wander from the path of honor!—You ſhall guide and direct all her actions, your counſels ſhall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify the weakneſs of her heart, and aſſiſt her to ſubdue every ſentiment diſapproved by you; and if ſhe cannot immediately forget the conſpicuous virtues of her loſt Albert, at leaſt, ſhe will hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble her ambitious hopes, which had the preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſoar above her obſcure birth, and aſpire to an alliance to which ſhe had no pretenſions, but what the deluſive voice of love and Albert awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened in her boſom." Bernard folded her in her arms with all a father's fond delight; and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded the ſentiments, which flowed from a heart capable of ſacrificing every inclination to that duty which ſhe owed him. Emma poſſeſſed a ſtrength of mind ſuperior to her years, and tho ſhe tried in vain to forget an object ſo tenderly beloved, ſhe ſo far reaſoned herſelf into a perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that the friends, of Albert would never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to their marriage, without which ſhe was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely determined never to accept his hand, that ſhe renounced every idea of being united to him, and baniſhed the ſeducing hope of beholding him again.</p>
            <p>While Emma was thus meritoriouſly ſubmitting to the rigid laws of filial duty, fate was haſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to involve her in a ſn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>re more dangerous than that which ſhe had ſo nobly overcome. As ſhe

was ſpinning, one ſultry day, in a bower of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-ſuckles, near the gate of their little cottage, accompanied by one of her young female neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors, the Baron de Morenzi paſſed by on horſe-back, and caſting his eyes on the fair Emma, was ſo ſtruck with her beauty, that he ſuddenly ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, and diſmounting, approached the wicket. Taking off his hat he complained of a dizzineſs in his head, for which he politely requeſted a glaſs of water: Emma aroſe, and tripping into the houſe, quickly returned with a chryſtal draught, which ſhe preſented to him with a native grace that accompanied all her motions. He had, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her ſhort abſence, informed himſelf that ſhe was the daughter of Bernard, who ſerved him as under-bailiff. He accepted the cup from her hand, and while he ſwallowed the contents, he drank, at the ſame time, from her bewitching eyes, a draught, which ſpread an irreſiſtible poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon thro his veins. The baron was indebted to nature for a fine perſon, and to art, for that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing elegance of addreſs, which ſeldom failed to inſinuate his wiſhes with ſucceſs, when the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of a tender paſſion tempted him to gloſs over his haughty demeanor with diſſembled con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion. Juſt as he was returning the cup to the lovely Emma, who ſtood to receive it, with her looks bent upon the ground, to avoid the fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed gaze of his penetrating eyes, Bernard ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeared, and afforded his daughter an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to retire into the cottage.</p>

The good old bailiff accoſted his lord with a reſpect, which, while it acknowledged his ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority as a maſter, was unmixed with that kind of ſervile humility, which demeans the dignity of man. He had never before attracted the notice of the Baron, who forgetting the diſtance, which birth and fortune had placed between them, recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected only that he was the father of Emma, and might, perhaps, aſſiſt him in the views which he had formed to corrupt her virtue. Accoſting him, therefore, with kind familiarity, he requeſted that he might take a ſurvey of his little dwelling, which he ſhould be welcome to exchange for one more convenient and comfortable. "My lord," replied Bernard, "in this humble dwelling my infant eyes firſt opened, and here I would wiſh to cloſe their aged lids."</p>
            <p>"But," interrupted the Baron," you begin to bow under the weight of years, and in need of reſt and indulgence; I ſhall feel a true ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in rendering your latter days happy."—"Permit me to aſſure you," ſaid Bernard, "that a life of honeſt induſtry, and uncorrupted inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, has already inſured to me that happineſs in its cloſing ſcene, which an irreproachable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience only can beſtow, but which riches can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver give." "You have a daughter, however, interrupted the Baron, ſmilling, "too young to have adopted your ſtoical ideas." "I have a daughter," retorted Bernard, "who inherits her mother's virtue, and has been taught by precept and example thoſe ſentiments, which have render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her too contented in her ſituation, to harbor an ambitious wiſh in her boſom." The Baron
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:034525_0226_0FFE1B9F288DC278"/>
reddened at theſe words, but commanding, for his own ſecret purpoſes, the riſing indignation of of his mind, he condeſcendingly bade the vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Bernard adieu; ſaying, that he ſtill hoped, mature reflection would induce him to accept the favors which he was anxious to confer upon a man, whoſe reſpectable character, and long life of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſullied virtue claimed a ſingular reward.</p>
            <p>So ſaying he mounted his horſe, and returned to the caſtle, revolving in his mind, every prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticable ſcheme for the ſeduction of the devoted Emma. He reflected that he had never beheld a female half ſo lovely; and as on no occaſion had accuſtomed himſelf to combat his inclinations, or ſubdue his paſſions, he reſolved to loſe no time in accompliſhing his deſign. The humble ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Emma, gave him, in his opinion, an uncontrouled right to her ſubmiſſion; but he was ſolicitous, if poſſible, to gain an aſcenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy over her heart, by awakening with her gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude tenderer ſentiments; for this purpoſe, he determined to wear the maſk of hypocriſy a little longer, and then to attempt, by every art of ſoft deception, to ſecure her affections in his favor. A week elapſed after the Baron's viſit at the cottage, without any renewal of his great offers; a circumſtance that contributed to diſpel thoſe fears, which had been awakened in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom of Bernard, by the interview of the Baron with Emma, and his generous profeſſions of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to himſelf,—<hi>profeſſions,</hi> too oppoſite to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ferocity of his temper. Bernard conſidered
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:034525_0227_0FFE1BA207491108"/>
them no longer in any light, but in that of a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary inclination toward humanity and kindneſs, which could have no root in a ſoil ſo barren.—He purſued, therefore, without further ſuſpicion, his uſual labors; taking, however, the precaution never to leave his daughter without a companion, in his abſence,</p>
            <p>One morning when he had quited the cottage about an hour, a haſty meſſenger from the caſtle terrified Emma with an account that her father was taken with a ſudden indiſpoſition as he paſſed the gates; and having been ſupported into the houſe by ſome of the domeſtics, who had obſerved him ſinking on the ground, the houſekeeper had thot it proper to ſend for his daughter, who by being accuſtomed perhaps to theſe ſeizures, knew beſt how to treat them. The trembling Emma, alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the utmoſt degree at a diſorder, which had never yet attacked her beloved father, delayed not a moment to follow her conductor; and taking the arm of her friend Agnes, who had been liſtening to her as ſhe was reading aloud, proceeded with tottering ſteps to the caſtle, diſtant from her hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble cottage about a mile. When ſhe arrived in the great hall, ſhe met with a female of a reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table appearance, and of an advanced age. She eagerly inquired after her father, and earneſtly requeſted to be permitted to ſee him. The houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper anſwered Emma with the appearance of much ſenſibility, that Bernard was ſo perfectly recovered by a cordial which ſhe had adminiſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that he had returned to his daily occupation, ignorant that his illneſs could have reached his
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:034525_0228_0FFE1BA78ECC40F8"/>
daughter's ears. "Thank heaven!" exclaimed the innocent Emma, "O, madam, accept my hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble gratitude for your kind care, and ſuffer one of the domeſtics to direct me to the ſpot where I may find my dear father; I will watch by his ſide during the labors of the day, or attend him to our cottage, if he will permit me to lead him thither."</p>
            <p>"Be no longer anxious, my lovely child," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the matron, "your father will be here at the hour when the turret bell ſhall call the family to dinner; he promiſed to meet my lord's ſteward, to receive ſome orders from the Baron."—The unſuſpecting Emma thanked her kind informer, and was departing, but preſſed condeſcendingly to continue there till the return of Bernard, and in the interval, to take a ſurvey of the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the caſtle, in ſome of which, alterations were making, ſhe conſented to wait her father's return. While her obliging guide was leading her into a large ſaloon, ſhe turned round to ſeek for Agnes, whom, till that inſtant, ſhe imagined to have been ſtill near her ſide. She expreſſed ſome anxiety at her abſence, to the houſe-keeper, who obſerved, that her friend had remained in the firſt hall, and immediately ſent a woman, then deſcending a ſtair-caſe, to eſcort her to them, Emma, in the mean time, purſued the ſteps of her conductreſs, who having paſſed ſeveral ſtate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments, opened a door that led to a library, and which ſhe had no ſooner entered, and direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the attention of Emma to a fine portrait of the late Marchioneſs de Clairville, that hung over the chimney, than ſhe diſappeared. Emma, for
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:034525_0229_0FFE1BA91575D9C8"/>
ſome moments, was loſt in contemplating the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelic countenance of a woman, whoſe ſad fate ſhe had heard ſo frequently and ſo tenderly deplored, which ſhe was ſuddenly rouſed from theſe melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly reflections, by the opening of a glaſs door, which led to a colonnade filled with exotic plants. If ſhe felt embarraſſed by the appearance of the Baron, who entering thence into the library, that what were her ſenſations, when on making an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to quit it herſelf, ſhe found the door of the apartment locked, and beheld the Baron de Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renzi at her feet, in an attitude of reſpectful ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs.</p>
            <p>The confuſion and ſurpriſe of Emma, at the humble poſture of the Baron, could only be heightened by his addreſs. She had inſtantly retreated a few paces from the door which ſhe had vainly attempted to open, and ſupported herſelf with difficulty againſt a book-caſe. "Be not alarmed, charming Emma," ſaid the Baron, in a voice of aſſumed ſoftneſs, "you ſee before you a man, who, till he beheld your incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble beauty, never completely loſt his liberty. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard me no longer as the maſter of your father, but as the ſlave and lover of his daughter, and who only waits her commands to ſhew by his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience the truth and generoſity of his ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments." During this ſpeech. Emma's gentle frame was agitated by a variety of inexpreſſible emotions. Amazement, fear, and indignation prevented her interruping the Baron; but when, on his riſing and advancing to her at the cloſe of
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:034525_0230_0FFE1BAA9A6483F8"/>
his ſpeech, he attempted to take her hand, "My lord," ſaid ſhe, ſhrinking from his touch, "you muſt permit me to aſſure you, that I have no wiſh but to return to my father: in his cottage all my ideas of happineſs are centered. Condeſcend to open this door, or to admit my departure thro that colonnade: my intruſion here was entirely owing to Madame de Chalons, who promiſed to ſhew me the caſtle." "How much indebted am I to her," replied the baron, "for this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view, which gives me an opportunity to unfold the ſentiments of a heart devoted to you alone. No longer ſhall ſuch beauty, formed to ſhine in palaces, be concealed in a cottage. Accept my affections, and command my fortune."</p>
            <p>Indignant bluſhes dyed the cheeks of Emma, as a propoſal, which ſhe could not miſconceive, and all the pride of wounded delicacy ruſhing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her boſom, ſuſpended for a moment its natural timidity, and animated her to pronounce theſe words: "That fortune, my lord, from which you aſſume the privilege thus to inſult the daughter of a peaſant, can neither dazzle my va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, nor tempt my ambition; my humble birth inſpires in me no pride, but that of virtue, and the poſſeſſion of no dignity, but that of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious innocence. Allow me to retire my lord: my father doubtleſs wonder at my abſence." "Your father, froward beauty, waits my pleaſure in the caſtle," returned the Baron, with a look of anger, "your compliance or rejection of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous offers will decide his future fate. Recollect, Emma, the extent of my power; dread my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment, or deſerve my gratitude; they each
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:034525_0231_0FFE1BB0205E9730"/>
ſhall be unbounded. If you reward my paſſion, your father will reſide in this caſtle, freed from the toils of ſervitude, the witneſs and partaker of thoſe benefits, which my love ſhall heap upon you: receive this caſket of jewels, as a trifling earneſt of a liberality, which ſhall know no li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits." While the Baron diſplayed the ſparkling treaſure to the eyes of the unambitious Emma, ſhe puſhed them from her with diſdain. "Once more, my lord," ſaid ſhe, "let me aſſure you, that I have a heart impenetrable to vanity, or grandeur, to which the power of wealth could raiſe me:" "But," cried the Baron, interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her, ſoftening the natural ferocity of his fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and gazing tenderly on her, "is your heart impenetrable to love, and cannot it be moved to yield a generous return to ſentiments ſo ſincere? Let me owe to mutual affection that which you deny to ambition: and accept the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors which ſhall be offered you, as tributes due from my gratitude, rather than as bribes to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure your compliance." "Never, never," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied Emma: "my heart will ever continue as untouched by love, as by your proffered gifts: it is proof againſt every ſentiment, that would injure my honor and debaſe my virtue!—No," exclaimed Emma, "could you ſtoop ſo low as to demand my hand in an honorable alliance, my heart would reject the offer, and my tongue diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim an union, which no intreaties could induce, no authority compel me to accept! After this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt confeſſion, my lord, you will ſuffer me to quit your preſence." The enraged Baron w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

now raiſed to a pitch of reſentment which baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the moment every paſſion but that of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Mortified pride ſtung him to the quick; and viewing her with a look of contempt, "Tis well," ſaid he, "your audacity has diſpelled the charm of beauty; unworthy of a prepoſſeſſion, which covers me with diſgrace, you may return to that obſcurity and indigence, which befit the meanneſs of your birth, and the grovelling ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of your ſoul."—Uttering theſe words, he took a key from his pocket, and throwing it on the ground left her at liberty; ſhe inſtantly ſeized the opportunity to unfaſten the door, and to eſcape; haſtening thro the hall, inſtead of turning to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the offices by which ſhe had entered it, ſhe took advantage of the great door, that ſtood o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, and deſcending a flight of ſteps with a ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerity urged by her fears of detention, ſhe flew acroſs the court, darted thro the iron gates, and gained the end of the front avenue in a few mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. She then ſtopped, for want of breath, and ſunk, almoſt ſpent, under the ſhade of a lofty elm: recollecting, however, that ſhe was not beyond the reach of purſuit, ſhould the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged Baron change his mind, and attempt to recal her, ſhe aroſe, and caſting an apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive look toward the caſtle, ſhe perceived her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther advancing toward her with ſlow ſteps: aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured by his preſence, ſhe heſitated not to wait his approach; and he had no ſooner reached the ſpot; where ſhe ſtood trembling to receive him, than they claſped each other in a ſilent embrace: but Emma, urged by the dread of a moment's
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:034525_0233_0FFE1BB327C9B310"/>
delay, entreated her father to ſuſpend all interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation till they ſhould have regained their cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, which they had no ſooner reached, than they each gave vent to the agitations, which had mutually oppreſſed them.</p>
            <p>The ſtory of Bernard's illneſs had been a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brication, invented merely for the purpoſe of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trapping his daughter in the ſnare laid for her. As he paſſed the caſtle, in the morning he had been met by Monſieur Du Val, the ſteward, and requeſted to wait there to receive the commands of his lord, who had ſome deſigns to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to him, greatly to his advantage. The good old man, who never yet had formed a wiſh, beyond the ſufficiency which his humble ſtation had always allowed him, heard this circumſtance with cold indifference; but out of reſpect to the Baron, waited his pleaſure. He was introduced into a pavilion in the garden, and requeſted not to quit it till the Baron, who propoſed to join him there, ſhould diſmiſs him.</p>
            <p>He remained above two hours, in vain expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; the ſteward at length entered, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed him that he had liberty to depart, as the Baron's ſentiments were changed in regard to him, from the ungrateful rejection, which Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma had preſumed to offer to propoſals that did her but too much honor, and would have raiſed her and her family to a ſituation which muſt have rendered them objects of envy to the ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing peaſantry. Bernard, ſtrongly agitated, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to this harangue, "Then may I truly glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:034525_0234_0FFE1BB77968B378"/>
in my child, whoſe ſteady virtue teaches her to reſiſt the treacherous arts of ſeduction, and to ſpurn at an elevation which would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> her far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath her lowly birth and humble education. Let me haſten from a ſpot once the reſidence of worth and honor, but now become the ſcene of infamy and ſhame"—"Have a care, old man," replied Du Val, "how you tempt the vengeance of your maſter, by ſuch daring language." "I fear no danger," interrupted Bernard, "but the loſs of honor, and I own no real maſter but that Power Omnipotent, who guarded the innocent, forſakes only the guilty!"—Having thus ſaid, he reached the lodge; where the porter opened a private gate which admitted him thro the ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, where he joined, as we before related, his beloved daughter.</p>
            <p>The enraged Baron, in the firſt emotions, of his reſentment, had been induced to baniſh from his preſence, the woman, who had preſumed to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe his offers and his love. A momentary ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred took poſſeſſion of his mind, but it ſoon gave place to ſofter ſentiments;—her beauty, the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple elegance of her form; her unſtudied graces, and even the innocence which he meditated to deſtroy, returned to his imagination, and diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed paſſion once more raged with greater vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence than ever.—In the firſt tranſports of his anger, he had commanded Du Val to diſmiſs Bernard with contempt, as an object beneath his future notice; he now ſummoned again into his preſence this truſty meſſenger, this confidential friend of all his vices. The wily minion ſoon pacified the perturbed ſpirit of his lord, with
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:034525_0235_0FFE1BBA55B70948"/>
that ſubtle flattery which he well knew how to adminiſter; he artfully and reſpectfully ventured to blame the Baron, for ſetting at liberty the prey which he had once ſecured in his net, and adviſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to avail himſelf of the power that his rank gave him over his dependents, and to take by force the object of his wiſhes from the cottage of her father: ſuch a method, he doubted not, would enſure his victory over her ſtubborn vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, which probably might be affected only to enhance her conſequence; which would certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly yield, when fears for the ſafety of her father ſhould be rouſed, on her ſeparation from him.—This point being ſettled, Du Val obtained the thanks of the Baron for his friendly counſels, and the promiſe of a large gratuity to recompenſe his ſervices, when by his aſſiſtance Emma ſhould be incloſed once more within the caſtle walls.</p>
            <p>When Bernard had received from his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a minute detail of her late viſit, altho he rejoiced at her preſent eſcape, he foreſaw her future danger, and trembled at the fatal conſequence which might yet enſue. He knew Morenzi to be void of every principle of honor and humanity: he dreaded the influence of his power, and felt his own defenceleſs ſituation, which he feared would not enable him to protect his devoted child from arbitrary force, and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs violence. After revolving in his mind every poſſible circumſtance, he had worked up his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions to ſuch an height, as to decide ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, and that an immediate flight could afford the only means of ſecurity from an enemy ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable.
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:034525_0236_0FFE1BBD301DFE40"/>
—The caſtle of Brinon was the ſole aſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum which he could fix on as eligible; there a ſiſter of his late wife had lived for many years ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendant of the family; and there he hoped he might be permitted to conceal his daughter without danger of diſcovery; it was diſtant from Bernard's village about twenty miles, and he hoped that they ſhould be able to reach it in a couple of days, He propoſed the ſcheme to Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, who readily undertook a journey, which would remove her beyond the power, of the dreaded Morenzi. They had no time to loſe, and therefore, without further deliberation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan the preparations neceſſary for an expedition ſo important to their ſecurity. Bernard prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly determined to repoſe no confidence in any of his neighbors; altho he knew himſelf to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved by them ſufficiently to ſecure their ſecrecy, yet he was unwilling to expoſe them to the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron's reſentment, by entruſting them with the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret of his journey. Bernard took with him his little ſtore, the honeſt earnings of induſtrious years; Emma made up a ſmall parcel of linen; and neither of them being inclined to repoſe, they ſat down to a ſimple meal, of which, for the ſake of each other, altho devoid of appetite, they mutually forced themſelves to partake, that they might the better be enabled to encounter the fatigues which they had to undergo.</p>
            <p>The village clock ſtruck eleven, the hour when they had agreed to begin their journey. Emma took a mournful ſurvey of the beloved cottage,
<pb n="234" facs="unknown:034525_0237_0FFE1BC012FE55D0"/>
where ſhe had paſſed her life of innocence; ſhe caſt her eyes upon her ſpinning wheel and ſighed; then turning to a wicker armed chair, which was the conſtant ſeat of her father, ſhe ſunk into it, and burſt into tears. "Alas," ſaid ſhe, "I hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for happy years to come to watch here the calm repoſe of him who gave me being; to tend, with duteous affection, his declining age, who reared my infancy with anxious love: I, who would wiſh to be his deareſt companion, am doomed to bring ſorrow on his ſilver head!"—"Rather," replied Bernard, extending his hand to lead her from a ſpot where fond re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance ſeemed to arreſt her lingering ſtops, "ſays that my Emma was born to bleſs her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by her exemplary virtues. I triumph in my child, who nobly prefers honorable indigence to ſplendid infamy! Let us haſten from impend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perſecution;—let us quit a place, where eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry moment endangers her liberty and innocence." Emma ſtarted up, caſt a fearful look around, and encircling her arm in that of Bernard, they quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the cottage, paſſed thro the ſleeping hamlet, and reached the road, which led to their deſtined aſylum. The moon ſhone in penſive majeſty,—all was ſtill,—the gentle breeze of night wafted re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing odours,—and ſolemn ſilence reigned,—ſave the ſoft notes of warbling nightingales, chanting their tuneful ſongs among the fragrant hedges, or, perchance, the diſtant bleating of ſome wakeful lamb. Emma's delicate frame felt ſomething rather exhauſted, and obliged her to reſt for a few moments; but her fears did not
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:034525_0238_0FFE1BC2F1919B10"/>
permit her to indulge long in a repoſe which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered her ſafety. Bernard comforted her by the aſſurance, that they approached a village, where there was a public inn; in which they might venture to take ſome refreſhment, and where he hoped to procure a chaiſe, to convey them about twelve miles further, which would place them at an eaſy diſtance from the caſtle of Brinon, and conſequently diminiſh the danger of purſuit. Thus encouraged, the timid Emma moved onward with renewed courage; and the fugitives reached the inn juſt as a travelling car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage drove into the courtyard: while the land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord and his wife were buſily engaged in attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the newly arrived gueſts, Bernard applied to one of the ſervants to accommodate him and his daughter with a room, until a chaiſe could be got ready for their uſe: his requeſt was granted, and they were ſhewn into a garden, where they waited with ſome impatience the arrival of the carriage, in which they were to purſue their lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle journey.</p>
            <p>Having urged their requeſt to be ſerved with expedition, the landlord entered, and informed them that by ſunriſe they might depend upon a chaiſe, but that he would not ſuffer his horſes to leave the ſtables until they had been ſufficiently refreſhed to do their duty: obſerving Emma to caſt a diſconſolate look upon her father, he ſaid, "Your young companion may be weary, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend her to take ſome reſt in a quiet cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, whither my wife ſhall conduct her." Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, oppreſſed by fatigue, which ſhe had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone, and finding they had no chance of purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:034525_0239_0FFE1BC5D18C62C8"/>
their journey for the next two hours, accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the propoſal, and conſented to retire into an upper chamber; where reclining upon a bed, juſt as ſhe was, notwithſtanding the agitations of her mind, ſhe ſunk into a profound repoſe.</p>
            <p>Let us quit a-while the virtuous fugitives, to follow Albert into Swiſſerland. He quitted the village where Emma dwelt, with a heart deeply impreſſed by the perfections of a woman, whoſe noble rejection of his hand, from the moſt deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate motives, had raiſed her in his eſteem. The Count de Bournonville, his father, was a man truly reſpectable in rank and character; he lived but to promote the happineſs of his friends; and had been ſo uniformly indulgent to the wiſhes of Albert, that he had every thing to expect from his generoſity and kindneſs. The education of this only ſurviving ſon had been cultivated with the utmoſt attention; he poſſeſſed a brilliant ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, a ſolid underſtanding, and a heart with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, ſenſibility, and virtue.</p>
            <p>The Count welcomed his ſon with thoſe marks of tenderneſs, which promiſed every thing to the ardent hopes of Albert. On the evening of his return, impatient to urge a ſuit, upon the ſucceſs of which his happineſs depended, he requeſted a private audience of his father, who appointed an interview in his cloſet, before they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire to their ſeparate apartments for the night. They met at the ſtated hour, each bearing teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony in his expreſſive countenance of the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:034525_0240_0FFE1BC8AC540D90"/>
ſecret which oppreſſed his heart. The youthful impetuoſity of Albert arreſted the Count's attention, by an inſtant confeſſion of his paſſion, and by his reliance on parental indulgence to crown his wiſhes: the Count de Bournonville liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened without interruption, to the character of Emma, painted with all the ardent enthuſiaſm of love in the glowing colors of perfection. Albert ceaſed;—the pauſe of a moment ſucceeded;—when his father looking ſtedfaſtly upon him, thus replied, "Ever ready to promote your feli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ity, I ſhall not attempt to reaſon you out of an attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which you deſcribe ſo worthy of your choice, in every thing but birth and fortune<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> You are undoubtedly the ſafeſt judge in point of ſuch conſequence as an union for life: but a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of ſtill more <hi>preſent</hi> importance <hi>now</hi> demands your attention. You muſt in future decide your own deſtiny:—I no longer can claim from you the duty of <hi>obedience.</hi> You are the child alone of <hi>my adoption,</hi> but the <hi>real,</hi> the indiſputable ſon of a noble and unfortunate Marquis, the heir of a princely fortune, the real Henry de Clairville! wronged of your natural rights by an uſurper; who doomed you to a death in early infancy, from which Providence reſcued your innocence."—"And who murdered, with barbarian hand, my honored mother?" exclaimed Albert, attentive with increaſing wonder to the words of the Count; and whoſe imagination had been wrought up al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to a pitch of frenzy at the cloſe of the ſpeech. "This arm," continued he, "ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge her ſacred blood in that of an aſſaſſin!"
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:034525_0241_0FFE1BCB8AB1F210"/>
—But ſuddenly his features ſoftened into a look of greatful tenderneſs, recollecting himſelf, and falling at the feet of Bournonville, he thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued; "Forgive, oh, <hi>parent</hi> of my <hi>deſerted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy,</hi> the foce of nature, that ſuſpended in my breaſt the endleſs debt of gratitude which I owe you: here let my heart ever acknowledge the tribute due to filial love; while my ſword aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges the blood of murdered innocence; from whoſe honored ſource! drew my own exiſtence. But ſay, my Lord, whence do you derive this ſtrange intelligence?" The Count then informed him, that in his late abſence he had taken into his family a ſervant, diſcharged from the caſtle of Clairville, on the death of the late Marquis, and who, being a native of Swiſſerland, had return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to an uncle reſiding there in credit, by whom he had been recommended. That Prevot, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogated relative to the motive of his quitting France, had given him a circumſtantial account of the occurrences which had paſſed in the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the Marquis, including the fatal death of the Marchioneſs, and the loſs of her young ſon. "Theſe events," continued the Count, "I ſound from Prevot's recital, paſſed at a period, when I was returning with my wife thro France to Swiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerland; but ſo expeditious was my journey, that the foregoing circumſtances never reached my ears: an infant ſon had accompanied our tour; and by a ſudden illneſs incident to children, it pleaſed heaven to recal the gift, with which it had bleſſed us for a ſhort time; the Counteſs was inconſolable, and I feared grief would have had a fatal effect upon her delicate frame; when an
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:034525_0242_0FFE1BCD10D0F650"/>
extraordinary incident rouſed her attention from the indulgence of her private woes, to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe it on an object whoſe intereſting age claimed the offices of humanity from her maternal care."</p>
            <p>Albert liſtened with attentive ſilence while the Count de Bournonville continued thus his narrative: "My faithful Durand accompanied us in our travels; he has ſpent his youth in my ſervice, and by his firm attachment has merited the place which he holds in my eſteem. As we were paſſing a frequented road, Durand, who followed us on horſeback, perceived upon the ground a ſleeping infant. Surpriſed to ſee no perſon near, and that the child had been left ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently unprotected, he ſtopped his horſe, when, from a wood which bordered the road, a man ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly ſtarted forth, and thus addreſſed Durand, in a tone of agitation, if you have an inclination to do an act of mercy, take charge of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate infant: his life will be forfeited, ſhould you refuſe to ſave him:—Spare his innocence, and ſnatch a ſoul from guilt. He is of noble blood, born to inherit a ſplendid fortune, but vengeance will purſue and overwhelm him, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs you generouſly reſcue him,"—With theſe words, not waiting for a reply, he bounded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain into the wood, and left Durand in the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt conſternation. The honeſt fellow, trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling for the fate of the child, would not riſque a moment the threatened danger, but lifting the little infant gently from the ground, and placing him on his horſe ſoon overtook our carriage, and ſtopping it, haſtily related the adventure, and
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:034525_0243_0FFE1BCFEC9CD660"/>
preſented us with the foundling, who, awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the motion, was pouring forth his little ſorrows: the Counteſs ſnatched him eagerly to her boſom, he ſmilled innocently in her face, and ceaſed to cry, as if recollecting in her arms a mother's fond embrace.—"Yes," ſaid ſhe, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving into tears, "thou ſhalt be protected, lovely infant; thou ſhalt replace in my vacant af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections the loſs of my lamented Albert, my care and tenderneſs ſhall ſupply that of a fond parent, and ſhelter thee from thy barbarous ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies!"—The better to ſecure your ſafety, we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to call you by the name of our lamented ſon, and to conduct you to Swiſſerland as ſuch. We ſwore to ſecreſy Durand and the Counteſs's wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who attended us, on whom we could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend, and who have inviolably kept the ſecret; which till this hour has been concealed from all the world, even from yourſelf, whom I adopted with a tenderneſs equal to parental ſentiments. Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven not having thot fit to bleſs me with other chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, I fixed my hopes on you, and had long ceaſed to expect, and I will confeſs even to wiſh, that fate would diſcloſe the hidden myſtery of your birth. You will remember the dying ſcene of the incomparable Counteſs, who had ſo ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly fulfilled for you a mother's duties: you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived her bleſſing, and mourned her loſs with fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lial ſorrow. I complied, rather reluctantly, with your deſire to travel, and obtained your promiſe not to be abſent from me on your firſt expedition more than three months. The account which we received from Prevot of the unfortunate death of the Marchioneſs de Clairville, and the unknown
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:034525_0244_0FFE1BD574A57A60"/>
fate of her infant ſon, correſponding exactly with the time and circumſtances of your adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, left Durand and me little doubt, but that you were the devoted victim of the concealed aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſſin: we determined, however, not to let our ſuſpicions tranſpire before your return, which I daily expected from the laſt letters that I had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. A week ago, Durand paſſing thro the ſtreets of Zurich, was accoſted by a ſtranger, whom he ſoon recollected, in ſpite of the veſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of time, to be the perſon who had entruſted him with the care of the infant Albert.—"Thank heaven," exclaimed the ſtranger, "I have lived to meet you once again! You have never quitted my remembrance, altho many years have paſſed, ſince I recommended to your protection a perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted child. If he ſtill ſhould live, heaven may yet reſtore him to his rights. Condeſcend to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me to my habitation, where I will unfold a ſtory terrible to relate, the concealment of which has coſt my conſcience ſo dear." Durand readily complied with his requeſt, and learnt from him the confeſſion; that being a ſervant in the family of the Baron de Morenzi, he had been bribed by promiſes, and intimidated by threats, to aſſiſt his maſter, in the ſeizure of the Marchoneſs de Clair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville and her ſon on the road to Clairville caſtle; but that having been previouſly haunted by a hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid dream, he had determined to ſave, if poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the young Marquis; that he conſulted with his brother, who was alſo in the Baron's ſervice, and who afterwards loſt his life in the action, and they both agreed together at all events, to reſcue
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:034525_0245_0FFE1BD7211AD2B0"/>
the child, the chief object of Morenzi's malice, and the certain impediment to his wiſhes of inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riting the revenues of Clairville caſtle. In the beginning of the engagement, Fargeon declared, that with a view to ſave him, he ſnatched the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant from his mother's arms, who had ſwooned on the approach of the armed villains; and that having eſcaped with him to the wood, he lulled him to ſleep on a bank near the road; where he watched the approach of ſome paſſenger whom he hoped to move with compaſſion; that he waited not long, as Durand was ſoon after ſent by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence to be the fortunate inſtrument of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation: Fargeon added, that he then returned to the Baron, who himſelf had headed th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lainous troop; and found it not difficult to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade him, that he had with his own hands ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the child, and buried him in a deep ditch. Soon after theſe occurrences he had married and retired to Swiſſerland with his wife, where he had lived with an upbraiding conſcience ever ſince, upon the wages of iniquity; with this ſole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, however, that he was in appearance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone guilty of the murder—He had lately arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the knowledge of the late Marquis's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe, and of the ſucceſſion of the Baron, which awakened in his mind ſuch remorſe for the ſhare taken by him in the deception, that he had almoſt reſolved to return to France, in order to divulge a ſecret, which oppreſſed his conſcience; when he unexpectedly met and recollected Durand, to whom he reſolutely confeſſed the whole. My faithful domeſtic loſt no time in imparting to me
<pb n="243" facs="unknown:034525_0246_0FFE1BD8A4B9F658"/>
this momentous ſecret: I have not yet diſcloſed to Prevot the diſcovery, which his intelligence made to me of your family, but had immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confided it to Durand, whoſe report of Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon's confeſſion, added a ſtrong confirmation of circumſtances, ſufficiently evident before. The ſecret yet remains between us undivulged:—but now is the criſis of your fate, and the moment is arrived for you to aſſert your claims,—to prove your exiſtence,—to expoſe to juſtice the uſurper of your rights—"and the murderer of my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther!" exclaimed Albert; "little did I conceive, when I attended the funeral of the lamented Marquis de Clairville, that I was performing an act of duty, and following a parent to the grave!"</p>
            <p>Sleep viſited not the eyelids of Albert, who paſſed the remainder of the night in revolving the wondrous events which had been imparted to him. Abhorrence of Morenzi's crimes occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied every faculty of his mind; but in the midſt of theſe filial emotions the ſeducing form of Emma would ſometimes glide into his ideas, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightening the future proſpect of his life with brighteſt hope. When the Count met Albert in the morning, he found him, impelled by youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ardour and thirſt of vengeance, reſolved to haſten to Clairville caſtle, and to challenge the aſſaſſin of his mother. The Count endeavored to ſooth his impetuoſity by repreſenting to him that the judicature of France would do him ample juſtice; and that they were fortunately armed with evidence ſufficient to condemn a traitor, whoſe artrocious crimes ought to be publicly
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:034525_0247_0FFE1BDE2E501058"/>
puniſhed by the exertion of thoſe laws which he had violated—He propoſed, however without loſs of time, to accompany him to France, and to take immediate meaſures for ſeizing the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Baron de Morenzi.—Albert ſubmitted to the opinion of the Count, and they ſet out ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly the next morning, with a large reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, among whom Durand, Fargeon, and Prevot were included.</p>
            <p>We will leave the travellers to purſue their jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, while we return to the Baron de Morenzi. Du Val, ever indefatigable in a cauſe, wherein his own advantage was concerned, had reſolved to make uſe of the firſt opportunity, which ſhould offer, to ſecure the lovely Emma, in the abſence of her father. For this purpoſe he aroſe at break of day, and with two truſty domeſtics, in whom he could confide the baſeſt deſigns, took his ſecret ſtand behind a thick hedge, that fenced the ſmall garden of Bernard, with an intent to watch his departure from the cottage, and to ſeize the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>protected victim whom he had devoted to his own avarice and the licentious paſſion of Moren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zi. While this wretch was lurking in ambuſh, ſome peaſants accuſtomed to call their well-belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed neighbor to the occupations of the day, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing repeated their uſual ſignal to no purpoſe, knocked at the door; they received no anſwer; an univerſal conſternation prevailed among them. After conſulting ſome time, they agreed to force the door, which having affected, they entered, and found to their aſtoniſhment the cottage de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted. Du Val and his aſſociates had by this time joined in the ſearch, and having no difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:034525_0248_0FFE1BDFB3D86E30"/>
to account for the flight of Bernard and his daughter, haſtened to the caſtle to inform the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron of a circumſtance ſo mortifying to his paſſion. Morenzi, exaſperated with rage and diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, vowed vengeance on the fugitives, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering a carriage to be got ready, threw himſelf into it with Du Val, determined to overtake the objects of his fury. Altho well convinced that they had been too cautious to attempt concealing themſelves in the village, before his departure he ordered that every cottage ſhould be ſearched. They took the ſame road which Bernard had cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen and they purſued the wanderers as cloſely as the interval of ſome hours would admit. While Morenzi was engaged in the purſuit of this venerable old man, Bernard, ſtudiouſly anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious to protect his perſucuted daughter, impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently waited the approach of morning, when the landlord had promiſed him a carriage. He had locked the door of his daughter's chamber, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending not to diſturb her repoſe until the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of departure ſhould arrive, and had return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his room below, where anxiouſly ſolicitous for the return of day; he ſtood at a window con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating the declining moon. He was rouſed from his reverſe by the entrance, thro the open door, of a large dog, which jumping up to his knees, began fawning upon him, as recollecting an old acquaintance. Bernard ſoon called to his remembrance the faithful creature; when his maſter, who had miſſed his favorite, traced him to that apartment, and entering it, diſcovered
<pb n="246" facs="unknown:034525_0249_0FFE1BE13794F160"/>
to the aſtoniſhed Bernard the unexpected form of Albert.</p>
            <p>A mutual ſurpriſe and pleaſure made them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim the ſame inſtant, "is it poſſible!" An explanation ſoon took place on each ſide; and the Count de Bournonville having joined them, he received Bernard with every mark of friendſhip and condeſcenſion.—While the good old man was recounting the occaſion of his flight, and the deſigns formed by Morenzi to betray the innocence of Emma, the rage of Albert roſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all bounds; and he ſolemnly vowed, that the monſter who had thus injured him by compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated villany ſhould fall the devoted victim of his avenging arm.—"But where," ſaid he, "is my incomparable, my glorious Emma?—Let me, by my preſence, reaſſure her tender apprehenſions, and ſwear no fate ſhall ſeparate us more; but that from this moment ſhe ſhall find in her devot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Albert, the protector of her innocence, the champion of her honour, the avenger of her wrongs!" At that inſtant a carriage drove furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly into the yard, and two perſons alighted from in, in one of whom, as it was now day, Albert recognized Morenzi.—The impulſe of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment induced him to follow the Baron. They entered a room at the ſame time,—"Villain, traitor, uſurper," exclaimed Albert, ſhutting the door, and inattentive to his own unarmed ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, "defend thyſelf, if thou dareſt encounter the juſt reſentment of Henry de Clairville, whoſe mother's blood demands the juſtice of a ſon's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge; from a ſon, who calls upon thee to expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate with thy life thy monſtrous crimes."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="247" facs="unknown:034525_0250_0FFE1BE44E910CB8"/>
The coward heart of Morenzi, ſtruck with the horrors of all conſcious guilt, froze in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom; and he ſtood fixed in mute wonder and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>may. The Count de Bournonville, accompanied by Bernard and his attendants, had joined by this time the unarmed Albert, who might have fallen a victim to the Baron's reſentment, had not a ſenſe of his own villainy, together with his aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment and terror at the ſight of the injured ſon of Clairville, arreſted the trembling arm of Morenzi. The cautious friends of Albert, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt by force dragged him from the room, and leaving Duval only with Morenzi, faſtened the door upon them, which was guarded on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide by the Count's armed retinue to prevent an eſcape. The Baron had caught a view of Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, and recollecting in him the man whom he had employed to aſſaſſinate the young Henry, he felt a ſtrong and fatal preſage of his own impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent fate! His brain was ſeized with ſudden deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; he ſnatched from his pocket a loaded piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol, and before Du Val could wreſt the weapon from his hand, he lodged the contents in his own head, and fell thus ſelf-convicted, the devoted ſacrifice of his conſcious and accumulated crimes!</p>
            <p>Du Val terrified, flew to a window, and throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing open the ſaſh, proclaimed murder, in a voice ſo audible that he inſtantly collected together a concourſe of perſons, who, urged by curioſity, ſurrounded the houſe, and demanded admittance into the room from whence the alarm proceeded: the affrighted landlord likewiſe peremptorily claimed liberty to enter; which being granted, on condition that the priſoners ſhould not be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
<pb n="248" facs="unknown:034525_0251_0FFDC6D164F19C70"/>
to eſcape, they ruſhed into the room, found the Baron lifeleſs, and Du Val leaning over his dead maſter, with looks expreſſive of horror and conſternation. When Albert viewed his fallen enemy, he ſtood for ſome moments wrapt in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent wonder—then exclaimed. "Chaſte ſhade of my departed mother, be appeaſed!—The arm which ſhed thy guiltleſs blood, has in his own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged thee, and marks by this dread deed of juſtice the unerring hand of heavenly retribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion." He then quitted the apartment, and withdrew with the Count de Bournonville, who had given orders that proper attention to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſhould be paid. They now conſulted what meaſures they ſhould take to conceal from Emma a cataſtrophe ſo fatal, till they could remove her from this horrid ſcene.</p>
            <p>Bernard determined to go to his daughter's chamber; and undertook with cautious tenderneſs to unfold to her the extraordinary circumſtance, that Albert and the Count had alighted from their chaiſe at the moment of Emma's arrival.</p>
            <p>Harraſſed by the violent agitations of mind and body which ſhe had undergone, Emma had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed for ſome time the moſt refreſhing and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found repoſe; from which ſhe was rouſed at length by confuſed ſounds of voices that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from below. She ſtarted up, and recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected her perilous ſituation, which the height of the ſun beaming thro the curtains painted in ſtrong colors, ſhe felt her apprehenſions of purſuit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed; haſtening therefore to adjuſt her dreſs,
<pb n="249" facs="unknown:034525_0252_0FFE1BEB59857280"/>
ſhe tied on her ſtraw bonnet, with an intent to rejoin her father, when he ſuddenly entered, and tenderly enquiring after her health, he found her ſo apprehenſive of danger from the interval of time, which they had loſt at the inn, that he ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to inform her of Albert's arrival, and of his waiting impatiently to be admitted to her preſence. The glowing bluſh of momentary pleaſure animated her lovely cheek, but inſtantly retreating, was ſucceeded by a deadly paleneſs. "Ah, my father," ſaid ſhe, "how ſhall I avoid him? We muſt not meet no more—I have taught my heart to renounce each fond idea which it had dared to form. Honor demands the ſacrifice. Let us fly then from redoubled danger." "O my exalted girl!" interrupted Bernard, while tears of tranſport gliſtened in his eyes; "Well doſt thou deſerve the bright reward which now awaits thy courage and thy virtue; deſcend with me into the garden, where thou mayſt guiltleſs behold again the worthy Albert, thy faithful lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and thy deſtined huſband. Let me lead thee to him—he ſhall reſolve thy timid doubts, and baniſh that incredulity, which ſpeaks in thy countenance."—Emma followed her father in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent aſtoniſhment, to a ſmall ſhurbbery at the end of a ſerpentine walk, where Albert waited her approach, whom in an inſtant ſhe beheld at her feet. "Receive," ſaid he, with a look of rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, "the heart, the hand of Albert, or rather of Henry de Clairville, the lawful heir of that uſurped caſtle and its wide domains. I hail theo miſtreſs of thoſe ſacred ſhades, where firſt my
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:034525_0253_0FFE1BECDEAEFEE8"/>
vows of conſtancy and love were offered in the atteſting ear of heaven! Within thoſe hallowed walls a ſolemn ceremony ſhall bind our faith—the Baron de Morenzi is no more.</p>
            <p>"Alas," interrupted Emma, in a tremulous voice, "has Albert then drenched his ſword in blood!—do I behold a murderer?"—"No," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied her lover, "Morenzi fell the victim of his conſcience, and of heaven's avenging judgment. Accept a guiltleſs hand, a conſtant heart, and a name unſullied—The Count de Bournonville at this inſtant reached the ſpot, when the young lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver preſented to him the fair object of his affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, whom he ſaluted with reſpect and cordial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, felicitating them both on their approaching happineſs.</p>
            <p>Events ſo extraordinary being ſoon circulated thro the adjacent country, they were received at the caſtle of Clairville with dread and wonder, but in its neighborhood with unſeigned tranſport and exulting joy. The unlooked-for reſtoration of a family to which they were ſtrongly attached by every tie of affection, gratitude, and duty, broke at once the galling yoke of that oppreſſive ſlavery, under which the tenants had groaned during the ſhort reign of an uſurper, and promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them at once liberty and happineſs.</p>
            <p>The approach of the young Marquis to the manſion of his anceſtors, being announced, he was met ſome miles from the caſtle by all the pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantry, who welcomed and followed him with ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations of unfeigned delight.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="251" facs="unknown:034525_0254_0FFE1BF12C1A0DE8"/>
The return of Bernard and his beauteous daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who were univerſally beloved, was likewiſe hailed by their ruſtic neighbors, with an honeſt ſimplicity of heart, to which that envy is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, which ſo often mingles with the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of thoſe born in the ſuperior ranks of life; and they cordially congratulated Bernard, on the rewards, which awaited his merits, in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of his virtuous daughter.</p>
            <p>As the high and venerable turrets of his native caſtle roſe to the view of Henry, emerging from the thick foliage of the lofty trees by which they were ſurrounded, a thouſand varied emotions fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his noble heart: tears to the memory of his unfortunate and reverend parents, rolled down his manly cheek: while gratitude to heaven, for the reſtoration of thoſe rights that empowered him to diffuſe happineſs around him, ſoftened his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Bernard and Emma entered their little dwelling with ſenſations very different from thoſe with which they had ſo lately quitted it. They waft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their mutual thanks to that Being, whoſe mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy had preſerved them from the machinations of a once dreaded, but now vanquiſhed enemy. The proſperous fortune that awaited Emma, fill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her boſom with humble gratitude; but the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unambitious mind of this child of innocence, impenetrable to pride and vanity, felt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
