         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The <hi>Power</hi> of God, is called, His <hi>Hand</hi>; The <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of God, is called, His <hi>Hand</hi>: But above all, The <hi>Christ</hi> of God, who is, <hi>The Power of God, and the Wiſdom of God,</hi> He is the <hi>Hand</hi> of God; By <hi>Him</hi> 'tis, that the God of Heaven doth, what He doth in the World: And <hi>He</hi> is, for that cauſe alſo Styled, <hi>The Arm of the Lord.</hi> It is therefore to the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> and <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of God, in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that our Expiring <hi>Spirits</hi> are to be committed.</p>
            <p>There was indeed a wonderful <hi>Time,</hi> when our Lord Jeſus Chriſt Himſelf made a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Uſe</hi> of this very Text.

Now, our Lord having ſaid, <hi>Into thy Hands I commend my Spirit,</hi> ſtop'd at thoſe words; for He was Himſelf the <hi>Redeemer, the Lord God of Truth.</hi> But as for <hi>us,</hi> we are to conſider <hi>God,</hi> as in our <hi>Lord Jeſus Christ,</hi> when we <hi>Commit our Spirits</hi> into His <hi>Hands.</hi> As <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> could ſay, <hi>Nolo Deum Abſolutum,</hi> I Tremble to have to do, with an <hi>Abſolute God</hi>; that is to

            <p>And now, there is a weighty CASE, that lies before us;</p>
            <p>After what manner ſhould we commit our Spirits unto our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that ſo the Eternal Safety and Welfare of our Spirits, may be effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally provided for?</p>

There were many Great Points of our <hi>Chriſtian Faith,</hi> which he ſtill treated with Shorter Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, becauſe his Thoughts were continually Swallow'd up, with the <hi>Vast Concern</hi> of not being <hi>Deceived,</hi> about the <hi>Marks</hi> of a Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate and a Sanctifyed <hi>Soul,</hi> and <hi>Hopes</hi> of being <hi>found in Chriſt</hi> at a Dying Hour.

<pb n="37" facs="unknown:000828_0037_0FAB414017D2C910"/>
Goſpel, was Tryed, by an <hi>Hard Impriſonment,</hi> which he underwent becauſe his <hi>Conſcience</hi> could not <hi>Conform</hi> to <hi>Humane Inventions,</hi> In the Sacred Service of Heaven. Yea, while he was yet a Young man, he often Travell'd far by <hi>Night</hi> in the <hi>Winter,</hi> as well as in the <hi>Summer,</hi> that ſo he might enjoy the Ordinances purely Adminiſtred, in the Meetings of the Faithful; and was laid up ſometimes in <hi>Lancaſhire Gaol</hi> for being ſound at thoſe Meetings. When he was at <hi>Limrick,</hi> the Attendance which a Perſon of Great Quality, and his Lady, (who were nearly related unto the Duke of <hi>Ormond,</hi> the Lord Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland,</hi>) upon his Miniſtry, provoked the Biſhop, to Complain unto the Lord Lieutenant.

Seldom, if ever Able to Preach at all. Mr. <hi>Baily</hi> went on, in the Exerciſe of his Miniſtry, not purſuing any Factious Deſigns, but meerly the <hi>Converſion,</hi> of men to Chriſt, and Faith, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, which the Devil counts the worſt of all Deſigns. And now, although he were ſo <hi>Harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs</hi> and <hi>Blamleſs,</hi> in his whole Converſation, that he was alwayes much Beloved wherever he came, yet another long <hi>Impriſonment</hi> was inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on him, while the <hi>Papiſts</hi> in the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, had all manner of Liberty and Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. When he was before the Judges, he told them, <hi>If I had been drinking and gaming and carou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing at a Tavern with my Company, my Lords, I preſume that would not have procured my being thus treated as an offender.

As this his Brother and Colleague notes in his Diary; <hi>He dyed well, which is a great Word; ſo ſweetly, as I never ſaw the like before!</hi> But as for this Elder Brother, he was a man of Great <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> and of ſo Tender a <hi>Conſcience,</hi> that if he had been at any Time Innocently Cheerful, in the Company of his Friends, it coſt him after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards abundance of ſad <hi>Reflection,</hi> through Fear, leſt e're he had been aware, he might have <hi>Grieved the Holy Spirit of Chriſt.</hi> A Savoury Book of his, about, <hi>The Chief End of Man,</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed among us, ha's fully deſcribed unto us, that Savour of <hi>Spirit,</hi> which was in his <hi>dayly walk</hi> mentained.</p>
            <q>Sic Oculos, Sic ille manus, Sic or a ferebat.</q>
            <p>The <hi>Deſire</hi> of this <hi>Holy</hi> man, was, (as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Expreſſed it,) to Get up unto <hi>Three</hi> Things: To <hi>Patience</hi> under the <hi>Calamities</hi> of Life; To <hi>Impatience</hi> under the <hi>Infirmities</hi> of Life; and, To earneſt Longings for the <hi>Next Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And his <hi>Deſire</hi> at another Time, he thus Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed. <hi>Oh! that I might not be of the Number of them, that Live without Love, Speak without Feeling, and Act without Life! Oh! that God would make me His Humble and Upright and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Servant!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From this Holy Temper it was, that when ſome kind preſents were made unto him, he wrote in his <hi>Diary</hi> thereupon; <hi>I have my wages quickly; But Oh! that God may not put we off,
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:000828_0041_0FAB41426A6A5278"/>
with a Reward here! Oh! that God may be my Reward!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We will more particularly Note, a few No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables, wherein the <hi>Holineſs,</hi> which Irradiated him, will be deſcribed unto us.</p>
            <p>We might begin, with Obſerving, That the <hi>Holy Word</hi> of God was very dear to him, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is to every <hi>Holy man.</hi> Hence, I find this paſſage in his <hi>Diary. Jan.</hi> 11.
<q>
                  <hi>I finiſhed the Reading of the Bible,</hi> in my Family (as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly,) Oh! it's a <hi>Dear</hi> Book; it's alwayes <hi>New.</hi> In the <hi>Beginning</hi> of every Chapter, it's good to ſay, <hi>Lord, open my Eyes, that I may ſee Wonders out of thy Law</hi>; And when we ſhut it up, to ſay, <hi>I have ſeen an end of all perfection, but thy Law is exceeding Broad.</hi> Oh! now terrible are the <hi>Threatenings</hi>; how precious are the <hi>Promiſes</hi>; how ſerious are the <hi>Precepts</hi>; how deep are the <hi>Prophecies</hi> of this Book!</q>
But we will paſs on, to ſome further Obſervations.</p>
            <p>What is <hi>Holineſs,</hi> but a <hi>Dedication</hi> to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt? This Holy man was often brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in himſelf, and preſſing on others, that Great point, of <hi>Dedicating</hi> every thing to the Service of the Lord. Thus, in his <hi>Diary</hi> there frequently occur, ſuch Strains as theſe.
<q>Oh! that I may <hi>Glorify God,</hi> with all I <hi>am,</hi> or have; even with all the faculties of my <hi>Soul,</hi> all the members of my <hi>Body,</hi> and in all the <hi>Places</hi> and <hi>Relations</hi> that I Stand in, as <hi>Man, Maſter, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:000828_0042_0FAB41432BAA96C0"/>
Husband, Kinſman, &amp; Neighbour.</hi> Oh! I ſtand in need both of a <hi>Juſtifying</hi> Chriſt, and a <hi>Sanctifying</hi> Chriſt. When ſhall I ſenſibly find a Chriſt, Swaying his Scepter in my Soul!</q>
Thus, whatever <hi>Houſe</hi> he came to Live in, it came under a <hi>Dedication</hi>; and once upon a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move, he wrote this paſſage in his Diary.
<q>I could not but Leave my <hi>Old Houſe,</hi> with a Prayer in <hi>every Room</hi> of it, for pardoning mercy.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But it was particularly Expreſſed, when one of his <hi>Children</hi> was to be <hi>Baptiſed.</hi> He thus wrote upon it.
<q>I ſpent ſome Time, in Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up my ſelf, and my <hi>Child</hi> unto the Lord, and in taking hold of the <hi>Covenant</hi> for my ſelf and him. It is Actually to be done to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, [in Baptiſm.] I prayed hard this day, all this day, that I might be able in much Faith, and Love, and New-Covenant-Obedience, to do it to morrow. It is not <hi>Eaſy,</hi> tho' <hi>Common,</hi> to offer a Child unto God in <hi>Baptiſm.</hi> Oh! that's a ſweet word, <hi>I will be a God to Thee, and thy Seed after thee.</hi> No marvel <hi>Abraham</hi> fell on his Face at the hearing of it!</q>
            </p>
            <p>Hence, when he parted with the greateſt En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment he had in this World, he thus wrote upon it, in his Diary;</p>
            <p>
               <q>If I can but Exchange <hi>Outward Comforts</hi> for <hi>Inward Graces,</hi> 'tis well enough: Oh! for an Heart to <hi>Glorify God in the Fire</hi>!</q>
            </p>

               <pb n="43" facs="unknown:000828_0043_0FAB4143EC273518"/>From this <hi>Holineſs,</hi> proceeded that <hi>Watchfulneſs,</hi> which Diſcovered a ſingular <hi>Fear of God,</hi> in his whole Converſation. I find him Entring in his <hi>Diary,</hi> ſuch paſſages as theſe.</p>
            <p>At one Time.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I did not watch my <hi>Tongue</hi> ſo as I ought; which coſt me much Trouble afterwards, and made me walk Heavily. It's a <hi>mad Thing</hi> to <hi>Sin!</hi>

            </p>
            <p>At another Time.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I ſpoke Two <hi>unadviſed words</hi> to day. Tho' there was no great Harm in them, yet I was Rebuked by my Conſcience for them. Let the Lord Forgive them; and for the future, ſet a watch before the <hi>Door of my Lips.</hi> Let my <hi>Thoughts and words be acceptable in thy ſight,</hi> O Lord.</q>
            </p>
            <p>At another Time.</p>
            <p>
               <q>That's a ſerious word, methinks, in Eph. 5.30. I have <hi>Grieved</hi> the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> by my <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edifying Communication.</hi> Oh! that in ſpeaking, I might <hi>Administer Grace to the Hearer!</hi> Oh! that <hi>Honey</hi> and <hi>Milk</hi> were under my Tongue continually.</q>
            </p>
            <p>At another Time.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I was too forgetful of God, and exceeding in <hi>Tobacco.</hi> The Lord pardon that, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sins, and heal this Nature, and humble this Heart.</q>
At another Time.</p>
            <p>
               <q>This Day I have been more chearful, than I
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:000828_0044_0FAB4144AA4AC840"/>
have been, of a Long Time. It hath afflicted me ſince, fearing it was not ſuitable. Oh! I ought to walk in the midſt of my Houſe, in a perfect way. I ought every day to be wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Copies; and to Leave a <hi>Stock</hi> behind me, that others may trade for God withal, when I am Dead.</q>
And, Behold, you ſee this Day, that he did ſo.</p>
            <p>And as <hi>Holy</hi> men, uſe to be full of Hearty Prayers, and Wiſhes, for the Good of other men, thus this <hi>Holy</hi> man, has fill'd many places in his <hi>Diaries,</hi> with his Prayers for the Welfare of thoſe, with whom he was concerned; from whence we may gather how full his Heart was of Bleſſings for his Neighbours.</p>
            <p>Once particularly I find him thus Writing.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I deſired to know of Dr. <hi>O.</hi> what I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to him, for thoſe many Rich Things I have had from him: he told me, <hi>Nothing</hi>; [which was a great Favour!] only deſired my <hi>Prayers</hi> for him. Oh! that I could <hi>Pray!</hi> Whenever I can <hi>Pray,</hi> I would heartily ſay to God in the Name of Chriſt, for him, <hi>The Lord bleſs him indeed! Let thy Hand be with him, and keep him from all Evil, that it may not Grieve him.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, It was not only among the Great <hi>Signs,</hi> but alſo among the Great <hi>Means,</hi> of his <hi>Holineſs,</hi> that he was very ſollicitous, as well in his <hi>Preparation</hi> for the <hi>Table of the Lord,</hi> as in

            <p>ECcleſiaſtical Hiſtory mentions this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Diſpoſition, in one of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and <hi>Confeſſors</hi>; That when the Sworn Enemies of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> Examined him, <hi>What he was</hi>? he would ſtill give them no other Anſwer, but this, <hi>I am a Chriſtian:</hi> If they asked him, what Countrey-man he was, or, what Employment he had, or, who were his Friends, or, any other matter, his Anſwer to them ſtill was no other than this, <hi>I am a Chriſtian</hi>: Thus he ſtill Anſwered, although he ran the hazard of his Life, by making ſuch an Anſwer!</p>
            <p>It is to be ſuppoſed, that <hi>Moſt,</hi> if not <hi>All,</hi> of the Perſons, who Compoſe the Aſſembly, now together in this place, if they ſhould be asked, <hi>What they are?</hi> would make that Anſwer, <hi>I am a Chriſtian</hi>: And indeed there is no Danger; 'tis
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:000828_0059_0FAB415CAA986758"/>
a matter of ſome Credit, among us, in ſuch an Anſwer. But then there is ano<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>her Queſtion, hence proper to be Conſidered: <hi>What is a CHRISTIAN?</hi> And it is to be feared, That very many, who wear that <hi>Worthy Name,</hi> can make, either but a ſorry Anſwer to that Queſtion, or ſuch an Anſwer as muſt carry their own Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and Condemnation in it.</p>
            <p>You are at this Time, to be Entertained with a Diſcourſe on that Important Queſtion. And we may fitly Introduce our Diſcourſe, with ſome Enquiry into the <hi>firſt Original</hi> of that <hi>Name,</hi> CHRISTIANS; which Enquiry may Receive ſatisfaction, from the words now Read unto us.</p>
            <p>The Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, was begun to be Preached unto the <hi>Gentiles: Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och</hi> particularly was a City of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> where the Preaching of the Goſpel was Crowned with a great Succeſs. And at this <hi>Antioch</hi> it was, that the Name of CHRISTIANS, was firſt put upon the people, who <hi>Received the Love of the Truth</hi> of that Goſpel. It had been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted, as a thing to come to paſs at the coming of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> in Mic. 4.5. <hi>We will walk in the Name of the Lord our God for ever and ever.</hi> And there now ſeems a partial compl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tion of this prediction, in our having the Name of CHRISTIANS; for CHRIST, is the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>the Lord our God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have Two Things here before us, that ſeem Remarkable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="unknown:000828_0060_0FAB415D6BA6F510"/>Firſt, We have the <hi>Name,</hi> which was betimes faſtned upon the <hi>Diſciples</hi> of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. This Bleſſed people, had hitherto cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led one another, by the Name of <hi>Diſciples,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their ſubjection to the Inſtruction, and Protection, and Government, of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Beca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe of their <hi>Faith</hi> alſo, they call'd one another <hi>Believers</hi>; Becauſe of their <hi>Love,</hi> they call'd one another <hi>Brethren</hi>; and they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led one another <hi>Saints,</hi> becauſe of their <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs</hi> unto the Lord. Their Enemies all this while, called them <hi>Nazarenes,</hi> and <hi>Galilaeans,</hi> becauſe our Lord was Conceived, and had Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided at <hi>Nazareth</hi> in <hi>Galilee</hi>; and His Apoſtles were moſtly of that Countrey. But now, the Honourable Name of CHRISTIANS, became <hi>That,</hi> by which they were afterwards moſt of all diſtinguiſhed.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We have the <hi>Place,</hi> where this Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable Name firſt of all began. This was at <hi>Antioch.</hi> There were, it may be, no fewer than Seven and Twenty Cities of <hi>Aſia,</hi> wearing the Denomination of <hi>Antioch</hi>: Which was occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by two ſeveral <hi>Anti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>chus</hi>'s, potent Princes, who founding, repa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ing, and enlarging the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Cities, procured them to be thus from themſelves denominated: or elſe their Favourites to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>k this way of naming Cities from them to be Recommended unto their Favour. But the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch</hi> here mentioned, was undoubtedly That in
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:000828_0061_0FAB415E2AD83360"/>
               <hi>Caeloſyria,</hi> the <hi>Metropolis</hi> for the Trade of theſe Regions. It was called, <hi>Antioch the Great</hi>; Behold here, as <hi>Great</hi> a Thing, as any that ever made it ſo: A <hi>Church</hi> of CHRISTIANS, here firſt wearing ſo <hi>Great</hi> a Style. The Evangeliſt <hi>Luke,</hi> who writes the Story of this thing, was a <hi>Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen</hi> of <hi>Antioch</hi>: and behold, what a memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Note he Leaves, for the Everlaſting Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Town, whereof he was a <hi>Citizen</hi>: the Style of CHRISTIANS, was never heard of, ſays he, till firſt at my Town of <hi>Antioch.</hi> It had been foretold unto the people of <hi>Chriſt; The Sons of them that Afflicted thee, ſhall come ſtoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping unto Thee.</hi> See now that p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ophecy in a ſmall part fulfilled! In that very City, which had been the <hi>Seat,</hi> and ſtill bore the <hi>Name,</hi> of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> the moſt Bloody Tyrant, that ever <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the people of <hi>Chriſt</hi> had groaned under, that people are now multiplied; and obtain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> an Appellation, which muſt be extended as far as any part of the Earth, which the Sun ſhines up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and continued as long as the Sun &amp; Moon Endure in Heaven.</p>
            <p>Two Things one would now Enquire.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Who it was that firſt gave the Name of CHRISTIANS, to the <hi>Diſciples</hi> of our Lord? Of that I ſay, It is not probable, That this Name was impoſed upon the <hi>Diſciples,</hi> in a way of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſion, by their <hi>Perſecutors:</hi> Their Perſecutors would rather have contrived a more Deriſory or
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:000828_0062_0FAB415EEA775298"/>
De<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>amatory Name for them, and have call'd <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>em, as one ſaies, <hi>Crucifixians,</hi> or ſome like Term of Contempt. It is much more probable, That the <hi>Diſciples</hi> Aſſumed this Name to themſelves, by their own Election The Greek word, <hi>CHREMATISAI,</hi> here uſed, for <hi>Called,</hi> ſignifies, a <hi>Calling,</hi> with ſome very ſolemn and ſignal, and ſingular Circumſtances. Yea, 'tis related by <hi>Johannes Antioche<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>s,</hi> that <hi>Evodus,</hi> the Miniſter of the Church at <hi>Antioch,</hi> at a <hi>Church Meeting</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed with them, to take this Name upon them. It ſhould ſeem, that there was a ſpecial Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, from the Holy Spirit of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> unto them, for their doing of it.</p>
            <p>Secondly. Why the Name of CHRISTIANS; A Title derived from no perſon in the Trinity, but the <hi>Second</hi>; and from no other Character of that Second Perſon, but <hi>This?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of That I ſay; 'Tis only the <hi>Second Perſon</hi> in the Trinity, which took our <hi>Nature</hi> upon Him. Our <hi>Name</hi> therefore is very fitly fetch'd from that Second Perſon. 'Tis only in CHRIST, and thro' CHRIST, that God becomes our God; and it is by CHRIST, that He does what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is done for us. How Agreeably, are we called, <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> to acknowledge this? As for the Name of JESUS, it ſignifies, <hi>A Saviour</hi>; Now none of us vain <hi>men,</hi> have any claim to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſhare with our Lord, in His being ſo. Since, There <hi>is no other Name under Heaven, given a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:000828_0063_0FAB415FAC6CE8D8"/>
men, whereby we muſt be Saved,</hi> it is not fit that this <hi>Name</hi> ſhould be put upon any <hi>among men under Heaven.</hi> They who have call'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves JESUITES, in the Laſt Age, are a <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous</hi> as well as a <hi>pernicious</hi> Generation. But the Name of CHRIST, ſignifies, <hi>Anointed.</hi> Now to ſomething of This priviledge <hi>we</hi> alſo are Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced: The Apoſtle ſaies, <hi>We have Received an Anointing:</hi> And the Pſalmiſt ſays, We are <hi>Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows with our Lord in this, tho' He be Anointed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove us all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having thus briefly diſpatched theſe <hi>Two</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries, there is a <hi>Third,</hi> which remains, to be the Subject of our further, and moſt ſerious Meditations. Namely;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>What is a CHRISTIAN?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Two <hi>Preliminaries</hi> are to be Conſidered.</p>
            <p>Firſt; Many a man is not <hi>Really</hi> a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> that yet is <hi>Viſibly</hi> ſo. As the Scripture ſayes, in Rom. 2.28. <hi>He is not a Jew, that is one outwardly</hi>: Thus we may ſay, <hi>He is not a Chriſtian, that is no more than outwardly ſo.</hi> Tis t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e, A mans being <hi>Viſibly</hi> a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> is that which Entitles him to the External Priviledges of <hi>Christianity,</hi> in the Churches of God; <hi>Non Judicat Eccleſia de Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultis.</hi> But a man muſt be <hi>Really</hi> a <hi>Christian,</hi> if he would not periſh among <hi>Infidels</hi> at the laſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly; A man that is <hi>Really</hi> a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> may have many <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nchriſtian</hi> Diſorders in his Heart &amp; Walk. Alas, my Friend<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> is not <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> that is done by every <hi>Real Chriſtian</hi>! He was a <hi>Real</hi> and a <hi>First-rate Christian,</hi> who ſaid, in Rom. 7.22, 23. <hi>I Delight in the Law of God after the Inward man, but I ſee another
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:000828_0064_0FAB41606A4CB470"/>
Law in my Members.</hi> Thus it may be ſaid of a Good man; <hi>He Delights in every Good Thing, ſo far as he is a Christian man: but you may ſee ſuch a man do many Things, that are far from Christian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Prepared with theſe Two Conſideration, Let us now paſs on to Conſider, What a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> is? What are the points of <hi>Real Chriſtianity,</hi> which every <hi>Christian,</hi> as far as he is a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> does come up unto.</p>
            <p>Give your Attention, Sirs; Your Condition for Eternity, is going to be determined.</p>

               </hi> A CHRISTIAN, is one, who Adores the Lord JESUS CHRIST, as very <hi>GOD,</hi> and who Accepts that Lord, as His <hi>own GOD.</hi> The man, who does not Look upon our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as more than a man, is no <hi>Chriſtian.</hi> The Old <hi>Arians</hi> were but <hi>Pſeudo Christians.</hi> A <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi> ſees that our Lord Jeſus Chriſt is a man, but he ſees this man to be perſonally Uni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This is menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned as the Firſt, and Grand, Article of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianitie,</hi> which is the <hi>Myſtery of Godlineſs,</hi> in 1 Tim. 3.16. That our Lord Jeſus Chriſt is no other than <hi>God manifest in the Fleſh.</hi> A man may be a notable Preacher of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and write whole Books, about, <hi>The Knowledge of Chriſt,</hi> and yet not be a <hi>Chriſtian.</hi> Mighty Numbers of thoſe <hi>Hereticks,</hi> which are called <hi>Socinians,</hi> do at this day cover the face of <hi>Chriſtendome,</hi> as the <hi>Frogs</hi> did <hi>Egypt</hi> of old: They hold, that our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, is God, not by <hi>Nature,</hi> but only by <hi>Office</hi>; and not from <hi>Eternity,</hi> but only

ſince His <hi>Reſurrection.</hi> The <hi>Mahometans</hi> are as Good <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> as theſe miſerable <hi>Hereticks</hi>; for the <hi>Mahometans</hi> grant our Bleſſed <hi>Jeſus,</hi> to be a Glorious <hi>Prophet</hi> of God. Yea, there are better <hi>Chriſtians</hi> than theſe, among the <hi>Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi>; for there is a Potent Sect lately riſen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> called, <hi>The Good Followers of the Meſſiah,</hi> who hold that our <hi>Chriſt</hi> is <hi>God, and the Redeemer of the World.</hi> No, A <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> is one, who counts himſelf Robb'd, of all his <hi>Hope,</hi> and all his <hi>Joy,</hi> and all his <hi>Life,</hi> if the <hi>God-Head</hi> of his Lord Jeſus Chriſt, ſhould be queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned. A <hi>Chriſtian</hi> expects from his Lord, ſuch a <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> as will Entitle him to Life, and ſuch a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> as to Expiate all his Guilt, and ſuch a <hi>Spirit,</hi> as will Sanctify him throughout, and at laſt Raiſe him out of the Duſt, unto Heavenly and Eternal Glory. Now the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all this Expectation in the Chriſtian, is, <hi>My Chr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ical Writings have called our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, The <hi>True God,</hi> and, The <hi>Great God,</hi> and <hi>God over all</hi>; the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> is one that Heartily Subſcribes unto it. The <hi>Christian</hi> thinks of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, That this His Lord, <hi>Is every where,</hi> and, <hi>Knows every thing,</hi> and, That His Lord is, <hi>The Lord God Omnipotent,</hi> and, <hi>That all Things were made by Him,</hi> and, <hi>That He Upholds all Things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There were <hi>Christians</hi> in the Dayes of the
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:000828_0066_0FAB416A2B918C98"/>
               <hi>Old Teſtament</hi>; All the Faithful People of the <hi>God of Abraham,</hi> were <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> tho' that Name were not yet Formally put upon them. Now thoſe old <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> did Worſhip the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> as <hi>God: Joſhua</hi> did ſo. <hi>Jacob</hi> was one of thoſe old <hi>Christians</hi>; and he ſaid of the <hi>Meſſiah, This is the God that fed me all my Life Long. Job</hi> was another of them; and he ſaid, <hi>In my Fleſh, I ſhall ſee God:</hi> From whence, even a Jewiſh Rabbi, who was no <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> infers, <hi>The Word of God will take Fleſh in a Woman on Earth. David</hi> was a <hi>Chriſtian</hi>; and he ſaid of the <hi>Anointed One,</hi> our <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in Pſal. 45.7. <hi>Thy Throne, O God, is for ever and ever. Iſaiah</hi> was a <hi>Chriſtian</hi>; and he ſaid, of the <hi>Christ,</hi> who is <hi>the Child born; the Son given unto us,</hi> in Iſa. 9.6. <hi>His Name ſhall be, God, The Mighty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Unleſs our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, be unto a man, <hi>God</hi> as well as <hi>Man,</hi> and the very <hi>God,</hi> whoſe <hi>Name alone is JEHOVAH,</hi> That man cannot be a <hi>Chriſtian.</hi> The <hi>Christian</hi> accounts our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>The God, which is, and which was, and which is to come</hi>; that is to ſay, The Eternal JEHOVAH. The <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of the <hi>Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> were of this Apprehenſion; and therefore, in multitudes of paſſages, concerning the Works of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> all over the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> the Name of JEHOVAH is Aſcribed unto Him. [Thus in Zech. 12.10. Thus in Zeph. 3.9. Thus, in Jer. 33.16.] The <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves are ſo

               </gap>ſible of This, that tho' they Deny our <hi>Jeſus</hi> to be the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> yet ſeveral of their own Rabbi's, do confeſs, That when the Meſſiah comes, he ſhall be called, <hi>The Eternal JEHOVAH</hi>; and, that the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> is intended when 'tis ſaid, <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah ſhall build up Jeruſalem.</hi> There was a <hi>man,</hi> whom the Jews did Stab with a <hi>Sword.</hi> But the Old <hi>Chriſtians</hi> among the <hi>Jews,</hi> look'd upon that man, to be Aſſum'd by the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of God, into one perſon with Himſelf; Hence, they reckoned, the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> to be the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of God; and as in Zech. 13.7. that <hi>Stab'd man,</hi> they ſaw, was a <hi>Fellow,</hi> an Aequal, unto <hi>Jehovah,</hi> the Lord of Hoſts.</p>
            <p>But when the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> ſees the Demonſtration of this <hi>Myſtery,</hi> That his Lord Jeſus Chriſt, is very <hi>God,</hi> and by an ineffable Generation from all Eternity, <hi>The Son of God,</hi> he does there <hi>on,</hi> and there <hi>fore,</hi> make choice of this Lord, for his <hi>own God.</hi> The Language of the <hi>Christian,</hi> is that which <hi>Thomas</hi> uſed when he ſaw our <hi>Chriſt,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter His <hi>Reſurrection</hi> from the Dead, in Joh. 20.28. <hi>My Lord, and my God</hi>!

Truly, Sirs If we <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> are <hi>Wicked,</hi> or <hi>Worldly</hi> Wretches, we ſhall open the mouths of men, againſt our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and as in <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.7. <hi>They'l Blaſpheme that worthy Name, by which ye are called.</hi> As <hi>Averroes,</hi> the Arabian Philoſopher; he was much taken with the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi> till he ſaw a vile Thing very common a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them; <hi>Ah, Now,</hi> ſays he, <hi>Let my Soul go among the Philoſophers</hi>! Alas, Chriſtians, we ſhall horribly wrong the <hi>Souls</hi> of our Neighbours, if we allow our ſelves to do any thing, but what becomes <hi>Christians,</hi> or if we do not <hi>Adorn the Doctrine of God our Saviour.</hi> I tell you, we forfeit the Name of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> if we Live Unholily; a <hi>Profane Chriſtian,</hi> a <hi>Diſhoneſt Chriſtian,</hi> or a <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courteous Chriſtian</hi>; 'Tis a Contradiction. The Pagans of old, called the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> by the Name of, <hi>Chreſtians</hi>; they miſtook the Name, and it was now taken to ſignify, <hi>Good, Kind, Uſeful, and Sweet Natured People.</hi> Why, if we would be <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi> we muſt be <hi>Chreſtians</hi>; we muſt not be harſh, &amp; fierce and unſerviceable, &amp; ill-conditioned; we muſt be all made of Benignity towards all the

World, and count our ſelves Enriched with any opportunity to Expreſs Goodneſs, and Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes towards all the Children of men. When the Heathen Emperour <hi>Severus,</hi> did ſee Two <hi>Chriſtians</hi> moſt ſhamefully Quarrelling with one another, he gave order, <hi>Let thoſe two Wretches ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be called</hi> Chriſtians <hi>any more; Their Maſter Chriſt never taught them to do as they do.</hi> Even ſo, if any of you, <hi>Christians,</hi> do not lead Godly, Sober &amp; Righteous Lives, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt Himſelf utters &amp; Thunders that Order from Heaven about you, <hi>Let not thoſe People be called</hi> Chriſtians, <hi>any longer; Tis a Diſhonour to me, that they ſhould be called ſo.</hi> In the Primitive Times, if a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> were asked, <hi>Have you kept the Lords day ſtrictly</hi>? he would Reply, <hi>I am a Chriſtian, and I dare do no other.</hi> Thus, if it be asked concerning any of us; <hi>Do's that man Pray without ceaſing, and bring up his Family in the Fear of God, &amp; deal juſtly, &amp; fairly, &amp; kindly with all the World?</hi> Oh! Let it be Replyed; <hi>Yes, He is a Chriſtian; &amp; he dare do no other; he fears, he ſhall diſhonour his Chriſt, if he do?</hi>
