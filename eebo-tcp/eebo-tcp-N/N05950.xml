            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Of Earthquakes.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>F all Temporal Judgments, what is more <hi>Terrible</hi> than a sudden and destroying EARTHQUAKE? Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines, Plagues, and Wars are wasting and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Calamities. But these destroy in a gradual manner, and give the Inhabitants Time to escape or prepare to meet them. But an <hi>Earthquake</hi> comes on a sudden, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently does it's destructive Work in a Moment, and there is no resisting or flying away.</p>
            <p>AND <hi>in such a dismal Hour,</hi> while the Earth is Quivering under us—Does not every one rightly conceive, they feel the Glorious GOD then shaking it with his amazing Power? Does not every Mind look up and clearly see Him offended in an high Degree, and apprehend Him ready to express his Wrath in their immediate and utter Destruction?</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>IN these dreadful Works of GOD, Let us see the extream Evil and Danger of sinning against Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>OUR Sins of every Kind are full of Contrariety and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour to this most Glorious BEING. And as they are justly most offensive to HIM, they are also most dangerous and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive to us. They are so many Instances of our slighting his supream Authority, of abusing his infinite Goodness, and of rising in Opposition against Him. It is by these alone we raise his Anger; and by our Continuance in them, move Him to express it, both in Threatning and Bringing on us his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying Judgments. And O! who can stand before Him when once He appears to be Angry? For <hi>the</hi> LORD <hi>is the true GOD, He is the living GOD, and an everlasting King: At his Wrath the Earth shall</hi> TREMBLE, <hi>and the Nations shall not be able to abide his Indignation.</hi> Jer. X.10.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:007550_0004_102D77C9224CD688"/>IT is this offensive and mischievous Thing that has moved Him to testify his Displeasure in this lower World, and in every Age: To destroy not only particular Persons, Families and smaller Villages; but even whole Cities, Countries, Kingdoms, with their vile Inhabitants, and in various man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. Famines, Fires, Wars, Tempests, Plagues and Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes are so many bitter Fruits and Tokens of his high Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentment of the Sins of Men. There is no Calamity, tho' ever so great, extensive, grievous, sudden; but what our Sins, especially when persisted in, expose us to, and provoke the righteous GOD to execute on us.</p>
            <p>NOR will our sacred <hi>Covenant Relation</hi> to Him, our high Profession, or our formal religious Services, in the least avail to secure us from them. No! Alas! They rather aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate our Guilt, inflame his Wrath, and put Him on to mark us out with more signal Miseries; as He declared to his anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent People, about Two Years before the Earthquake. Amos iii.1.2. <hi>Hear this word that the</hi> LORD <hi>hath spoken against you, O Children of Israel, against the whole Family which I brought up from the Land of Aegypt, saying; You only have I known of all the Families of the Earth: Therefore I will Punish you for all your Iniquities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for <hi>Particular Places</hi> that have been most eminent for Religious Services—See how severely He threatned <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi> of old, under the Term of <hi>A<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>d</hi>; i. e. <hi>The Lion of GOD.</hi> When she grew rampant like that Creature in her violent and sinful Courses; He wou'd no more spare but treat Her with the utmost Rigour. He wou'd bring every Kind of Distress upon Her: and among the rest this dismal one. Isa. xxix.1, 2, 5, 6. <hi>Wo to Ariel, to Ariel, the City where David dwelt: Add ye Year to Year, let them Kill Sacrifices: Yet will I distress Ariel, and there shall be heaviness and sorrow, and it shall be to me as Ariel—Yea it shall be at an instant sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, Thou shalt be visited of the</hi> LORD <hi>of Hasts with Thunder, and with Earthquake, and Great Noise, with Storm and Tempest, and the Flame of devouring Fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This terrible Threatning is doubtless put on sacred Record for our Admonition upon whom the Ends of the World are
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:007550_0005_102D77CB2CAAA588"/>
come: and the Righteous GOD may execute it when He pleases on the like provoking Towns and Cities, O! That we might continually Remember it! and fear; least as it has begun to be accomplish'd on us, it should go on to be fulfilled in its extream Severity.</p>
            <p n="2">2. What <hi>abundant Reason have we to adore the Patience and Mercy of GOD, and be exceeding Thankful, that we, our Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies and Towns are not swallowed up in this calamitous Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What Loads of Guilt and Wrath are lying upon us: and how have they been growing every Year? How long have we been going on in our provoking Sins, against Light and Grace, Threatnings, Invitations, Mercies, Judgments, and every Means that GOD has used for our Reformation? And O! How heavy did we feel our Guilt, and what awful apprehensions had we of the glorious Holiness, Omniscience, Power and Justice of an angry GOD in that dismal Night of our Distress and Danger? Then we see no other Refuge but that mighty BEING, whom we had been constantly Offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: and yet to Him alone must we look for Safety.</p>
            <p>And while we felt Him shaking us over the dreadful Gulf, it may be of Fire and Brimstone, and our Houses over us also ready to give way every moment and crush us to pieces—O! How earnest were our anxious Souls for speedy Mercy and Deliverance? <q>O LORD have Mercy on me, make hast to help me! Preserve the House from Breaking, and let me not sink into the Depths of the Earth! O GOD, in the multitude of thy Mercy hear me! Let not the water-flood over-flow, nor the Deep swallow me up, nor let the Pit shut her mouth upon me! O LORD hear me, for thy Loving-Kindness is Good! Turn to me according to the multitude of thy tender Mercies, and hide not thy Face from me: For I am in Trouble: Hear me speedily: Draw nigh to my Soul and redeem it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And how wonderfully Gracious and Kind was GOD in our Time of Trouble. If He had put forth his Power in an higher measure, or had not stay'd his Hand as He did, but shaken us a few Minutes longer; our Dwellings cou'd not
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:007550_0006_102D77CD0ED5C290"/>
have born the Shock, but must have fallen to pieces on us, destroy'd the Lives of Multitudes at once, and most miserably crushed and broken others. What a doleful howling from mortal Wounds and Death had come out of our fallen Houses? and what an astonishing Desolation had we been this Day?</p>
            <p>But his Divine Compassions wrought toward us, as they wonderfully did to EPHRAIM and ISRAEL of old— <hi>How shall I give Thee up? How shall I deliver Thee? How shall I make Thee as</hi> ADMAH? <hi>How shall I set Thee as</hi> ZE<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>OIM? <hi>Mine Heart is turned within me: my Repentings are kindled together: I will not execute the Fierceness of mine Anger: I will not return to destroy Thee; For I am GOD and not Man, the holy One in the midst of Thee!</hi> Hos. XI.8.9.</p>
            <p>But that we may see something more of the Greatness of our Deliverance; I shall here briefly mention these Two Things,
<list>
                  <item>1. GOD's amazing Execution of this sort of Judgments in other Places. And,</item>
                  <item>2. His repeated Threatnings of them in these Parts of the World.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>GOD's amazing Execution of this sort of Judgments in other Places.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here I must invite you, in the Words of the Psalmist. —<hi>Come, Behold the Works of the</hi> LORD, <hi>what Desolations he has made in the Earth!—I will speak of the glorious Honour of thy Majesty and of thy wonderous Works: And Men shall speak of the might of thy terrible Acts, and I will declare thy Greatness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor need I here search the Records of former Ages: But confine my self to the Instances of the <hi>last Fourscore Years</hi>; and even of these, the <hi>most Remarkable</hi> only; for it wou'd fill a Volumn to recite them all. And as I enumerate the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, I desire you to think, they might have been the same with us; and wou'd have been so, were it not for the wonderful Forbearance and Mercy of GOD.</p>
            <p>IN a Province of PERSIA, which lies in the same Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude with ours in 1667, there was an extraordinary Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:007550_0007_102D77CEEBA83560"/>
which lasted <hi>Three Months,</hi> and not only overturned Houses, Towers, Churches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But swallowed up in one Moment <hi>Eighty Thousand</hi> Men, besides Women and Children. Multitudes of Villages and Towns, through out the Province were destroyed the same Day: Several Mountains sunk into a Level, and the great Roads were broken up and became un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passable. And about <hi>Four Years</hi> after, there was another Earthquake in the same Province on New Years Day, which swallowed up abundance of People and Houses.</p>
            <p>IN the famous City of SMYRNA, which stands on a most convenient Harbour in one of the finest Bays of the World, is one of the principal Seats of Trade in the <hi>Turkish</hi> Empire, consisted of about 90,000 People, and is not far from our Latitude neither—On <hi>June</hi> 30 1688, at Noon Day, there was a terrible Earthquake, which in one Minute threw down most of the Buildings and shattered the rest. Immense Wealth was swallowed up: the Castle sunk into a Chasm that opened under it: and <hi>Five Thousand</hi> People perished. And to add to the misery, a few Hours after, a Fire broke out of the Ruins, which consumed the Rest of the City but a few scattering Houses.</p>
            <p>In the City of NAPLES on Saturday <hi>June</hi> 5. N. S. 1688, There was a dreadful Earthquake which ruined many of their stately Churches, Colleges, Palaces, and killed many People: And on the <hi>next Day</hi> another, which threw down many Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings that were weakened the Day before. Three Ships were sunk in their Harbour. Several Seats and Places in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Country were quite destroyed, and most of their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants swallowed up. Among the rest, BENEVENTO was almost totally ruined; and of <hi>Ten Thousand</hi> People, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained scarce <hi>Six Hundred</hi> alive.</p>
            <p>IN the Kingdom of SICILY, near the same Latitude, in the Night after <hi>March</hi> 8. 1669, came on a dreadful Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake: which shook all the Buildings of <hi>One</hi> of their Towns to the Ground, and almost ruined <hi>Two</hi> more.</p>
            <p>BUT this was nothing to that most amazing one which befel that Kingdom on <hi>Jan.</hi> 9 and 11. N. S. 1692, 3.</p>
            <p>THE Night after <hi>Friday Jan.</hi> 9. in a serene, warm and
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:007550_0008_102D77D0B8107290"/>
pleasant Time, the Shakes began with a Quivering motion, and were so violent as to throw down a great many Buildings and fright the People into the Churches and Fields for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge. But on the <hi>Lord's Day</hi> following they came on like a swift Rolling Billow, and with such a vehement Impulse, as in <hi>Four Minutes</hi> to throw above <hi>Fifty Towns and Cities,</hi> with their magnificent Streets, Churches, Colleges, Castles, Towers and Pallaces, into utter Desolations, Great Churches fell down at once, while the frighted People were at their Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and crushed them to Death by Thousands. In the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining <hi>Seas</hi> there was such a furious Emotion, that several Ships as well as smaller Vessels were drowned all along the Coast of the Island. And many considerable Towns and Cities were so wholly destroyed, that there were no Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants left to give an Account of the manner of their sudden Destruction.</p>
            <p>Among the rest, CATANIA, a famous, ancient, splendid City, full of Learning, Wealth and stately Structures, sunk out of sight in a moment. Some Fishermen in the Bay in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, They saw the City sink down with the Noise, as of a Thousand great Cannon discharged at once. And in the Place were it stood appeared a <hi>Lake</hi> with vast Heaps of Rubbish here and there above the Water. Of <hi>Eighteen Thousand nine Hundred</hi> Inhabitants, <hi>Eighteen Thousand</hi> pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished; the rest having left it the Morning before: and thro'<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Island, <hi>One Hundred and Twenty Thousand,</hi> besides the bruised and like to die, about <hi>Twenty Thousand</hi> more.</p>
            <p>PALERMO the chief City at the other End of the Kingdom received some Damage in most of it's buildings, and of the People not above a Hundred kill'd. But doubtless, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the awakening Accounts not long since Published here of the late dreadful Earthquake which befell <hi>that City</hi> in the Night between the 1. and 2. of <hi>September</hi> 1726. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan between 10 and 11, and in a calm and serene Sky like ours in 1727. though at first the Shocks were not so violent and did no hurt: But soon increasing they continued with great Fury for above <hi>Twenty Minutes:</hi> whereby about a <hi>Quarter Part</hi> of that large City was intirely overturned, and
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:007550_0009_102D77D2CED96440"/>
reduced to a Heap of Rubbish. In one of it's Wards, an whole Street gaped at once with a dreadful Noise: from whence there broke out Flames mixt with calcin'd Stones and a Torrent of burning Brimstone, which consum'd the whole Ward in <hi>less than half an Hour.</hi> In <hi>Five Days after</hi> there were <hi>Three Thousand</hi> drawn out Dead from the Ruins, and many dismally mash'd to pieces: and 'twas computed about 15,000 People perished in that amazing Convulsion.</p>
            <p>At BATAVIA on the large Island of JAVA, in the East Indies, between the 4th and 5th of <hi>Jan.</hi> 1699, there was an Earthquake, whereby <hi>Sixteen Hills</hi> sunk down with a great Noise, in the adjacent Country.</p>
            <p>And at <hi>Lima</hi> the principal City of <hi>Peru</hi> and the largest in <hi>South America,</hi> on <hi>June</hi> 17. N. S. 1678, there was a terrible Earthquake, which ruined a great Part of the City. And on Monday, <hi>Octob.</hi> 20. N. S. 1687, at <hi>Four</hi> in the Morning came on another with an horrible Noise; when some Houses fell and some Persons perished under their Ruins. At 5, another shake with the same Noise. And at 6, when they tho't they were all in Safety, came on a Third with a rushing Noise and great Fury. The Sea roaring arose beyond it's Bounds: The Bells rung of themselves: The Destruction was so great that no Building stood: Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Places round about were ruined: Above <hi>Five Thousand</hi> Dead Bodies were found, and they found more Daily when the Accounts came away so that they knew not their Number.</p>
            <p>But to come a little nearer Home.</p>
            <p>There are many in this Country that well remember the fearful Tydings of that Earthquake in JAMAICA, on <hi>June</hi> 7th 1692. It came on between 11 and 12 at <hi>Noon,</hi> in a clear, calm and Sun-shine Day. It began with a <hi>small Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling,</hi> so as to make some think of an Earthquake; which Thought was confirm'd by a <hi>second Shake</hi> something stronger, accompany'd with a <hi>hollow rumbling Noise</hi> almost like Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which made them begin to run out of their Houses. But alas! This was but short warning for them to provide for their Safety: For at the Heels of the second came the <hi>Third and most violent Shake,</hi> which threw down and drowned 9
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:007550_0010_102D77D49F8682C8"/>
               <hi>Tenths</hi> of PORT-ROYAL their Capital Town in <hi>two Minutes,</hi> and all the Houses by the Wharff in <hi>less than One.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Streets</hi> rose like the Waves of the Sea; lifting up all that were in them, and immediately dropping down into Pits. The Shake was so fierce, that it threw the People on their Knees and Faces, as they run in the Streets to seek for safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. In several Places the Ground wou'd Crack and open and shut quick and fast in a wonderful manner. Some have seen <hi>Two</hi> or <hi>Three Hundred</hi> of these <hi>Openings</hi> at one time. In some of which many of the People were swallowed up: Some the Earth caught by the middle and squeez'd to Death: The Heads, Arms or Legs of others only appear'd above Ground. At the same Time a Flood of Water gushed out and roll'd over others: Some caught hold of Beams and Raf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: Others were afterwards found Dead and almost cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Sand. Some who were swallowed quite down, rose again in other Streets, being cast up with great Quantities of Water, and some into the midst of the Harbour: and yet some of these thro' the wonderful Goodness of GOD were saved; while others that went down quick, were never seen more.</p>
            <p>These were the <hi>smaller Openings.</hi> The <hi>larger</hi> swallowed Great Houses: and out of <hi>some</hi> there issued whole Rivers spouting to a vast Height in the Air, with ill Stenches that were very offensive. All the Wharves and some of the <hi>Houses</hi> sunk at once: And the most so soon, that the People had no time to get out; those who were in the upper Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers meeting the Water at the Garret Stairs as they were running down for Safety. While some of the Houses were quite swallowed up in the Earth; others were thrown on Heaps: And even the best Streets in the Town full of stately Buildings sunk so deep as to be near <hi>thirty Foot</hi> under Water.</p>
            <p>Several <hi>Sloops and Ships</hi> were overset and lost in the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. The Sea suddenly rising and swelling with a strange Emotion, came rolling with such a Force as to drive the Ships from their Anchors, breaking their Cables in an Instant, and dashing them against the Tops of the sunken Houses.</p>
            <p>While the Earth was labouring in these Convulsions, the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:007550_0011_102D77D6A1F085B8"/>
People run up and down, pale and trembling with Horror, like so many Ghosts; as if the Dissolution of the whole Frame of the World were at hand.</p>
            <p>And yet the Shake was stronger in the <hi>Country</hi> than in the Town, where it left more Houses standing than in all the rest of the <hi>Island</hi>; though it be more than <hi>One Hundred and Sixty Miles</hi> Long, and about <hi>Fifty</hi> Broad. They were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all either thrown down or swallowed up. And my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor says, it is not to be doubted, if there had been <hi>Five Thousand Towns</hi> in <hi>Jamaica,</hi> but every one of them had been ruined.</p>
            <p>The Waters of Wells above 30 Foot deep flew out at the Top. In several Places the Earth gaped prodigiously with great Spoutings of Water. The Sky which before was clear and blew, became in a Minute, dull and redish, like a red hot Oven. Amazing Noises were made by the Fall of the Mountains and the Rumblings that were heard under Ground.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Mountains</hi> were the most violent Shakings. Some falling down, stopt up the Roads and Rivers; and many were thrown in Heaps upon others. A great Mountain split, and tumbling, drove all the Trees before it, and overwhelm'd several Settlements with their Inhabitants, a Mile off. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther large high Mountain sunk and was quite devoured; And in the Place thereof arose a <hi>Lake</hi> 12 or 15 Miles over.</p>
            <p>IN a certain Ground on the North Side of the Island, the Planters Houses, with the greatest Part of their Plantations, were swallowed up, Houses, People, Trees and all in <hi>one great Opening</hi>; in the room of which arose at first a <hi>Lake</hi> of <hi>a Thousand Acres</hi> extent; But afterwards it dryed away, and left not the least appearance of House, Tree, or any thing else that was there before.</p>
            <p>IN fine, The Earth continued shaking for <hi>Two Months</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: And all the while, the Mountains tottering, and bellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing most loud and hideous Noises. About <hi>two Thousand</hi> People perished in Town, a <hi>Thousand</hi> more in the other Parts of the Island; and 'tis thought, if the Shakes had fell out in the Night, but very few had been left alive. Great Numbers of Dead Bodies were floating from one side of the
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:007550_0012_102D77D89A8E33D8"/>
Harbour to the other; sometimes <hi>one</hi> or <hi>two Hundred</hi> in an Heap, as the Winds and Seas drove them. And such a general SICKNESS presently follow'd which few escaped, and was very fatal. Half the People saved from the Earthquake at <hi>Port-Royal,</hi> are said to have Died of the Sickness at <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston</hi>: where <hi>Five Hundred</hi> Graves were dug in one Months time, <hi>Two</hi> or <hi>Three</hi> buried in <hi>One</hi> Grave. About <hi>two Thousand</hi> swept away; and in the Rest of the Island a <hi>Thousand</hi> more.</p>
            <p>And thus I have mentioned something of GOD's amazing Execution of this Sort of Judgments in <hi>Other Places.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We may now briefly,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Consider his repeated Threatnings of the same in these Parts of the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is no less than the <hi>Eleventh</hi> or <hi>Twelfth</hi> Earthquake which has been perceived in this Country since our Fathers Arrival hither, and even within this 120 Years. <hi>Four</hi> or <hi>Five</hi> of the Shocks were indeed much smaller and less exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive. But this is the <hi>Fifth</hi> that has been very General and very Awakening.</p>
            <p>The <hi>First</hi> of them all was on <hi>June</hi> 2. 1638. Mr. MOR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON says, It was <hi>a Great and terrible Earthquake.</hi> It was heard before it came with a rumbling Noise like remote Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. It came from the Norward and passed to the Southward. As the Noise came nearer, the Earth began to shake: And it quickly rose to that Violence as to make the moveables to clatter and fall. Those who were in their Houses were afraid of their falling: And others abroad were not able to stand, but were forced to catch hold of Fences to preserve themselves. About <hi>half an Hour after,</hi> came another Noise and Shaking, though not so loud or strong as the former. It was <hi>far in the Land</hi> as the Indians observ'd: and not only ashoar, but, also at <hi>Sea,</hi> some Ships on the Coasts being shak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en thereby.</p>
            <p>The same Author tells us, That in 1658 there was <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Great Earthquake</hi> in <hi>New-England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And on <hi>Jan.</hi> 26. 1662, 3, at the shutting in of the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, there was a <hi>very Great Earthquake</hi>; and the same Night
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:007550_0013_102D77DAA64AD370"/>
               <hi>Another</hi>; though somewhat less than the former. And on the 28th of the same Month <hi>Another</hi> about 9 in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <note n="*" place="bottom">CANADA seems to have been the chief Seat of this Great Concussion. For on the very same Day. viz. <hi>Jan.</hi> 26. O. S. 1663, Monsieur FREZIER tells us, Began an amazing Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake There, which continued till <hi>July</hi> following and made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible Alterations on the Surface of the Earth for 400 Leagues thro' the Country. And CLUVERUS gives us a most hideous Description of it, in his HISTORIARUM totius mundi EPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TOME.</note>
            </p>
            <p>On the Night after the Lord's Day Octob. 29. 1727. about 40 Minutes past 10. in a calm and serene Hour, the Town of <hi>Boston</hi> was on a sudden extreamly surpriz'd with the most violent Shock of an <hi>Earthquake</hi> that has been known among us. It came on with a loud hollow Noise like the Roaring of a Great fired Chimney, but incomparably more fierce and terrible. In about <hi>half a Minute</hi> the Earth began to heave and tremble: The Shock increasing, rose to the Height in about a <hi>Minute</hi> more, when the Moveables, Doors, Windows, Walls, especially in the upper Chambers, made a fearful Clattering, and the Houses rock'd and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, as if they were all dissolving and falling to pieces. The Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple asleep were awakened with the greatest astonishment: many others affrighted run into the Streets for Safety. But the Shaking quickly abated, and in another <hi>half Minute</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely ceased.</p>
            <p>The Noise and Shakes seem'd to come from the <hi>Norwest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> and to go off <hi>Southeasterly</hi>; and so the Houses seemed to reel. Some Damage was done to the more brittle sort of Moveables, and some Bricks on the Tops of some Chimneys fell; but not an House was broken, nor a Creature hurt. At several times till <hi>Day-light,</hi> were heard some distant Rumblings, and some fainter Shocks were felt.</p>
            <p>And after several smaller ones in the Interval since, <hi>This Last</hi> seems to be the most dreadful of all, among us.</p>
            <p>And now, When we hear what Desolations have been made by this terrible Judgment in other Parts of the Earth,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:007550_0014_102D77DCA6600150"/>
and how often we have been threatned Here with the same; How greatly do these things inhance our Deliverance? How glorious shou'd the Mercy and Patience of GOD appear in our Eyes? How high shou'd it raise our Thankfulness to Him? How affectionately shou'd we rejoice in the LORD our Deliverer? And how loudly shou'd we declare his Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Sing forth his Praises.</p>
            <p>LET us therefore always bare in our Minds the Scriptural <hi>Threatnings</hi> of this fearful Calamity, with the surprizing <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances</hi> of their sudden Execution on others. And let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the GREAT and TERRIBLE DAY of GOD is hastning, and how near we know not—when the LORD of GLORY shall come down to shake the Heavens and the Earth to pieces, to set this lower World on Fire, to consume the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners out of it; to refine it, and that it may be a Place of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness and fit for his Dwelling. Then, though the <hi>Jews</hi> may have the distinguishing Grace to mourn with Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, when they see Him they have pierced, yet the <hi>rest of the Tribes of the Earth</hi> shall mourn with utter Dispair. And then so insufferable will his Brightness quickly appear; that though at first they might fly from the tottering Rocks and Mountains, they will soon fly back to get under them, and wish them to fall and cover them from the Face of Him that sits on the Throne, and from the Wrath of the Lamb. <hi>Rev.</hi> vi.12,—<hi>c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>TO Conclude,</hi> Let us therefore now this moment look to this only SAVIOUR, Receive Him in all his Offices, Give up our selves wholly to Him for ever: And then live in the Exercise of every watchful Grace and Duty; with our Lips and Lives continually Praise Him; and abound in the delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Contemplations of Him, till we come to long for that Illustrious Appearance. And then We shall lift up our Face with an holy Joy and Confidence; our temporal Dangers will end in Eternal Safety; our trembling Dwellings be changed for an unmoveable Kingdom; and our anxious Fears will vanish in perfect Quietness and Assurance for ever.</p>
            <p>For of that Great Day we have the lively Description in Nahum I.2,—8. <hi>GOD is jealous, and the</hi> LORD <hi>revengeth,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

            <p>IN Compliance with your Desire, I shall give you an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the surprizing <hi>Earthquake</hi> which happen'd the 18th Inst. at 25 Minutes past 4 in the Morning, having been perfectly awake sometime before it began; and having felt several before in this Place as well as the <hi>West Indies,</hi> I had a better Command of my self in making my Observations thereon, especially as I laid in my Bed the whole time under the best Composure of Mind I could bring my self to. It was first introduced with a Noise like several Coaches rattling over the Pavements, or rather like the Noise of many Cartloads of paving Stones thrown down together. I was sensible it came from the Northwest, and that side of my House felt the first Concussion. The first Motion was a strong <hi>Pulsation,</hi> which threw my House upwards; immediately after a <hi>Tremor</hi> succeeded, which in half a Minute abated a little, but then instantly a quick <hi>Vibration</hi> with sudden <hi>Jerks</hi> followed; and this by my best Observation held near a Minute, before the second Abatement, which went off gradually, in about half a Minute more, so that the whole Duration from the first <hi>Pulse,</hi> to the End of the Shock seemed to be about two Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes; the greatest Force I apprehend was about a Minute after it began, and had that <hi>Vibration,</hi> with those <hi>sudden Jerks,</hi> continued <hi>one Minute</hi> longer, I much question whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther one House in Town had been left standing. The first View I took was the Steeples of the Churches and Meetings, and was glad to see them standing, but the Spindle and Vane of <hi>Faxeuil Hall Market</hi> was thrown down; I observed the Tops of many Chimneys demolished, others crack'd and much damaged, Bricks, Tile and Slates scatter'd in the Streets, and large Quantities of Morter and Rubbish almost
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:007550_0016_102D77DFE8FCFB20"/>
every where spread, especially in the Streets near the Dock, and Alleys between the Warehouses, where most Damage seem'd to have been done; and several Houses have suffer'd by large Cracks and Breaches to their Foundation.</p>
            <p>Upon the first Shock of the <hi>Earthquake,</hi> many Persons jump'd out of their Beds, and ran immediately into the Streets, while others sprung to the Windows, trembling, and seeing their Neighbours, as it were naked; <hi>shrick'd with the Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions of its being the Day of Judgment,</hi> and some tho't they heard the LAST TRUMP founding, and cry'd out for Mercy, others fainted away, with the Fright, and those of the <hi>most composed Temper,</hi> that were sensible of these tremendous Shak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, expected instantly, to be swallowed up, and buried in the Ruins. In short Children ran screaming to their Parents, to save them; and the <hi>Brute Creatures lowed,</hi> and ran to the Barns, for Protection; the <hi>Dogs bowled</hi> at their Masters Doors, the <hi>Birds</hi> flutter'd in the Air, with a Surprize; and all the <hi>Animal Creation</hi> were fill'd with Terror: and never was such a Scene of Distress in <hi>New-England</hi> before. In my Walk out about Sun rising, every Face look'd <hi>ghastly,</hi> and many Persons Knees smote one against another, and few were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered of the great Fright and Surprize they had been put into, by this <hi>awful Providence</hi>; and all seem'd to expect a Repetition of this <hi>terrible Judgment.</hi> In fine, some of our solid, and Pious Gentlemen, had such an Awe and Gloom spread in their Countenances, as would have check'd the gay Airs of the most <hi>intrepid Libertine</hi> among us. Such Judgments may well make us cry out with the Psalmist, <hi>My <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
