            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>In the distressing time of the late War with the <hi>Indians</hi> in <hi>N-England,</hi> many of the Rulers (both Civil and Ecclesiastical) in <hi>Connecticut Colony,</hi> being sensible that publick Judgements seldome come, but as Intimations of Heavens displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure; and that then, of all Men the Leaders of the People are concerned to enquire into the Causes of the Lords Controversie, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21.1. they did accordingly meet for that purpose.

Our <hi>Jewish Sabbatarians</hi> who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse those words of Christ to countenance their Error; might as well from thence argue that the Ceremonial Law is still in force. For its certain it was not abolished until every tittle contained therein was fulfilled. It has been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, that Christians in the Primitive times ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served the seventh day. The Christian <hi>Jews</hi> in the Apostles time had a religious respect, not only for the seventh day Sabbath, but for Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision and other Ceremonies, until such time as the <hi>Iudaical World</hi> was utterly destroyed, but the Apostles never allowed Christianized Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles so to <hi>Iudaize.</hi> The <hi>Ebionites</hi> kept the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day, but they were never accounted true Christians. The <hi>Constitutions</hi> which pass under the Name of <hi>Clement,</hi> L 7.C.24. commend the observation both of the seventh and of the first day of the week.

Of later times there have not been ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of any great Fame or Note in the World, that have stood up for this Opinion. There was in <hi>England</hi> formerly <hi>Braborn</hi> and <hi>Trask;</hi> but they afterwards recanted. Within these few years, Mr. <hi>Bramfield</hi> of <hi>Sherborn</hi> was strangely drawn away into this Error. But his weightiest Objections are answered, with great judgment and candour, by the Reverend Mr. <hi>William Ben</hi> of <hi>Dorchester</hi> in <hi>Dorset</hi> (a Man whose Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion was occasioned by a Sermon of his own; after which he continued an eminent Light in the Church of God for fifty years together; and than whom I never knew Man upon Earth that did maintain a greater intimacy of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God) Nor has Mr. <hi>Bramfield</hi> made any Reply to Mr. <hi>Ben'</hi>s Book, so far as I have seen or heard.</p>
                  <p>As for the present <hi>Jewish Sabbatarians</hi> in <hi>Connecticut Colony</hi> they out-do all their Predecessors, as to Insolent Behaviour, being arrived unto that height of impudent.

Professors, those beautiful visions, and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming Discoveries of his Glory, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. he doth withdraw the rising Beams of the Sun of Righteousness, and the shadows of the Evening are stretched upon them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 6.4 5. and the temptations of Satan, and the World doth look upon them, and make them Sun-burnt, and Black<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

And thus Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy considered as a decay of the beauty of a religious Profession, and this maketh way for the clearing of the Reason, why Apostasie is the root of other sins; and that is,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Because other sins in nature follow this, and they are as branches or bitter fruits: the sin of omission, is in nature before the sin of commission; a neglect of what ought to be done, before the practice of that which ought not to be done; a forsaking the Fountain of living Waters, and then follows, <hi>our hewing Cisterns, broken Cisterns which can hold no Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> Jer.2.13.</p>

2. The other sins are (through the Lords just judgement) a punishment of the former. Apostasie, is punished with many vices, that where Apostasie comes in, behold a troop of other sins follow, <hi>Psal.</hi> 81.11,12. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.24,25. But of this in that which followeth. Thus Apostasie hath been considered in the kind quality of it: Now in the next place we may see how it shews it self in the degrees of it.</p>
                  <p>The Question is, <hi>What are those degrees and steps in which this Apostasie doth shew it self?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> Apostasie doth shew it self in the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of several Duties of Gods Worship, or of Family Duties, or private Christian Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and at last in the neglect of the Publick Worship of God.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Apostasie beginneth in secret, in the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of secret Prayer, that which is called clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set Prayer, or praying alone, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.6. or in the neglect of self examination; that which is called a judging a Mans self, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.31. to judge our state whether it be happy or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable, to judge our daily way and particular actions, whether they be good or evil, and to this is requisite some convenient season daily, and a Conscience and Heart awakened to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the timely way of Self examination,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:000341_0010_0FA4AAE0715CFE50"/>
                     <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.40. <hi>Jer.</hi> 8.6. And the neglect of these Duties is, either total, as those who have cast off secret Prayer, and Self-examination, and do neglect any set, solemn and steady atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance to these duties, <hi>Job</hi> 15.9. unless it be in some fit of distress, and then they cry to God, and say, <hi>Arise and save us,</hi> Jer.2.27.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Or if they do daily attend to these Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and yet neglect that which is of most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal and special concernment to their own Souls; you may be in a secret place with a Friend, and have much discourse, and that in secret, and yet not one word of secret things, but that which any one may hear: likewise, you may be in prayer alone in secret, and yet not one word or that which is of most secret concernment to your Soul, but that which may be exprest before a Family or a Congregation; and thus one principal end of Secret Prayer is lost, which respecteth the Confession of secret sins, <hi>Psal.</hi> 19.12. and the petitioning for those personal and secret favours which may not so conveniently be exprest before others, <hi>Psal.</hi> 38.9. But the specialty intended in the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of this, is to shew how far the neglect of these secret Duties doth argue a declension from Religion.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Those who neglect secret Duties have

And to conclude this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, we may consider,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Some do despise the Covenant in the administrations of it, or by their practice pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, that the Covenant is not worthy of their care, labour and cost, and it may be drop some scoff or mocking expression, but will not seek the Lord in the way of his Covenant these are in the high way to that unpardonable sin against the Holy Ghost, of counting the blood of the Covenant an unholy thing, and of doing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spite to the spirit of Grace <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.27,28.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Some have visibly taken hold of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant but do live in the breach of it, <hi>Psa.</hi> 78.37,38. &amp; 50.16,17. and the Lord saith, what hast thou to do to take my Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant

into thy mouth, seeing thou hatest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions, and castest my words behind thee. And the quarrel the Lord hath against a People or particular persons whether it be for despising his Covenant or breach of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ever implieth.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. These are guilty of sinning against the greatest love; for the love of God in conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending to enter into Covenant with a sinner, is the highest act of love, and to despise this Covenant or the things of it, or live in the breach of it, is to spit reproach and contempt in the most beautiful face of divine Love: do you thus requite the Lord, O foolish People and unwise, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32 6.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. These sin against the only Remedy. What cure and relief can there be for sinners but from Christ, and how doth Christ relieve but in the way of his Covenant, in the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of it: how can those escape who neglect this great Salvation? <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.3. and hence follows the greatest punishment for the quarrel of the Covenant, <hi>Amos</hi> 3.3. You I have known of all the Families of the Earth, and you I will punish, when the inquiry is made when they see what plagues &amp; sicknesses come upon the Land, wherefore hath the Lord done thus to this Land? and the Answer is, because

                  <p n="1">1.

                     </gap> the first place is,</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> Because some under the means of Grace have rejected the knowledge of God, and therefore are left to gross ignorance, or not loving truth as truth, and therefore are left to abuse their light and knowledge to their destruction.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Some have rejected knowledge, that its become the object of their hatred, as if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction was not worthy of their love, and if they be reproved, they do despise reproof, and the reprover, and will not obey the voice of their Teachers, <hi>Prov.</hi> 5.12,13. the reading good Books, the Writing and Repeating of Sermons, the Schools of Learning, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versing with the wise, and all good means of knowledge in their hearts they despise, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.22, <hi>How long ye simple ones will ye love sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity,

                  <p n="2">2. The punishment upon these followeth, therefore they are left to a sottish ignorance, they have not so much light as shall keep them from sottish and bruitish ignorance, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.22. they are sottish Children, they have no under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.4. surely they are poor and foolish, they know not the way of the Lord, and the judgement of their God, they have rejected the knowledge of God, and are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore left to the darkness of gross Ignorance.</p>

                  <p>The second follows concerning Prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: the <hi>Question</hi> is,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>How it comes to pass that some under the means of Grace are given up to Prophaneness?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Answer</hi> is, Because some under the means of Grace have rejected saving Grace in the Gospel, and therefore the Lord with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draws common restraining Grace from them, and they become prophane.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Some are prophane, although they live under the means of Grace, these will not shew a civil respect to Religion and that good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners which civility will teach; their words are scornful and mocking, abusing the Holy Scriptures in a jesting and deriding manner, like those Scoffers who said, where is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of his coming? 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.3,4. these are a pest and a most dangerous infection in societies, by their evil communication do cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt good manners, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.33. their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, Gestures and Lives do declare them to be like a mocking <hi>Ishmael,</hi> or prophane <hi>Esau, Heb.</hi> 12.15,16. look diligently lest any

man fail of the Grace of God lest there be any Fornicator or Prophane Person as <hi>Esau.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. These have rejected saving Grace in the Gospel the God of all Grace by the means of his Grace, the Ordinances, and by the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Examples of the godly, seconded by some afflicting providences, and sometimes with convictions and terrors of Conscience hath been striving with these, but they would not hearken to his voice, and would have none of him and his saving Grace, and therefore are given up to their hearts lusts, <hi>Psal.</hi> 81.11,12. <hi>Wo unto thee, wilt thou not be clean, when will it once be,</hi> Jer.13.27.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Hence the Lord hath withdrawn re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straining Grace, that those who reject saving Grace in the Gospel, and will not live as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh godly men; the Lord withdraws common restraining Grace from them, that they shall not live as becometh men, this is the reason why some are so lewdly filthy, that in their filthiness is lewdness, because they would not be purged, and therefore the Lord saith, they shall not be purged, but the Lords fury shall rest upon them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 24.13. this is the reason why some under the means of Grace are more prophane than some others who
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:000341_0021_0FA4AAEEAEC8E208"/>
enjoy no such means to reform them, and that they are become more prophane then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they enjoyed the means of Grace; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they have provoked the Lord by their resistings of the strivings of the Spirit of Grace, to give them up to most horrid and hellish prophanenss, that as <hi>Israel'</hi>s abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions shall exceed the silth of <hi>Samar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The third bitter fruit, concerning gross neglects of relative Duties: And the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion is,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Why are some under the means of Grace left to those palpable neglects of relative Duties, in Family, Church and Common-Wealth?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Answer:</hi> Because some under the means of Grace, living in neglect of Duties towards God, and of duties towards others in the Lord, its just with the Lord to leave them to gross neglects of relative duties one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards another.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="33" facs="unknown:000341_0021_0FA4AAEEAEC8E208"/>
1. There are some who though they enjoy the means of Grace, yet they li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e in the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of duties in Relation to the God of Grace, he hath profered a holy Marriage Covenant to them; and himself as the only suitable Match and Husband for the immortal Soul, <hi>Isai.</hi> 54 5. but they have loved Strangers and after them they will go, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 25. neither will they honour him as a Father, nor fear him as their Master, but despise his Name, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.6. if they call him their God, yet they cast off the thing that is good, <hi>Hos</hi> 8.25</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Hence it follows, these never did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form duties in relation to others in the Lord, for this is the Religious and true Gospel band in all Relations; <hi>Husbands love your Wives, as Christ loved his Church,</hi> Eph.5.25. <hi>Wives submit your selves to your Husbands, as is fit in the Lord,</hi> Col.3.18. <hi>Children obey your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents in the Lord,</hi> Ephes.6.1: <hi>Srevants obey your Masters in singleness of heart, fearing the Lord,</hi> Col.3.22. But those who do not consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiously attend duties in Relation to the Lord, do feel no such Religious band upon their hearts and Consciences in relation to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but act only as moved by some natural or moral Principles which are too weak to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist the violence of temptations and distempers.</p>

                     <pb n="34" facs="unknown:000341_0022_0FA4AAEF9AAC6A38"/>
3. Therefore its just with the Lord to leave these to some notorious neglects of relative duties one to another; if the Husband be a man of <hi>Beliai,</hi> he is likewise a <hi>Nabal,</hi> and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is with him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.25. and will behave himself foolishly or bitterly against the Wife of his Bosome, <hi>Colos.</hi> 3.19.

If Parents, and Heads of Families do neglect obedience unto and to act in imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Heavenly Father, and live as if they had no Master in Heaven, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6.9. they will be left either by their rash passions to provoke unto wrath, <hi>Ephes</hi> 6.9. and to discourage those under their Government, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.21. or they will by an unadvised indulgence neglect to bring theirs up in the nurture and admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lord, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.4. but let them live like the wild Ass in the Wilderness, snuffing up the Wind, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.24. and if Children are not in subjection to the Father of Spirits, they will not behave themselves reverently to the Fathers of their flesh, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.9.

                  <p>The like may be said of neglect of duties in a Plantation, Church and Common-wealth-Relations, if Rulers Civil or Ecclesiastick do not rule actually in the fear of God, 2 <hi>Sam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And if a people do not subject to Ruler<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

2. Or these who do not see what ought to be reformed, do fix upon some lesser matters of the Law, and spend the strength of their zeal in reforming those lesser matters of the Law, but do suffer the more weighty matters of Judgement, Mercy and Faith to lye unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.23. and all these poor blinded Souls are ready to say as those who were reproved for wearying the Lord, for robbing of God, and were commanded to return to the Lord, with a promise that the Lord would turn towards them; but they said wherein have we wearied thee, or robbed thee? and wherein shall we return? <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.7,8. these do not see what ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, but these shall see whether they will or no, either to their Conversion or their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion, <hi>Isai.</hi> 26.11.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>ARguments Grounded upon the Word of God, to prove that the First Day of the Week is by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Appointment the Day separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for Holy Worship, and ought to be kept Holy unto the Lord, according to the Rules of Sanctifying the Sabbath, and consequently the Cessation of the seventh Day Sabbath in these Gospel Dayes.</p>
                     <p>And then a Reply to <hi>John Rogers</hi> his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers to some Questions sent to him from the Honourable Governour of <hi>Connecticut;</hi> and likewise an Answer to <hi>John R.</hi> his seven Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions with which he concluded.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>Concerning the Arguments, the Question is not now concerning the Name, whether to be called a Christian Sabbath<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which some take to be Analogically a resemblance to the <hi>Jewish Sabbath;</hi> or whither to be called the Lords Day, which some have thought to be a

more Gospel Name. But the Subject of our Discourse at this time, is not concerning the Name but the thing, and far be it from me to imagine that I can add any thing to, or do so well as those Worthies, Doctor <hi>Bound,</hi> Mr. <hi>Abbot,</hi> Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> &amp; Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> Mr. <hi>Shepard,</hi> and others have done in their Learned Ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate Discourses upon this Subject, only I shall take some Arguments which to me seem most suitable to my present purpose.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The first is from <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.10. in which the Apostle declared <hi>that he was in the Spirit on the Lords Day:</hi> For the opening of which words to make way for the Argument we may Consider:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> It was some particular Day in the week, which the Apostle calls the Lords Day: for his Scope is to notifie at what particular time he had the Visions and Revelations of so great concernment to all the Churches in all Ages to the end of the World, and this he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the Lords Day:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> Which was either some particular day, or some general name applicable to any day of divine Vision, if so then the answer should be the same with the Question, and prove and make evident nothing, for the question is what day he had these divine visions
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:000341_0043_0FA4AB0FAE503F38"/>
and the Answer then should be in the day of divine Visions, far be it from us to think that the Apostle guided by the Spirit of God in every word he said, could speak such nonsence: therefore it mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> be understood of some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular day in the week.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> It was some particular Day well known to the Churches of Christ to whom he wrote, by that name of the Lords Day.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> For it was a Day well known to the Churches by the name of the Lords Day, or else unknown and obscure, and would want an Exposition; far be it likewise from us to think that the Apostle guided by the Spirit of God, and having undertaken to make known to the Churches in what particular Day he had those Divine Revelations, should put an obscure and unknown name upon the Day by which the Churches could not knew what he meant; therefore it is to be understood of a particular day well known to the Churches of Christ.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This particular Day so well known to the Churches by the name of the Lords Day, was a Day of divine Institution a Holy Day:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> For it is called the Lords Day, either because it was a day of divine Revelation, or a
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:000341_0044_0FA4AB1074293DB0"/>
Day by divine Institution; but it was not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Lords Day, because it was a day of divine Revelation, for as we heard before, this would be to speak nonsense, and nothing to the Question, therefore it was called the Lords Day, because it was so by divine Institution, and so a Holy Day.</p>
                  <p>Take one <hi>Argument</hi> more for the clearing of this, That which is honoured by the Holy Ghost in the Apostle, with the same honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and holy Title and Name as belongs to the Lords Supper, and other holy Institutions is holy as these are.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> The reason is, for if the Holy Ghost should honour this particular Day with as sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred a Name of Honour, as Ordinances are, and yet not be a holy Day, it would be to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour it above its due, and consequently to degrade other divine Institutions, but this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be, but the day spoken of hath the same honourable title and name, as the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, the Word of the Lord, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. That the particular Day well known to the Churches of Christ, called by the same honourable and holy Title or Name, as the Lords Supper is, and other holy Institutions was the first day of the week.</p>
                  <p>And for the Proof of this, let us consider
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:000341_0044_0FA4AB1074293DB0"/>
Arguments of all sorts, inartificial, and arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial abundantly confirmed by the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> To begin with inartificial Arguments, <abbr>
                        <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </abbr> Testimony of all the Churches in all ages, from the Apostles times, until you come nigh to our dayes; take Mr. <hi>Baxter'</hi>s own words, <hi>It is unquestionable to any man versed in antiquity, that all the Churches of Christ, Greek and Latin, Syrian, Ethiopick, Persian, and Arib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

And what force there is in this Argument we may now weigh it; the Word o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> God saith, <hi>that the Testimony of two Men is true,</hi> John 8.17. this is granted of all who have but humanity, that it is legally true, and the contrary to this is legally false, and we may know what to judge o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> sum that speaks it: but the Testimony of all the Churches of Christ, from the Apostles time from age to age, may well have the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit which belongs to two men, and somewhat more, especially if we consider that it was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

possible all the Churches East and West, those who had no opportunity one with another, that these could convene or any wayes consult to deceive their poor posterity with a lie, by telling them that the first day of the week had the holy name of the Lords day, and was to be kept holy, when if it were fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>se: but they all spake the same thing, because they were guided according to truth, which came from the same spirit of truth, breathing in the Apostles, and guiding the Churches in the primitive time, to declare the same to their Children, and so to Childrens Children in all age<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> according as it was said in another cafe, <hi>Isai.</hi> 78 6,7. and if <hi>de facto</hi> as they call it, concerning the fact for that we now speak of (<abbr>
                        <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </abbr>) that the first day of the week from the primitive time, was called the Lords day, if Histories be of no use to inform us, or what they say ought not to be credited, although they generally speak the same thing as to fact what was done. I know not of what use they be: but all the Books and Histories of the Church of Christ concerning the time of the ten Persecutions, and ever since, may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Flames as unworthy of credit: and let us never Write and Record any thing more for the benefit of Posterity of this kind:

But I take it for granted that no sober minded Christian will agree to this, whatever <hi>John Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi> his judgment may be.</p>
                  <p>And if any do desire to see more fully how it is proved that the first day of the week is the Lords day by the testimony of the antient Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; let them read Mr. <hi>Samuel Cra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>We have at present done with the first Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, as it respects Testimony.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But let us proceed to that kind of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which by the Learned is called Artificial, and argues from the Artifice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Frame and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the thing, and must necessarily be granted to be the strongest way of Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> The Apostle calls the Day as it was by the Lord made, and as it is, or else he did misc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>l it; the first part of this disjunct Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position must be granted, that the Apostle did call the Day as it is, as the Lord had made,
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:000341_0046_0FA4AB1285CDFE10"/>
for none will dare to say that he miscalled it, unless it be those who have learned to Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme. The Minor follows, that the first day of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> was made by the Lord above any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> day of the week to be the Lords Day in Gospel times; and for the Proof of this let us now Consider:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>First,</hi> this was the day in which our Lord rose, <hi>John</hi> 20.1. <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.1.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This was the day in which he appeared to the two Disciples after his Resurrection to teach them. <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.13.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This was the day in which he appeared to the Apostles, and gave them their Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and the Holy Ghost to enable them, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.33,36. <hi>John</hi> 20.19,20,21,22.</p>

the eighth day shall be the day wherein their Offering shall be accepted.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> Take the Argument from hence, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this was performed literally, or typically, if literally, then the eighth day which is our first day of the week, was Honoured and San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified above the seventh day, and that by the Lords appointment: but thus it was not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Gospel times for that would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to <hi>Numb.</hi> 28 9,10. therefore, it is to be understood typically, <abbr>

                     </abbr> what day in Gospel times the Worship of God, shall be accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and that is the eight day which is our first day of the week.</p>
                  <p>And that day of his Resurrection was the day of performing that great promise and prophecie, <hi>Thou art my Son, this any I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten thee,</hi> for thus its expounded by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poste, <hi>Act</hi> 13.33.

                     </gap> is written in the second <hi>Psalm, Thou art my Son this day I have begotten thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For although Christ is the Son of God from everlasting, yet this was the day in which he was declared to be the Son of God by Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection from the dead, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.4. and the first day of the week was the very day for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of this promise, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.5. as <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And to conclude this, and though we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not expect that those who are under a penal blindness and dea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

But to help the mind and memory of those who are sensible of their weakness, but are willing to hear and see: Let us gather up briefly that which hath been said out of <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.10. as followeth;</p>
                  <p>The day called the <hi>Lords Day</hi> is some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular day well known to the Churches of Christ, otherwise it was in vain, and to no purpose for the Apostles to have spoken a word of the Day.</p>
                  <p>And this day called the Lords day was a Holy Day, otherwise it could not have the holy name proper unto holy things and holy time.</p>
                  <p>And that the day called the <hi>Lords Day</hi> is the first day of the week, this hath been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>In the second place, to prove that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles by their Doctrine did settle the first day of the week to be our Christian Sabbath, we may see in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.1,2.</p>

1. That which is there exprest is by way of precept and injunction, for so the Apostle saith, he had given order concerning the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of the Saints, and therefore not left it as a matter of indifferency or liberty, but whosoever did neglect this, did transgress the Apostolical precept and order.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This order for the collection for the Saints was not only sent to the Churches at <hi>Corinth,</hi> but to the Churches at <hi>Galatia.</hi> so that it was an order and injunction common to the Churches.</p>

                     <hi>Ans,</hi> If the Consequence drawn from Scripture is agreeable to the Scripture and no wayes contrary to the Scripture, it must be granted truth, because it speaks what the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture speaks.

                  <p>For saith <hi>Iohn Rogers,</hi> as he was Man he was made of a Woman, and made under the Law, hence his Argument is, if Christ as a Man was made of a Woman under the Law, then as God-Man he is not Lord of the Sabbath.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply,</hi> My Reply is, that if Christ the Son of Man be Lord of the Sabbath its either as he is the Son of God, or as the Son of Man, or as he is God and Man; not as the Son of God considered without being the Son of Man for the words are express, <hi>that the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.</hi>

the Lords Day than he can have who his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was, this being the Testimony of all the Churches in all Ages, from the primitive time to this very day, until of late some few have risen up and raised the Objection.</p>

                     <hi>Reply,</hi> The Reply is this, <hi>John Rogers</hi> his Answer is full of confusion jumbling the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Works and the Covenant of Grace together:</p>

                     <hi>Reply: John</hi> R. in this Answer is fled to his seeming Fort, and he knows if he be driven out from this, that neither he nor any for the seventh dayes Sabbath, have any Castle nor Covering for their conceited confidence, but the scope of the Question if rightly stated and plainly expressed is.</p>
                  <p>That a Sabbath as a Sabbath is first and last in the Precept, and shall not be changed, but the particular day is secondarily specified, and is mutable as other positive Laws are, the Lord having reserved a liberty to himself to change them according to his Royal pleasure, and who shall say he hath done iniquity? And as for <hi>John</hi> R. his Argument, so far as it hath any colour of reason in it, is. That seeing Christ came not to destroy the Law but to fulfil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> it, and that in every jot and tittle of it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not to change the seventh dayes Sabbath into the first day of the Week, and to this we shall positively and plainly Reply.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>First,</hi> There is that which may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led an actual fulfilling in all and every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar point and duty required in the Decalogue, but Christ did never actually fulfil the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Duties of Parents to Children of a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:000341_0061_0FA4AB23F0D01BE8"/>
to a Wise and many other particular points and duties contained in the Decalogue and yet his fulfilling all and every one of those Duties which had any suitableness to his sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and work, as he had opportunity in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to God or Man, this is called a fulfilling of all righteousness, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.15.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> There is an actual fulfilling of the Law literally; and in this sence the Priest in his Labour in Sabbath duties of his Office, might be said to prophane the Sabbath, <hi>Mat:</hi> 12 5.</p>
                  <p>And a fulfilling spiritually and finally accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the true scope of the Law, and thus he was said to be blameless, and so may we, if we keep that day holy which Christ hath appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as most suitable to Gospel times and the most spiritual scope of the fourth Command, although we prophane the seventh day Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To come nearer to the Text mentioned, Christ came not to make any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive change of the Law but to fulfil it, and therefore to make a perfecting or perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive change: And the Godly, Learned do note that the word to destroy the Law signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies to dissolve or pull it in pieces, Christ came not to dissolve or pull the Law in pieces, and

an ancient Copy he had found it thus Recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, That the Apostle had given order for the Collections in the first day of the week with this added the Lords Day, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.2.</p>
                  <p>But seeing this <hi>Ju<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> As Christ came to fulfil the Law, so likewise he came to fulfil the Prophets, so it is expressed in <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.17. <hi>think not</hi> saith Christ, <hi>that I am come to destroy the Law or the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, I am not come to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </p>
                  <p>But Christ did fulfil the Prophets, their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies by performing and answering the scope and end of the same, and by changing the Prophecies into performances: Oh most happy and glorious cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ge, without which the Prophets, their Prophecies could not have been fulfilled, this was far off from a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive change of one jott or tittle of the Prophecies.</p>
                  <p>So likewise Christ did fulfil the Law, and particularly that Law the fourth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by performing and answering the scope and end of it, and by changing not the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath as a Sabbath, but by changing of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath from the seventh day to the first day of
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:000341_0062_0FA4AB24A7535260"/>
the week, and this was no destructive change of one jott or tittle of the fourth Command, but a most happy and glorious change with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to the glory of the Law-giver, and the good of his People, which blessed ends are more fully and perfectly attained by the change than could possibly be by a seventh day Sabbath, as is more fully explicated in my Catechism; so that the fourth Command complains not, it is wronged not a jott or tittle of it destroyed, no more than when vessels of Brass or Earthen Vessels are turned into Gold and that which is less perfect is turned into that which is more perfect, for though the Law of God is ever perfect as to the time and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject for whom it is fitted, and so as the seventh day Sabbath as it respected the time and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects for whom it was fitted, but yet when the first day of the week is appointed by the Lord of the Sabbath as most suitable to Gospel times, and the subjects of Gospel Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; now that which was less perfect respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting this time and state must give place to that which is more perfect, and in this fourth Command is not destroyed but fulfilled the Law being no Enemy to the Gospel, but like <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> do kiss one another upon the Mount of the Lord, and thus doth the fourth

                  <p>

                     <hi>Ans.</hi> They Consequence from Scripture is either a necessary Consequence, and being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Scripture, is of as full force as any plain Scripture, as <hi>John Rogers</hi> granted in his Answer to the first Question, or else it is a Consequence seemingly deduced from Scripture, but is really a perverting of, and contrary to the Scripture, as some unlearned and unstable, who wrest the Scriptures to
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:000341_0069_0FA4AB2A06EE5A60"/>
their own destruction, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.16. and then it is far off from being of the same force with the Scripture: But we have given <hi>Iohn Rogers</hi> necessary deductions from plain Scriptures in the Old and New Testament, to prove that the first day of the week is the Lords day, and our Christian Sabbath; and it is in vain for <hi>Iohn R.</hi> to deny this until the Arguments be confuted.</p>
                  <p>Qu 7. <hi>Iohn Rogers</hi> his seventh Question, <hi>Whether or no there be a possibility to take out the day commanded out of the fourth Commanament, and put in one of the six working dayes, in the room thereof, and not alter one jott or one tittle of the former Law, if there be a possibility of such a thing, or ever such a thing was?</hi> I desire a Copy of it may be sent me to the Prison as soon as may be.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> My Answer to this seventh Question is, that I have already proved in my Reply to his Answer to the tenth Question, that this change of the Sabbath from the seventh day to the first day of the week is no destructive but a perfecting change, and so far from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying the Law in a jott or tittle of it, that it is a fulfilling of the Law as really and fully as the performances of Prophecies are the fulfilling of Prophecies, and it is too late for,

                     <hi>John Rogers</hi> now to question, whither that be possible to be done which is already certainly performed and done as we have proved al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready; and as for some fragments of Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and Cavils which <hi>I. R.</hi> hath gathered out of some late Authors, and yet if all these be put together he is unable to defend his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day Sabbath.</p>
                  <p>And it is as possible for <hi>I. R.</hi> to hinder the change of the Moon as he can hinder the change of the seventh day Sabbath, seeing it is founded upon the works of Creation which is given to change: but who can hinder the stability &amp; immutability of the first day of the Week, the Lords day; which is grounded upon the unchangeable work of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, according to an immutable and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Covenant: And if it be not possible for <hi>I. R.</hi> yet to see the reason of this but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire at his legal light, and despise Gospel vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions: <hi>Behold ye despisers wonder and perish, for I work a work in your dayes, a work which you shall in no wise believe, though a man declare it unto you,</hi> Act.13.41. and yet those who have the Revelations of the Spirit of Wisdom in the Gospel, shall say, this is the Lords doings, it is marvellous in our eyes, this is the day which the Lord hath made; <hi>Save now I beseech

thee O Lord, blessed is he that cometh in the Name of the Lord,</hi> Psal.118.23,24,25,26.</p>
                  <p>And if he that despised the Law of <hi>Moses<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </hi> and particularly did prophane the seventh day Sabbath was so severely punished, as <hi>John</hi> R. did note, of how much sorer punishment shall he be thought worthy, who hath despised the Gospel Commandment, and particularly the Lords day the Christian Sabbath, the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and Institution of Christ which he hath by his Blood purchased, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.28,29.</p>
                  <p>And thus I have done likewise with <hi>Iohn R.</hi> his Questions at present; and if <hi>I. R.</hi> or any for him shall undertake to make a Reply to that which hath been said, I expect they should answer my Arguments <hi>interminis,</hi> according as they are in the frame and method of them: I do not intend for the future to trouble my self with an Answer to such Lax Discourses as have nothing of the frame of an Argument with them.</p>
                  <p>And thus at present I have done speaking to Man, but this I may say, <hi>Oh Lord, I have not desired the woful day, that which came out of my lips was right before thee, be not thou a terror to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

manner, or in any respect whatsoever I have erred, let it not be confirmed but confuted, and let me be convinced: but if that which hath been said be according to thy Holy Word revealed by the Apostles of the Lord Jesus, let those who do, or shall oppose, be converted, and repent of this their Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of their heart may be forgiven them, or else let them be confounded and cut off. <hi>Act.</hi> 8.22. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
