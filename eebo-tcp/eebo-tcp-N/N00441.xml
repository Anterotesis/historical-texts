            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Secondly, That which Enflames the <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content</hi> of men, is usually the <hi>Condition</hi> which they see their <hi>Neighbours</hi> in. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ENVY most properly seems to fall under the Crimes that are Branded by the <hi>Fifth</hi> Commandment of our God; it is a Disposition to Diminish the just <hi>Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of our Neighbours. But there is a Roving and a Ranging of the Soul, after what our Neighbour has, and a Grudging at his Prosperity, which the <hi>Tenth</hi> more peculiarly stigmatizes. Although we do not go so far, as to consent with our wills unto the doing of any unjust thing, for Dispossessing our Neighbour of what God has given him, yet of our Souls have any
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:000560_0044_0FA70E79DD051F78"/>
stirrings, and bublings, and loose <hi>Hanker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> after it, here is that which brings us within the verges of <hi>Discontent.</hi> A <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented</hi> man, may be willing that his Neighbour should still enjoy his <hi>Place,</hi> his <hi>Life,</hi> his <hi>Bed,</hi> his <hi>Estate,</hi> and his <hi>Esteem;</hi> nevertheless the view of what his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour has, causes him to <hi>Grudge</hi> that h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> han't the like. It was said of the <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented,</hi> in Deut. 28. 34. <hi>Thou shalt b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

It is the <hi>sight</hi> of what the merciful God has bestow'd upon his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and not upon himself. <hi>That's</hi> his <hi>Eye-sore;</hi> the, <hi>Light of God shining upon a Neighbours Tabernacle,</hi> is what the <hi>sore Eyes</hi> of him, are vexed at.

<pb n="43" facs="unknown:000560_0045_0FA70E7A7A55A3B8"/>
because he han't the same. In <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content,</hi> we make anothers condition, the measure for our own. Our <hi>Brown Bread</hi> has not such a favoury Tast in it, because others have <hi>White.</hi> The <hi>Camel</hi> will cry for Horns, the <hi>Ox</hi> must wear a <hi>Saddle,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Horse</hi> draw a <hi>Plough-share,</hi> whether it be suitable or no; meerly because they see <hi>some</hi> in that Condition.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, There are many, perverse, Froward, <hi>Expressions,</hi> wherein <hi>Discontent</hi> uses to vent it self. Indeed, it Leads to the Breach of all the Commandments; particularly, <hi>The first Motions to all Second Table Sins,</hi> are in this <hi>Discontent.</hi> But there are some other <hi>Expressions</hi> of Discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, which the other Commandments do not so directly refer unto. It is said, in Eccl. 6. 9. <hi>The wandring of the Desire;—this also is vanity and vexation of Spirit.</hi> Where <hi>Discontent</hi> comes, the <hi>Desire</hi> falls to <hi>wandring</hi> after this and that <hi>vanity,</hi> and from thence comes a <hi>vexation</hi> in the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of it. A <hi>discontented</hi> man does first <hi>wish</hi> that he had this and that, which God has placed out of his reach, and he does then <hi>Vex,</hi> and <hi>fret,</hi> and <hi>fume,</hi> that he cannot reach it. He is a man that <hi>fancies</hi>
                  <pb n="44" facs="unknown:000560_0046_0FA70E7B390346A0"/>
many <hi>straits</hi> upon him, and they are but <hi>Fancied straits;</hi> as it is said in Job 20. 22. <hi>In the Fulness of his Sufficiency; he shall be in straits.</hi> He has more <hi>wants</hi> then ever God Almighty permitted him to reckon so; and though he be never so much preferred, unless he may have the Knee of <hi>Mordecai</hi> too, he says, <hi>All this availeth me nothing!</hi> And To, a vast flux of <hi>Cares</hi> now runs and eats into the Soul of such a man. We should ordinarily treat our <hi>Cares,</hi> as a Person of Quality does his Inferiours, that ask to wait upon him; we should say, <hi>Let 'em stay, till I call <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> them in!</hi> But by Discontent, the Doors of our Souls, are set open so, that all kinds of <hi>Cares</hi> rush in upon us, with a most untruly violence; and O what a Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour do they make upon us! Our <hi>Affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions</hi> hereupon come to be all in a Tumult; like that Riotous Multitude at <hi>Ephesus, One cries one thing, another cries another, and all is in Confusion!</hi> And our Soul-nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing, our Soul-refreshing Thoughts of God, are superseded by Troublesome Thoughts, upon that point, <hi>How shall I Compass my Desires?</hi> At last, it grows on to the Discouragement, and Melancholly;
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:000560_0047_0FA70E7C2A912FB0"/>
which is quite contrary to <hi>Serving of God with Gladness of Heart.</hi> The <hi>Hornets</hi> that stung the Hearts as well as the Skins of the Ancient <hi>Canaanites,</hi> are got into the Soul of a Discontented man; they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order the man, as the <hi>Hornets</hi> that got into the Trunks of the Elephants, did the Army of <hi>Sapores,</hi> when he Besieged a C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Yea, 'tis well if this Inward Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver do not cause a <hi>Scab</hi> upon the <hi>Lip:</hi> there are filthy <hi>Mutterings,</hi> Growlings, and Snarlings, which we fall, into when <hi>Discontent</hi> has <hi>Bitten</hi> us, Even the meek <hi>Moses</hi> himself, when <hi>Discontent</hi> had once Discomposed him, <hi>spoke unadvisedly with his Lips.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Finally, Discontent, is a <hi>Temper,</hi> or more truly, a <hi>Distemper,</hi> opposite unto that <hi>Calm</hi> of the Soul, in which we should still be Sailing to our <hi>Eternal Rest;</hi> for here, quite otherwise than in our other Navigation, the more <hi>Calm</hi> we have, the more <hi>Way</hi> we make.

               <p>Now to <hi>Blacken</hi> the Sin of <hi>Discontent,</hi> Let it be Considered.</p>
               <p>First, Our <hi>Discontent</hi> is a Monstrous Piece of <hi>Ungodliness,</hi> Yea, of <hi>Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

There is a woful <hi>Corruption</hi> in the Soul, where DISCONTENT Predominates; it is like a <hi>Fretting Humour</hi> in an <hi>Ulcer,</hi> yea a <hi>Cancer</hi> of the mind. It is <hi>Ungodliness:</hi> in Jude 15. 16. we find <hi>Ungodliness,</hi> no less than four times o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, in one verse charged upon some in the world; and who are they?

                     </gap>belion.</hi> In Numb. 16. 41. with 17. 10. It was said, <hi>All the Congregation Murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;</hi> and then it follows, <hi>There was a Token against the Rebels.</hi> Indeed, our Discontent, is but a <hi>Quarrelling</hi> with Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God; but, <hi>Wo to him that striver with his Maker?</hi> A discontented man, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Quarrels the <hi>Wisdom</hi> of God, as if
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:000560_0049_0FA70E80B48A2A30"/>
God might have done things more conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently; or, he Quarrels the <hi>Goodness</hi> of God, as if Good pleas'd himself in our Sorrows; or he Quarrels the <hi>Truth</hi> of God, as if God would not fulfil his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful Engagements. However, be sure, he Quarrels the <hi>Justice</hi> of God. <hi>Qui de p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>nts Murmur at, Ferientis Justitiam accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sat.</hi> Among all his <hi>Lamentations,</hi> you shall not hear him-using the words in our Inspired <hi>Lamentations, Why should a Living Man complain! a man for the punishment of his Sin?</hi> He does not own his <hi>Sinfulness</hi> to be such, nor Gods <hi>Righteousness,</hi> that he is dealt kindly withal, while any thing short of <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Hill,</hi> is inflicted on him. It is indeed a most Impious and Accursed <hi>Pride,</hi> which is the Rise of our Discontent. A Sinner counts himself to <hi>Be better</hi> than his Neighbours, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if he don't <hi>Fare better</hi> than they, he will be Discontented at it. Yea, the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty <hi>God</hi> himself must gratify all of his <hi>Capricio's,</hi> or he'l be dissatisfy'd. Altho' there is perhaps not one known <hi>Papist</hi> an Inhabitant of this Country; yet there is many an <hi>Antichrist</hi> in the midst of us; Every Discontented man has, <hi>A Man of
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:000560_0050_0FA70E830BDCF8D8"/>
Sin,</hi> within him, or that which <hi>Exalts it self above all that is called God;</hi> he must have his own will to be the Director of what God shall do unto him. And is this fitting? <hi>Judge I pray you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Our <hi>Discontent</hi> is not onely Disagreeable to the Spirit of a <hi>Christian,</hi> but it is the very Spirit of the <hi>Devil.</hi> The Blessed Spirit of God, is like a <hi>Dove,</hi> whose meek, sweet, quiet Qualities, are inconsistent with Discontent; there is a <hi>Vultur,</hi> or an <hi>Harpye,</hi> that preys upon the Soul, where Discontent is Harboured Now, the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God is in every <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian;</hi> and, if he be got but as far as A. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>. C. in Christianity, that Spirit has made him Con a little of this Lesson, <hi>To be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</hi> The Christian has chosen <hi>God,</hi> both for his LORD, and for his GOOD; and hence, let things go never so Ill with him, there are two things that he attains unto. One is that in Psal. 39. 9. <hi>I was Dumb, I opened not my mouth; because thou didst it.</hi> He is willing that God should Rule, the whole World, and all his own little Affairs in the World. Another is that in I Sam. 30. 6. <hi>He Encouraged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in the Lord his God.</hi> He reckons,
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:000560_0051_0FA70E831EF794F0"/>
that while be has the Enjoyment of God the Knowledge, the Image, the Favour of God left unto him, the loss of all other things, is but like the spilling of a Cup of Water, unto him that has a perennous Fountain running at his Door. This is the Spirit of a <hi>Christian!</hi> But what then is <hi>Discontent?</hi> It is truly, the Spirit of the <hi>Devil. Satan</hi> is the greatest <hi>Malecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent</hi> in the World; and he is, <hi>The Father of such.</hi> He (with all his <hi>Legions</hi>) is a <hi>Roving,</hi> as well as a <hi>Roaring</hi> sort of a Creature; 'tis said of him, <hi>He seeks Rest, and finds none.</hi> We <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

The Devils, and the Discontented, are like one another; both of them, as the <hi>Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled Sea.</hi> Discontent is of all things, most properly, <hi>Vitium Diabolicum;</hi> there is a sort of <hi>Diabolism</hi> in <hi>Discontent;</hi> our <hi>Murmur</hi> is therefore the Devils <hi>Musick.</hi> And hence, <hi>Discontent</hi> is the Stock upon which the Devil uses to Graff the most

I once knew a Minister whom God made an Instrument of saving a <hi>discontented</hi> young man, from <hi>signing</hi> a Covenant with the Wicked One, which he by strange Accident found out, that the youngman had already <hi>Written</hi> with his Blood. Yea, <hi>Murder,</hi> and the worst, <hi>Murder</hi> too: even <hi>Self-Murder,</hi> is that which the <hi>Devil!</hi> does by <hi>discontent</hi> often precipitate many wretched mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men into. <hi>Achitophel</hi> falling into a pang of <hi>Discontent,</hi> goes and <hi>hangs himself.</hi> O it is a most hideous and hazardous <hi>Possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> which the Devil takes of a <hi>discountent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> man. When <hi>Saul</hi> was in a <hi>discontent,</hi> it is noted, <hi>An Evil Spirit came upon him.</hi> Why, Discontent invites all the <hi>Devils</hi> within Call, to make a Kende<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouze in the Heart of the disturbed man. Yea, if I were as much a <hi>Sadducce,</hi> as I
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:000560_0053_0FA70E84F62A7868"/>
am, even by matter of Fact, able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute a <hi>Sadducee,</hi> I would say, <hi>Discontent</hi> is it self a <hi>Devil,</hi> and the very <hi>Prince of Devils.</hi> But it is enough to say, The Devil has not a greater Engine to work withal.</p>
               <p>Thirdly. Our <hi>Discontent,</hi> layes us o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to the Terrible <hi>Wrath</hi> of the Eternal God. Indeed a Discontented man rarely feels the <hi>Love</hi> of God, witnessed unto his own Soul. Those Joyful and Gladsome <hi>Seals,</hi> wherein a Saint ha's powerful Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, <hi>That God ha's Loved him with an Everlasting Love,</hi> are usually <hi>withdrawn,</hi> yea, they are <hi>Banisht,</hi> from a Discontented Heart. But instead thereof, the <hi>Wrath</hi> of God lyes hard upon the Soul, whom Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content hath overwhelmed. It is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Numb. 16. 41. <hi>The Congregation Murmured;</hi> and the next News was, <hi>There is Wrath gone out from the Lord.</hi> It is a Token of a Direful &amp; Ireful <hi>Wrath</hi> from God upon the Soul, when the <hi>Evil Disease</hi> of Discontent, shall take away the Relish, which otherwise a man might have in his Enjoyments. And it further Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes the God of Heaven, to inflict His <hi>Wrath</hi> upon all the Interests of such
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:000560_0054_0FA70E85DF7888A8"/>
an <hi>Unthankful,</hi> and <hi>Unholy</hi> man.

upon His <hi>Discontented</hi> People in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness of Old; and I wish my own <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented</hi> Country would <hi>Think</hi> upon it.

It is said of Discontented persons, in Psal. 39. 6. <hi>Surely, they are Disquieted in Vain.</hi> Truly, t'were easy to give a thousand E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences,

that People are usually <hi>Discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented in Vain,</hi> when they are so at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Discontent,</hi> it will procure none of the those <hi>Good</hi> Things we are concerned for: They will not come a bit the sooner for all our Intemperate <hi>Snatches</hi> after them. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, a <hi>Likely,</hi> yea, a <hi>Certain</hi> way for us, to have more Good, is to be so <hi>Content</hi> with what we have already, as to be <hi>Thankful</hi> for it. I have heard, that Old Mr. <hi>Dod,</hi> having a Kinswoman, among the first Planters of <hi>New-England,</hi> who Underwent more than Ordinary Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies, in the Beginning of the Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, he sent the Gentlewoman for a present, at the same time, first, a Brass <hi>Counter,</hi> then a Silver <hi>Crown</hi> and then a Gold <hi>Jacobus,</hi> all of them severally wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped up; with this Instruction to the Gentleman who carried it; That he should first present her only the <hi>Counter,</hi> and if she received it with any show of <hi>Discontent,</hi> he should then take no further Notice of her; but if she Gratefully Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented that <hi>small Thing,</hi> for the sake of the hand it came from, he should then go on to present the <hi>Silver,</hi> &amp; so the <hi>Gold;</hi> and withal assure her, <hi>That such would
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:000560_0057_0FA70E88C7CB3D40"/>
he the Dispensations of God unto her, and the other good People of</hi> New-England; <hi>if they would be</hi> content with <hi>such little things as God at first bestow'd upon them, they should in Time have</hi> Silver <hi>and</hi> Gold <hi>enough.</hi> The Gentlewoman gave the man occasion to go thro' with all his Presents; and many more besides her have also found the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality of the Observation. But now, <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content</hi> puts men out of the way and reach of Gods Blessing upon them. If a man do happen to <hi>Get</hi> any thing with discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, it is a thousand to one, he'l <hi>keep</hi> it so, if he <hi>keep</hi> it at all. What comes with a <hi>Eret,</hi> has a <hi>Eret</hi> in it when it comes. If a <hi>Rachel</hi> be discontented for her Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renness, and cries, <hi>Give me Children!</hi> what sort of <hi>Children</hi> do they prove unto her? Truly, very <hi>deadly</hi> Ones. No,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Discontent</hi> will heap all sorts of <hi>Bad</hi> Things upon us. For, it utterly <hi>deprives</hi> us, of our Comfort in those things which we are already the Subjects of. 'Tis <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent</hi> alone, that will make a man really <hi>Rich</hi> and <hi>Great.</hi> A man truly is the <hi>Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessor</hi> of nothing, which he is not <hi>Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> with. It is said. <hi>A little that a Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous man, has, is better than the Riches of

               </p>
               <p>Indeed, it also <hi>Forfeits</hi> all those things, wherein we have been ready to take our Comfort. As the Lord said, <hi>Because yee did not serve the Lord with gladness of Heart, yee shall serve your Enemies with weariness:</hi> This is the Common Fate of Discontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Persons; Because they are not <hi>Content</hi> with that they have, God says, <hi>I'l take it all away!</hi> And when those Comforts are gone, our <hi>Discontent</hi> makes us, yet more unable to bear the going of them. As a man is a <hi>Fever,</hi> or a Bird in a <hi>Lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t wig,</hi> the more he Tumbles and Flutters, the worse his matters are; so is it in <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content.</hi> None of the <hi>Fetters</hi> which God layes upon us, would be half so Galling, so heavy, so irksome, if <hi>Discontent</hi> were not a <hi>sore</hi> first made upon us; 'tis by this that, <hi>The Iron Eats into our Soul.</hi> But now, being brought into our sorrowful Hours, our <hi>Discontent</hi> serves us, as the Jewes did our Lord upon the Cross; <hi>Gall and Vinegar,</hi> is all the Cordial that it brings for the supporting of us; 'tis, <hi>As Vinegar to Nitre,</hi> one Sharp thing upon another unto us, when we are of an <hi>Heavy Heart.</hi>

In fine, Our Discontent, is upon all Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, as much without <hi>Reason,</hi> as the most <hi>Bruitish</hi> thing in the World: For, Either we <hi>can</hi> Remedy our Affliction, or we <hi>Can<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Allow me to touch a Little upon one frequent and fretting string of <hi>Discontent;</hi> It is that of Murmuring at the <hi>Government.</hi> The World, and this part of it more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, is much disquieted with a sort of people, known by the Name of, <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murers;</hi> and what is it <hi>breeds</hi> 'em? Tis commonly the <hi>Taxes</hi> which are demanded of them. And yet if they would hearken to <hi>Reason,</hi> many times all this foaming <hi>Discontent</hi> would be taken away. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the <hi>Taxes</hi> were granted by the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi> of the People in an Assembly, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not such <hi>Taxes</hi> he paid with the <hi>Content</hi> of the people that have given them?

or at least, on <hi>Superfluities</hi> in a year. Are there <hi>Inequalities?</hi> These are Unavoidable.

Ten thousand such Things, might be spoken to show how <hi>Irrationals</hi> the <hi>Discontent</hi> of men, often is in that ONE particular; and the like might be said upon Ten thousand more. But I shall Irritate the <hi>Discontent</hi> of my Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, if my Discourse grow too being upon them; I'l therefore only say this one word for all; Almighty God once Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed that upon His People, <hi>Show your selves men;</hi> and I affirm, that this one Direction well attended, would Clap a <hi>Golden Bridle</hi> upon most of the Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strong <hi>Discontent,</hi> which we are carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way withal.</p>

               <p>First, Let me Recommend <hi>Faith,</hi> as that <hi>Grace,</hi> which brings, <hi>Perfect Peace,</hi> unto him that ha's it. <hi>Faith</hi> will keep us, as from <hi>Fainting,</hi> so from <hi>Fretting,</hi> under our Afflictions. By <hi>Faith,</hi> let us Live upon <hi>Gods Promise</hi> in the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.

               </p>
               <p>And, Lastly, Let me Recommend <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,</hi> as a <hi>Grace</hi> which Cuts off the very <hi>Spring</hi> of all our <hi>Discontent.</hi> All things do alwayes go well with an <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> man. He is, <hi>As a Weaned Child,</hi> and so not a <hi>Froward</hi> one.
