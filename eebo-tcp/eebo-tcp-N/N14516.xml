            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>BENEVOLENCE is that quality, in the human mind, without which we could not be the objects of one another's eſteem: Neither, were we wholly deſtitute of it, could we, whatever other qualities we might be endowed with, place that confidence in each other, upon which the well-being of the world, in ſo great a meaſure, depends. Were we poſſeſſed of power, but no benevolence, it would operate in tyranny; were we the ſubjects of wiſdom, but no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence, it would be nothing better than craft: And the higher we enjoyed theſe properties in degree, the greater reaſon we ſhould have, had we, at the ſame time, no benevolence, to ſhun one another through fear of miſchief. It is <hi>benevolence,</hi> tempering our other qualities, and making way for their exerciſe in the methods of kindneſs, that conſtitutes us worthy objects of each other's love, and lays the foundation for that mutual truſt between man and man, without which there could be no ſuch thing as public happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>And this obſervation, extended to all other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted intelligent agents, is equally true: Yea, it is ſo far true, with reſpect even to the uncreated Supreme Being himſelf, as that, if we had no idea of him as <hi>benevolent,</hi> we could not <hi>eſteem</hi> him, though we might fear him: Neither could we place our <hi>truſt</hi> in him, though we might in a ſervile way, do homage to him. <hi>Benevolence</hi> is that ingredient in his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter which exhibits him to our view as <hi>amiably</hi> perfect, and worthy of our warmeſt love, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire confidence. His other attributes, ſeperate from
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:018397_0003_0FA70C90B8512CE0"/>
this, are inſufficient to inſpire theſe affections; nor are they indeed at all ſuited to ſuch a purpoſe. "Eternity and immenſity amaze our thoughts: Infinite know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and wiſdom fill us with admiration: Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, or irreſiſtable power, is great and adorable; but, at the ſame time, if conſidered ſimply by itſelf, 'tis alſo dreadful and terrible: Dominion and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, clothed with perfect and impartial juſtice, is worthy of our higheſt praiſes; but ſtill to <hi>ſinners</hi> it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears rather awful and venerable, than the object of deſire and love: Holineſs and purity are inexpreſſibly beautiful and amiable perfections, but of too bright a glory for ſinners to contemplate with delight. Tis good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that finiſhes the idea of <hi>God,</hi> and repreſents him to us under the lovely character of the <hi>beſt</hi> as well as greateſt Being in the univerſe. This is that attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, which both in itſelf is infinitely amiable, and, as a ground-work interwoven with all the other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the Divine Nature, makes every one of them alſo to become objects of our love, as well as of our admiration. Immenſe and eternal goodneſs, goodneſs all-powerful and all-wiſe, goodneſs inveſted with ſupreme dominion, and tempering the rigor of unrelenting juſtice: This is indeed the deſcription of a Perfect Being; a character truely worthy of God."<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. Clark's ſermons.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But though <hi>Benevolence</hi> thus eſſentially enters into the character of the <hi>Deity,</hi> it has been objected to by ſome, and abuſed by others. And it may be, more objections have been levelled againſt, and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er reproaches caſt upon, this attribute of the Divine Nature, than any of the other; though it is, in it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:018397_0004_0FA70C91952548C8"/>
the moſt lovely of all the perfections of God, and eminently that perfection, which, being intimately conjoined with the reſt, in all their exerciſes, is the true and only ſource of all created exiſtence, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent happineſs, whether in preſent poſſeſſion or fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture proſpect.</p>
            <p>With reſpect to ſome, their abuſes of the Divine <hi>benevolence</hi> don't ſo much ſpring from any diſtinct notions they have formed of the nature of this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, as exiſting in the <hi>Deity</hi>; or the methods, in which they conclude it ought to operate, as from a <hi>wrong ſtate of mind.</hi> They are diſſatisfied with their ſituation in the world, and quite out of humour, becauſe they don't partake ſo liberally of the good things of providence, as they imagine they might do. And their diſcontent is ſtill heightened if they meet with diſappointments, and are reduced to ſuffering circumſtances, though by their own folly. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of frame, uneaſy and reſtleſs in their ſpirits, they find fault with their Maker, and vent themſelves in reflections on his goodneſs; as though it were great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly defective: Otherwiſe, as they imagine, a more advantageous condition in life might have been allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them; and would have been, if the <hi>Deity</hi> had been as good as they can ſuppoſe him to be. Theſe are the complaints, by which the infinitely benevolent Creator, and Governor, of all things, is abuſed by the leſs knowing and inquiſitive, who are the moſt numerous: But, as their complaints don't ſo much originate in <hi>judgment,</hi> as a <hi>bad temper of mind,</hi> this chiefly needs to be rectified, and then their complaints will ceaſe of courſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vi" facs="unknown:018397_0005_0FA70C9236F2AA68"/>There are others, whoſe <hi>objections</hi> againſt the <hi>Divine Benevolence</hi> ariſes from a <hi>vain mind,</hi> proudly aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to comprehend that which is above the reach of their capacities. Some appearances, in the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of nature, and government of providence, are ſuch as they can't account for, upon the plan of <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite benevolence.</hi> They find themſelves unable to connect theſe, with other appearances, ſo as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute an <hi>whole</hi> which they diſtinctly and particularly perceive to be an <hi>abſolutely good</hi> one, free'd from all difficulties: And they are therefore rather diſpoſed to diſpute the exiſtence of an <hi>infinitely perfect</hi> principle of benevolence, than to call in queſtion their own capacity to ſee through the whole of its operations: Though, if there be ſuch a principle, it muſt be employed about the <hi>univerſal ſyſtem</hi> of things; and, for that reaſon, require an underſtanding, in order to adjuſt its exerciſes, that can take in connections, and dependencies, vaſtly tranſcending the moſt enlarged conceptions of ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect creatures as we are. Nothing can be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to ſatisfy ſuch objectors, till they have firſt learnt to be modeſt; entertaining juſt apprehenſions of their own weakneſs, and the unſearchable <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and <hi>goodneſs</hi> of <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are yet others, whoſe <hi>objections</hi> againſt, and <hi>abuſes</hi> of, the <hi>benevolence</hi> of the <hi>Deity,</hi> take riſe from their <hi>miſconceptions</hi> of the nature of this Divine attribute. Having formed to themſelves <hi>wrong</hi> apprehenſions of ſupreme abſolute benevolence, and the methods of its diſplay, they either <hi>deny</hi> that <hi>God</hi> is thus benevolent, becauſe ſome detached ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:018397_0006_0FA70C962E7059F8"/>
of goodneſs are not ſuch as they were led, from their miſtaken notions, to expect they ſhould be: Or elſe, they <hi>reproach</hi> this glorious attribute of the Divine Being, giving falſe and diſhonourable repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations of it, conformably to the <hi>erroneous</hi> thoughts they have previouſly entertained of its <hi>nature,</hi> or <hi>manner of exerciſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some there be who ſeem to have no other idea of <hi>abſolutely perfect benevolence,</hi> than an <hi>uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controulable impulſive principle, neceſſarily</hi> ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging on to the <hi>greateſt</hi> communication of <hi>good,</hi> and the total prevention of evil; its prevention ſo as that it ſhould have no place in the creation, in any ſhape, or view whatſoever: And the conſtitution of nature, not falling in with this notion of goodneſs, they queſtion the reality of any principle of benevolence: Not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that benevolence if ſeated in an infinitely perfect mind, like <hi>God's,</hi> is never exerted blindly, or <hi>neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily,</hi> but always under the conduct of reaſon and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: Which thought juſtly purſued, will ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly account for all appearances, however ſeemingly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with goodneſs; as we may have occaſion to ſhew hereafter, in its proper place: Whereas, a principle of benevolence, thou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The effect of <hi>miſtaken</hi> notions of Divine Goodneſs, in others, is, not their denying that <hi>God</hi> is good, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely good, but ſpeaking <hi>reproachfully</hi> of this
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:018397_0007_0FA70C979A271D38"/>
attribute of his nature. And, perhaps, the reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which have been caſt upon the benevolence of the <hi>Deity,</hi> from this cauſe, have been equally <hi>malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> with a total denyal of it, and done as much diſſervice to the intereſt of true religion, and real vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, in the world.

And yet, this is the true import of the doctrine of <hi>abſolute and unconditional re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation,</hi> as it has been taught, even by thoſe who profeſs faith in <hi>God</hi> as a <hi>benevolent,</hi> yea, an <hi>infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely benevolent Being</hi>: But they could not have taught this doctrine, it would have been impoſſible, if they had not firſt entertained <hi>intirely wrong</hi> concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of benevolence, as attributed to the <hi>Deity.</hi> 'Tis indeed ſtrange that any, who feel within themſelves the working of kind affection, ſhould give in to an opinion ſo reproachful to the Father of mercies. To be ſure their ideas of goodneſs in <hi>God,</hi> if they have any, muſt be totally different from all the ideas we have of goodneſs, as we apply the term to <hi>ourſelves,</hi> or any created intelligent agent whatſoever. And if their ideas are th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>PART I.</hi> Explaining Benevolence as attributed to the <hi>DEITY.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE firſt thing neceſſary, in treating of <hi>Divine Benevolence</hi> is to aſcertain the <hi>ſenſe</hi> in which this <hi>perfection</hi> is aſcribed to the <hi>Deity.</hi> In order whereto,</p>
            <p>It may be proper to begin with fixing the <hi>general</hi> notion of goodneſs, as a <hi>moral</hi> attribute. And here we ſhall meet with no great difficulty. We have clear and diſtinct ideas of this moral quality. 'Tis as readily perceived by the mind as any ſenſible quality whatſoever, and as readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtinguiſhed from all others.</p>
            <p>'A principle diſpoſing and prompting to the communication of happineſs,' is the firſt idea that enters into its compoſition. As there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>perceiving</hi> beings only are capable of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, they only are the objects of goodneſs. Inanimate matter, 'tis true, in all its various forms, may <hi>paſſively</hi> be the occaſion of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to creatures that are either ſenſible, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent. And, upon this account, it may be conſidered as an object, about which goodneſs may be employed, and by means of which it may be manifeſted: Though, being void of
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:018397_0011_0FA70C9B735D9110"/>
perception, it cannot itſelf immediately be the object of goodneſs, becauſe an incapable ſubject of happineſs. But whatever beings are endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with <hi>perception,</hi> as they are hereby rendered capable of happineſs, in an higher or lower de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, in proportion to their faculties, they are the proper objects of goodneſs: And goodneſs conſiſts in 'a diſpoſition to make them happy.'</p>
            <p>'This diſpoſition alſo muſt be exerted freely.' And hence it is that we don't attribute goodneſs, as a character, to the <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ute creatures.</hi> Not that they exiſt without kind propenſions, or that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs to others, in various kinds, is not the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of their ſeveral exertions: But as theſe <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctive</hi> principles are thrown into exerciſe by <hi>mechanical impulſe,</hi> we look upon the <hi>animals,</hi> in whom they are implanted, as inſtruments only in the diffuſion of good, not the <hi>moral cauſes</hi> of it. Communicated happineſs muſt be the <hi>cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen act</hi> of ſome <hi>agent,</hi> otherwiſe we never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it as a <hi>moral quality,</hi> and call it <hi>commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> goodneſs. Accordingly, the <hi>good man,</hi> is not a meer <hi>paſſive inſtrument</hi> in the beſtowment of good. Neither do we call a man <hi>good,</hi> tho' he does good, if it be beſide his intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and by accident only. But he is the <hi>good man,</hi> and he only, who <hi>voluntarily</hi> acts for the benefit of others. His offices of kindneſs are the reſult of <hi>free choice</hi>; and for this reaſon we apply good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to him, under the notion of a <hi>moral virtue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This diſpoſition muſt alſo be exerted with a truly benevolent deſign. We don't call that
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:018397_0012_0FA70C9C0D174D98"/>
man good, whoſe actions may be productive of good to others, if it was beſide his intention in doing them: Much leſs will he deſerve this cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, if he did them with a view to ſerve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf only, not them. And, inſtead of benevolent, he will be quite the reverſe, if, in the inſtances wherein he manifeſts goodneſs to others, his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign is to entrap and enſnare them; making uſe of that which has the appearance of intended kindneſs, as an enticement to lead them aſide, and bring upon them ſome greater evil. A worſe character can ſcarce be given a man. It is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the character of that Being, who, of all Beings, is the moſt malevolent.</p>
            <p>In fine, 'this diſpoſition muſt be exerciſed under the guidance of <hi>reaſon,</hi> and in conſiſtency with <hi>right</hi> and <hi>fit</hi> conduct:' Nor otherwiſe do we conſider it as a <hi>moral</hi> perfection. If we look within, and reflect upon our perceptions, we ſhall find, that our idea of benevolence, as a <hi>commendable</hi> quality, is not a <hi>ſingle</hi> diſpoſition; but a diſpoſition exerciſed under the conduct of <hi>ïntelligence,</hi> and within the limits of <hi>moral truth</hi> and right. Conformably whereto, experience teaches us, that we do'nt expect, that the man, we call benevolent, ſhould act for ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> advantage without thought, and at random: We ſhould eſteem ſuch <hi>blind</hi> benevolence great weakneſs, and look upon the expreſſions of it as little bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than ſo many inſtances of folly. Neither do we expect, that the benevolent man ſhould do us kind offices, in contradiction to the known
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:018397_0013_0FA70C9CDC9C8A08"/>
laws of juſtice and truth. Such a diſplay of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs would make an odious appearance to ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> uncorrupted minds, and we ſhould rather call it an inſtance of <hi>vice,</hi> than <hi>virtue.</hi> The truth is, whenever we ſpeak of benevolence, as a moral character, we conſider it as directed by <hi>wiſdom,</hi> and exerciſed within the bounds of <hi>right reaſon</hi>: And the more wiſely and juſtly it is conducted, and exerciſed, the higher do we riſe in our eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of it, as a <hi>lovely</hi> quality.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the ingredients that conſtitute the compleat <hi>general</hi> idea of <hi>moral</hi> goodneſs; which is the ſame, whether we apply it to <hi>men,</hi> or <hi>angels,</hi> or <hi>any created intelligences</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever; or even to the <hi>Supreme Being</hi> himſelf. Only, when we aſcribe goodneſs to the <hi>Deity,</hi> we muſt remove away all defects, and conceive of it as <hi>infinitely perfect.</hi> Goodneſs in <hi>men</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways mixed with frailty and imperfection. Even in <hi>angels,</hi> and the <hi>higheſt order</hi> of created moral agents, 'tis finite and defective. But as to the quality itſelf, 'tis the <hi>ſame in kind,</hi> in all intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent moral Beings whatſoever. Every Being, in heaven and earth, to whom this attribute may be applied, partakes of the <hi>ſame quality,</hi> though not in the ſame <hi>manner,</hi> nor in the ſame <hi>degree</hi> and <hi>proportion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some, I am ſenſible, pretend, that the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and other moral attributes of <hi>God,</hi> are not only different in <hi>degree,</hi> but in <hi>kind</hi> likewiſe, from moral qualities in the creatures: inſomuch that the words goodneſs, juſtice, veracity, and the
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:018397_0014_0FA70C9D979ECC78"/>
like, are no otherwiſe applicable to the <hi>Deity,</hi> than as they ſtand to ſignify ſome <hi>unknown</hi> qualities anſwerable indeed (as they unintelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſpeak) to thoſe diſpoſitions in inferior moral agents; but yet, in their nature, altogether tranſcendent; and not to be conceived of by us. But this is certainly a moſt abſurd notion. For, if when we apply the terms good, juſt, faithful, and the like to <hi>God,</hi> the qualities ſignified by theſe words, are applied to men, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> other created intelligent agents, are not the qualities intended, but other <hi>inconceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> ones of a quite <hi>different kind,</hi> we really mean nothing when we ſay, that <hi>God</hi> is juſt, true, and faithful; but aſcribe to him an <hi>unknown</hi> charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. In which caſe, how can we make him the object of our adoration and worſhip? We muſt certainly, upon this ſuppoſition, worſhip him as an <hi>unknown God,</hi> if we worſhip him at all. The truth is, we muſt know what goodneſs, juſtice, and faithfulneſs, in <hi>God,</hi> are, or we ſhall unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligibly apply theſe attributes to him; uſing words that have no meaning at all: And, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all doubt, we are capable of this knowledge. The moral attributes of the infinitely perfect Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, 'tis true, are <hi>incomprehenſible</hi> by ſuch narrow underſtandings as our<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and perhaps by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings of all creatures whatſoever. But this does not mean, that we know nothing at all about their <hi>true nature</hi>; but only that their <hi>mode of exiſtence, manner of exerciſe,</hi> and <hi>degree of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</hi> tranſcend our, and all other finite, capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities.
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:018397_0015_0FA70C9E3755E0D8"/>
In this ſenſe, the moral qualities of the <hi>Deity</hi> ſurpaſs all underſtanding; while yet, we have as poſitive, clear, and diſtinct ideas of their <hi>real nature,</hi> as of the nature of any qualities ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable to ourſelves: Inſomuch that we may, with all deſirable certainty, argue from them, to the directing of our worſhip, forming our expectations, founding our hopes, and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our conduct: Nor otherwiſe would religion be an <hi>intelligible,</hi> or <hi>reaſonable</hi> ſervice. I may add here, the opinion which makes moral qualities, in <hi>God,</hi> totally <hi>different in kind,</hi> from moral diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions in men, and other inferior intelligent agents, is altogether <hi>unintelligible.</hi> We have no conceptions of different <hi>kinds</hi> of goodneſs, or juſtice, or veracity; tho' our ideas of a difference, in <hi>degree,</hi> between theſe qualities, are clear and diſtinct. Accordingly, nothing more common than to ſpeak of goodneſs, and juſtice, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, as qualities <hi>more</hi> or <hi>leſs</hi> excellent and perfect, in proportion to the <hi>manner,</hi> and <hi>degree,</hi> of their exerciſe. But we never ſeverally diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh theſe qualities into <hi>kinds,</hi> attributing <hi>one kind</hi> of goodneſs, or juſtice, or veracity, to theſe beings, and <hi>another</hi> to thoſe. Nor indeed is there any foundation in truth for ſuch a diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. They are properties, in their nature, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>variably one and the ſame, whatever ſubjects they are applied to, whether finite or infinite, God of man. And it would be groſsly abſurd to rank them ſeverally into <hi>ſorts,</hi> as truly ſo as if we ſhould divide <hi>roundneſs,</hi> or <hi>ſquareneſs</hi> into <hi>diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:018397_0016_0FA70C9F42AFD208"/>
kinds</hi> of roundneſs or ſquareneſs. We pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly diſtinguiſh theſe figures into <hi>more perfect</hi> or <hi>leſs perfect</hi>; and we have diſtinct ideas of ſuch a <hi>difference</hi>: But of <hi>different kinds</hi> of <hi>roundneſs</hi> or <hi>ſquareneſs,</hi> we have no idea at all: And thus to diſtinguiſh them is a ſelf-evident abſurdity. The ſame is true of goodneſs, and all other moral qualities. They are invariably one and the ſame thing in <hi>kind,</hi> whatever beings they are applied to. They are incapable of a diviſion into <hi>different kinds.</hi> We have not the leaſt conception of ſuch a difference; tho' we clearly underſtand what is meant, when they are diſtinguiſhed as to their <hi>degrees</hi> of perfection, and <hi>modes</hi> of exerciſe. So that to aſcribe goodneſs and juſtice, and the like, to <hi>God</hi>; and to ſay, at the ſame time, that theſe qualities, as applied to him, mean ſomething wholly <hi>different in kind</hi> from what they mean, when attributed to inferior moral agents, is to talk in the dark, uſing words without any ideas: The tendency of which muſt be to deſtroy all real knowledge of the moral character of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Creator, and conſequently all religion; for if we have no ideas of the moral attributes of <hi>God,</hi> we can have no foundation on which to build any rational religion, but muſt live as without God in the world.</p>
            <p>It appears then, upon the whole, that the goodneſs of <hi>God,</hi> is the <hi>ſame thing</hi> with goodneſs in all other intelligent moral beings; allowing only a due difference in <hi>degree</hi> and <hi>proportion.</hi> So that if we remove from our ideas, even of a good
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:018397_0017_0FA70C9FB69557C8"/>
man, all frailties and defects, and add to it bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs perfection in <hi>mode</hi> and <hi>degree,</hi> we ſhall entertain juſt thoughts of the <hi>Divine Benevolence,</hi> and need not fear being led into a miſtaken notion of this moſt glorious attribute of the Supreme Being.</p>
            <p>But it may be worth while to be ſtill more particular, and critical, in the application of the <hi>general</hi> idea of goodneſs to <hi>God,</hi> and in going over its ſeveral parts as thus applied.</p>
            <p>A natural diſpoſition then in the <hi>Deity,</hi> moving him to the communication of happineſs," is the firſt ingredient in the notion of goodneſs as at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to him. When I ſpeak of goodneſs as a <hi>natural diſpoſition</hi> in the <hi>Deity,</hi> I would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood to mean a <hi>certain ſtate of mind,</hi> call it inclination, propenſion, diſpoſition, or whatever elſe may be thought more proper, analogous to what is ſignified by a <hi>benevolent diſpoſition</hi> in <hi>men,</hi> or any other created moral agents. Such a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition we find within ourſelves. 'Tis natural to us, one of the principles implanted in our original frame, and what we all partake of, in a leſs or greater degree. And ſome principle an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable hereto, I ſuppoſe inherent in the nature of the Supreme Being, and <hi>neceſſary</hi> in him, in the ſame ſenſe that <hi>intelligence</hi> is a <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>neceſſary</hi> perfection: Inſomuch that we ſhould as truly wrong him, to conceive of him without a benevolent, as without an intelligent principle: Only, the principle of benevolence in <hi>God,</hi> like that of intelligence, ought always to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as <hi>infinitely perfect,</hi> both as to its <hi>mode</hi> of
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:018397_0018_0FA70CA41E726348"/>
exiſtence, and <hi>manner</hi> and <hi>degree</hi> of operation: Nor ſhould we allow ourſelves to think of this diſpoſition in the <hi>Deity,</hi> without removing out of our minds thoſe weakneſſes and imperfections, which attend the like diſpoſitions in ourſelves.</p>
            <p>In order whereto, and to help us in forming the moſt juſt and honorable thoughts of benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, as a <hi>diſpoſition</hi> in <hi>God,</hi> it may be proper to obſerve, that the two grand principles, in human nature, <hi>ſelf-love</hi> and <hi>benevolence,</hi> the former de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining us to <hi>private,</hi> the latter to <hi>public,</hi> good, are accompanied, each of them, with particular appetites and paſſions, ſeverally adapted to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the more effectual proſecution of theſe ends, as occaſion may require: Nor ſhould we have been ſo well qualified to purſue ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our <hi>own</hi> good, or the good of <hi>others,</hi> had it not been for the implantation of theſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites and paſſions, which are filled to haſten our exertments, and give them an additional force, anſwerable to the ſtate and circumſtances, we ourſelves, or others, may be in. <hi>Self-love</hi> is a general, calm, diſpaſſionate principle; and would not, in a variety of caſes, eſpecially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the ſlow progreſs we make in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and the weakneſs of it at beſt, have been ſufficient, ſingly and alone, to put us up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſeeking, or ſhunning, with requiſite ſpeed and vigor, the things neceſſary to our own preſervation. And therefore the author of our beings has kindly and wiſely provided againſt this defect, by the implantation of particular
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:018397_0019_0FA70CA677778A08"/>
appetites and propenſions, attended with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs proper to rouſe our attention, and call us forth to action. The ſame may be ſaid of the general common principle of <hi>Benevolence.</hi> 'Tis calm and diſpaſſionate: And tho' a ſtrong and noble principle, yet, as planted in ſuch imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect beings as we are, might prove inſufficient to put us upon thoſe exertions, for the good of others, which their circumſtances, in this preſent ſtate, would render neceſſary. The <hi>God</hi> of Nature has therefore given us parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular affections, apt to be excited upon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per occaſions, and make us active in uſing our endeavours to contribute our part towards the production of <hi>ſocial</hi> happineſs. Thus, the helpleſs ſtate of children, requiring the conſtant care and patience of others, in miniſtring to their wants, a ſtrong affection is planted in the hearts of parents, diſpoſing them both to do, and bear, almoſt any thing for their advantage: Nor without this STORGEE is it conceivable, how they ſhould ſo often deny themſelves, and go through ſo much toil and labour, for the ſake of their offspring: which yet their cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances make abſolutely neceſſary. In like manner, the dangers mankind are liable to, and the difficulties, ſorrows, and diſtreſſes, they meet with, ſo often call for the ſudden, vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous exertment of ſome kind hand, that <hi>pity</hi> is an affection <hi>God</hi> has fixed in our nature: And to this it is owing, that we are ſo readily mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to activity, in proportion to the diſtreſs of the object preſented to our view.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:018397_0020_0FA70CA6929E8290"/>Now, when we attribute <hi>benevolence</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> we muſt cautiouſly diſtinguiſh between the <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral principle</hi> itſelf, and thoſe <hi>particular affections</hi> which accompany it in us men, and are attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with uneaſineſs, tho' wiſely ſuited to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection of our preſent ſtate. They are eaſily and evidently diſtinguiſhable from each other. And, 'tis probable, there are orders of created beings, in whom they are in <hi>fact</hi> diſtinguiſhed; the perfection of whoſe powers and ſtate are ſuch, as that they have no need of theſe additional excitements. Much more may this be ſuppoſed to be the caſe, with reſpect to the infinitely perfect cauſe of all exiſtence. 'Tis common, it is true, in ſpeaking of the <hi>Deity,</hi> to aſcribe to him theſe paſſions and affections. Inſtances to this purpoſe are frequent, even in the ſacred writings themſelves. But ſuch attributions are to be underſtood in a looſe and figurative ſenſe only. And we ſhould always take care to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from benevolence, when attributed to <hi>God,</hi> all the <hi>modes</hi> of it that are ſuited only to imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect beings, in an imperfect ſtate; as is the caſe with reſpect to us men. But as to the principle itſelf, conſidered without theſe <hi>affections,</hi> arguing weakneſs, and uneaſineſs, in the ſubjects of them, and heightened beyond all conceivable bounds, in <hi>mode</hi> and <hi>degree,</hi> I ſee not but it may, in a ſtrict and proper ſenſe, be attributed to the <hi>Deity</hi>; as containing nothing in it but what is worthy of him, and conſiſtent with his character as an abſolutely amiable and perfect being.</p>

               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:018397_0021_0FA70CA7A3965230"/>It is the opinion, I am well aware, of ſome great and learned men, that benevolence, as a <hi>diſpoſition,</hi> inclination, or propenſion, ought not to be aſcribed to the <hi>Deity.</hi> They allow in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that benevolence, as a <hi>diſpoſition,</hi> is planted in <hi>man</hi>; but ſay, that the <hi>general principle</hi> itſelf, together with the <hi>particular affections</hi> belonging to it, are deſigned only as <hi>auxiliaries</hi> in ſupport of <hi>reaſon,</hi> which needed ſuch help, in creatures ſo weak and imperfect as we are: But that, in <hi>God,</hi> whoſe underſtanding is infinite, and who perfectly ſees all poſſible connections of ideas, and fitneſſes and unfitneſſes of actions ariſing therefrom, there can be no need of ſuch an <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional aid.</hi> And conſequently, that we ought to conceive of him as giving exiſtence, and happineſs, to his creatures <hi>ſolely</hi> from the <hi>fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and <hi>reaſonableneſs,</hi> of the thing as an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of <hi>intelligence</hi>: And that it would reflect diſhonour on him, to ſuppoſe him in the leaſt excited hereto from any <hi>natural ſtate of mind,</hi> call it temper, inclination, diſpoſition, or by any other name, ſignifying the like idea.</p>
            <p>The anſwer whereto is, that the <hi>particular propenſions,</hi> belonging to benevolence in us, were undoubtedly planted in human nature (as has been obſerved) in conſideration of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection of our preſent ſtate and powers: But that this is, by no means, the truth of the caſe, with reſpect to the <hi>general principle</hi> itſelf; which ſeems to have been a matter of ſuch neceſſity, as that, if it had not been planted in our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:018397_0022_0FA70CA7F5B23740"/>
our <hi>reaſon,</hi> tho' ever ſo perfect, would have been inſufficient to put us upon exerting ourſelves in purſuit of <hi>ſocial</hi> happineſs: Nor indeed could we have <hi>reaſonably</hi> done it. And the ſame, perhaps, upon examination, will be found to be the real truth, with reſpect to the <hi>Deity</hi> likewiſe: Which, that we may clearly conceive of, let it be obſerved,</p>
            <p>It is neceſſary, with reſpect to all beings whatſoever, that they have ſome <hi>conſtitution</hi> or <hi>nature</hi>; which nature muſt be previouſly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and, in ſome meaſure, known, or it will be impoſſible to determine whether they are capable of action, or not: Or, if they are, what would be reaſonable and fit action in them. As for example—It is by knowing the conſtitution of <hi>man,</hi> that he is formed with a capacity to receive pleaſure; with a ſtate of mind <hi>inclining</hi> him to purſue it, both for his own <hi>private</hi> good, and the good of <hi>others</hi>; with the powers of <hi>intelligence</hi> and <hi>volition,</hi> qualify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to <hi>diſcern</hi> what will conduce to theſe ends, and to <hi>will</hi> the exertion of his endeavours for the accompliſhment of them: I ſay, it is from our thus knowing the conſtitution of man, that we underſtand what is <hi>fit</hi> and <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable</hi> conduct in him: Was he differently conſtituted, what is now reaſonable and fit, might not be ſo: On the contrary, it might, as to him, be <hi>unreaſonable</hi> and <hi>unfit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Had man been formed with the powers of <hi>intelligence</hi> and <hi>volition,</hi> but without any ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:018397_0023_0FA70CA8B6E252D0"/>
in his nature for the enjoyment of <hi>hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs,</hi> or any ſtate of mind naturally <hi>inclining</hi> him to purſue it, as a valuable end, either with reſpect to <hi>himſelf,</hi> or <hi>others,</hi> of what uſe would <hi>intelligence</hi> or <hi>volition</hi> have been to him? Moſt certainly, upon this ſuppoſition, he could never have been excited to action, either with reference to himſelf, or others: Neither would there have been, as to him, any reaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or fitneſs in action of any kind.</p>
            <p>Or if, in addition to the principles of intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence and volition, he had had planted in his nature, a capacity for the perception of <hi>hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs,</hi> and <hi>private affection,</hi> inclining him to ſeek his <hi>own intereſt,</hi> as an ultimate end, he would, in this caſe, have been excited to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but then, his actions would have wholly centred in <hi>himſelf</hi>: Nor could he have put forth his endeavours, in purſuit of <hi>ſocial</hi> happineſs, otherwiſe than as he might perceive a tendency, in ſuch purſuit, to promote his <hi>own.</hi> This would have been his governing end, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing would have appeared (yea, and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi> would have been, as to him) reaſonable, or unreaſonable; fit, or unfit, as it ſtood con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with this end, and had a tendency in its nature to forward, or obſtruct it.</p>
            <p>But if, together with the powers of intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and volition, we ſuppoſe <hi>ſocial</hi> as well as <hi>private</hi> affection, to have been implanted in him, <hi>diſpoſing</hi> him to purſue the happineſs of <hi>others,</hi> as well as his <hi>own,</hi> a proper foundation
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:018397_0024_0FA70CA980BFD560"/>
is now laid in his nature for <hi>benevolent</hi> actions. He is as truly conſtituted for the purſuit of <hi>ſocial</hi> as <hi>private</hi> good: And it is now eaſy to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the meaning of <hi>fitneſs,</hi> when predicated of <hi>benevolent</hi> actions and how it is eternally <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable,</hi> from the <hi>fitneſs</hi> of the thing itſelf, for a being <hi>ſo conſtituted</hi> to ſeek the welfare of <hi>others,</hi> as well as his <hi>own</hi>: Nor is this language readily <hi>intelligible,</hi> upon any other ſuppoſition.</p>
            <p>And this reaſoning extends to all created be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings whatſoever; and I ſee not but it equally takes place with reſpect to the <hi>Supreme</hi> Being himſelf. We muſt ſuppoſe him exiſting with ſome conſtitution or other; which conſtitution, as to him, being <hi>ſelf-exiſtent,</hi> muſt be looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as <hi>neceſſary,</hi> in the ſame ſenſe that we call his exiſtence itſelf neceſſary. And what conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can be imagined more worthy of the <hi>Deity,</hi> or conſentaneous to all the ideas we have of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, than that which ſuppoſes him to exiſt, not only with the powers of <hi>intelligence</hi> and <hi>voli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> heightened in degree of perfection beyond all bounds; but with the principles alſo of <hi>ſelf-love,</hi> and <hi>benevolence,</hi> heightened in like manner) <hi>diſpoſing</hi> him to ſeek his <hi>own,</hi> and the happineſs of <hi>others?</hi> Upon the previous ſuppoſition of ſuch a <hi>conſtitution of nature,</hi> the conduct of the <hi>Deity,</hi> in creating the world, and giving being and happineſs to ſo many creatures is <hi>intelligible</hi>: Otherwiſe, not very eaſily to be accounted for. It can indeed be ſcarce conceived, if the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Being exiſted without any <hi>natural ſtate of
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:018397_0025_0FA70CAA5BF26B40"/>
mind inclining</hi> him to the communication of happineſs, how he could have communicated it, or judged it reaſonable to do ſo.</p>
            <p>It will probably be ſaid here, the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of happineſs is, in itſelf, a <hi>fit, reaſonable</hi> thing: And the <hi>Deity,</hi> if ſuppoſed to be an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely reaſonable</hi> being, muſt have ſeen a <hi>fitneſs</hi> and <hi>reaſonableneſs</hi> in it, and accordingly have <hi>willed</hi> it. For, to a <hi>perfectly reaſonable</hi> being, there cannot be a more ſuitable or effectual mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to action, than the <hi>reaſonableneſs</hi> of the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on itſelf.</p>
            <p>The reply is, It is readily acknowledged, that to a <hi>reaſonable</hi> being, the <hi>reaſonableneſs</hi> of an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is a ſufficient excitement to it, and the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one that is ſo: But then I add, that no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable being can be ſuppoſed to exiſt <hi>merely</hi> with the <hi>principles of reaſon,</hi> without any other ingredient in his nature. And if a <hi>conſtitution of nature</hi> is previouſly ſuppoſed, no action can have any <hi>reaſonableneſs</hi> in it, but in conſiſtency with this ſuppoſed nature. To apply this particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the <hi>Deity.</hi> If, when he is ſpoken of as a <hi>reaſonable</hi> being, nothing more is meant than his <hi>ſimply</hi> exiſting with the powers of <hi>intelligence</hi> and <hi>volition,</hi> it does not appear how he could have <hi>ſeen</hi> any action to be <hi>reaſonable,</hi> or choſen it as ſuch. <hi>Intelligence</hi> and <hi>volition,</hi> conſidered <hi>ſimply,</hi> and as abſtracted from all perception of happineſs, and connection with it, in any view whatſoever, are really worthleſs powers, and can ſerve for no manner of uſe: And the caſe
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:018397_0026_0FA70CAB0070EE28"/>
would be the ſame, ſhould we heighten them in <hi>degree,</hi> even to <hi>infinity.</hi> The being, poſſeſſed of them, could have no excitement to action, but would eternally exiſt indifferent to every thing. The <hi>Deity</hi> therefore muſt be ſuppoſed to exiſt with <hi>ſentiments of happineſs,</hi> and a <hi>capacity</hi> for it, in addition to the powers of intelligence and volition, together with a <hi>natural ſtate of mind inclining</hi> him to purſue it, either with reſpect to <hi>himſelf,</hi> or <hi>others,</hi> or <hi>both</hi>: And according to the idea we frame of his <hi>nature,</hi> in theſe reſpects, ſo muſt our ideas be of <hi>reaſonable</hi> action in him. If we ſuppoſe him exiſting with a <hi>ſtate of mind diſpoſing</hi> him to purſue happineſs, with reſpect to <hi>others,</hi> as well as <hi>himſelf,</hi> 'tis now eaſy to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the meaning of <hi>fitneſs</hi> of <hi>benevolent</hi> acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in him; and how it would be <hi>reaſonable, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally reaſonable,</hi> from the <hi>fitneſs</hi> of the thing, for him to communicate being and happineſs: But if a <hi>principle of benevolence</hi> is not ſuppoſed to have place in the <hi>Deity,</hi> if he is to be conceived of as <hi>naturally</hi> deſtitute of all deſire of the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of <hi>others,</hi> and as having no <hi>inclination</hi> to purſue it as a valuable end, how could he do it? What exciting reaſon could he have to do it? 'Tis true, he might, from his all-compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive underſtanding, perfectly know all the various ways in which creatures might be made, and conſtituted happy: But the deſire of making them happy, not being ſuppoſed <hi>natural</hi> to him, this knowledge of his could have no tendency to put him upon acting for the procurement of
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:018397_0027_0FA70CABF878D538"/>
this end: Nor can it be ſuppoſed <hi>fit</hi> or <hi>reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> that it ſhould. For no conduct, in any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is <hi>fit</hi> and <hi>reaſonable,</hi> but what agrees with his <hi>natural ſtate,</hi> and <hi>powers,</hi> not perverted. So far as he acts in conſiſtency with his <hi>nature,</hi> he acts as it is <hi>fit</hi> and <hi>reaſonable</hi> he ſhould act: Not otherwiſe. <hi>Reaſonableneſs,</hi> or <hi>fitneſs</hi> therefore, in benevolence, to a being who has no <hi>diſpoſition</hi> to it in his <hi>nature,</hi> is <hi>unintelligible</hi> and abſurd.</p>
            <p>I ſhall only add, we can judge of the <hi>benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence</hi> of the <hi>Deity,</hi> only from the ideas we have of benevolence in <hi>ourſelves</hi>; removing away all weakneſſes, and adding infinite degrees of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. And, in this way of judging, we are directly led to conceive of this quality, as origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating in ſome <hi>ſtate of mind,</hi> analogous to that we call benevolent in ourſelves. With reſpect to ourſelves, 'tis found true, in fact and experience, that the <hi>ſpring of ſocial action is benevolence of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi>; a diſpoſition <hi>natural</hi> to us, tho' capable of being ſtrengthened, and rendered ſtill more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. And if we have any idea at all of <hi>benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence</hi> in the <hi>Deity,</hi> it is the <hi>ſame in kind.</hi> The only difference is, that the <hi>diſpoſition</hi> in him is origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally and abſolutely perfect, both in <hi>mode,</hi> and <hi>degree.</hi> — To proceed,</p>
            <p>'This diſpoſition in the <hi>Deity</hi> muſt be exerted <hi>freely</hi>'. Otherwiſe, it will be a <hi>mechanical</hi> prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, not a <hi>moral</hi> one; which would deſtroy our idea of it as a <hi>commendable</hi> quality. Nor is there any inconſiſtency in ſaying, that this diſpoſition <hi>neceſſarily</hi> inheres in the Divine mind as a <hi>natural</hi>
               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:018397_0028_0FA70CAC83808BA0"/>
principle, and yet that it is capable of being exerted <hi>freely.</hi> For thus it is, in fact, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to ourſelves. Benevolence is a diſpoſition planted in our nature, and exiſts <hi>neceſſarily</hi> there. What I mean is, we poſſeſs this turn of mind, diſpoſition, or inclination, independently of our <hi>own choice</hi>; and yet, our exertions, in acts of beneficence, ſpring from <hi>our wills,</hi> which are determined <hi>freely,</hi> and not impelled by force. We feel it to be in our power, notwithſtanding the <hi>propenſion</hi> in our nature, inclining us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence, either to <hi>will,</hi> or <hi>not will,</hi> theſe or thoſe beneficent acts. And accordingly, we neither eſteem ourſelves, or others, virtuous or praiſe worthy, otherwiſe than as our or their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of kindneſs proceed from <hi>free choice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are, it is true, ſome particular propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, in our nature, which have the appearance of being <hi>mechanical.</hi> Not only the inclinations themſelves, but the exertments in conſequence of them, ſeem to be, in a degree, <hi>neceſſary,</hi> as not reſulting from any proper act of the will. Such is the STORGEE, or <hi>natural affection</hi> of parents to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their offspring. And ſuch is the affection of <hi>pity,</hi> which is a more univerſal propenſion, and common indeed, in a leſs or greater degree, to all mankind. Theſe propenſions ſeem to be of the <hi>mechanical</hi> kind, operating <hi>neceſſarily,</hi> and not from <hi>choice</hi>: At leaſt, this appears to be the caſe, in ſome inſtances, and with reſpect to ſome perſons. And if, inſtead of truſting the well-being of helpleſs children, and perſons in immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:018397_0029_0FA70CAD37E29C30"/>
diſtreſs, to the general, cool principle of benevolence, in ſuch weak, imperfect creatures as we are, the <hi>Deity</hi> has planted this <hi>propelling force</hi> in our conſtitution, for the good of the world, which could not otherwiſe be ſo effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally provided for, it is no more than might be expected from his wiſdom and goodneſs. But then, as <hi>parental kindneſs,</hi> and <hi>pitiable exertions</hi> upon the view of miſerable objects, are thus, in a meaſure, <hi>mechanical,</hi> we ſcarce allow the name of <hi>virtuous</hi> to them: To be ſure, we never call them <hi>virtuous,</hi> only as there was room for <hi>choice,</hi> and in proportion as they ſprang from the <hi>free determination</hi> of the mind. Nay, even with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the general principle of benevolence it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ther<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> no virtue in it, conſidered ſimply as a natural affection, nor in any of its exertions, otherwiſe than as they are <hi>choſen acts</hi>: And the more they are ſo, the higher do we riſe in our opinion of them as truly excellent and virtuous.</p>
            <p>And the ſame reaſoning extends with equal force to the <hi>Deity.</hi> He is <hi>morally</hi> good, and we ſpeak of him as ſuch, becauſe his exertions for the benefit of others are <hi>choſen</hi> acts; tho', at the ſame time, they originate in a <hi>natural</hi> principle of benevolence. Such a principle <hi>neceſſarily</hi> inheres in him, i. e. independently of his <hi>own choice</hi>: And yet, his benevolent exertions, in all inſtances, and kinds, are perfectly <hi>voluntary,</hi> and ſo intirely depend on his <hi>will,</hi> as that they could not have been, if he had not <hi>freely willed</hi> that they ſhould be. And 'tis this that gives us the
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:018397_0030_0FA70CAEB5121710"/>
idea of benevolence in <hi>God</hi> as a <hi>moral character.</hi> If he was <hi>neceſſarily</hi> urged on to the beſtowment of being and happineſs, from the benevolent ſtate of mind that is natural to him, there would be no value, <hi>morally</hi> ſpeaking, in his communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of goodneſs: But as this diſpoſition, though <hi>neceſſarily</hi> inhering in his nature, is yet <hi>freely</hi> exerted, he is juſtly looked upon as a <hi>moral agent</hi> in the good he diſpenſes, and therefore worthy of the higheſt love and gratitude. Nor is it at all more difficult to conceive how benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence in the <hi>Deity</hi> ſhould be a <hi>neceſſary</hi> diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and yet a <hi>moral</hi> perfection, than it is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive how <hi>intelligence</hi> or <hi>volition</hi> in him ſhould be in one ſenſe <hi>neceſſary,</hi> and in another <hi>moral.</hi> The <hi>Deity neceſſarily</hi> exiſts a being endowed with the principles of <hi>intelligence</hi> and <hi>volition</hi>; and yet, he <hi>freely</hi> exerts theſe principles: Nor otherwiſe would they be <hi>moral</hi> ones. The ſame may be ſaid of his <hi>benevolence</hi>: He <hi>neceſſarily</hi> exiſts with this ſtate of mind; and yet, he truly <hi>wills</hi> the communication of good, in all inſtances whatſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ever. And this conſtitutes benevolence in him a <hi>moral character.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This diſpoſition muſt be exerted alſo with a nobly benevolent intention, not with a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, hidden view to make thoſe miſerable, and with inhanced aggravation, who are the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of that which has the appearance of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated goodneſs. Some there are, who, though they call the Deity benevolent, yet, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent him as making ſome of his crea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="32" facs="unknown:018397_0031_0FA70CB0DCC07170"/>
beſtowing upon them riches of goodneſs with an expreſs deſign, that they ſhould miſuſe them, and by this means give occaſion for the infliction of his wrath upon them, and in an inhanced meaſure, and this forever. Yea, there are thoſe, who make the infinitely benevolent God the <hi>grand and only efficient,</hi> not only in the beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of good, but even in the abuſe of it; and that he has ſo laid his plan, and connected a chain of cauſes, as that this abuſe ſhall invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lably be brought into event, and on purpoſe that its final reſult ſhould be the everlaſting damnation of a great number of the creatures his hands have formed. Some late writers will not diſown, that this is a juſt repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their publiſhed ſentiments. What their idea of benevolence is, I will not pretend to ſay; but this I will ſay, that it eſſentially dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from that moral quality, which goes by the name of benevolence among men; and it moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly would, in any created intelligent moral agent be deemed, not merely malevolence, but male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence in the higheſt degree. And to attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute ſuch benevolence to the all-perfect Deity, would be to make him, not conſtructively and by diſtant conſequence, but directly and in explicit terms, a more malevolent being than even the evil one has ever been repreſented to be. For he is only a tempter to wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but, according to this ſcheme, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely good God is its <hi>efficient,</hi> its only <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per cauſe,</hi> and in order to produce eternal mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:018397_0032_0FA70CB142704480"/>
as its effect. Far be it from reaſonable creatures to harbour in their breaſts ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honorable conceptions of the only good God! If he is poſſeſſed of that moral quality we call benevolence, he muſt, if we can form any idea of what benevolence means, in all the manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of it to his creatures, intend their good, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſecret reference to the contrary; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch, that if they chuſe that to their hurt, which was truly deſigned for their good, they themſelves, and not the God that made them, and has been kind and good to them, are chargeable with the guilt and folly of their miſconduct.</p>
            <p>Finally, this diſpoſition in the <hi>Deity</hi> muſt likewiſe be exerted 'under the <hi>direction of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence,</hi> and in <hi>conſiſtency with fit conduct.</hi>' I ſay under the <hi>direction of intelligence,</hi> becauſe otherwiſe it would be that <hi>blind</hi> ſort of bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence which is really of no worth, <hi>morally</hi> ſpeaking. And I add, in <hi>conſiſtency with fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of conduct,</hi> becauſe there is certainly ſuch a thing as <hi>unfitneſs,</hi> as well as <hi>fitneſs</hi> of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, in the production of happineſs. And the <hi>latter</hi> muſt be regarded by an infinitely wiſe and intelligent being: Nor otherwiſe would he act <hi>reaſonably,</hi> whatever benevolence he might diſcover in his exertions.</p>
            <p>Some may be ready to think, that the <hi>will</hi> of the Supreme Being is the only meaſure of <hi>fitneſs,</hi> in the communication of good; that what he <hi>wills</hi> is for that reaſon <hi>fit,</hi> and there is
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:018397_0033_0FA70CB652C6D6C8"/>
no need of any other to make it ſo. But this is a great miſtake. There is, bey<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

And the reaſon here is the ſame, as in the caſe of <hi>fit</hi> and <hi>unfit</hi> methods of conduct. As the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> is ſelected becauſe <hi>fit,</hi> for the ſame reaſon, in general, that muſt be choſen which is the <hi>fitteſt,</hi> and will beſt anſwer the end.</p>

               <pb n="38" facs="unknown:018397_0037_0FA70CBA584ACBB8"/>So that happineſs, as communicated from the <hi>Deity,</hi> is, by no means, the effect of <hi>mere inclination, blindly and boundleſsly exerted</hi>: Neither is it the reſult of <hi>unaccountable will and pleaſure</hi>; pleaſure not excited by the <hi>eternal fitneſs</hi> and <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs</hi> of action: No; but the exertions of the <hi>Deity,</hi> in benevolent acts, are all directed and governed by an unerring principle of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and intelligence: Inſomuch that he cannot do a benevolent action, but within the limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (if I may ſo ſpeak) of reaſonable and fit conduct. It is not poſſible (I mean <hi>morally</hi> ſo, in the ſenſe in which we ſay, it is impoſſible for God to lie: It is not poſſible,) for him to diſpenſe happineſs in any other way. It would argue ſome defect in wiſdom, or ſome depravity in diſpoſition, which is inconſiſtent with the ſuppoſition of his being infinitely perfect and intelligent. No happineſs therefore ought to be expected from the <hi>Deity,</hi> but what may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult from <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>fit</hi> conduct: But I may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly add, all the happineſs that can, in this way, be communicated, may fairly and reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably be looked for.</p>
            <p>The ſum of what has been ſaid concerning <hi>benevolence,</hi> as attributed to the <hi>Deity,</hi> is, that it ſuppoſes 'a <hi>natural ſtate of mind,</hi> inclining him to the <hi>communication</hi> of good;' a ſtate of mind analogous to <hi>kind affection</hi> in us men, only as kind affection <hi>in us</hi> is attended with frailty, <hi>in him</hi> it is abſolutely perfect, both as to <hi>mode</hi> of exiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and <hi>manner</hi> of exerciſe: That, as he

exiſts a <hi>free agent,</hi> in the higheſt and moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſenſe, he is not <hi>mechanically,</hi> or <hi>neceſſarily,</hi> urged on, from this <hi>natural diſpoſition,</hi> to the communication of good; but acts herein <hi>vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily,</hi> and of <hi>choice</hi>: And, in fine, that, as he is an infinitely <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>intelligent,</hi> as well as free, <hi>agent,</hi> his exertions, in order to the production of good, are never <hi>unfit,</hi> never unreaſonable, but always <hi>fit reaſonable,</hi> and <hi>abſolutely</hi> and <hi>perfectly</hi> ſo. So that, in one word, <hi>benevolence</hi> in the <hi>Deity</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies preciſely the ſame thing with "a diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion freely to communicate all the good that is conſiſtent with <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>fit</hi> conduct:" For, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premely perfect benevolence of nature, being, in him, conjoined with an all-comprehending underſtanding, and unerring wiſdom, he muſt know all the ways of producing happineſs, and the <hi>greateſt</hi> ſum of it that can be wiſely produced: And this therefore is the happineſs that may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably be expected ſhould be produced by him; that is to ſay, all the happineſs to the <hi>whole,</hi> and every part of the creation, than can be, not in reſpect of <hi>omnipotence,</hi> conſidered as a <hi>natural</hi> power, but in the way of <hi>fit</hi> and <hi>reaſonable</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.

a good argument in proof of it, and would appear ſo us to be ſo, had we one intire view of the <hi>whole caſe,</hi> in all its connections and dependencies,</p>
            <p>I ſhould have now proceeded to look into the <hi>conſtitution of nature,</hi> and inquire whether we are not therefrom led into this conception of the <hi>benevolence of the Deity</hi>:—But I ſhall firſt dilate a little upon a few deductions, which ſeem too important to be wholly paſſed over in ſilence.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place, it is obvious to deduce, from the explanation that has been given of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence as a <hi>moral</hi> quality, a juſt conception of the thing meant, when the Deity is ſpoken of as <hi>infinitely</hi> good. There may have been, in the minds of ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>me, indiſtinct, if not wrong, appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of what is ſignified by this adjunct. The application of it, if applied intelligibly, is not intended to ſuggeſt, that benevolence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite in degree is diſplayed in every commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of goodneſs from the Deity. For it is evident to common ſenſe, that theſe commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications are various; ſome manifeſt goodneſs in one degree, others <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> another; and ſo on, with incon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>vable diverſity. Neither is it to be ſuppoſed, be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e God is <hi>infinitely</hi> benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, that he has in fact made an infinite ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of his goodneſs. This, perhaps, is impoſſible; and for this very good reaſon, becauſe <hi>infinity</hi> in benevolence knows no bounds, but there is ſtill room for more, and higher
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:018397_0040_0FA70CBD29F539E8"/>
diſplays of it. The true idea therefore of the epithet, <hi>infinite,</hi> when applied to God as benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, is, as I apprehend, plainly this; that he has within himſelf a boundleſs ſource of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence, that he is ſo benevolent, in his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as that he may go on eternally making diſcoveries of his goodneſs, or, in other words, that this perfection of his is, ſtrictly ſpeaking, inexhauſtable, not capable of being exerted to a <hi>ne plus.</hi> It is obſervable, we do not ſay that God is almighty, omnipotent, becauſe he has exerted his power to the utmoſt; for he may go on exerting it without end; otherwiſe, he could not be ſaid to be <hi>infinite</hi> in power. In the ſame ſenſe God is <hi>infinitely</hi> benevolent. But then, as he is infinitely intelligent and wiſe, as well as benevolent, he never manifeſts either his power, or goodneſs, but under the guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of intelligent wiſdom. Whatever this directs to, he wills ſhall be; and whatever he wills ſhall be, is actually brought into event. This points out the reaſon, and the true one, why God, though <hi>infinitely</hi> powerful and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent in his nature, is yet under a limitation as to the diſplay of thoſe attributes. He mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſts no more power, or goodneſs, than unerring wiſdom directs to: Nor could it be otherwiſe, unleſs theſe perfections were to be manifeſted blindly, and at random; the abſurdity of which is too glaring to be ſuppoſed. This leads</p>
            <p>To another obvious and important deduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is, that no communications of
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:018397_0041_0FA70CBDB57424A0"/>
goodneſs may reaſonably be looked for from the Deity, though infinitely benevolent, but ſuch as fall in with what wiſdom directs to, as fit and proper. We may pleaſe ourſelves, and too often do, with vain expectations, taking riſe from falſe ideas we have in our minds of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite benevolence, as exiſting in the breaſt of G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d. But it ought to be remembered, and ſeriouſly conſidered, that the ſame Deity who is infinitely benevolent, is alſo infinitely intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, wiſe, juſt, and holy, and cannot there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, unleſs with groſs abſurdity, be ſuppoſed to manifeſt his benevolence in any acts of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but in harmony with thoſe perfections, all which are equally eſſential ingredients in his nature. Many men are apt to imagine, that God is all goodneſs, and that they may hope for every thing from this attribute of his, without ſo much as once thinking h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>w unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, and unfit it would be in an infinitely intelligent, wiſe, and juſt being to make diſplays of his benevolence in any inſtances, or degrees, but under the guidance of wiſdom, and in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect conſiſtency with rectitude. What are our ſentiments of thoſe good-natured, kindly affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned men, who diſpenſe their bounties, not with underſtanding and wiſdom, but in a ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom way, without thought or conſideration? We pity their weakneſs, and wiſh they had more diſcretion. And ſhall we attribute that to the all-perfect Deity, which we eſteem a diſgrace even in man! Benevolence, though infinite in
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:018397_0042_0FA70CBE73450000"/>
its ſource, or principle, muſt yet be limited, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, and governed in all its manifeſtations, by wiſdom, equity, and juſtice, or it may, in the final reſult of its operations, do more hurt, than good; to be ſure, it will not otherwiſe bring honor to the being poſſeſſed of it, if, at the ſame time, he is ſuppoſed to be endowed with intelligence and wiſdom, in a ſufficient degree, for his direction in the diſplays of his goodneſs.</p>
            <p>Another deduction ſtill, highly intereſting and important, is, that intelligent moral beings have no juſt ground, from the infinite bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence of God, to expect the enjoyment of that happineſs they are made capable of, but in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of, or connection with, a wiſe and virtuous uſe of their implanted powers, under ſuch advantages as they may be favored with. The reaſon is, becauſe God, though he has with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in himſelf an infinite, never-failing ſpring of benevolence, yet will not ſuffer it to flow from him, in any inſtance or degree, but under the guidance of wiſdom that cannot err. And can it be thought wiſe or fit, that moral agents, whether they are virtuous or vicious, without regard had to their reſpective oppoſite charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, ſhould be indiſcriminately treated as ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table objects of the Divine benevolence? How would ſuch a conduct comport with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of heaven in the beſtowment of intellec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and moral powers? To what purpoſe were they given, if it was a matter of indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency, in relation to their being fit objects of
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:018397_0043_0FA70CC0A7848420"/>
their Maker's kind notice, how they employed them? And how could even theſe moral be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings themſelves, entertain in their minds, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming conceptions of the wiſdom and recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the Supreme Creator and Ruler, upon this plan of manifeſting his benevolence? Beſides, it may be juſtly queſtioned, whether moral agents can be made truly happy, but by a wiſe and right uſe of their implanted facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. The goodneſs of God, under the direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of wiſdom, has given them various fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, and placed them within reach of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects fitted to yield them the enjoyment, they were formed capable of; but if they will ſeek for happineſs in other ways, and not in this, which a good God has purpoſely adapted to give it to them, how ſhould they be the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of it? It cannot be. There muſt be an agreement between faculties and objects, and a due application alſo of theſe faculties to their reſpective objects, or there can be no proper ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. It is indeed impoſſible there ſhould be, according to the preſent conſtituted way of enjoyment. The nature therefore of intellec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual moral beings muſt be changed into ſome other, or they muſt, in a meaſure, act up to their character as p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>per to this kind of beings, than righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs can have fellowſhip with unrighteouſneſs, or light have communion with darkneſs."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="unknown:018397_0044_0FA70CC25824F820"/>I have hitherto conſidered this deduction on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in general, as it reſpects all intelligent mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral beings, in all worlds. But it may, with pertinency be applied more particularly to us men, as containing that in it which is well worthy of our moſt ſerious attention. We are formed by the God that made us, not only with animal, but intellectual and moral faculties; in which view of our conſtitution, we have nothing to expect, in a way of favorable no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, from the Deity, though infinitely bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent, but what is ſuited to the faculties, he has given us, and to be enjoyed only in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection with, or in conſequence of, a due and proper uſe of them. Was benevolence in God a propenſity in his nature, of the inſtinctive kind, blindly urging him on to a gratification of it, it might be done at any rate: But, far from this, it is a diſpoſition inhering in an all-perfect mind, and that is inſeparably conjoined with infinite knowledge and wiſdom, and can therefore be never manifeſted <hi>ad extra</hi> but with reaſon, and in conſiſtency with rectitude. And as we men are formed, not only with bodily appetites, but with intellectual and moral pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers alſo, ſhall it be imagined, that ſuch a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as God is ſhould make us the objects of his benevolence, in any way but that, which is ſuitably adapted to the nature he has given us? And if, inſtead of cultivating our ſuperior powers, and exerciſing them in a due manner upon their proper objects, we neglect their

            <p>It may with propriety be added here, that the Supreme Being himſelf, as he is an intelligent moral agent in abſolute perfection, is infinitely happy from the delight he takes in always chuſing, willing, and doing, and with perfect freedom, that which is right and fit. And as he has made us men with intellectual and moral powers, after the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of his own, though in a low degree, he has planted a capacity in our nature of being hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py with the like kind of happineſs, he himſelf exiſts in the enjoyment of. But then it ſhould be remembered, we muſt be the ſubjects of this happineſs in the ſame way that he is, that is, by a wiſe and fit uſe of our rational and moral faculties; or, in other words, by ſo governing our elections, volitions, and conſequent actions, as that they may be conformed, as nearly as may be, to the eternal rule of right. This is the way, and the only one, in which we can at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to the happineſs that is ſuited to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of ſuch beings as we are. Benignity of heart, probity of mind, conſcious integrity, ſelf-approbation, and a good hope of the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of our Maker, evidenced to us by an habitual, ſteady courſe of freely chuſing and practiſing the things that are comely, 'juſt, pure, lovely, and of good report,' are die true

ſource of the moral happineſs we are formed capable of. We may, in conſequence of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection that is natural to us as creatures, from free choice, act below our character as men; walking in impiety, ſenſuality, unrighteouſneſs, deceit, malignity, and the like vicious ways: But, inſtead of being adapted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to yield us real, ſolid ſatisfaction, they powerfully tend to make us miſerable; and miſery will be the reſult of ſuch a walk, according to the conſtitution of nature, unleſs counteracted by the Deity, which, to expect, would be the vaineſt thing in the world. Yea, it ſhould ſeem impoſſible, that a rational moral being ſhould be happy, whoſe choice, and conſequent practice, are a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to his reaſon, and a violation of the rule of right. It would be a ſubverſion of that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which is the eſtabliſhment of a good God, that the happineſs proper to an intelligent na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture might, in this way, be attained to. If we would be happy; as beings of our rank in the ſcale of exiſtence, we muſt act up to our charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and not as if we had no underſtanding, and there were no difference between us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the beaſt that periſhs.

kind of happineſs: But how ſhall we become the percipients of it? By an imitation of God in benignity of temper and conduct, in purity, in righteouſneſs, in charity, and in every thing that is amiable, and worthy of eſteem.

            <head>PART II. Proving, that the Deity is ſupremely and perfectly benevolent, in the ſenſe that goodneſs, as a moral quality, has been explained to belong to him.</head>
            <p>SOME have endeavoured to prove, by meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſical reaſoning, that the Deity is perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and infinitely benevolent. And I ſee not, I muſt confeſs, but that may be offered in this way of reaſoning which is ſtrictly concluſive. We may be as ſure, from the exerciſe of that power of diſcernment we are naturally endowed with, of the perfect benevolence of the Divine Being, as of his exiſtence, or of any of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections we connect with it. The ſame intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual power that aſſures us there muſt be an eternal ſelf-exiſtent Deity, aſſures us alſo, and in the ſame way, that he muſt be poſſeſſed, not of this or that perfection only, but of every perfection. For, having always exiſted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any exterior cauſe to limit his exiſtence, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as to its nature, manner, or properties, there is, and muſt be, preciſely the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ſuppoſe him the ſubject of all perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as of any one in particular. Benevolence, therefore, ſupremely perfect benevolence, is as juſtly applicable to him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as immenſity, ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituality, omnipotence, or any of the Divine attributes, to which the epithet, <hi>natural,</hi> is commonly applied, to diſtinguiſh them fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="53" facs="unknown:018397_0051_0FA70CCA81E2C5D8"/>
and the ſame may be ſaid, and with equal truth, of his all-perfect benevolence. Do we attribute almighty power to God, from the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of power he has produced? And ſhall we not conceive of him as perfectly benevolent, from the effects of his goodneſs we every where ſee in our world, and in all parts of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe we have any knowledge of? How num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs are the creatures he has formed with capacities of enjoyment? How amazingly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious are theſe capacities? What abundant pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion has he made for filling them with the good that is ſuited to their reſpective natures? And how immenſe is the quantum of good en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed by them all, conſidered in one collective view? Every creature we caſt our eyes upon, diſcovering pleaſure in its exiſtence, from the good it is made capable of enjoying, and actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally does enjoy, is, at once, both an inſtance, and proof, of the Divine benevolence. How inconceivably is this evidence increaſed in its ſtrength, when ſuch multitudes of beings in the creation of God, the number of which no man can count, have been, through a long ſucceſſion of ages, and ſtill are, the percipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents of his bountiful care, and munificent good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs! Can any one, in the ſober exerciſe of his underſtanding, queſtion, whether this is a clear proof of benevolence in the Deity? Eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when there has been the diſplay of ſuch aſtoniſhing ſkill and contrivance in the formati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of faculties, and the making and placing
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:018397_0052_0FA70CCC3846E410"/>
objects within the reach of them, ſo admirably ſuited to yield them delight, and in ways and degrees beyond conception various. Who can help, in this view of things, breaking forth in ſome ſuch words of admiration as thoſe of pious David, "Thou, Lord, art good, and d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſt good! Thy tender mercies are over all the works of thy hands!"</p>
            <p>But, as it is a matter of no ſmall importance, that we entertain in our minds lively concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the benevolence of the Deity, I ſhall be particular and diſtinct in mentioning ſome of thoſe effects of it, which muſt, unleſs we are greatly faulty in the uſe of our intellectual powers, oblige us to confeſs, that God is good, ſupremely and perfectly good.</p>
            <p>Only, before I enter upon this argument, and in order to clear the way to it, I deſire the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing remarks may be previouſly well conſidered.</p>
            <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> is, That this ſyſtem of our's is not to be conſidered <hi>ſingly,</hi> and by <hi>itſelf,</hi> when we are arguing about the benevolence of the <hi>Deity.</hi> And for this plain reaſon, becauſe there are <hi>other</hi> ſyſtems of beings, to whom <hi>God</hi> has made manifeſtations of his goodneſs. If we may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the <hi>bible,</hi> as a ſacred book, there are certainly <hi>other</hi> beings, capable of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and in actual poſſeſſion of it, beſides thoſe which dwell on this earth. Nay, more than this, their capacities for happineſs are <hi>much larger,</hi> than the capacities of any of the beings belonging to this ſyſtem; and they actually en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:018397_0053_0FA70CCDE718FCC8"/>
it, in a <hi>much higher</hi> degree. But if any ſhould eſteem this a conſideration of little weight, I would add, there are ſo many globes viſible to our ſight, equally capable; with this globe we live upon, of containing inhabitants<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> furniſhed with ſentiments of happineſs, and means of obtaining it, that it is, without all doubt, the truth of <hi>fact,</hi> that they are filled with ſuch inhabitants. With reſpect to our earth, we certainly know, that it has relation to <hi>life</hi> and <hi>enjoyment.</hi> It is indeed ſo conſtituted as to ſupport in <hi>being</hi> and <hi>happineſs</hi> innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble animated creatures of various kinds. And why ſhould the other globes, revolving in the ſame heavens, be looked upon as <hi>meer dead mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?</hi> We have infinitely greater reaſon, from what we ſee to be <hi>fact,</hi> in our own globe, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that they alſo are ſo formed as to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to the preſervation of numberleſs <hi>percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> beings, to the h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nor of the Creator's mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence. The all-powerful, and infinitely wiſe, God could as eaſily have modelled the other globes to the purpoſes of maintaining <hi>life,</hi> and rendering it comfortable, and happy, to milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of creatures, as he has done this: And the thought that he has actually ſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>gous to what we behold of his goodneſs, with reſpect to our own ſyſtem: It is indeed the moſt obvious and natural inference, from the conſideration of him as a <hi>benevolent,</hi> as well as powerful and wiſe Being.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="56" facs="unknown:018397_0054_0FA70CCED9B281A8"/>If now we are naturally led, from <hi>known ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances,</hi> to argue, that there are <hi>other</hi> beings beſides thoſe on this gl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is no argument that the <hi>Deity</hi> is not <hi>abſolutely</hi> good, becauſe the <hi>greateſt communicable good</hi> is not to he found in our world. Was our world indeed the <hi>only one</hi> in which there were perceiving beings, and we knew this to be <hi>fact,</hi> the argument might then carry weight with it. For, if the <hi>Deity</hi> was abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and <hi>perfectly</hi> good, our world, in this caſe, would be the proof of it, conſidered <hi>ſimply in it-ſelf.</hi> But if there are other ſyſtems, they m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſt be taken care of, and provided for, as well as our's: And no more happineſs is required for our ſyſtem, even from <hi>infinitely perfect</hi> benevolence, than is proper for a <hi>part</hi> of ſome <hi>great whole</hi>:
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:018397_0055_0FA70CCEF94B2510"/>
And it is enough to illuſtrate the <hi>real be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of an <hi>abſolutely perfect</hi> principle of bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence, if the diſplays of it towards our world, one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>A <hi>ſecond</hi> remark though not very foreign from the former, is, that, in arguing concerning the <hi>Divine Benevolence,</hi> we ought not to conſider its <hi>diſplays</hi> as they affect <hi>individual beings only,</hi> but as they relate to the <hi>particular ſyſtem</hi> of which they are parts. For, as all <hi>particular ſyſtems</hi> are, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably, related to ſome <hi>univerſal one,</hi> and, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſpeaking, are ſo many <hi>parts</hi> conſtituting this <hi>great whole,</hi> deſigned, by the <hi>Deity,</hi> for the <hi>full</hi> manifeſtation of his <hi>infinitely perfect</hi> bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence: In like manner, the ſeveral beings, in any <hi>particular</hi> ſyſtem, are the <hi>parts</hi> conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>that</hi> a <hi>particular whole</hi>: And the Divine benevolence therefore, is to be eſtimated from its amount to <hi>this whole,</hi> and not its conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>parts,</hi> ſeparately conſidered. Theſe, it is true, muſt partake of good; but then, the good lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ked for ought to be no other than is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to <hi>parts,</hi> bearing ſuch a relation to ſuch a <hi>whole.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To be ſure, the only fair way of judging of the Divine benevolence, with reſpect to our world, is to conſider it, not as diſplayed to <hi>ſeparate individuals,</hi> but to the <hi>whole ſyſtem,</hi> and to <hi>theſe</hi> as its conſtituent <hi>parts.</hi> For it is true in <hi>fact,</hi> that the <hi>Deity</hi> originally made, and

conſtantly governs, all the various kinds of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, on this earth, and all the individuals in each of theſe kinds, with a <hi>relative</hi> view.

They are all brought into being, and preſerved in being, in this way: And not only ſo, but all the happineſs they attain to the enjoyment of, is, in like manner, dependent on <hi>general laws,</hi> whoſe operation the <hi>Deity</hi> does not coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-act,

but <hi>concurs</hi> with, in order to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce this effect. This is <hi>univerſally</hi> true of all the <hi>animate</hi> kinds on the earth: And it is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly true of <hi>men,</hi> its only inhabitants that are endowed with <hi>rational</hi> and <hi>moral</hi> powers. They are brought into exiſtence according to a <hi>ſettled uniform courſe of nature</hi>: And their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence, which, at firſt, is nothing more than a <hi>variegated capacity for happineſs,</hi> is upheld by <hi>ſtated laws</hi>; and it is by <hi>ſtated laws</hi> ſtill that this capacity, agreeably to its <hi>diverſe nature,</hi> is opened and expanded, and gradually fitted for the happineſs that is proper to it.</p>
            <p>Theſe are all unqueſtionable <hi>facts.</hi> And the conſequence from them is another <hi>fact</hi> as indiſputable, viz. that <hi>leſs good</hi> may be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the operation of theſe cauſes, than they <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally tend</hi> to produce, and actually would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, if they were not obſtructed in their ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. To illuſtrate my meaning by an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. It is by the <hi>intervention of ourſelves,</hi> in a great meaſure, that we come to the enjoyment of that happineſs our <hi>implanted capacities tend to.</hi> The good we are originally formed for is put very much into our <hi>own power</hi>; inſomuch that we are <hi>more</hi> or <hi>leſs</hi> happy, in conſequence of our own conduct. This is one of the <hi>general laws,</hi> according to which the <hi>Deity</hi> operates in the communication of good. And it ſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally takes place, that he does not ſo much as uphold us in being, excluſively of <hi>our own

care</hi> in providing, and uſing, that ſuſtenance, without which, according to <hi>another law</hi> of nature, we cannot be preſerved in life. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther does he open and enlarge our implanted faculties, or fill them with the good that is ſuited to them, but with the concurrence of <hi>ourſelves</hi>: inſomuch that the increaſe, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of our <hi>mental</hi> and <hi>moral</hi> capacities, is ſo far put into our own power, that it is, in a great meaſure, dependent on <hi>ourſelves,</hi> whethey they attain to any conſiderable degrees either of <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</hi> or <hi>happineſs.</hi> And it is true, in expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that a great part of mankind do not arrive to that <hi>extent,</hi> either of <hi>perfection</hi> or <hi>hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs,</hi> their original capacities would have allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of, and they might have attained to, had they more wiſely fallen in with the <hi>tendency</hi> of that <hi>general law,</hi> which makes their <hi>perfection</hi> and <hi>happineſs</hi> ſo much dependent on <hi>themſelves.</hi> They do not uſe their own powers, in order to their own good, as they might do; and ſo come ſhort of that <hi>degree</hi> of good, this <hi>general law ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded</hi> to produce, and would actually have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, had it not been their own fault. It is therefore owing to <hi>themſelves,</hi> and not to the <hi>Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> that they do not partake of good, in larger meaſures: And it would be a wrong to his <hi>infinite benevolence</hi> to judge of it <hi>meerly</hi> from the good they <hi>actually</hi> enjoy, without taking into conſideration the <hi>tendency</hi> of <hi>this,</hi> among the other <hi>general laws</hi> by which he operates in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playing his goodneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="unknown:018397_0061_0FA70CD652B3EEF0"/>It will poſſibly be ſaid here, infinite benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence cannot be <hi>confined to general laws,</hi> in the communication of good: Or if general laws are expedient, it may reaſonably be expected, that a perfectly benevolent being ſhould <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,</hi> as occaſions may make it neceſſary, to prevent that miſchief which might take place, if <hi>general laws</hi> were ſteadily and rigidly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered to.</p>
            <p>As to the firſt part of this objection, that infinite benevolence is not to be reſtrained, in its exertions, within the limits of general laws; it is more than we can pretend to affirm, upon any other foot than that of meer conjecture. For notwithſtanding all that we can prove to the contrary, the method of communicating good by <hi>general laws</hi> may be the <hi>fitteſt</hi>: And the <hi>Deity,</hi> who is perfectly acquainted with all the methods in which it is poſſible, that good ſhould be communicated, might ſee it to be the <hi>fitteſt</hi>; and, for that reaſon, ſelect it from all others, as the only one in which he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to manifeſt his <hi>infinite benevolence.</hi> And indeed, we ourſelves, weak as we are, can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern this to be the <hi>fitteſt</hi> and <hi>beſt</hi> method we are able to conceive of. For it is the alone foundation of all our rational exertions, whether of body or mind, ſeparate from which they would be, in a manner, uſeleſs, as they could not be directed to any end. Did the <hi>Deity</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve <hi>no rule, no order, no ſtated courſe,</hi> in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications, what ſhould we be able to make
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:018397_0062_0FA70CD739B70E10"/>
of ſuch a method of conduct? What beauty or harmony could we diſcover in it? What rules could we form from it to govern our own purſuits? Appearances that do not reſult from <hi>eſtabliſhed laws,</hi> operating in a <hi>ſtated, uniform</hi> way, are abſolutely unintelligible. For being, by ſuppoſition, <hi>ſingle, ſeparate, independent</hi> effects, nothing could be argued from them: They could not be ranged in <hi>order,</hi> ſo as to ſerve any valuable purpoſe; but muſt be perceived by every intelligent mind as a <hi>looſe, rude, unconnected</hi> heap of irregularity and confuſion. Thoſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances only, which take place in a <hi>uniform</hi> way, according to <hi>eſtabliſhed laws,</hi> are capable of being reduced to a certain rule, and ſo as to lay a proper foundation, either for ſcience or <hi>foreſight</hi>: Nor do any other ſeem to become the wiſdom of an <hi>infinitely intelligent</hi> agent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Inconveniences,</hi> it is true, may ariſe from this method of acting by <hi>general laws,</hi> in a <hi>ſtated</hi> way. And, perhaps, it is impoſſible, in the nature of things, that <hi>general laws</hi> ſhould be ſo framed as <hi>abſolutely</hi> to prevent <hi>all irregularity.</hi> But may not the ſame be ſaid, of any other method of conduct that could be pitched upon, with equal truth? And f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>r aught we can ſay to the contrary, there may be leſs danger of irregularities in <hi>this,</hi> than any other method whatſoever; at leaſt, of irregularities that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be rectified in the <hi>final iſſue</hi> of things, ſo far as it can be done in conſiſtency with wiſdom and rectitude.</p>

               <pb n="65" facs="unknown:018397_0063_0FA70CD7F89AB518"/>The other branch of the objection is, that, if <hi>general laws</hi> ſhould be thought expedient, it may however be expected, that an <hi>infinitely benevolent</hi> being would <hi>interpoſe,</hi> as occaſion required, to prevent the miſchief which would otherwiſe take place. In reply whereto, it may be obſerved, tho' <hi>inconveniences</hi> will probably ariſe, <hi>for the preſent,</hi> when <hi>general laws</hi> are ſtatedly kept t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But was this <hi>impoſſible,</hi> who knows what would be the conſequence of theſe deſired <hi>interpoſitions?</hi> It is certain they would entirely <hi>alter</hi> the preſent method of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating good: And will any man take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him to determine, that <hi>good upon the whole,</hi> and not <hi>evil,</hi> would be the reſult of ſuch an alteration? Poſſibly this method of communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating good by <hi>general laws, uniformly adhered to,</hi> is, in the nature of things, a better adapted one to produce the <hi>greateſt good,</hi> than the other method by <hi>interpoſitions continually repeated.</hi> It is true, if by <hi>interpoſitions</hi> no other effect would follow than the prevention of the miſchief they are introduced for, they might well be deſired: And I ſee not indeed but they might reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be expected from an <hi>infinitely</hi> benevolent being. But it is certain, they would be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed with other effects; and I may add, bad
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:018397_0064_0FA70CD8B8BE2750"/>
ones too, which might be more than a ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance for the good it is intended they ſhould produce. As thus:—They would render all <hi>foreſight</hi> abſolutely uncertain, and, in no mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, to be depended on; they would put a final bar in the way of men's <hi>activity</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry,</hi> in the uſe of their various powers, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bodily, or mental; and, in ſhort, they would totally deſtroy the <hi>whole buſineſs of life,</hi> which is carried on, upon this ſuppoſition, that ſuch and ſuch actions will be followed with ſuch and ſuch conſequences, in virtue of thoſe <hi>eſtabliſhed laws,</hi> which <hi>uniformly</hi> take place in the world. No one indeed can ſo much as conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture what theſe <hi>interpoſitions</hi> would finally iſſue in. If they did ſome good, they might poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly do more hurt. And for aught we know, they might, upon the whole, counter-act the very end for which they were introduced: That is to ſay, they might be the occaſion of an over-balance of <hi>miſchief.</hi> And if ſo, ſo the Deity,s not <hi>interpoſing,</hi> in the manner pleaded for, is an inſtance of <hi>goodneſs,</hi> and not an argument in proof of the <hi>want</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>The great thing more particularly aimed at, by theſe <hi>interpoſitions,</hi> is, the prevention of <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral evil</hi>; which has done ſo much hurt in the world. And could the <hi>Deity,</hi> in this way, have prevented the <hi>abuſe of moral powers,</hi> without bringing on, at the ſame time, other conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, as truly fatal to the <hi>happineſs</hi> of <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral agents,</hi> he would, no doubt, have done it.
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:018397_0065_0FA70CDA745BE670"/>
And his not doing it ought to be looked upon as a ſtrong preſumptive argument, that he could not, without the following of theſe bad effects; unleſs it can be clearly ſhown, that no ſuch ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects would have followed thereupon. The en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of <hi>wickedneſs</hi> into the world, it is readily owned, has done <hi>vaſt miſchief</hi>: But will any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>an undertake to prove, that <hi>leſs miſchief</hi> would have been done, if this had been prevented by the <hi>interpoſitions</hi> pleaded for? Poſſibly, no <hi>interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions,</hi> but ſuch <hi>over-bearing</hi> ones as would have deſtroyed <hi>moral agency,</hi> would have <hi>certainly</hi> and <hi>abſolutely</hi> prevented <hi>moral evil</hi>: And the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>moral agency</hi> would, I will venture to ſay, have at once deſtroyed the true and only foundation, on which the <hi>greateſt</hi> and <hi>moſt valuable</hi> part of the happineſs, that is commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicable from the Deity, is built; as any intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent reader will eaſily perceive, by purſuing the thought in his own mind, and as we may have occaſion largely to purſue it hereafter.</p>
            <p>It appears then, upon the whole, that we have no juſt reaſon for complaint, that the <hi>Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> communicates good by <hi>general laws,</hi> whoſe operation he does not counter-act, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs with, in a <hi>regular uniform</hi> courſe. The main queſtion therefore, in the preſent argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is, whether <hi>thoſe laws</hi> are as <hi>good</hi> as it might reaſonably be expected they ſhould be, if eſtabliſhed by a <hi>perfectly benevolent being?</hi> And this muſt be determined (the other previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous remarks having had their due weight) by
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:018397_0066_0FA70CDB0119CCA0"/>
the <hi>tendency</hi> of the laws themſelves to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of good, as well as by the good that is, <hi>actually</hi> produced by them. Theſe ſhould be conſidered not <hi>ſingly,</hi> but in one conjunct view. The good <hi>actually</hi> produced ought to come into conſideration, becauſe it cannot well be ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n, but what would have had this effect. But then, the <hi>tendency</hi> of theſe laws ought to be conſidered likewiſe, becauſe <hi>this</hi> might manifeſt <hi>greater benevolence</hi> than the good that is <hi>actually</hi> produced. The <hi>laws</hi> might be well adapted in their nature, and tendency, to effect <hi>more</hi> good than is <hi>actually</hi> accompliſhed: And that <hi>more</hi> good is not produced may be owing, not to any <hi>defect</hi> in the laws, but to a <hi>miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe</hi> of them by his creatures: for which <hi>they</hi> are anſwerable, and not the <hi>Deity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this is particularly worthy of conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with reſpect to our world; which is not in the ſtate <hi>now,</hi> that <hi>God</hi> originally made it, but abounding with <hi>evils,</hi> introduced by <hi>ourſelves,</hi> againſt the manifeſt <hi>tendency</hi> of thoſe laws which he was pleaſed to eſtabliſh, in order to effect its <hi>greater good,</hi> ſo far as it could reaſonably and wiſely be done. And that this end is not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, is wholly chargeable to that <hi>abuſe</hi>
               <pb n="69" facs="unknown:018397_0067_0FA70CDBB4DE4570"/>
of our faculties, whereby we have perverted the <hi>tendency</hi> of thoſe laws, which would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe have operated to its taking effect. It is impoſſible therefore we ſhould judge fairly of the <hi>Creator's benevolence,</hi> from a view only of our world, under its preſent <hi>actual enjoyments</hi>: But if we would form right ſentiments of it, we muſt conſider the <hi>tendency</hi> of the Divine ſcheme of operation, and what the ſtate of the world would have been, if the <hi>rational</hi> and <hi>moral</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in it had acted up to the <hi>laws of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and given them full ſcope to operate for the production of good. This will give us the idea of <hi>good,</hi> in ſome meaſure, anſwering the <hi>plan</hi> of it, in the Divine mind. Every other view of it, ſeparate from this, will be either <hi>partial,</hi> or <hi>falſe,</hi> and fall ſhort of exhibiting to us the true character of the <hi>Deity</hi> as <hi>benevolent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>laſt</hi> remark, though not the leaſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant, is, that, in judging of the Divine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence, we muſt carry our thoughts beyond the <hi>preſent</hi> to ſome <hi>future</hi> ſtate of exiſtence, and conſider them as <hi>connected</hi> in the Divine <hi>plan</hi> of operation for good. Was <hi>death</hi> the entire de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of all the <hi>intelligent moral</hi> beings that have exiſted, or will exiſt, on this earth, it would be <hi>difficult,</hi> I may ſay <hi>impoſſible,</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain the thought, that the Creator was <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent,</hi> in the ſenſe we are pleading for. And one of the reaſons, why ſome are ſo ready to call in queſtion his <hi>abſolutely perfect</hi> goodneſs, is their looking upon the <hi>preſent</hi> ſtate, in an

            <p>And it is the rather proper, in arguing about the <hi>Deity's benevolence,</hi> to take into conſideration <hi>another ſtate</hi> of exiſtence, becauſe this is the thought we are muſt obviouſly led to, even from <hi>preſent</hi> appearances themſelves; which carries, in their nature the evident marks, not of a <hi>compleated</hi> plan of operation, but of one that is depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent on ſomething <hi>ſtill to come</hi> to render it <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</hi> Though there is enough viſible, in the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent</hi> ſtate, to give us an idea of the Supreme Being, as proſecuting a <hi>ſcheme for good</hi>; yet there are, at the ſame time, plain diſcoveries that the ſcheme is but <hi>begun,</hi> that what we now ſee is only a part of it carried into execution, and that what is wanting to finiſh it, is to be looked for in ſome <hi>future</hi> ſtate of exiſtence.

            <p>Having briefly mentioned theſe previous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks, the way is now clear to the <hi>main point,</hi> which is to make it evident, that the <hi>appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of good,</hi> in our world, are ſuch as fairly lead us to conceive of the Supreme <hi>Creator</hi> as <hi>abſolutely</hi> and <hi>perfectly benevolent.</hi> I do not mean, that the <hi>preſent actual amount</hi> of theſe appearances is <hi>ſo much good</hi> as will anſwer to the idea of <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely perfect benevolence</hi>: But what I intend is, that they ariſe from <hi>ſuch laws,</hi> and are ſo <hi>circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced</hi> and <hi>related,</hi> as that, in this view of them (as has been explained above) we may clearly and fully argue, that the original author of them is <hi>ſupremely</hi> and <hi>infinitely good.</hi>

This would be beyond the reach of my ability, and a <hi>needleſs</hi> labor. It will be a ſufficient enforcement of the preſent argument, if <hi>ſo much</hi> is ſaid as to make it plain, that <hi>all the good,</hi> ſuitable for <hi>ſuch a ſyſtem as this,</hi> is apparently the <hi>tendency of nature,</hi> and the <hi>Divine adminiſtration</hi>; and that it <hi>actually</hi> prevails ſo far as <hi>this tendency</hi> is not <hi>perverted</hi> by the creatures themſelves, whom <hi>God</hi> has made; for which <hi>he</hi> is not anſwerable, as has been hinted already, and will be more fully ſhown hereafter.</p>
            <p>The way in which I ſhall endeavour to il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate this important ſubject ſhall be, by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, in the firſt place, ſome <hi>general</hi> touches on the <hi>viſible frame of inanimate nature</hi>; then by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſome <hi>tranſient</hi> notice of the <hi>inferior crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> made capable of happineſs; and finally by viewing more <hi>critically</hi> and <hi>fully</hi> the <hi>intelligent moral</hi> beings, in this world, towards whom the Divine goodneſs has been diſplayed, in the <hi>largeſt</hi> meaſures.</p>
            <p>We ſhall begin our illuſtration of the preſent argument, with ſome <hi>general</hi> touches on the <hi>viſible frame of inanimate nature,</hi> and the <hi>pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of goodneſs</hi> to which it is ſubſervient.

<pb n="77" facs="unknown:018397_0075_0FA70CE3F9CE2438"/>
the eaſe and freedom of motion upon the earth, without which life itſelf had been beſtowed to little purpoſe: It is this that communicates ſound, without which we could not have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed our thoughts to one another, by the help of ſpeech; not to ſay any thing of the pleaſure, in various kinds, which reſults from the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony there is between one ſound and another: It is this that gives riſe to the <hi>wind,</hi> which mixes and tempers the exhalations interſperſed in the atmoſphere, corrects the heat in hotter climates, and carries the clouds, from place to place, to diſtill the rain that is needed: And, in a word, it is this that preſerves life, by the power of <hi>breathing,</hi> in all creatures, from the higheſt to the loweſt: And to this it is alſo ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ſo many claſes of creatures, by the help of ſuitable organs, are able to wing their way threugh the regions above, aſcending to the tops of mountains, and tall trees, where they find both nouriſhment and ſhelter.—The proper re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection from all which is, that the <hi>benevolent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity</hi> could not have better adapted <hi>inanimate na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> for the diffuſion of good.

            <p>The <hi>diſpoſition of material nature,</hi> I know, has been objected to, and complaints made, becauſe its parts were not better adjuſted. But the

more accurately theſe complaints have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined, the more groundleſs they have always appeared. Is it complained, that there are <hi>too wide ſeas</hi>? It has been made evident, by the beſt obſervations, that the proportion between the <hi>ſea</hi> and <hi>dry-land</hi> could not have been ſettled with greater exactneſs, for the ſupply of that moiſture which is neceſſary to render the earth fruitful. Is it complained, that the water in the ſea is <hi>ſalt?</hi> This was a neceſſary quality to keep it from <hi>putrefaction.</hi> And beſides, it loſes this quality, before the exhalations from it fall in rain, or, by being condenſed on the tops of mountains, are formed into ſprings whether for the ſervice of the earth it ſelf, or the creatures that are on it. Is it complained, that the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the earth is too unequal? Some ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality was abſolutely requiſite in order to guard againſt inundations from the <hi>ſea</hi>: Nor is that inequality <hi>uſeleſs</hi> which makes even the higheſt mountains; for theſe are the ſources of ſprings, to the great benefit of all living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: And, in their bowels, are contained thoſe <hi>minerals</hi> and <hi>metals,</hi> which are ſo advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous to mankind. In a word, there is nothing in the <hi>order</hi> or <hi>diſpoſition</hi> of the parts of this earth that can juſtly be complained of; as is evident from this, that, if we do but make an alteration in our thoughts, and purſue it in its conſequences, we ſhall ſoon ſee our own folly. There is not indeed any part of <hi>inanimate na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> but what ſerves to ſhew forth the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor's

            <p>We go on, in the next place, to take a tranſient view of the <hi>animal</hi> world, in which I include <hi>all</hi> the creatures, on this earth, endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with <hi>perception</hi> and <hi>life,</hi> mankind only except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And I thus diſtinguiſh them from man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, calling them animal, not becauſe I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they exiſt without ſome <hi>ſuperior principle</hi> of the <hi>ſame kind</hi> with the <hi>higheſt</hi> principle in <hi>men</hi>; but becauſe, if they do poſſeſs ſuch a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, it is in <hi>ſo low a degree</hi> as to render it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper to rank them with <hi>intelligent,</hi> much more with <hi>moral</hi> beings, as <hi>men</hi> are.

<pb n="81" facs="unknown:018397_0079_0FA70CE91FCA4670"/>
againſt the injuries, to which they are more pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly expoſed. And, in conſequence of this proviſion, the <hi>general tendency</hi> of their nature is to <hi>good</hi>: And they actually enjoy a great <hi>over-balance</hi> of it. So far as we are acquainted with them, inſtead of going on heavily with life, they give plain indications that it is comfortable and pleaſant to them. And, from what we know of our own <hi>animal</hi> frame, ſo analogous, in many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, to their's, we have ſufficient reaſon to believe, that life, under the circumſtances in which they hold it, is accompanied with many gratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> rendering it infinitely preferable to <hi>non-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor does it argue any want of goodneſs in the <hi>Deity,</hi> that they are not <hi>all equally happy,</hi> or that they none of them enjoy that <hi>degree</hi> of happineſs which is common to other beings of a <hi>ſuperior order.</hi> It is enough to the purpoſe of the preſent argument, if <hi>ſo much happineſs</hi> is allotted to them, as is proper to creatures in their <hi>ſtate,</hi> and filling up <hi>ſuch</hi> a <hi>place</hi> in the ſcale of beings. This is all that can be reaſonably look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, in order to a <hi>perfect diſplay</hi> of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor's benevolence.</p>
            <p>Neither are the <hi>inconveniences</hi> they may <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally</hi> be liable to, an <hi>objection</hi> of any weight. For as their ſtructure is <hi>material,</hi> (at leaſt ſo far as it is ſo) they are, from their very <hi>make,</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to the ſame <hi>general laws</hi> which take place in the <hi>material</hi> world. And i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="82" facs="unknown:018397_0080_0FA70CEA065E6EA0"/>
be liable to inconveniences. And <hi>unavoidable</hi> inconveniences are not to be mentioned, as <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtencies</hi> with the <hi>moſt perfect</hi> benevolence; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it can firſt be proved, that no ſyſtem ought to be made, nor laws eſtabliſhed, but what are <hi>abſolutely</hi> freed from them: Which perhaps may not be the caſe, with reſpect to any ſyſtem, in the whole circle of exiſting nature.</p>
            <p>It is a ſtill further manifeſtation of the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator's goodneſs towards theſe <hi>inferior kinds,</hi> that he has contrived to make them, in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, <hi>uſeful to one another.</hi> Perhaps, they are ſo claſſed into ſorts, as that they not only fill up the creation, but, at the ſame time, do it ſo a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There may be an eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed <hi>general relation</hi> between all the ſpecies of inferior creatures, in conſequence of which the <hi>particular intereſts</hi> of the ſeveral kinds, inſtead of <hi>interfering,</hi> are mutually ſubſervient to each other. This is undoubtedly the truth of fact, in many inſtances. Several of the <hi>lower</hi> kinds are ſerviceable to the <hi>ſuperior</hi>: And it looks as though they were purpoſely placed in ſuch a <hi>ſubordination</hi> to this end. Nay, ſome of the <hi>higheſt</hi> animal ſpecies are, in like manner, uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to <hi>mankind</hi>: And they ſeem to have had this degree <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="83" facs="unknown:018397_0081_0FA70CEC1FC141D8"/>There is certainly a <hi>bond of union</hi> eſtabliſhed between the <hi>individuals of every ſpecies.</hi> As they have ſome inſtincts determining them to their <hi>own private good,</hi> ſo have they others that unite them to their <hi>reſpective kinds.</hi> They diſlike ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and diſcover pleaſure in the company of each other. Some live together in flocks, ſeem un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy when ſeparated, and will run ventures that they may get <hi>aſſociated</hi> with their ſpecies. And there is univerſally a <hi>ſtrong affection</hi> in the <hi>fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males</hi> towards their <hi>young.</hi> They are urged on by their natural STORGEE, not only to exert themſelves in providing for their ſuſtenance, but in ſecuring them againſt danger. They will riſque their own eaſe, and engage in combats for the ſake of their young; expoſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to greater extremities on <hi>their account,</hi> than their own. Even the moſt <hi>ſavage</hi> animals are <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate</hi> to their <hi>offspring</hi>; and will take care of them with all deſirable tenderneſs.</p>
            <p>It is readily acknowledged, the <hi>inſtincts</hi> by which <hi>individuals</hi> are attached to their own kinds are not ſo ſtrong, but that they may be <hi>miſcheivous</hi> to one another; and the <hi>relation</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>ſeveral ſpecies</hi> may be ſtill more looſe, inſomuch that it may ſeem as though <hi>ſome kinds</hi> were rather <hi>deſtructive,</hi> than <hi>beneficial,</hi> to other kinds. But this notwithſtanding, <hi>indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals</hi> may exiſt with reſpect to their <hi>own kinds,</hi> and the <hi>ſeveral kinds</hi> with reſpect to <hi>each other,</hi> in the beſt manner it was <hi>poſſible</hi> they ſhould, in order to their conſpiring, as <hi>parts,</hi> to promote
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:018397_0082_0FA70CEC481FDD50"/>
the <hi>common</hi> happineſs. And if ſome inſtances of a contrary aſpect, to ſuch ſhort-ſighted crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as we are, could be mentioned, it ought not to be eſteemed a <hi>counter-balance</hi> to what is <hi>ſo evidently the general tendency</hi> of the <hi>animal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution.</hi> It becomes us, in ſuch caſes, to take care how we raſhly cenſure the <hi>benevolent Deity</hi>; eſpecially, if it be conſidered, that <hi>detachea in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances</hi> may have the <hi>appearance</hi> of <hi>evil,</hi> to our imperfect view; while yet, in their connection, they may be <hi>good.</hi> And as <hi>good</hi> is ſo apparently the <hi>general tendency,</hi> we have ſufficient reaſon, from hence, to think that this is the <hi>real truth,</hi> with reſpect to theſe <hi>ſpecial inſtances</hi>; unleſs we could clearly prove the contrary. In order whereto,</p>
            <p>It is pleaded, I know, that ſome <hi>animal kinds live on others,</hi> to the intire deſtruction of their <hi>being</hi> and <hi>happineſs.</hi> But this notwithſtanding, they may, in the wiſeſt manner, be <hi>uſeful</hi> to one another; and even this very <hi>objection</hi> may be a ſtrong evidence of it. It is true, the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of life</hi> will follow, if ſome animals are <hi>food</hi> to others. But it may be true alſo, that there could not have been <hi>ſo much</hi> life, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently happineſs, in the creation, had i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> not been for this expedient. Perhaps, <hi>ſo many kinds</hi> of creatures as now exiſt, and it was neceſſary ſhould exiſt in order to fill up this ſyſtem, could not, in any other <hi>eſtabliſhed way,</hi> have been <hi>ſupported in being.</hi> And if it was neceſſary, as we cannot ſay it was not, in order to the <hi>main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:018397_0083_0FA70CECF5196628"/>
of life,</hi> in ſuch a <hi>variety</hi> of kinds, that it ſhould be upheld, by a <hi>ſucceſſion</hi> of individuals in each kind, and not by the <hi>continued exiſtence</hi> of the <hi>ſame</hi> individuals, we are, at once, let into the <hi>wiſdom</hi> and <hi>goodneſs,</hi> not only of the <hi>general law</hi> ſubjecting all animals to <hi>death</hi>; but of that <hi>more limited</hi> one alſo, according to which <hi>ſome ſpecies live upon others.</hi> The ſcheme, in this view of it, is certainly intended for <hi>good</hi>: And <hi>more good,</hi> upon the whole, may be communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated in <hi>this,</hi> than any other way. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is ſo far from arguing a <hi>defect</hi> of bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence in the <hi>Deity,</hi> that it is a ſtrong illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it. Beſides, we know not the <hi>intire plan</hi> of heaven, with reference to the <hi>animal</hi> world. Perhaps, their <hi>preſent</hi> exiſtence is only an intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction to ſomething further. It may poſſibly be the <hi>firſt</hi> ſtage of their being, and a <hi>ſtep</hi> to ſome <hi>other</hi> ſtate, this may be previouſly neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to fit them for. And as we are able to ſee but a little way into the deſign of the <hi>Deity,</hi> with reſpect to theſe <hi>inferior</hi> creatures; and yet, are at no loſs, from what we do ſee, certainly to determine that it is a deſign <hi>tending to good</hi>: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of complaining that it is not a <hi>better contriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſcheme,</hi> we have reaſon rather to look upon it as the <hi>beſt in its kind,</hi> and to believe that it will turn out ſo, in the final reſult of its operation.— To proceed,</p>
            <p>The moſt important head of argument, in the preſent debate, is the <hi>conſtitution</hi> and <hi>government</hi> of the <hi>intellectual</hi> and <hi>moral</hi> world; by which
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:018397_0084_0FA70CEDB4BB1988"/>
I mean <hi>ourſelves,</hi> the <hi>higheſt order</hi> of beings it has pleaſed <hi>God</hi> to place on this earth, and that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der towards which he has made the <hi>largeſt</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plays of his benevolence.</p>
            <p>And there is one thing <hi>peculiar</hi> in our <hi>conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> which it may be proper to give a <hi>general</hi> touch upon, before we come to <hi>particulars.</hi> What I ſpeak of as thus <hi>peculiar,</hi> and worthy of notice, is our <hi>compound make</hi>; in conſequence of which we are partly <hi>animal,</hi> and partly <hi>rational,</hi> being allied both to the <hi>higheſt,</hi> and the <hi>loweſt</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of beings in the univerſe. And the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving us <hi>this conſtitution</hi> is an illuſtrious inſtance of the Divine goodneſs, and naturally leads us to conceive of the <hi>Deity</hi> as <hi>abſolutely</hi> and <hi>perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> benevolent.</p>
            <p>It may indeed ſeem, at firſt view, as though there was an argument rather proving the <hi>imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> than <hi>perfection</hi> of the <hi>Deity's benevolence.</hi> But it is far otherwiſe. For it is by means of this <hi>compound</hi> make, that <hi>inanimate nature</hi> is not only <hi>enjoyed</hi> but <hi>perceived</hi> to have <hi>beauty</hi> and <hi>order,</hi> and to be a contrivance worthy of the Supreme Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. The <hi>inferior kinds</hi> are variouſly capable of a <hi>lower</hi> ſort of happineſs, from their relation to, and ſituation in, this material world: But this is all.

creatures, to diſcern the wiſdom, and power, and benevolence, of the <hi>Deity,</hi> herein diſplayed. And it is from hence alſo, that we become capable of that <hi>more noble</hi> happineſs, which is the reſult of the exerciſe of <hi>reaſon</hi> upon the <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> of the <hi>material</hi> world, and the adjuſtment of bodily organs thereto, ſo as to occaſion ſo much <hi>ſenſitive</hi> pleaſure. In a word, if there had not been ſome order of beings, like us, of a <hi>compound</hi> make, who were, at once, qualified for enjoyment from this <hi>material</hi> world, and for <hi>perceiving,</hi> in ſome meaſure, the connections and dependencies by means whereof this is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed: I ſay, if there had not been ſome ſuch order of creatures, this <hi>material</hi> world muſt have been <hi>comparatively loſt.</hi> No honor would, in an <hi>active</hi> way, have been reflected on the <hi>Deity</hi>; and little, very little, of that happineſs would have been enjoyed, which there is now a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per foundation laid for, according to the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed courſe and order of nature. So that <hi>ſuch a conſtitution</hi> as our's ſeems to have been ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in order to a <hi>compleat</hi> diſplay of that <hi>good,</hi> this <hi>material</hi> world was fitted to produce: And it looks as though it <hi>was principally</hi> made with a view to us <hi>men,</hi> and that the <hi>inferior</hi> crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, in their <hi>various kinds,</hi> were formed for the prevention of <hi>needleſs voids,</hi> and to <hi>fill up</hi> this ſyſtem: To which purpoſe they are admirably fitted, as, by their gradual and inſenſible ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they make it the <hi>beſt coherent whole,</hi> in its kind.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="88" facs="unknown:018397_0086_0FA70CEF4E326A28"/>It is not pleaded, that we are, by this <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound</hi> make, the <hi>moſt perfect</hi> beings that can be brought into exiſtence: Neither is this neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary in order to the <hi>moſt perfect</hi> diſplay of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence. It is ſufficient, if by this make, we are fitted for the world to which we are more eſpecially related, and rendered capable of <hi>as much happineſs</hi> as is proper for beings in our <hi>ſituation,</hi> and bearing <hi>ſuch a part</hi> in the <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral plan</hi> for the manifeſtation of good.</p>
            <p>Neither is it pretended, that this <hi>compound</hi> conſtitution is not liable to <hi>inconveniences.</hi> For, ſo far as we are <hi>material,</hi> be the matter of which we are made what it will, or our bodily orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nization what it will, we muſt of courſe be ſubject to thoſe <hi>laws,</hi> by which the <hi>material</hi> world we are related to, is governed.

            <p>And ſo I proceed to a <hi>diſtinct</hi> conſideration of <hi>both parts</hi> of our frame, in order the more fully to illuſtrate the <hi>Divine benevolence</hi> from its diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plays towards <hi>us,</hi> the <hi>higheſt</hi> order of beings in this ſyſtem.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>lower part</hi> firſt preſents itſelf to view: As to which, we are allied to the <hi>inferior</hi> kinds, and partake, in common, with them, of a <hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily organization,</hi> rendering us capable of pleaſure,

in various ways: Though we are highly ſet above them, even with reſpect to this our <hi>ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal</hi> part. Its exterior form has greatly the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence</hi>; as bearing the evident marks of ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior beauty and majeſty. And the ſame may be ſaid of its ſeveral <hi>members</hi>; which are fitted for a much greater diverſity of uſeful exerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Beſides, it is endowed with ſome powers, which they are deſtitute of: Such is the power of ſpeech; and ſuch are the powers of <hi>perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beauty</hi> and <hi>harmony</hi> in the objects of <hi>ſight</hi> and of hearing: All which are rich ſources of <hi>good,</hi> and adminiſter unſpeakably to the <hi>benefit,</hi> and <hi>delight,</hi> of life. The advantage, it is true, would, in ſome reſpects, have been on the ſide of the creatures <hi>below</hi> us, had not the union of <hi>reaſon</hi> with <hi>ſenſe,</hi> in our conſtitution, turned the ſcale in our favour. They have a quicker ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacity, with reſpect to the things which belong to their preſervation and ſafety. They ſurpaſs us, at leaſt many of them, in the natural firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their make, whereby they are better fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to endure hardſhips. They can more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily provide themſelves with the means of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence, not being called to that labor and pains, which nature has made neceſſary for us. And they ſooner come to an ability to ſhift for themſelves. And this <hi>diſpoſition</hi> of things is juſt as it might be expected it would be, upon the ſcheme of <hi>perfect benevolence.</hi> For, the giving thoſe creatures the advantage, in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſe reſpects, is, on the one hand, a <hi>ſit</hi> diſplay of

goodneſs towards them; as they have only their <hi>appetites</hi> and <hi>inſtincts,</hi> with a <hi>low degree of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> at moſt, to guide and direct them: And, on the other hand, it is no evidence of any <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi> of goodneſs towards us, becauſe being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with reaſon and underſtanding, in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively high degree, the <hi>advantage,</hi> by this means, turns greatly on our ſide; as indeed it ought to do. If they have a ſtronger ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal ſagacity, our larger degree of reaſon is more than a balance for it. If they are, any of them, more robuſt in their make, we are notwithſtanding better able, by the help of our reaſon, to guard ourſelves, than <hi>nature</hi> has guarded them. If they are ſupported with leſs care, we, by the exerciſe of reaſon, can make our greater care a pleaſure, and, by means of it, bring in a much richer ſupply for the comfort of life. And if it is in a more gradual and leiſurely way, that we come to the uſe of our animal powers, we can, by the help of reaſon, make them more extenſively uſeful afterwards, by employing them to a vaſtly greater variety of good purpoſes. Beſides, our animal frame is originally made for a <hi>longer</hi> duration; and the time required in order to its coming to its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſtate, may be, in the beſt manner, adjuſted thereto. And further, as we are deſigned for <hi>intellectual</hi> and <hi>moral,</hi> as well as animal growth, this method of coming to <hi>maturity,</hi> by <hi>ſlow</hi> and <hi>gradual</hi> ſteps, may be the moſt <hi>ſuitable one</hi> to promote theſe <hi>ſeveral intentions,</hi> as united in the ſame conſtitution.</p>

               <pb n="91" facs="unknown:018397_0089_0FA70CF50DAEF9B8"/>So that there is no compariſon between the <hi>inferior</hi> creatures, and us <hi>men.</hi> We have much the advantage of them: At leaſt, we are quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to turn the balance in our own favour. For it is in our power, by the help of our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, to render our <hi>animal life</hi> far more eaſy and happy, by guarding it againſt inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; by providing for it neceſſaries; by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſifying its pleaſures; by multiplying its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights; and by refining and exalting its en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments, in a variety of ways, not within the reach of their capacities.</p>
            <p>But we have conſidered as yet only that <hi>low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſort</hi> of happineſs we are furniſhed for, by means of our <hi>animal</hi> make. This, it is true, is <hi>very conſiderable</hi>: And mankind have <hi>ſuch</hi> an opinion of it, if we may gueſs at their thoughts by their practice. For <hi>ſenſual</hi> pleaſures are the great object of their purſuit. Too many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge to them, as though they were deſigned for no higher happineſs. Our fault indeed is, not that we have no value for <hi>animal</hi> gratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, but that we value them too highly, and place too much of our happineſs in them; as they contain only the <hi>loweſt</hi> ſort of good we are fitted for the enjoyment of, by means of our <hi>animal</hi> part. For it is to be remmembered,</p>
            <p>That a great proportion, even of that happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which is proper to us, as <hi>intelligent</hi> and <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> agents, <hi>originates</hi> in our <hi>animal</hi> frame, which <hi>fits</hi> us, by its various well adjuſted organs, to have communication with the <hi>material</hi> world,
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:018397_0090_0FA70CF5891E3E68"/>
in a certain ſtated way, eſtabliſhed by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of nature. How many of our ideas are we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden to our <hi>ſenſes</hi> for? They are indeed the <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary</hi> inlets to the materials of knowledge, the true foundation of all <hi>intellectual</hi> happineſs. It is from hence, in a great meaſure, that our reaſon, imagination, invention, and other <hi>mental</hi> pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, are ſupplied with objects, which not only employ their <hi>exerciſe,</hi> but yield thoſe various pleaſures which vaſtly ſurpaſs the higheſt animal delights. Nay, even the <hi>ſocial</hi> and <hi>moral</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs we are formed for, takes riſe, in part at leaſt, from our <hi>animal</hi> nature, by means of which we become <hi>viſible</hi> to, and <hi>converſible</hi> with, each other, and capable of interchanging thoſe vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous offices of juſtice, and kindneſs, and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, which chiefly lay the foundation for thoſe <hi>moral</hi> and <hi>ſocial</hi> pleaſures, which are the moſt <hi>refined</hi> and <hi>exalted</hi> we are made capable of enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Nor, unleſs we had poſſeſſed ſuch <hi>materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi> bodies, could there have been thoſe ways of communion with one another which now take place, or thoſe occaſions for helping and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing each other, which ſo frequently ariſe from our preſent conſtitution, and give ſo large a ſcope for <hi>ſocial</hi> and <hi>moral exerciſes,</hi> and thoſe ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blime pleaſures which are the reſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And it is this view of the <hi>inferior part</hi> of our conſtitution, that gives us the <hi>true</hi> and <hi>full</hi> idea of its <hi>main</hi> deſign and uſe. We ſhould enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain but a poor low thought of our <hi>bodily organi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation,</hi> if we looked upon it as contrived for no higher an end, than meer <hi>animal</hi> gratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. It was proper indeed, for many rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that it ſhould be furniſhed, as it really is, for this kind of pleaſure: But the great thing aimed at, by the <hi>Deity,</hi> in employing ſo much ſkill in adjuſting the ſtructure of our bodies, was, that he might fit us, by this means, for ſuch a communication with <hi>material nature,</hi> as might <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I may properly add to what has hitherto been ſaid, that the <hi>Deity's benevolence,</hi> with reſpect to our <hi>inferior part,</hi> is conſpicuous, not only in the <hi>poſitive good</hi> he has fitted it to be the means of to the <hi>mind,</hi> but in the care he has alſo taken to <hi>ſecure it againſt inconveniences.</hi> It may poſſibly be thought, that <hi>perfect goodneſs</hi> would have <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely</hi>
               <pb n="94" facs="unknown:018397_0092_0FA70CF6B2EB89A8"/>
freed our <hi>bodies</hi> from <hi>all inconveniences</hi> whatſoever. But this may be only a miſtake of our own. It is certain, in point of fact, that <hi>that</hi> bodily organization, whereby we are fitted for the perception of good, is liable to be <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered,</hi> yea, <hi>deſtroyed,</hi> in numberleſs ways: Nor can we ſay, that it was <hi>poſſible,</hi> in the nature of things, <hi>abſolutely</hi> to have <hi>ſecured</hi> it from this <hi>liableneſs to diſturbance.</hi> All therefore that can, with reaſon, be required of the <hi>Deity,</hi> upon the ſcheme of <hi>perfect benevolence,</hi> is, that he ſhould provide for the <hi>ſecurity</hi> of our <hi>animal-ſtructure</hi> againſt <hi>miſchief,</hi> in the beſt manner that was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the operation of thoſe <hi>laws,</hi> he has eſtabliſhed for the diſplays of his goodneſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards this ſyſtem. And this, ſo far as we are able to judge, he has actually done; partly, by putting it in our power to contrive ſuitable methods for our own ſafety; and partly, by planting within us a <hi>variouſly modified</hi> principle of <hi>ſelf-preſervation,</hi> urging us on to avoid every thing that we apprehend will be <hi>hurtful</hi> to us: But principally, by annexing the <hi>ſenſation of pain</hi> to thoſe touches upon our <hi>bodily mechaniſm,</hi> which tend to <hi>diſturb</hi> its <hi>order</hi>; hereby rouſing the principle of <hi>ſelf-love,</hi> and putting us upon the moſt effectual exertions in order to our own ſecurity. And wherein could the <hi>Deity</hi> have contrived better for our being guarded againſt miſchief? I know indeed that the very <hi>capacity of perceiving pain</hi> is urged as an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt the <hi>benevolence</hi> of the <hi>Deity</hi>: But
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:018397_0093_0FA70CF7A9360C80"/>
with nothing more than the bare ſhadow of reaſon. For it is a <hi>moſt uſeful</hi> capacity. Even the principle of <hi>ſelf-preſervation,</hi> with all its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendages from the <hi>body,</hi> and aſſiſtances from the <hi>mind,</hi> would have been <hi>eſſentially defective,</hi> was it not for this additional <hi>ſtimulus</hi>: Nor is it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable, how we could have been, in any tolerable meaſure, ſecured it from danger, without ſome ſuch <hi>expedient</hi> as this. Some <hi>warning</hi> ſeems to have been abſolutely neceſſary, eſpecially to creatures, whoſe knowledge of the <hi>material world,</hi> and its capacity to do them <hi>hurt</hi> as well as good, is not <hi>intuitive,</hi> but <hi>gradual</hi> and <hi>experimental</hi>; as it is beſt it ſhould be for many reaſons: Some of which we may have occaſion to mention here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after: I ſay, ſome <hi>warning</hi> of the miſchiefs we are expoſed to, in ſuch a world as this, was neceſſary: And what more proper one than <hi>that,</hi> which makes <hi>every thing hurtful at the ſame time painful</hi>? What warning ſhort of this would have been effectual to have anſwered the purpoſed end? Notwithſtanding the <hi>new force</hi> or <hi>ſtimulus,</hi> herefrom awakening the principle of <hi>ſelf-preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> we are careleſs enough in guarding our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt even thoſe things which we know to be <hi>hurtful,</hi> by <hi>feeling</hi> that they are <hi>painful.</hi> And was it not for the <hi>ſenſation of pain,</hi> which we are ſo ready to complain of as inconſiſtent with goodneſs, in the <hi>Creator,</hi> we ſhould not enjoy any happineſs in compariſon with what we do now. It is this that rouſes our attention to guard ourſelves againſt thoſe external objects

that may cauſe wounds and bruiſes, or in any other way do miſchief to our bodies: It is this that minds us of the neceſſity of food and ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So that the <hi>ſenſation of pain</hi> is a noble contrivance for <hi>good,</hi> and ſtrongly argues <hi>benevolence</hi> in the <hi>Creator,</hi> rather than the contrary. It is indeed the <hi>grand ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient</hi> to prevent thoſe <hi>inconveniences,</hi> which, had it not been for this contrivance, muſt have been <hi>inevitable.</hi> And as to thoſe that are ſo, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this proviſion of nature, ſuch as the <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of our animal frame,</hi> and thoſe <hi>diſorders we are naturally ſubjected to,</hi> we ſhall particularly take notice of them, hereafter, in a more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place.</p>

Some conception we may frame of this, from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of <hi>words</hi> out of the <hi>letters</hi> of the alpha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet. <hi>Theſe,</hi> though few in number, are yet ſufficient for the formation of <hi>words without end</hi>: Which words are again capable of being placed in ſuch poſitions, with reſpect to each other, as to be proper ſigns for the conveyance of all manner of truths to the mind.

with almoſt an infinite variety. So extenſive is the <hi>ground work</hi> laid by thoſe powers of <hi>ſenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> and <hi>reflection,</hi> for acquirements in <hi>knowledge,</hi> and <hi>mental pleaſure</hi> the conſequence therefrom.</p>
            <p>The <hi>other ſort</hi> of faculties, or thoſe which qualify us for the uſe of theſe <hi>materials</hi> of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, are ſuch as theſe.</p>
            <p>The firſt is, the mind's ability to lay up the ideas it has received, in either of the above ways, as it were, in ſtore for uſe afterwards, with a readineſs to revive them, without the preſence of external objects, or the help of thoſe inward reflections, by which they were at firſt occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. This is done by the <hi>memory</hi>; which is a neceſſary faculty. For, the mind not being ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of attending to many ideas at once, we ſhould have been but poorly qualified for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency in knowledge, had we not been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with a power to <hi>recall</hi> ideas into view, as we might have occaſion for them, after they had lain out of ſight. And this ability we are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly furniſhed with: Nor is it a meer <hi>paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive</hi> one; but dependant, in a good meaſure, on the <hi>will.</hi> It is true formerly in printed ideas will ſometimes obtr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>de themſelves upon the mind, and come undeſired to the view of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding: But this notwithſtanding, the mind can of <hi>choice</hi> lay up ideas; and is able to a good degree, as it <hi>pleaſes,</hi> to recall them. It can, on purpoſe, employ itſelf this way: And the readineſs, with which it often revives the perception of paſt ideas, is really aſtoniſhing.—
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:018397_0099_0FA70B9AB3AC1A88"/>
I need not ſay any thing to point out the <hi>uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs</hi> of this faculty, and the mighty help it is fitted to afford us in <hi>intellectual</hi> acquirements. Were we not thus furniſhed, we ſhould neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily be confined to <hi>preſent</hi> ideas, as they might happen, in a <hi>paſſive</hi> way, to be excited in our minds: Whereas now we have it in our power to employ our thoughts on any of thoſe ideas which have, at any time, been imprinted on our minds, as we are <hi>pleaſed</hi> to call for them, in the purſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>it of <hi>intellectual</hi> happineſs. And what an unſpeakable advantage is this? It not only makes the way to knowledge much eaſier and quicker than it could otherwiſe have been; but greatly enlarges the capacity for it, by laying a proper foundation in our nature for very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable attainments in this kind.</p>
            <p>Another power is <hi>diſcernment</hi>; by which I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand an ability to <hi>diſtinguiſh</hi> ideas from one another, according to the real difference there is between them. And a very important fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty this is. Witho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t it the former faculties would be, in a manner, uſeleſs. It is not meerly the power of receiving ideas, or the power of recalling them into view after their diſappear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, that would have been ſufficient for attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in knowledge. A faculty to <hi>diſcriminate</hi> them from one another was further neceſſary: Nor otherwiſe would our thoughts have been any other than ſo many conf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſed ideas. What we call <hi>judgment</hi> is chiefly dependant on this faculty. It conſiſts in the mind's readineſs to
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:018397_0100_0FA70B9EC6652178"/>
diſcern the difference there is between ideas: And the more nicely and accurately it is able to diſtinguiſh them, the better and more perfect is the judgment. It is owing to this faculty that ideas lie clear and determinate in the mind; and by the help of it we are not only preſerved from perplexity in our notions, but from miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes alſo, ariſing from a ſeeming likeneſs in ideas when they really differ. It is, in ſhort, in conſequence of this faculty, that we are able to reaſon clearly and ſolidly, ſetting before our own view, and the view of others, the evidence of truth in a ſtrong and ſatisfactory p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>int of light. The <hi>uſefulneſs</hi> of this faculty may be learned from thoſe <hi>perceptions of truth,</hi> which have taken riſe from it, to the increaſe of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, in ſo many inſtances, redounding ſo greatly to the benefit of mankind.</p>
            <p>Another power the mind is furniſhed with, is that of <hi>compounding, enlarging,</hi> and <hi>diminiſhing,</hi> the ideas that have been let into it: By means whereof it is capable, in a ſenſe, of making <hi>new objects</hi> of perception, by preſenting to the view of the underſtanding the <hi>original</hi> ideas, received by <hi>ſenſation</hi> or <hi>reflection,</hi> in <hi>new complex forms</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out end. In conſequence of this <hi>compounding</hi> power, we become, as it were, <hi>Creators</hi>; being able to frame images at our pleaſure, hereby <hi>mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying</hi> the objects of thought, and giving occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for infinitely various <hi>new perceptions,</hi> accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with pleaſure, we muſt otherwiſe have been ſtrangers to. The <hi>imagination</hi> is chiefly
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:018397_0101_0FA70BA1B6CB5800"/>
employed in this work of making <hi>new complex</hi> ideas. It is able indeed, with quickneſs and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacity, to revive former images; but its power lies principally in framing <hi>new forms</hi> or <hi>ſpecies,</hi> which exiſt only in conception. And a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful faculty it is to this purpoſe. How admirably quick is it in its operations? How ſuddenly can it unite and blend together the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſt diſtant ideas, varying them from their ſimple origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, and ſetting them before the mind with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite diverſity? This power, it is true, is pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly liable to <hi>abuſe.</hi> It may be proſtituted to vain and baſe purpoſes. It may be debaſed with mean images, or polluted with vicious ones. But yet, it is in itſelf a noble capacity: And had we not been endowed with it, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe excellent productions of art and genius would never have had a being, which are ſo variouſly fitted, both for the ſervice of life, and the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of the mind.</p>
            <p>A ſtill more uſeful power is that whereby we are enabled to aſſemble ideas in <hi>various poſitions</hi> and <hi>arrangements,</hi> in order to <hi>compare</hi> them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and view them in the <hi>reſpects</hi> and <hi>relations</hi> they bear to each other. It is owing to this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty that we perceive <hi>new truths.</hi> For every different <hi>juxta poſition</hi> of ideas exhibit to the mind ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>me agreement or diſagreement it was not before acquainted with, and opens to its view ſome <hi>new diſcovery.</hi> This faculty, as employed in finding <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t new truths, by placing ideas in various <hi>poſitions</hi> or <hi>orders</hi> with reſpect to each
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:018397_0102_0FA70C16B7C16C18"/>
other, is what is principally meant by <hi>invention.</hi> But as it is employed in placing <hi>invented truths,</hi> or propoſitions already perceived to be truths, in like <hi>poſitions,</hi> in order to deduce ſtill other truths, it is called <hi>reaſoning</hi>; which is them bleſt and moſt uſeful operation of the mind, and that indeed for which all its faculties were prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally deſigned.</p>
            <p>The laſt power of the mind which I ſhall mention, and indeed I have only mentioned the foregoing ones; for it would require a volume to enlarge ſeverally on them, as might eaſily be done: I ſay, the laſt power the mind is furniſhed with is that of <hi>abſtraction</hi>; by which it makes <hi>particular</hi> idea <hi>general</hi> ones. And this it does by withdrawing or ſeparating from them theſe and thoſe circumſtances which accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied them, as excited by <hi>particular</hi> objects, and conſidering them in that <hi>general</hi> view only, wherein many other objects do agree with them. As for example:—The ſame idea, ſignified by the term <hi>redneſs,</hi> being perceived to day upon the ſight of a <hi>cherry,</hi> which was perceived yeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terday upon the ſight of a <hi>brick,</hi> and the day before upon the ſight of <hi>blood,</hi> the mind con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders this idea <hi>abſtracted</hi> from theſe <hi>particular objects,</hi> or at leaſt thoſe c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>itant ideas which accompanied its perception from each of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> making it a <hi>general</hi> idea comprehending all exiſtences that agree in being <hi>red.</hi> And to this faculty we are beholden for the benefit of <hi>lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. Particular names</hi> for <hi>particular ideas</hi> would,
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:018397_0103_0FA70C175192EAA8"/>
in a great meaſure, have deſtroyed the uſe of ſpeech, by rendering it infinitely tedious. <hi>Abſtraction</hi> is the remedy againſt this. It is the mind's capacity to make <hi>general</hi> ideas that has given riſe to <hi>general</hi> names; by means whereof language is made eaſy, and we are qualified with convenient ſpeed, by the intervention of words, ſpoken or written, to convey our thoughts to one another. Beſides, it is of vaſt uſe, in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring knowledge, to have this power of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering ideas in an <hi>abſtracted</hi> view; as, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, the making progreſs in underſtanding would have been an infinitely lengthy buſineſs. And further, we have it in our power, by the help of this faculty, more fully and thoroughly to examine ideas then we could otherwiſe have done; conſidering them <hi>ſingly,</hi> and <hi>a-part</hi> from all others, and ſo as to have the compleateſt conception of them, in their ſeveral properties and relations.</p>
            <p>Thoſe now are the powers, qualifying us for <hi>intellectual</hi> acquirements. And how admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably fitted are they to this end? <hi>Material na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> is, by this means, in a great meaſure, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to our command. We can view <hi>external</hi> objects, even in their abſence, by their images retained in the mind; examine their relations and dependencies; enquire into their properties and powers; and inveſtigate numberleſs truths concerning them: Applying them to the <hi>uſes of life,</hi> or the <hi>entertainment of the min<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The forming us with faculties whereby we are qualified for ſuch noble <hi>intellectual</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments,
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:018397_0105_0FA70C18BADFF9C8"/>
evidently carries with it the marks of <hi>benevolence.</hi> Nothing indeed but <hi>ſupreme</hi> and <hi>perfect</hi> goodneſs, could have ſo wonderfully adorned and endowed our nature.</p>
            <p>It is readily acknowledged, <hi>theſe capacities,</hi> as planted in us, are but <hi>low</hi> and <hi>ſmall,</hi> in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon with what we may ſuppoſe them to be in many other beings above us. And this may ſeem to ſome an objection, if not againſt the <hi>benevolence</hi> of the <hi>Deity</hi> in general, yet againſt that <hi>abſolute perfection</hi> of it which we are plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for. But it is an objection of no great weight. For if theſe capacities in us, however low and imperfect, in compariſon with what they are in other beings, are well adjuſted to the ſtate and circumſtances of an order of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures bearing <hi>ſuch a part</hi> in the <hi>general ſcheme for good,</hi> it is all that can be required of <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable benevolence,</hi> though heightened to <hi>infinity.</hi> Had no other beings been brought into exiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence beſides us <hi>men,</hi> the objection, in this caſe, it is owned, would have h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ld good: But as we are only one of the numerous orders that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute a <hi>general ſyſtem,</hi> this quite alters the caſe; making thoſe capacities only an evidence of <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>reaſonable benevolence,</hi> which are fitted for a <hi>particular part,</hi> ſuſtaining <hi>ſuch a place,</hi> in the conſtitution of this <hi>whole.</hi> In this view of the matter, it is eaſy to ſee how benevolence may be <hi>infinitely perfect,</hi> while yet the creatures that are produced by it are <hi>variouſly</hi> endowed with capacities, ſome <hi>ſuperior,</hi> others <hi>inferior</hi>;
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:018397_0106_0FA70C1974B0C500"/>
Nor could they otherwiſe have been fitted to fill the place aſſigned them in the <hi>chain</hi> of being: Neither could they have anſwered thoſe good ends, they were <hi>particularly</hi> formed for. Had the <hi>brute</hi> creatures, for inſtance, been endowed with the capacities that belong to us <hi>men,</hi> they would have been <hi>unfit</hi> for the place they now take up in the creation: Neither could they have been the means of <hi>that good,</hi> they are now properly the occaſion of. And the ſame may be ſaid of us <hi>men.</hi> Had we been endowed with the capacities of <hi>angels,</hi> we ſhould not have been formed for <hi>ſuch a world</hi> as this, and for anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe ends, in it, which we are now fitted to anſwer, and it might be neceſſary ſhould be anſwered in order to a <hi>full</hi> manifeſtation of Divine goodneſs. The truth is, the <hi>perfection</hi> of benevolence conſiſts, not ſimply in the <hi>largeneſs</hi> of the capacities it beſtows upon any beings, but in <hi>fitting</hi> them to the <hi>ſtate</hi> and <hi>circumſtances</hi> of beings in <hi>ſuch a ſituation,</hi> and bearing <hi>ſuch a place,</hi> in the <hi>general plan</hi> of operation for good: And if our capacities are thus adjuſted, which cannot be diſproved, it is all that can <hi>reaſonably</hi> be expected. It is no argument of the <hi>want</hi> of benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence in the Creator, that they are not <hi>greater</hi>: Nay, had they been <hi>greater,</hi> the <hi>benevolence</hi> diſcovered would have been, in the ſame proportion, <hi>leſs wiſe</hi> and <hi>perfect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is confeſſed likewiſe, that mankind are not endowed with <hi>thoſe mental</hi> powers, in <hi>equal</hi> degrees. So far is this from the truth of fact, that the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities of ſcarce any two men are exactly alike.
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:018397_0107_0FA70C1BAE7DA450"/>
Some excel in one turn of mind, others in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; ſome have no great genius for any thing, others are diſtinguiſhed with a very extenſive one, fitting them for almoſt every thing: And perhaps ſome individuals in the human ſpecies differ as widely from others, in their <hi>rational</hi> powers, as thoſe others do from the next ſpecies below them. And this may poſſibly be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſome another objection againſt the plea we are making for an <hi>abſolutely perfect</hi> principle of benevolence in the <hi>Deity.</hi> But neither does this appear to be an objection, carrying with it any conſiderable force. It may be, ſome ſuch <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity,</hi> as that which is viſible in men's <hi>mental</hi> powers, could not have been <hi>prevented,</hi> in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency with thoſe <hi>general laws,</hi> according to which mankind were intended to be made hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py. One of theſe laws (which we have had occaſion already to mention) puts it very much into men's own power, by induſtry and proper application, to enlarge their capacities, and make progreſs in intellectual attainments: And in conſequence of this law, a <hi>difference</hi> in men's powers will be <hi>unavoidable</hi>; though we ſhould even ſuppoſe, what perhaps is not true, that they were <hi>alike</hi> in their <hi>original</hi> implantation. Beſides, the exerciſe of <hi>mental</hi> powers, being, according to another law of nature, in ſo great a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, dependant on the <hi>mechaniſm of the body,</hi> this alſo renders it <hi>impoſſible</hi> but that they ſhould be <hi>different</hi>; for a difference in <hi>bodily organiza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> cannot but take place, in ſuch a world as this, unleſs the laws of nature ſhould be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:018397_0108_0FA70C1F04A95430"/>
in their courſe. So that to object againſt a <hi>diſparity</hi> of <hi>mental</hi> powers is, in true conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, to object againſt the <hi>general plan</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which this ſyſtem is made, upheld, and governed: Which, in ſuch ſhort-ſighted creatures as we are, can be no other than <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting</hi> in the dark, by urging that which finally terminates in our own ignorance.</p>
            <p>But to come more directly to the point.— This difference in men's capacities, whatever it is owing to, whether a difference in their <hi>original implantation,</hi> or a difference in the <hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy's mechaniſm,</hi> either of which amounts to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely the ſame thing, in the preſent argument: I ſay, this <hi>inequality</hi> of powers is ſo far from argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>want</hi> of goodneſs in the <hi>Deity,</hi> that it ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly illuſtrates the <hi>glory</hi> and <hi>perfection</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>Poſſibly, the gradation in beings, by means of which all ſpaces are filled up, could not have been ſo accurately compleat, unleſs there had been a difference between the <hi>individuals</hi> in each ſpecies as well as between the ſpecies themſelves.

our <hi>mental</hi> powers ſo exactly alike, as that one man could not go beyond another, but every man muſt have within himſelf the whole ſource of intellectual furniture, there would be no room for that <hi>converſe</hi> between man and man, which is, in the preſent ſtate of things, one of the chief <hi>pleaſures,</hi> as well as <hi>improvements</hi> of the mind: To be ſure, it could not be carried on with that mutual <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> it now may; nor could it turn out to ſo great advantage. Beſides, if there was no ſuch thing as one man's <hi>excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> another, as there could not be upon the preſent ſuppoſition, the ſtrongeſt <hi>ſtimulus,</hi> that now prompts us to exert ourſelves in order to enlarge our intellectual powers, would be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and by means thereof our very powers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſo far as we can judge, muſt be in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of being rendered inactive, and of decrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in their fitneſs for exerciſe. And further, if our capacities had been preciſely the ſame, that <hi>ſubordination</hi> in the human ſpecies, thoſe <hi>ſuperiorities</hi> and <hi>inferiorities,</hi> could not have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken place, without which life itſelf could not have been enjoyed, in ſuch a world as our's, with tolerable comfort. And what is of yet greater importance, there would not have been the <hi>oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion</hi> for thoſe interchangeable offices of huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and ſocial kindneſs, which, upon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

we muſt otherwiſe have been ſtrangers to. The plain truth is, the conveniences and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, poſſible to be enjoyed by the human kind, do not ſeem to have been obtainable, in a world conſtituted as this is, but by an union of counſels and endeavours; every one doing his part in order to promote the good of the whole. And <hi>different capacities</hi> are the requiſite expedient to this purpoſe. Theſe not only fit the ſeveral in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals for reciprocal ſervices, but ſecure their mutual dependance on each other; here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by properly linking them together, and making way for thoſe various exertments which are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the common benefit. If mankind could at all have enjoyed the advantage of ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, without this <hi>inequality</hi> of powers, it is very evident that they could not have enjoyed it to ſo good a purpoſe as with it. Their being <hi>variouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> endowed is that which puts it in their power to be <hi>variouſly uſeful</hi> to each other, ſo as that the happineſs of every individual may hereby be increaſed beyond what it could otherwiſe have been. And it is the inſufficiency there is in every man for his own happineſs by himſelf <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gly,</hi> and <hi>alone,</hi> and his being obliged to depend on others for many things, without which he muſt be very uncomfortable, that is, in reality, the <hi>only effectual bond</hi> that unites the human ſpecies, ſecuring their attachment to each other, and ſtimulating them to thoſe mutual ſervices, upon which the good of all the individuals does very much depend.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="113" facs="unknown:018397_0111_0FA70C20F8BEB3F0"/>It is ſtill further acknowledged, that our <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual</hi> powers, at firſt, are <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>feeble,</hi> and it is in a <hi>ſlow</hi> and <hi>leiſurely</hi> way, under <hi>due cultivation,</hi> and in the uſe of <hi>labor</hi> and <hi>pains,</hi> that they gain ſtrength, and advance to any conſiderable degrees of their attainable perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And this likewiſe may be thought an <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection</hi> againſt the plea for an <hi>abſolutely perfect</hi> principle of benevolence in the <hi>Deity.</hi> But it is, duly conſidered, an argument rather enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing this plea, than in any degree leſſening its real weight.</p>
            <p>Perhaps, no mind, the infinitely comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive one only excepted, can be ſo perfect as to be incapable of <hi>progreſſion</hi> in underſtanding. For one degree of knowledge is ſo connected with another, and ſo naturally prepares the way for it, as that it may be an <hi>impoſſibilitity</hi> but that every <hi>created mind</hi> ſhould be capable of attaining ſtill higher degrees of it. So that if we were at all made capable of intelligence, it ſhould ſeem as though it muſt have been, in general, in the way of <hi>progreſſion.</hi> And as to the <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar method of progreſſion</hi> that takes place, with reſpect to the human mind, it is the moſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and rational one that could have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived, for an order of beings conſtituted in other reſpects, and ſituated, as we are; as we ſhall evidently ſee by going over its parts that are objected to.</p>
            <p>It is complained, that our faculties are <hi>weak</hi> at firſt, and advance in a <hi>ſlow</hi> and <hi>gradual</hi> way
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:018397_0112_0FA70C21D0CBCA18"/>
to their attainable maturity. To which the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply is, That, as the only way, according to the eſtabliſhed order of nature, in which the mind can be furniſhed with ideas, is by the medium of the bodily ſenſes, and its own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections afterwards, it was <hi>impoſſible</hi> but that the attainment of knowledge, with reſpect to us, ſhould be in a <hi>ſlow</hi> and <hi>leiſurely</hi> manner. And though our faculties are <hi>feeble</hi> at firſt, it is <hi>beſt</hi> they ſhould be ſo, and an inſtance of goodneſs, in the Creator, rather than the contrary. For, it is to be remembered, they could be of no manner of ſervice till ſupplied with proper ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and there had been time to learn the uſe of them. We muſt have been, at firſt, whatever was the ſtate of our faculties, totally unacquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ourſelves, and with the world about us: And is would have required <hi>time,</hi> and <hi>expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,</hi> and <hi>inſtruction,</hi> before we could have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired knowledge ſufficient for the proper ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of any thing to the purpoſes of life. And as this is the condition of our nature, faculties <hi>feeble</hi> at firſt, but yet capable of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually advancing to a mature ſtate, ſeem the <hi>beſt ſuited thereto</hi> of any we could have been endowed with. There is evidently a <hi>congruity</hi> and <hi>proportion</hi> between ſuch faculties, and the <hi>method</hi> according to which knowledge is attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by ſuch creatures as we are. Inſtead of having faculties in their <hi>full ſtrength</hi> and <hi>vigor,</hi> before it was poſſible, conformably to the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed order of nature, that we could make the
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:018397_0113_0FA70C22B49FBDA0"/>
proper uſe of them, it ſeems much better that they ſhould gradually open and enlarge, as ideas are gradually let into them to employ their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, and fit them for the offices and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of life. And perhaps the time of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a <hi>mature</hi> ſtate of faculties, is, in the beſt manner, adjuſted to the time requiſite for the mind to <hi>get ſtored with ideas,</hi> and furniſhed with that <hi>ſkill in the uſe of them,</hi> which is proper for <hi>full grown</hi> powers. Beſides, as we come into the world, and muſt do ſo according to the preſent laws of nature, with <hi>infant bodies,</hi> what more fit than that we ſhould have at firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant minds alſo? How unſuitable would a <hi>manly mature ſtate of mind</hi> be, for an <hi>infant body?</hi> What miſ-matched companions would they be for each other? It is moſt proper, as the <hi>body</hi> ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and gradually advances to its attainable ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity, that the <hi>mind</hi> ſhould do ſo likewiſe. There is, upon this ſcheme, an apparent adjuſtment between the two grand parts of the human frame; and it is all along preſerved in the joint pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs they gradually make towards the <hi>maturity</hi> they are deſigned to attain to. And, it may be, that ſtate of <hi>tuition</hi> and <hi>diſcipline</hi> we are placed under, while we leiſurely paſs through the ſeveral periods of <hi>infancy, childhood,</hi> and <hi>youth,</hi> is the <hi>beſt fitted initiation</hi> into a ſtate of <hi>manhood,</hi> or <hi>full grown</hi> faculties. It is certainly of eminent ſervice in many reſpects; as hereby opportunity is given, while ideas are letting into the mind, and the faculties are opening
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:018397_0114_0FA70C23904AEDD0"/>
and expanding, to introduce that <hi>attentiveneſs, teachableneſs,</hi> and <hi>modeſt diffidence,</hi> which are the grand preparatives for conſiderable attainments in uſeful knowledge. And that <hi>exerciſe</hi> which we are now called to, and put upon, is the moſt natural and ſuitable method, not only to <hi>ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then</hi> and <hi>improve</hi> our faculties, but to form that <hi>habit</hi> of <hi>induſtry</hi> and <hi>diligence,</hi> without which we ſhall in vain think of advancing in <hi>intellec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi> purſuits. And this leads to the other part of the <hi>complaint,</hi> which is,</p>
            <p>That our attainments in knowledge are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with care and labor; inſomuch that we can never make any conſiderable progreſs in underſtanding, unleſs we apply ourſelves, with <hi>diligence,</hi> to cultivate and improve our minds. And here it is queried, Why could not we have been formed, at once in the ſame degree of <hi>intellectual perfection</hi> we are ever capable of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to? And would not this have diſcovered <hi>greater benevolence</hi> than is diſcovered in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod that now takes place? Why ſhould the benefit of intelligence be truſted, in ſuch a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, with ourſelves, and be made to depend upon our own induſtry? What need of ſo much pains, and ſuch a tedious round-about way in order to knowledge, and the happineſs that is conſequent thereupon, when it might have been given at once, without ſo much ado<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>? To which the proper anſwer is, that the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of knowledge, in the way here pleaded for, may be an <hi>impoſſibility</hi> in the nature of
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:018397_0115_0FA70C23F3428730"/>
things: Or, at leaſt, ſuch a communication of it may be <hi>leſs fitted,</hi> upon the whole, and all things conſidered, for the production of <hi>ſo much good,</hi> as is capable of being produced in the method that at preſent takes place. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, the putting intellectual attainments <hi>into the power of creatures themſelves,</hi> in a good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, making them poſſible only in the way of <hi>due care</hi> and <hi>diligence,</hi> is the beſt adapted of any method, that could have been pitched upon to produce the <hi>greateſt ſum</hi> of happineſs. It it certain, that if as much knowledge, as we are ever capable of attaining to, was the <hi>abſolute gift</hi> of nature, and (if the ſuppoſition may not be thought an impoſſible one) a gift beſtowed <hi>at once,</hi> upon our firſt coming into exiſtence; it is certain, I ſay, that knowledge communicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this way would not be an endowment that had any value in it <hi>morally</hi> ſpeaking: For which reaſon it could not be the ſource of <hi>that plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,</hi> which might have reſulted from it, had it been an <hi>acquiſition of our own.</hi> And it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied, that pleaſure is naturally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with the idea of knowledge, as the fruit of our own induſtry. We need only attend to our perceptions, in order to be convinced that we <hi>feel pleaſure</hi> in viewing this quality under the notion of a purchaſe of our own, in the way of diligence: And it is indeed one of the higheſt and nobleſt ſorts of pleaſure we are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of enjoying. But, it is plain, this plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure could not have been perceived; there
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:018397_0116_0FA70C271939D708"/>
would have been no foundation laid for it in nature, if it was not in our own power, by care and pains, to make <hi>intellectual improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> If knowledge had been the gift of the <hi>Deity,</hi> independently of ourſelves, we ſhould have had no reaſon, were we endowed with it in ever ſo high a meaſure, for the leaſt <hi>ſelf-ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation</hi> on this account: Nor could we <hi>rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally</hi> have enjoyed <hi>that pleaſure</hi> which is now a natural conſequence therefrom. So that the preſent method for the communication of <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual good</hi> is a better fitted one for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, than that which is pleaded for in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection; becauſe knowledge <hi>abſolutely communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated</hi> is not capable of yielding <hi>ſo much</hi> happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as that which is attained to, by proper faculties, in the uſe of labor and pains: For there would be wanting the conſcious reflection on our <hi>own merit</hi> in the procurement of it: We could not look upon it as our <hi>own acquiſition,</hi> and conſequently could not, unleſs upon a falſe bottom, perceive that <hi>ſelf-approbation,</hi> from whence alone can reſult the <hi>nobleſt-kind</hi> of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure we are capable of. The truth is, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <hi>beſt</hi> that <hi>intellectual,</hi> and indeed every other kind of good, is made to depend, in ſo great a meaſure, upon <hi>ourſelves.</hi> For it is this that gives riſe to the various exerciſe of our facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, affording, at the ſame time, both proper <hi>ſcope</hi> and <hi>reaſon</hi> for their employment: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, if good was communicated without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of our own endeavours, it is not eaſily
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:018397_0117_0FA70C282ABCEB00"/>
conceivable, how there could have been either <hi>room</hi> or <hi>reaſon</hi> for thoſe noble exertions, which, upon the preſent plan, are properly called forth; and ſuitably recompenſed. Beſides, there could be no ſuch thing as any <hi>moral</hi> attainment, if nothing could be acquired by the due exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of our natural faculties. The capacity of making acquiſitions, by our own endeavours, ſuitably employed, is the true and only baſis of all our <hi>moral</hi> perfection. It is in conſequence of this, and this only, that we become capable of <hi>virtue,</hi> and worthy of <hi>praiſe</hi> and <hi>commendation</hi>: And had we not this power, we ſhould be nothing more than <hi>meer perceptive</hi> beings, who do not <hi>act,</hi> but are <hi>acted upon</hi>: Nor, if we were thus the <hi>paſſive recipients</hi> only of good, would there have been any foundation laid in our nature, for the <hi>higheſt</hi> and <hi>nobleſt</hi> of all plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; the pleaſure. I mean, which is conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent upon the reflection on good as our <hi>own attainment,</hi> by a right application of our own powers.</p>
            <p>So that, upon the whole, inſtead of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of God for not furniſhing us with powers, wonderfully contrived to fit us for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual attainments, and the happineſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent thereupon, we have reaſon rather to admire the greatneſs of his benevolence. It does not indeed appear, wherein he could have diſplayed his goodneſs, as guided by wiſdom, more conſpicuouſly than he has d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ne, to an order of beings in ſuch a world as our's, and
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:018397_0118_0FA70C28888BA328"/>
as ſuſtaining ſuch a place in the ſcale of intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent exiſtences.</p>
            <p>I now go on to illuſtrate the benevolence of the Deity, by taking as conciſe a view as I well can of thoſe powers, he has endowed us with, fitting us for <hi>moral</hi> happineſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the higheſt any being can be made capable of. And thoſe, the other mental powers, already mentioned, not being unattended to, are, in general, the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing ones.</p>
            <p>The firſt power in our nature [call it common ſenſe, moral ſenſe, moral diſcernment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or give it any other name that may be thought better] is that by which we are enabled at once, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the labor of a long train of reaſoning, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh between moral good, and moral evil, in all inſtances that are of primary importance, and eſſentially connected with the good of the moral world.</p>
            <p>There is an unalterable difference between virtue and vice, or, what means the ſame thing, between moral good, and moral evil. They have their reſpective natures, and are unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able oppoſites. Vice cannot be made virtue, nor on the contrary, can virtue be made vice. They are in themſelves what they are, and will remain ſo without variation, or the ſhadow of turning. It is, on the one hand, fit and right, that we ſhould be pious towards God, righteous towards our fellow-men, and ſober with reſpect to ourſelves; and, on the other, unfit and wrong, that we ſhould be impious towards the Deity, unjuſt
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:018397_0119_0FA70C294795A298"/>
in our treatment of men, and intemperate in the gratification of our animal appetites: Nor is it poſſible this moral order ſhould be inverted. No will, no power, either of men, or angels, or even the Supreme Ruler himſelf, can make it right to be impious, inſtead of pious towards God; or unrighteous, inſtead of righteous to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards men; or intemperate, inſtead of ſober, in regard of ourſelves. To ſuppoſe this, would be to eraſe the foundations of the moral ſyſtem, to deſtroy the relation that ſubſiſts between the Creator and his creatures, and between the creatures with reſpect to one another, and to make virtue and vice nothing more than arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary names, having in themſelves no certainly fixed nature.</p>
            <p>And as virtue and vice, moral good and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral evil, are thus different from each other, ſo is this difference obviouſly and at once, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable by all morally intelligent minds, unleſs they have been greatly corrupted. There may indeed be inſtances of moral conduct, in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of comparatively ſmall importance, with reſpect to which it may be difficult to diſtinguiſh between the right and wrong. And the analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy here, it may be worthy of notice, is very exact between the <hi>natural,</hi> and the <hi>moral</hi> world. Light and darkneſs may be ſo mixed, that one can ſcarce know which to call it. Sweet and bitter may be ſo blended together, that it may be difficult to ſay which is prevalent. Colors may be ſo dilated, and placed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

that the eye of a ſkilful painter may not be able to diſcern the preciſe point where one begins, and another ends. But, notwithſtanding theſe mixtures, light is never the ſame thing with darkneſs, nor bitter with ſweet, nor one color that of another; and they are, unleſs in ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated caſes, readily and at once diſtinguiſhed from each other. In like manner, there may be, and often are, in the moral world, caſes wherein the boundaries between good and evil, and the ſpot that divides them, may not be eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if at all, diſcerned, ſo as to be able to ſay, with preciſion, here virtue runs into vice, and vice into virtue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But this hinders not but that, in the main and eſſential branches of morality, the virtuous, and the vicious conduct may obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly be perceived, where the mind's perceptive power has not been, in a great degree, vitiated, and hurt. And, in very truth, the God of nature has, in his abundant goodneſs, ſo formed our minds, and given us ſuch a power of diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that it muſt be owing, unleſs we are ideots, or madmen, to ſome heinous faultineſs, we our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are juſtly chargable with, if we are not able, without difficulty, to diſcern the difference right and wrong, in the more important points of moral obligation. Will any man, who has not ſtrangely perverted the proper uſe of his perceptive powers pretend, that he cannot, or that he does not, ſee it to be fit and right, on the one hand, that ſuch a creature as he is ſo related to God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and dependant on him,
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:018397_0121_0FA70C2B8BA5E348"/>
ſhould yield to him the love of his heart, and the obedience of his life; and, on the other, that it would be unfit and wrong to withdraw his affection from him, and behave with diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect towards him? Will any man, in the due uſe of his diſcerning power, calmly and deliberate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay, that he cannot perceive it to be right, that he ſhould do to others, as he would they ſhould do to him, in like circumſtances, and wrong, unalterably wrong, that he ſhould do otherwiſe? Will any man, not having darken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his heart, declare, ſpeaking the truth, that he does not ſee it to be right, that he ſhould govern his paſſions, and keep his ſenſual ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites within the reſtraints of reaſon; and wrong, evidently wrong<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to give way to anger, wrath, malice, and to take an unbounded liberty in gratifying his animal na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? That man, be he who he may, if not void of common ſenſe, is wholly inattentive to its dictates, who perceives no moral difference between revering, and mocking his maker; between being honeſt and knaviſh, in his tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions with his neighbour; between being chaſte, and lewd; between living ſoberly and in the practice of drunkenneſs? Or if he does not perceive the former to be amiable virtues, and the latter deteſtable, infamous vices? The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral difference in theſe ways of conduct is ſelf-evident. There needs no argumentation, no ſeries of intermediate ideas, to point it out. Barely mentioning them, provided it is done in
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:018397_0122_0FA70C2C88665848"/>
words that are clearly underſtood, will at once, enforce conviction, unleſs in ſeeing men will not ſee; in which caſe it would be a vain thing to expect, that reaſoning ſhould have an effectual influence on them. For illuſtration, I ſhall bring to view here a particular inſtance. That rule of conduct, "do to others as you would they ſhould do to you," is ſo evidently fit and right, that, upon the bare propoſal of it, the mind at once diſcerns it to be juſt and equal. To uſe arguments to make it appear reaſonable, would be only to darken the evidence of its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo. No medium of proof could, in this caſe, be introduced, which would not more need to be proved, than the thing itſelf it is brought to prove. It is not indeed eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable, that any man, who has the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of a man, and is not under undue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence from evil affection, ſhould heſitate one moment in his judgment as to the ſuitableneſs of this moral rule of conduct, its equity is ſo obvious, and ſo inſtantly and glaringly ſtrikes the diſcerning power, we are all naturally fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with. And, in truth, however com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon it may be, among men, to throw practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal contempt upon this rule in their treatment of one another, none do it becauſe they enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in their minds an opinion of it as an unfair, unequal regulator of their behavior; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are thoughtleſs and inattentive, or ſuffer themſelves to be enticed, and led aſide by ungoverned pride, paſſion and luſt of one kind or
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:018397_0123_0FA70C2CF6DF4978"/>
another. This is the true reaſon, why they act in contradiction to the rule of right, not only in this, but in all other great and important caſes in moral life. They indulge theſe and thoſe vicious gratifications, not becauſe they do not perceive them to be unreaſonable, but becauſe they are excited hereto by the luſts of the fleſh, or mind, or both. It is true, the moral power of diſcernment, as well as the other intellectual faculties, may, in common with the bodily or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, be ſo debilitated, if not ſpoiled, by men's accuſtoming themſelves to do evil, as to be unfitted for the proper uſe for which they were implanted in their nature. And, perhaps, there are ſome, among wicked men, who, by having long habituated themſelves to live and act, as hurried on by the impetus of ungoverned paſſions and affections, ſuch as an irregular love of themſelves, and their own ſeparate intereſt; the love of honor; the love of riches; the love of ſenſuality, and other luſts: I ſay, there are thoſe, who, by a courſe of thus conducting, have gradually ſo weakened their moral ſight, as to be, in a great meaſure, if not totally, unable to diſcern thoſe actions to be wrong, which are glaringly ſo, and appear to be ſo, with a meridian luſtre, to all who have eyes to ſee. But this is not the common and ordinary ſtate even of wicked men. There are, it may be, comparatively few, but have ſo much mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral diſcernment, as not to be able to go on in vicious practice, in inſtances that are great and
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:018397_0124_0FA70C2E077AA470"/>
heinous, without remonſtrances from within. They do not ſinfully gratify their appetites, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have no ſight, or ſenſe, of its being unfit, and wrong that they ſhould do ſo; but becauſe they are tempted of their luſt and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. The law in their members, getting the better of the law in their minds, influences them to do that they approve not; yea, many times, that they even hate, it is ſo oppoſite to the light in them, which ought to be the guide of their conduct.</p>
            <p>The account I have thus given of that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted power in our nature, which enables us at once, without labor and pains, to diſcern the difference between right and wrong in all great and important inſtances in moral life, is, I imagine, ſtrictly juſt, and verified to be ſo by the univerſal experience of mankind. The plain truth is, we are ſo formed by the God of nature as that we as readily, and with as much certainty, perceive <hi>moral</hi> qualities as thoſe that are poſſible. By the intervention of our bodily organs, we directly perceive the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween white and black, ſweet and bitter, and know that the one is not, and cannot be, the other. By the diſcerning power of our minds we perceive, in the like direct and immediate way, theſe and thoſe qualities of temper and conduct, and are at once ſatisfied that they are either morally good, not evil; or morally evil, not good: Nor is this moral diſcernment con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to ſome among men, in diſtinction from
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:018397_0125_0FA70C2EE2046B78"/>
others; but is common to all; as being a power the whole human race come into the world en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with. And it is from this power that moral reaſoning takes riſe. It ſuppoſes ſuch a perception of moral qualities as is common to all, and in which all, not having corrupted their minds, acquieſce as primary principles; and in theſe, reaſoning, with reference to the moral world, muſt finally terminate in order to its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtrictly concluſive; and wherein it fails of doing ſo, by a non-connection in the chain of intermediate ideas brought to view, it is eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally defective; or ſhould the connection be juſt, but not diſcerned by any to be ſo, it muſt, as to them, be the ſame as if it was really inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient arguing. Primary moral truths, ſuch as are perceived, and aſſented to, as ſuch; and this, without heſitation, by mankind in common<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in conſequence of that power of diſcernment they come into being furniſhed with, are the only baſis on which there can be reaſoning to any purpoſe among men, with relation to the moral ſyſtem. Reaſoning powers, if there were no firſt moral principles, in which mankind could agree without debate would ſerve rather to promote endleſs wranglings, than virtuous pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits, in oppoſition to thoſe that are vicious. The author of our beings has therefore wiſely, as well as kindly, taken care to plant in our nature a morally diſcerning power, which is admirably fitted to diſtinguiſh without difficulty, between right and wrong, that we might chuſe and purſue
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:018397_0126_0FA70C2F39068E78"/>
the former, and refuſe and avoid the latter. In virtue of this power, and by the exerciſe of it, if we have not weakened, nor ſpoilt it, we may, as it were, by a glance of our moral ſight, in all important caſes, ſo perceive the difference there is in actions as to pronounce with certainty, that theſe are morally good, thoſe morally evil. What a noble implantation is this power in our nature? What a mighty guard againſt vice, and preparative for virtuous practice? Wherein could better proviſion have been for ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect beings as we are to engage our care to act up to that which is right, and not allow our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in doing what is wrong? We are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly laid under the ſtrongeſt obligations of love and gratitude to that Glorious Being, who has implanted in us this excellent power, and ſhall be inexcuſably blind if we do not ſee that he is benevolent, and baſe to an high degree if we do not find ourſelves diſpoſed to make our humble and thankful acknowledgements to him as ſuch.</p>
            <p>Another power in our nature is that of <hi>ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination,</hi> which gives riſe to our volitions, and conſequent actions, and is, in true propriety, the cauſe of them. This power in us men, whether it be called ſelf-determination, or by any other name, is the only baſis of moral ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation. Unleſs this be firſt ſuppoſed, to talk of moral agency is a contradiction to common ſenſe, and in itſelf a groſs abſurdity. We might, it is true, without the implantation of ſuch a power in our nature, in conſequence of a chain
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:018397_0127_0FA70C305F0BBD18"/>
of exterior cauſes, not within the reach of our controul, be made inſtruments in the producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any effects which are unavoidably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with their chain of fatality, ſhould even volition or choice be one of its links. But agents, free agents, we could not be, of whom it might, in conſiſtency with truth, be affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that they were the producers of theſe ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects: The author of this chain of cauſes, which inevitably gives exiſtence to them, is their real, and only proper cauſe. A power in man that will ſubject his volitions to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and conſtitute him the efficient of thoſe effects that are conſequent upon them, is the only bottom upon which agency can, with the leaſt ſhadow of propriety, be grounded. There is, in the nature of things, an eſſential difference between conſcious voluntary machines, and agents; that is, in other words of preciſely the ſame import, beings that are, ſtrictly ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, cauſes of the effects that are aſcribed to them. Such agents are we men; and we are, or maybe, as certain of it as that we poſſeſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence. For it is as evident a truth, and as evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently perceived by the mind to be ſo. We do not ordinarily make ourſelves ſo ridiculous as to endeavour, by reaſoning, to prove to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that we exiſt. We know that we do without argumentation, becauſe we feel that we do. It is an object of direct, immediate, and unavoidable perception, ſuperſeding the uſe of arguments, and indeed rendering it needleſs,
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:018397_0128_0FA70C30C0BB1688"/>
not to ſay abſurd. The ſame may be ſaid, and with equal propriety, of that power, we are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally endowed with, which conſtitutes us agents, or beings that are <hi>efficiently</hi> the cauſes of their own volitions and actions. To go about to prove this, by a long train of reaſoning, would be very like holding a candle to the ſun, in its meridian luſtre, for light that we might be able to ſee. It is a firſt, and fundamental principle in morals, and to be evidenced, not by arguing, but by an appeal to common ſenſe, or, in other words, the perceptions of mankind univerſally. We all feel the exiſtence, and operation of this power every day we live. The language of all the world, their projections, their purſuits, and the whole frame and order of their affairs, relative both to this, and the ſtate that is beyond it, are founded on this ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and would be ſo many downright in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtencies, if they were not, from their own perceptions, ſo certainly convinced, that this ſuppoſition was the real truth, as to admit it into their minds as ſuch without the leaſt he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation.</p>
            <p>Many there were, I know, among the pagan philoſophers, in former ages, who thought, and ſome there are among the philoſophers, not to ſay divines, of the preſent age, who agree with them in thinking, that all effects take riſe from a chain of cauſes, with the Deity at its head as the only efficient, ſo unavoidably linked together, connected with, and dependant on each other,
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:018397_0129_0FA70C35E286E1E8"/>
that the coming of theſe effects into event, in conſequence of the unavoidable operation of theſe cauſes, is not only certain, but abſolutely inevitable. And they conſider mankind, with all their powers, as ſo many links in this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amantine chain, no one of which can poſſibly fail in the production of the effect aſſigned to it.</p>
            <p>Thoſe, among the abettors of this ſcheme, who are capable of looking forward to conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences not very far diſtant, clearly and fully perceive its inconſiſtency with men's being free agents, and that it totally deſtroys the idea of moral good and evil. They accordingly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare with an honeſt, frank openneſs, that the diſtinction that is commonly made between mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral good and evil has no foundation in nature, however well adapted it may be to vulgar pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices and conceptions. And they are herein conſiſtent with themſelves. And fu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er, as it is ſuppoſed in this ſcheme of their's, that there is no evil in the creation but what is natural, intended for the production of good, and ſo unalterably connected with it as that it ſhall finally terminate in it, by effecting the complete happineſs of all, without limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or exception, it reflects infinitely leſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach upon the Deity than the ſcheme of thoſe, who would graft free agency upon the doctrine of fatality, and ill-deſert in men, upon the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of cauſes over which they have no power; and, as the reſult of all, fix vaſt multitudes of them in the place where they ſhall be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:018397_0130_0FA70C3600A00CA8"/>
day and night, without intermiſſion, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever and ever. This is the ſcheme embraced by ſome at this day, and by ſome too who are called divines, and would be looked upon as the only orthodox ones among their brethren. But it is ſo groſsly falſe an one, ſo debaſing to the nature of man, and ſo diſhonorary to the perfectly benevolent God, that it is ſtrange any ſhould entertain a favorable opinion of it.</p>
            <p>The chief thing they ſay in its ſupport is, that it leaves mankind at liberty to do as they ſhall pleaſe, to conduct without reſtraint con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formably to what they have willed, and choſen. And what greater liberty can be deſired? If we may not be thought capable of acting mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally well or ill, while we are able, without hindrance from exterior cauſes, to do as we chuſe to do, what can make us moral agents? What more is neceſſary? What more are we conſcious of, from any perception of our minds? The anſwer is at once obvious. It is not true, that our perceptions go no further than to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure us, that we can do as we have willed, and are pleaſed to do. Beſides this, and far beyond it, they certify it to us, that we are at liberty to will or not to will, to chuſe or not to chuſe, the doing of theſe and thoſe actions. We feel in ourſelves a power over our volitions, and ſuch an one as enables us to direct, ſuſpend, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule, or put an intire ſtop to them: Nor, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we were poſſeſſed of this dominion, could we be agents, however great liberty might be
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:018397_0131_0FA70C36CEFB3098"/>
allowed us in bringing into event what we have previouſly willed. It is eſſential to free agency, and ſuch a uſe of it as to make us capable of good or ill deſerts, that our volitions upon which our actions follow, ſhould be within the reach of our command. The birds of the air, and the beaſts of the field, will and chuſe what they do as really as we men; and it may, with as much truth, be ſaid of them, as of us, that they do as they are pleaſed to do. Their whole courſe of conduct is the effect of previous choice and pleaſure. But we never call them agents, nor do we eſteem them ſuch. And why? The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, becauſe they have no power over their volition. They are effects produced in them by the operation of cauſes, not within their governing command. The ſame may be ſaid of mad-men. Their actions are voluntary. They do nothing, but in conſequence of previous will and pleaſure; but we do not account them ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable either of moral good or evil. Should they do ever ſo much miſchief, we do not charge them with ill deſert, however loud we may be in complaints that they are not reſtrained from doing hurt, by being kept under due confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And what is the reaſon of our think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus differently of diſtracted men, and others who have the full uſe of their mental powers? The true and only reaſon is, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer are hurried on to volition by a wild im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petus, over which which they have no power; but the latter have it in their power, to reſtrain
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:018397_0132_0FA70C39434F61B0"/>
and govern their wills and choices: Nor, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they were endowed with this power, would it conſiſt with common ſenſe to think, or ſpeak, of them as moral agents. If, inſtead of being the cauſes of their volitions, they were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in them as unavoidable effects of an eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhed co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Their practice in life is a confutation of their faith in theory.</p>
            <p>It is readily allowed, liberty in man, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to neceſſity, is one of the great wonders of God. The power in our nature that conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes us free agents is an amazing contrivance of infinite wiſdom. The modus of its exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and operation is too great a deep for us to fathom. It has tried, and puzzled the greateſt geniuſſes in all ages, and in all parts of the world. And, perhaps, we ſhall never be able, at leaſt on this ſide mortality, to take in a comprehenſive idea of it. But is this a good reaſon why we ſhould deny, or diſpute, the real being of ſuch a power in our conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Do any know, or can they, by metaphyſical ſearching, find out the nexus between ſoul and body? Can they tell us how they influence each other? And yet, it is certain there is this nexus,
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:018397_0134_0FA70C3A82FA2560"/>
and mutual influence between them: Nor can it be diſproved by all the ſubtilty of vain reaſoning. The ſame may be ſaid with reſpect to the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of man over his volitions, and conſequent actions. The manner of its exiſtence goes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond our inveſtigation; but the real exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of ſuch a power can never be diſproved, however it may be darkened and perplexed. We feel it to be a truth, in conſequence of which we are, in a reaſonable ſenſe, maſters of our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Our daily experience, if attended to, will indubitably aſſure us, that the exertions of our minds and bodies are under our own dominion.</p>
            <p>The plain truth is, ſuch a power in men as will make them cauſes, real proper cauſes, of their volitions, and the effects conſequent upon them, is the grand ſupporting pillar of the world, conſidered as moral. Take this away, and it at once falls into deſolation and utter ruin. If men's volitions, and their conſequent effects, are the reſult of invariable neceſſity, in virtue of exterior cauſes ſo inviolably connected, as that they will, and muſt, come to paſs, the author of this connection, which, according to this plan, is God, is the only agent in our world, and the only efficient, and real author, of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever has been, or ſhall hereafter be brought into event; not excluding any of the moſt complicated villanies that have been, or may be perpetrated by any of the ſons of Adam. Is this a ſcheme of thoughts fit to be embrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by intelligent creatures? Will it not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly,
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:018397_0135_0FA70C3B37FFAD98"/>
and certainly follow, from the ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of its truth, that virtue and vice are idle names, having no reality in nature? That men's accountableneſs to God, and liableneſs to be puniſhed, upon the foot of ill-deſert, are vulgar notions only, incapable of any ſolid ſupport? That the character of God, as a moral Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, is a vain imagination? And, in a word, that religion, whether natural or revealed, is a ſenſeleſs pretence, ſuited only to ſerve the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of politicians and prieſts? It would indeed, upon this ſcheme, be ridiculouſly abſurd to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe there ever was, or could be any ſuch thing.</p>
            <p>Having thus evinced, from our conſcious perceptions, that we are the ſubjects of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, governing power over our faculties, in virtue of which we are conſtituted free agents, as being the true and proper cauſes of our vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition, and conſequent actions, it will be eaſy to point out the benevolence of the Deity in putting this power in our nature. It is indeed the moſt important one we are endowed with, and the only baſis of the higheſt happineſs, in kind, we are made capable of enjoying. Had not this power been planted in us, we ſhould have been paſſive inſtruments, not moral agents. It is this power that diſtinguiſhes us from all the various claſſes of inferior animals, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it poſſible for us to perceive pleaſure far ſuperior in its nature to any, they can be the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of. They have no perception of ſelf-appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, from a conſciouſneſs of having done well,
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:018397_0136_0FA70C3C03667008"/>
nor of the pleaſure that is the natural reſult therefrom. This, perhaps, is the higheſt kind of pleaſure communicable from the Deity; and it is perceivable only by moral agents. No beings, to whom the Deity has not committed the care of governing their faculties, can, by the exerciſe of them, deſerve the applauſe of their own hearts, and enjoy the ſublime ſatisfaction ariſing herefrom: But it is within the reach of the capacity of all ſuch to feel this ſelf-appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, and conſequent pleaſure; and they may go on in this enjoyment with continually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing degrees, in proportion to the degrees of virtue they diſcover in the good government of theſe various faculties, they are entruſted with the care of. What a nobly intereſting power is this, that makes us free agents, as, by doing ſo, it makes us the capable percipients of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs more highly exalted, in kind, than it could otherwiſe have been? It is not conceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, wherein the perfectly benevolent Being could have made a better, and, at the ſame time a wiſer proviſion for our enjoyment of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt kind of happineſs: Eſpecially, if it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered, that he has conſtituted ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection between this happineſs he has made us capable of, and the actual enjoyment of it, as that it cannot be enjoyed but in conſequence of a right exerciſe of that power, which character<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſes us moral agents; by which means, our coming to the enjoyment of this happineſs, we may be the ſubjects of, is a conſtant, continually
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:018397_0137_0FA70C3CDCF08220"/>
abiding, and powerful motive to engage our care thus to exerciſe this power in our nature. What an admirable contrivance for our good is this? How amazingly does it illuſtrate both the wiſdom, and benevolence of God! It may fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther enlarge our idea of this benevolence, if it be conſidered, that our Creator has, in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, conſtituted a connection between careleſsneſs in the exertion of this power, or, in exerting it an undue wrong manner, with ſelf-diſapprobation, and conſequent uneaſineſs. This, it is poſſible, may appear to ſome, at the firſt glance, an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection againſt the Divine benevolence, rather than a proof of it. But a little attention will ſhew the contrary. What was the deſign of our maker in thus connecting diſapprobation and uneaſineſs with a careleſs, inattentive, and wrong exertion of the power that conſtitutes us agents? Was it that he might make us unhappy? No; but quite the reverſe. It is an expedient he purpoſely contrived, a connection he wiſely and kindly conſtituted, that he might prevent our making ourſelves miſerable. His view was, that we might perpetually carry in our own breaſts a powerful motive to make ourſelves happy. And one of the moſt conſtraining motives it is to put us upon ſo uſing our determining power, as that we may hold exiſtence with ſelf-approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and that heart-felt pleaſure which reſults therefrom. I may properly add yet further here, this command we are entruſted with over the exertion of our faculties, and a right uſe of it,
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:018397_0138_0FA70C426352A9E0"/>
are the true and only baſis of that approbation of our Maker, and that conſciouſneſs of it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ourſelves, upon which is raiſed, that inward peace and ſatisfaction of ſoul which yield the higheſt reliſh to life, and have in them a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency to ſupport and comfort us under all the various viciſſitudes, trials, and events, we may be called to paſs through, while in the world; and, what is more, inconceivably more, this inward ſenſe of the approbation of God, the foundation of which is the right uſe of the power of determination we are endowed with, is that only which can rationally relieve us in the view of death, and inſpire the hope of a glorious immortality beyond the grave, as the reward a good God will beſtow upon thoſe, who have act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their part well on the ſtage of life. Some, perhaps, may be diſpoſed to treat the notion of happineſs, as taking riſe from the approbation of God, and the perception of it in the breaſt, with ſneering contempt. But they ought, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fear of giving them any juſt occaſion of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, to be freely told, they are ſo formed by the author of nature, that they could not be chargable with this guilt, if they had not firſt corrupted, and in a great meaſure ſpoilt, their perceptive powers, by having walked according to the courſe of this world, fulfilling the deſires of the fleſh and mind. It is, beyond all doubt, owing to this, if any can find within themſelves a diſpoſedneſs to prophane this highly important and intereſting matter with banter and ridicule.
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:018397_0139_0FA70C42DEDE5800"/>
If there is ſuch an exiſting being as God (as there moſt certainly is) his approbation muſt be worth more than all earthly good; and a conſciouſneſs that we are the objects of it muſt yield inward delight, greater than can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of by thoſe whoſe affections are ſet upon the infinitely lower pleaſures of time and ſenſe. Free agency, in oppoſition to neceſſity, is that only which can, in conſiſtency with reaſon, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the way for what we mean by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of God. And it is an argument of his benevolence, and the greatneſs of it, that he has ſo made us, as that, by a right uſe of our powers, we may attain to a conſciouſneſs of being the objects of this approbation, and a perception of pleaſure in connection herewith, or conſequent hereupon, which exceeds all other pleaſurable ſenſations, while yet it is only a fore-taſte of far more noble and exalted pleaſures at God's right hand forever.</p>
            <p>Beſides what has hitherto been ſaid, it may be further worthy of notice, our being free agents is that which not only makes us living images of the Deity in that perfection of his nature which is his greateſt glory, but capable percipients, in a degree, of that happineſs which is his higheſt. Did the exertions of the Divine Being take riſe from the ſame neceſſity as his immenſity, or eternity, he would not be a free agent. In order to this, he muſt be poſſeſſed of a power over his volitions, as well as a power of exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in conſequence of which he has willed and
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:018397_0140_0FA70C43B8444FE8"/>
choſen. Had he not this power, it would be abſurd to attribute to him that liberty, which is inſeparable from free agency: Nor would any diſplays of his perfections be morally va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable in the leaſt degree, as they would, in this caſe, be the effects of natural neceſſity, not of free choice. It is their being exertions, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon what was freely willed that gives them the denomination of moral, and claims our love and gratitude. This power in the Deity, which enables him with freedom, in oppoſition to neceſſity, both to will, and to do, is his greateſt glory. And it is, perhaps, from the exerciſe of this power, that his bleſſedneſs, in the enjoyment of himſelf, principally flows. Now, by the implantation of a like power to this in our nature, we are made after the ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of God; and, by a right uſe of this power, we are capable of being, in a noble degree, happy a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> he is, and with the like kind of happineſs. Without controverſy, the moſt exalted happineſs, it is poſſible we ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, is that which is connected with, and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant on, a free, but wiſe and good, uſe of that power, in the exerciſe of which we may mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt it both to ourſelves, and others, that we are benevolent, holy, juſt, faithful, and, in a word, perfect, according to our meaſure, as God is perfect. Had we not this power, we could be happy in no other ſenſe, than that in which all meerly percipient beings are ſo. Our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs could not be the reſult of our own choice, in
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:018397_0141_0FA70C4469480DE0"/>
the free exerciſe of our powers; but the effect of exterior cauſes, over which we had no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. We might, it is true, in this way be in a degree happy; but our happineſs would not be worthy the name, in compariſon with that which ariſes from a morally good conduct, in conſequence of a right uſe of that power which makes us free agents. It may be ſubjoined here, the Supreme Being would not have been ſo happy as he might have been, had not this free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of will and choice been one of the glorious perfections of his nature; and the exerciſe of this perfection is invariably accompanied with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. He is ever pleaſed with his elections, and they are a ſource of eternal ſatisfaction to him. The ſame may be ſaid of us men, all due allowance being made for the infinite ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority of God to ſuch creatures as we are. We could not have been ſo happy without freedom of choice, as we may now be in conſequence of our being endowed with it. It is with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure we view ourſelves as dignified with the power of free election, and the exerciſe of this power is always attended with ſatisfaction; but with ſatisfaction of the higheſt kind, and in the higheſt degree within the reach of our capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities, when exerciſed in a due manner, and in conſiſtency with what is right and fit. If we cannot diſcern the benevolence of God, and the greatneſs of it, in implanting this power in our nature, it ſhould ſeem as though it muſt be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we have ſo blinded our eyes that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:018397_0142_0FA70C44FB87AF60"/>
or hardened our hearts that we will not, ſee and own it to the praiſe of the glory of his goodneſs.</p>
            <p>Another power ſtill, relative to moral agen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and an highly beneficial one, is <hi>conſcience.</hi> No one will deny, that this is one of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers implanted in our nature. It is an object of immediate perception. We all feel, or have felt, its operation in us.</p>
            <p>It would carry me too far out of the way of my preſent deſign, ſhould I enlarge in aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining with preciſion the more ſpecial office of this power, in diſtinction from the other powers we are endowed with. It may, however be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful juſt to ſay, that its office is that of a witneſs, not of a law-giver. The work appropriated to it is, not to point out to us the virtues we ought to practice, or the vices we ought to avoid, which would be to invade the province of ſome other of our powers; but to be in our breaſts a teſtifier for, or againſt us, as we have done that which we knew to be right, or wrong. The apoſtle Paul has given us a very exact account of the work of conſcience, in his epiſtle to the Romans. Speaking there of thoſe Gentiles, in his day, who, not having the revealed law, yet practiſed, from the principles planted in their nature, the duties which this law preſcribed, he ſays, they herefrom made it evident, that they were not wholly deſtitute of a rule or ſtandard for their moral conduct, for that the law of God appeared from hence to be, as it were,
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:018397_0143_0FA70C45E21EAE20"/>
engraven on their hearts: Upon which he adds, "their conſcience alſo bearing witneſs, and their thoughts the mean while accuſing or elſe excuſing one another." This great apoſtle ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curately diſtinguiſhes here between "the law written on the heart," and "conſcience;" not making it the work of conſcience to tell men what the precepts of this law were, but to teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify in their favor, or disfavor, as they had been either obedient or diſobedient to them; in conſequence of which their thoughts either ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit or condemn them. This witneſs-bearing power of conſcience may, it is true, be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in its influence, and diverted in ſuch a variety of ways, that the deſign and tendency of its implantation in us may not be ſo fully anſwered, as might be wiſhed. Virtuous men may, through ſuperſtitious fears, wrong notions in religion, unreaſonable jealouſies and ſuſpicions, loſe in a great meaſure, the advantage that would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ariſe from the teſtimony of conſcience in their favor. And vicious men by blinding their eyes, and hardening their hearts, may ſo hinder the operation of its witneſs, as that the check it would give to their mad courſe of conduct is, in a manner, taken away. But it is capable, even with reſpect to ſuch men as theſe, of being ſo rouſed as that its voice ſhall be hearkened to. In ſpite of all their efforts to the contrary, it will aſſure them, and upon teſtimony carrying with it ſtronger evidence than a thouſand out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward witneſſes, if God has not been in their
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:018397_0144_0FA70C4686F4AF78"/>
thoughts, but they have behaved with irrever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and undutifulneſs towards him, that they are impious wretches; if they have gone on in a courſe of fraudulent, unjuſt dealing, that they are knaves; and if they have accuſtomed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to an intemperate, unchaſte, lewd way of living, that they are thorough-paced debauchees. In theſe, and ſuch like caſes, it will ſay to them, as Nathan did to David, "Thou art the man." How advantageous a power then is conſcience? How kindly, as well as wiſely, is it adapted to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote, on the one hand, the right exerciſe of our moral liberty, and, on the other, to reſtrain us from all vicious practice? Our Creator there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore has manifeſted benevolence in giving this power a place in our conſtitution. And his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence will ſhine out with yet more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous luſtre, if we go on, and conſider the affections, or paſſions, he has annexed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, as auxiliaries in order to anſwer the end of the implantation of this power in us. They are ſuch as theſe.</p>
            <p>Joy, upon its giving teſtimony to a man's ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving acted his part well. If there are any, who have not felt the working of this affection, it muſt be becauſe it was never in the power of conſcience to ſet it in motion. For the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurable ſenſation to which we give the name of joy is naturally connected with its witneſs to a man's having done what was right. The apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Paul has expreſſed this in very ſignificant words. Says he, "This is our rejoicing, the
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:018397_0145_0FA70C491D1553E8"/>
teſtimony of our conſcience, that in ſimplicity, and godly ſincerity, not by fleſhly wiſdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation in the world." And what he has thus ſaid perfectly accords with the truth of known expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience. A converſation ordered, not by the wiſdom of this world, but by the rule of ſtrict virtue, will put it in the power of conſcience to tell the man, whoſe character this is, that he has done well; up<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n which, agreeably to a Divine eſtabliſhment, that affection, unleſs obſtructed in its motion, will be excited, which will yield joy much greater, both in kind and degree, than their's, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe only pleaſure is that which takes riſe from their bodily ſenſes. A moſt kind and powerful incentive this, to virtuous practice.</p>
            <p>And as the witneſs of c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nſcience, when in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor of a man, is connected with joy; ſo is its teſtimony, when againſt him, accompanied with ſhame. This is a paſſion we can much better underſtand the meaning of by internal feelings than by outward deſcription. And we are none of us ignorant of what is intended by it, as we have often had occaſion, from our own perceptions, to know what it is. Its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per object is that which is, in its nature, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful. And as nothing is more reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful than moral deformity, nothing is more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully fitted to excite the exerciſe of this paſſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n. And the God of nature has ſo formed us, that we cannot eaſily avoid the motion of
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:018397_0146_0FA70C4F4603FE48"/>
ſhame, upon having made ourſelves morally deformed, eſpecially when conſcience ſhall ſpeak to us, and tell us that this is our juſt character. There have all along been, it muſt be owned, and there now are thoſe, who, by debauching their minds, and weakening, if not deſtroying, their natural ſenſibility, have, in a manner, eradicated the innate principle of ſhame, being able, without a bluſh, notwithſtanding the power of conſcience, to do thoſe things which are groſsly ignominious and reproachful. This is emphatically expreſſed, by Jeremiah, in theſe words, "Thou haſt a whore's forehead, thou refuſedſt to be aſhamed." And again, "Were they aſhamed, when they had committed abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination? Nay, they were not at all aſhamed, neither could they bluſh." But this is not the ordinary ſtate of vicious men. Few, compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, are ſo blinded, and hardened, as not to be filled with confuſion of face, when conſcience tells them in direct and poſitive terms, that they have been, and know that they have been, adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, fornicators, oppreſſors, extortioners, and the like. Such is the turpitude of theſe vices, and ſuch the ſuitableneſs in their nature, to excite ſhame, that this paſſion, when they have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted theſe abominations, and conſcience teſtifies to them that they have, will be put into mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in a leſs or greater degree, even by an eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhed conſtitution of heaven, till the very paſſion itſelf has been ſo debilitated, as to have no power to raiſe a bluſh. And it is in kindneſs
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:018397_0147_0FA70C5046C3C020"/>
to the world, that the God of nature has im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted in man this paſſion of ſhame. It is one of the ſtrongeſt reſtraints from an undue, wrong uſe of our moral liberty. And was it not for this powerful reſtraint, mankind would be more abandoned to vicious conduct than they now are, as we may reaſonably conclude from the mad behaviour of thoſe, who, by their debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheries, have ſo ſuppreſſed the operation of this paſſion, as that they are able, notwithſtanding its implantation in them, to commit abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in almoſt every kind, without being aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of what they have done. But it may be worth remembering here, even theſe ſhameleſs livers in the practice of vice may, upon ſome ſolemn alarm in providence, have their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſo awakened, as to bear witneſs to their abuſe of their moral liberty in ſo lively and powerful a manner, as to diſenable them to look back upon their paſt follies without the emotion of ſhame, and to a degree that will not ſuffer them to live at eaſe. The exact truth is, Such is the moral deformity of vice, ſuch its ignominious and diſgraceful nature, that it is naturally fitted to excite ſhame; and there will accordingly be the perception of it in the breaſts of wicked men, whenever they live in the practice of it, and it is teſtified to them by conſcience that they have done ſo, till by an habitual courſe of immoral conduct, they have ſo blinded their eyes, and ſtupified their their hearts, as to be paſt ſeeing and feeling.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="150" facs="unknown:018397_0148_0FA70C50F81B0980"/>There is yet another paſſion capable of being excited upon the witneſs of conſcience againſt a man, and this is that uneaſy ſenſation, which is ſignified by the words, remorſe, regret, horror of mind. Few there be, perhaps none, but have felt, in a greater or leſs degree, the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe words, and of the paſſion inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be pointed out by them; and they know alſo, and from inward perception, that it is a kind of uneaſineſs quite different in its nature fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>m every other. It is eſſentially connected with ſelf-condemnation, a conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and feeling of ill-deſert, upon having done wrong. And the pain of mind capable of being excited herefrom is inexpreſſibly great. The wiſe Solomon has ſaid, "a man may ſuſtain his infirmities, but a wounded ſpirit who can bear?" And this obſervation of his has often been verified in experience. Such has been the preſſure of remorſe, in conſequence of the teſtimony of conſcience, that it has exceeded the patient's art as well as ability to live under it without ſenſations of diſtreſs beyond all deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Some may diſpoſed to think, that this is an argument of defect in the diſplay of the Deity's benevolence, rather than an illuſtration of its greatneſs. But ſuch a miſtake in their appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions muſt ariſe from not duly conſidering the deſign, and tendency of the connection between this remorſe, and the witneſs of conſcience againſt a man, which is, that he might be powerfully guarded againſt vicious practice, which will
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:018397_0149_0FA70C53037475E0"/>
not only deprive him of the happineſs that is peculiar to morally good conduct, but expoſe him to ruin as the final reſult of a licentious, debauched courſe of life. In this view of the matter, the bittereſt remorſe, from a ſenſe of guilt, is an argument of kindneſs in our Maker; yea, of the greatneſs of his benevolence in thus taking care that we might be happy, and not miſerable.</p>
            <p>I have now ſaid what was in my intention to offer, in illuſtration <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>f the Divine benevolence, in the proviſion he has made, by the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the nature he has given us, that we might be morally happy.</p>
            <p>Before I proceed, I ſhall ſubjoin a thought not unworthy of notice, though it ſhould be a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion. It is this.—The paſſions of ſhame, and remorſe, upon the convicti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n of conſcience, are not only an illuſtration of the Deity's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence, in guarding us againſt an ill uſe of our elective power, but a ſtrong proof that we are endowed with this power. Every one knows, from what he has felt within himſelf, the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between thoſe uneaſy ſenſations, that are occaſioned by evils, which are the effects of exterior cauſes, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe operation is neceſſary, and over which we have no command; and thoſe that are the production of our own folly, in miſuſing the power we have over our own vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litions. Uneaſineſs will be excited in a man's breaſt, when he meets with diſappointments; loſſes, and misfortunes, which were brought
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:018397_0150_0FA70C53355941D0"/>
upon him by mechanical cauſes, in a train of neceſſary operations; but he will not feel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe, ſelf-condemnation, and conſcious guilt. And why? The true reaſon is, becauſe theſe evils, however grievous, are the effects, not of his own will, or choice, but of c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uſes extrinſick to himſelf, and whoſe operation it was not in his power to counteract. A man that is born blind may feel the emotion of uneaſineſs on this account, he may be ſorry, and wiſh he had not come into exiſtence with this defect; but he cannot reproach himſelf for it, or feel the leaſt degree of guilty remorſe: Whereas, if he loſt his ſight by an intemperate, debauched courſe of living, he will, if conſcience is ſuffered to do its office, be ſelf-condemned, and filled with bitter reſentments againſt himſelf. In like manner, if the lightning of heaven ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the life of his wife, or child, he would feel the working of grief, but not of ſhame, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe: Whereas, if he maliciouſly laid violent hands on them, and ſlew them, he would, if he was not a monſter, reproach and condemn himſelf, feeling that bitter remorſe which flows from great conſcious guilt. What now ſhould be the reaſon of theſe different ſenſations? It can be no other than this, that there is a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the cauſe of their production. If a man had no power over his volitions, but they were the effects of invoilable neceſſity, in virtue of a previous concatenation of cauſes, he would be no more to blame, nor could be any more
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:018397_0151_0FA70C53F619D2B0"/>
the ſubject of remorſe, than fire which occaſions miſchief, or a ſtone that breaks a man's head by accidentally falling from ſome height. The plain truth is, the ſenſations of ſhame and remorſe are grafted on the ſuppoſition of liberty of choice, in oppoſition to neceſſity. Take away this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and conſider men's volitions, not in their power, but as effects produced in them by cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes exterior to them, over which they have no controul, and they are not, nor can be, the ſubjects of blame, or of that ſhame, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe, which flow from it. And as we are ſo conſtituted by the author of our beings, as that we ſhall, and muſt, blame ourſelves in conſequence of certain volitions, and effects proceeding from them, and feel ſhame and remorſe upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, it ſhould ſeem as evident as it well can be, that we have within ourſelves a power to will, or not to will; to chuſe, or to refuſe. We certainly think we have this power; and we have, at the ſame time, as much reaſon for this conception, as we ſhould have, if this was the real truth. And if it is not, we are ſo made as that, by deception blended with our very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, we are inevitably influenced to condemn ourſelves, and feel the anxieties of guilt, and bitter remorſe, for what we are no more the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of, and no more worthy of blame for, than being laid ſenſeleſs by an apoplectic fit, or a ſtroke of the numb-palſy.</p>
            <p>I now go on, in as brief a manner as I well can, farther to illuſtrate the Divine benevolence
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:018397_0152_0FA70C54E5F479F8"/>
from the providential care he has taken, not only to perpetuate the exiſtence of percipient beings, in all their various claſſes, but to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port them in life, and to render it, agreeably to their reſpective natures, comfortable and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to them.</p>
            <p>Exiſtence in our world is perpetuated, with reſpect to all the claſſes of percipient beings, not by a continued prolongation of life in the ſame individuals, but by a ſucceſſion of others of the ſame kind, in their room, as they, in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious periods, are taken off from the ſtage of time. And an admirably wiſe and benevolent contrivance this is for the beſtowment, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment, of more life and happineſs, than there could have been, if exiſtence had been perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated without death, in the ſame individuals; as we ſhall have occaſion hereafter to point out particularly. In the mean time, it is to be obſerved, that this ſucceſſion in percipient life is effected conformably to a general eſtabliſhed law, that of propagation, which extends to all orders of percipient beings, from the higheſt to the loweſt. Almighty God, without all doubt, could, if he had ſo pleaſed, have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly ſupplied the place of all individuals, of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſpecies, as they ceaſed to be here any longer, by bringing new ones into being, as he did the firſt of our race, by immediate creation; but he choſe rather to do it, by the intervention of ſecond cauſes, operating under his influence and direction. It would have argued benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:018397_0153_0FA70C57C32C2DF8"/>
and to an high degree, had he perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated life and enjoyment in the former of theſe ways; but, as his benevolence is always mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted under the guidance of wiſdom, he has preferred the latter of them; and with good reaſon. For amazing ſkill and contrivance are diſplayed in carrying into effect this law of propagation; and it is ſo done, in concurrence with other wiſely contrived laws, as to ſet off the goodneſs of God in the moſt conſpicuous luſtre. This is a point we ſhall more fully conſider afterwards in its proper place. I ſhall therefore only ſay at preſent, if the giving of life, and a capacity of enjoying happineſs, to vaſtly various claſſes of beings, with innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable individuals in every claſs, is a proof of benevolence, it muſt be a greatly enhanced evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of it, to perpetuate this life, and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of enjoyment, in ſo many ſucceſſions, through all ages, from the beginning of time. It will ſurely betray blindneſs of intellectual ſight, or badneſs of heart, if we cannot diſcern the diſplay of riches of goodneſs, in thus mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proviſion for prolonging, and multiplying, both life and happineſs to ſuch millions of creatures.</p>
            <p>The manifeſtation of the Divine benevolence is likewiſe marvellouſly conſpicuous in the care God continually takes for the preſervation and comfort of life in all the claſſes of percipient creatures, however numerous, when, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation, they are brought into exiſtence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="156" facs="unknown:018397_0154_0FA70C58783BB8B0"/>To ſupport life, ſo as that it may be enjoyed with pleaſure, in a ſingle individual only, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues benevolence; it will argue it, in a ſtill higher degree, ſhould it be ſupported, with enjoyment, in a claſs of percipient beings, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a goodly number of individuals: But how amazingly muſt the argument riſe in ſtrength, when the claſſes of creatures are nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous beyond conception, and the individuals in thoſe claſſes much more ſo! Did we behold, among men of large ability to do good, one who found within himſelf a heart to provide and diſtribute ſupplies to hundreds of perſons, conflicting with the ſtraits and difficulties ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from poverty, and in ſuch noble meaſures as to render life pleaſant to them, and ſaw him going on doing this in a ſteady uniform courſe, accounting and feeling himſelf happy in the ſatisfaction of others from the communications of his bounty: I ſay, if we knew of ſuch a man, what would be our ſentiments of him in regard of benevolence? We ſhould think him a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle of goodneſs. We ſhould never mention his name but with honor, and eſteem him wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be held in high reputation by all who have any degree of rational moral diſcernment. But what a nothing is the benevolence of this good man, in compariſon with the benevolence of God, whoſe bounty daily ſupports millions of men, and numberleſs millions of inferior creatures, has ſupported them through thouſands of paſt ſucceſſions in life, and will yet ſupport
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:018397_0155_0FA70C5CF5BBDFE8"/>
them, having ſettled an eſtabliſhment herefor, till time ſhall be no more.</p>
            <p>The preſerving providence of God extends even to vegetables, who, in all their kinds, and individuals, have life though with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out perception; which life is preſerved and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuated by ſucceſſion, and ſo as to manifeſt all-wiſe goodneſs, though not to thoſe exiſtences themſelves, not being capable of enjoyment, yet to others, who, together with life, are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with a perceptive power. Of theſe I am now more particularly ſpeaking, and they are all the providential care of a good God. He maintains life in them, in their nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous claſſes, and ſtill more numerous indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals, and carries it on to its appointed ſtate of maturity and perfection, and all along with a balance of pleaſure in their favor. Whether they are men or beaſts; whether they are fowls of the air, or fiſhes of the ſea; whether they are inſects, or other animals ſo low in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending ſcale of ſubordination, as not to be viſible to human ſight, but by the help of glaſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; the benevolent God is the grand efficient in ſupporting their life, and providing for its comfort. It is true, they are both ſupported, and provided for, by the intervention of ſecond cauſes; but, far from leſſening, this increaſes the greatneſs and glory of the Divine goodneſs. Did God immediately preſerve and happily life in his creatures, the beneficence hereby diſplayed would be confined to a ſingle act of
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:018397_0156_0FA70C5E033077A0"/>
his power only; but as he does this by a trai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of intervening means, and inſtrumental cauſes, his goodneſs is, as it were, multiplied in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the variety of theſe wiſely adapted means and cauſes. For they are all inſtances of goodneſs, as truly as one immediate act of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er would be. A very ſenſible writer has per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently expreſſed himſelf upon this head, in theſe words; "whatever God effects by the interpoſition of means, and a train of interme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate cauſes, he could produce by his own im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate power. He wants not clouds to diſtil rain, nor human induſtry to make the earth fruitful, nor the fruitfulneſs of the earth to ſupply food, nor food to ſuſtain life. He could do this by his own immediate power. But he chooſes to manifeſt his providence, power, wiſdom, and goodneſs, in a variety of inſtances, and diſpoſitions; and yet, his power and goodneſs are not only as much concerned, and exerciſed, in this way, as if he produced the end without the intervention of means, but even much more: Becauſe his power, wiſdom, and goodneſs are as much exerted, and illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, in every ſingle intermediate ſtep, as if he had done the thing at once, without any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termediate ſtep at all. There is as much pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, wiſdom, and goodneſs exerciſed in produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing rain, or in making the earth fruitful, or in adapting food to the nouriſhment of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: I ſay, there is as much power, wiſdom, and goodneſs, exerciſed in any one of theſe
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:018397_0157_0FA70C5EBA397CB0"/>
ſteps, as there would be in nouriſhing our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies by one immediate act, without thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termediate means." In the method of prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration therefore, which God has pitched upon, he has in admirable wiſdom contrived ſo to exerciſe his goodneſs, as both to multiply and beautifully diverſify the diſplays of it. For this is the real truth, with reſpect to every inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate ſtep in the way of preſerving provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. It is by vapors exhaled from the earth and ſeas, by the heat of the ſun, that the clouds are formed: it is from the clouds that the rain falls; it is by the rain, and other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring cauſes, that vegetables of every ſpecies, with their individuals, are preſerved in life and growth; it is by means of theſe vegetables, that innumerable multitudes of inferior perceptive creatures are ſupplied with food; and it is from both theſe, that we men, the higheſt order of beings in this lower world, are nouriſhed and ſupported in life and vigor. What an aſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhing train of intermediate inſtrumental cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are held out to view, as made uſe of in carrying on the great and important work of preſervation! And yet, every one of theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental cauſes, as intended, eſtabliſhed, and adapted, to accompliſh the preſervation of life, manifeſt goodneſs, and to a marvellous degree, as truly as if it was effcted by one almighty act of immediate power; and as juſtly gi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for grateful acknowledgments to that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely benevolent being, who is thus good to
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:018397_0158_0FA70C5F49404170"/>
all his creatures, and continually ſo, as he every moment concurs with each one of theſe vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſubordinate cauſes by whoſe operation, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his influence, they are ſo provided for as to be ſupplied with the ſupports of life.</p>
            <p>It may with pertinency be added here, that the benevolence of God, had it not been diſplayed under the guidance of perfect wiſdom, would probably have preſerved life, in the creatures to whom he had given it, in an immediate way by one continued ſingle act of power. But his goodneſs, as manifeſted in ſuch a way, would have been leſs, far leſs, than in the way of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental means and cauſes, the way in which it is now done. In order to convey a clear and juſt idea of this, let it be obſerved,</p>
            <p>It is not conceivable, how the inferior crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, in any of their claſſes, could have had pleaſure in life, had it been ſupported without means, by a continued ſingle act of almighty power. For it is by the means employed in preſerving their life, that they are the percipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents of moſt of that enjoyment they are made capable of. Was it not for the food they live upon, and the ſatisfaction they take in procur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and then eating it, of what advantage would life be to them? In what way could they enjoy it, or be happy in its continuance to them? It is owing to the wiſdom of God, in ſo contriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to preſerve their life, as that his goodneſs is not only manifeſted, but the manifeſtation of it is multiplied in proportion to the multiplication
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:018397_0159_0FA70C601C14ACC8"/>
of the means that are uſed to this end, for that theſe means give riſe to the delight they take in life. Had your life been preſerved by an immediate act of power, where ſhould we have looked for the happineſs proper to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective natures? Their life, ſo far as we are able to judge, muſt have been preſerved in vain. There would have been nothing, which could have yielded them pleaſure. The admirable contrivance diſcovered in their various ſenſes, and ſuiting objects to them, would have been to no purpoſe. Both their ſenſes, and theſe objects, would have been altogether uſeleſs. They could not have been the means of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification to them.</p>
            <p>And the ſame may be ſaid of us men, ſo far as we agree with the inferior creatures, as to our animal part. We, as truly as they, are ſo made with reſpect to our bodies, that life, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as bodily only, would have yielded us, comparatively, little or no delight, had it been ſupported by an immediate exertion of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God. There would, in this caſe, have been no room for thoſe inſtrumental, ſecondary cauſes, in the adminiſtration of providence, which are now, not only the means by which we are continued in bodily life, but the means alſo by which our life, in this view of it, is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered pleaſant and happy to us. To what purpoſe was the wiſdom of God employed, in ſo curiouſly contriving our bodily <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>culties, and adapting ſo great a variety of objects to give
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:018397_0160_0FA70C64472335A0"/>
them pleaſure, if it was not, that he might diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play his goodneſs, and the riches of it, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving life in a way, that ſhould be cloſely connected with making it, at the ſame time, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirably ſweet and pleaſant? And this goodneſs of his is enlarged in proportion to the number, variety, and adaptation of thoſe objects, which are, at once, the means both of preſerving life, and rendering it more happy than it could have been, in the way of power immediately exert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from above.</p>
            <p>But the goodneſs of God, in the work of preſervation, with reſpect to us men, is not confined, as it is in regard of the inferior crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to the animal pleaſure only, which he has connected with his continuing us in life, and the mediate way in which he does it. For, as we are endowed with intellectual and moral powers, as well as bodily ſenſes and appetites, we are made capable of happineſs, and in a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble degree, by the exerciſe of theſe powers upon the very means, and inſtrumental cauſes, by which we are ſupported in life. The amazing contrivance God has manifeſted, in the forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our bodies with ſenſes and appetites, and in the adaptation of ſuch a multiplicity of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to give them ſatisfaction within reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble limits, is a vaſtly plentiful ſource of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to the mind, as well as body, but in a far ſuperior and more exalted kind. Is the body ſo fitted, by its make, to be ſupported, and, at the ſame time, delighted by this variety of
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:018397_0161_0FA70C64FAD63D98"/>
objects, the mind alſo is ſo framed, as to be capable of being much more delighted in the view it may take of the riches of wiſdom and ſkill, the Deity has manifeſted in ſo contriving the method of ſuſtentation, as that, by means of it, we may enjoy the happineſs that is ſuited to the nature of intelligent, as well as animal beings. The conſtitution, indeed, of the earth we live on is ſuch, that moſt of its producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons appear to have been intended, as they are well adapted, to carry into effect the work of preſervation, ſo as that, we might not only be ſupported by a vaſt variety deſirable for food, raiment, and the reaſonable gratification of our bodily appetites, but that we might alſo take occaſion, even from this very way in which our bodily life is ſupported, and with pleaſure, ſo to exerciſe our mental powers, as that, unleſs it be owning to ourſelves, we may be even more happy as intelligent, than animal crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. And we may be ſtill more happy as moral beings. For among all the objects in nature, though they are inconceivably multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with variety, there is not one that is ſuited to the preſervation and comfort of life, and made uſe of by the Deity to this purpoſe, but what affords juſt matter for, and a powerful excite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to, thoſe religious, devotional, grateful acknowledgments to our daily preſerver and benefactor, which conſtitute no ſmall part of that moral happineſs we are made capable of. There are, perhaps, few truly pious perſons, bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="164" facs="unknown:018397_0162_0FA70C6540C18AE0"/>
have felt more pleaſure in contemplating, admir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and adoring the amazingly wiſe, and benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent way, in which they are ſupported in life with ſo much comfort, than they ever did from the gratification of their bodily ſenſes. They certainly might; and if they have not, it muſt be aſcribed to the dullneſs of their moral per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, or a faulty perverſion of it.</p>
            <p>The truth is, had the preſervation of life, in the creatures on whom God has beſtowed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtencé in this world, been affected by a ſingle continued exertion of Almighty power, there would not have been that multiplied manifeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Divine goodneſs, which we have now ſo much reaſon to admire, and be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for. The alwiſe God, no doubt, could have made man, and the other percipient be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings on earth, and preſerved them in life, by an immediate act of power; but then their make, and the way in which they might be fitted for the enjoyment of happineſs, muſt have been, in many reſpects, different from what it now is, and the whole conſtitution of the world alſo muſt have been modelled upon a different plan. Poſſibly, there may be ſuch creatures, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>riſting in ſuch a world. But for ſuch crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as exiſt in ſuch a world as our's, prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in life, not by ſecondary inſtrumental cauſes, but an immediate exertion of power, would be ſo far from increaſing, that it would leſſen, the manifeſtations of the Divine benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. For, in the latter of theſe ways, its ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:018397_0163_0FA70C65F7DD6058"/>
would be confined to one act only, whereas, in the latter, it is manifeſted in every intermediate ſtep, and is conſequently diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and multiplied, in proportion to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and variety of them.</p>
            <p>There is yet, in the adminiſtration of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, another proof of the Divine goodneſs, and a more ſtriking one, to thoſe who are belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in revelation, than any that have been mentioned. It is the redemption of man by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>This great work of God, as we are told in the ſcriptures, from whence alone all our knowledge of this matter muſt be fetched, took riſe from his rich love, and diſintereſted good will towards the race of man. The infinitely good God, if we may depend upon the bible, was not exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to purpoſe, or contrive, or reveal, or exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the goſpel-plan of ſalvation, by any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive extraneous to himſelf; but benevolence of heart was the true ſource, and the only one, from whence it all proceeded. Had not God been moved by the eſſential, immenſe goodneſs of his own nature, he would not have come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it. The movement hereto was within himſelf. He conſulted his own bowels of love and mercy, and from hence it was, that he employed his wiſdom to contrive it. It ſprang from this ſource antecedently to all other conſiderations whatever.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="166" facs="unknown:018397_0164_0FA70C66F6A3ABC0"/>But then it ſhould be minded, the miſſion of his own ſon from heaven, into our world to become incarnate, that he might by being obedient to death, make atonement for the ſins of men, and by his exaltation, in conſequence of this obedient ſubmiſſion, at the right hand of God to finiſh the work, he had begun on earth, are the grand means by which this ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penduous benevolence of the Deity, in the buſineſs of ſalvation, is carried into effect. Only, it ſhould be carefully obſerved, that neither the incarnation of the bleſſed Jeſus, nor any thing he ever did, or ſuffered, or may be now doing in heaven, are to be conſidered as the original motive to the plan of redemption. For the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervening mediation of Jeſus Chriſt was poſterior to, and conſequent upon, this good will of God, and one of the glorious effects of it. The ſcripture always views it in this point of light. Some may have expreſſed themſelves, ſo as to lead one to think, that the blood of Chriſt was was ſhed to pacify the reſentments of God, and to produce in him a willingneſs to become reconcilable to ſinful man. But ſuch a mode of conception is highly injurious to the father of mercies, and utterly ſubverſive of that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence in God, to which even the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſt to be the Savior was originally owing. So far was the blood of Chriſt from being intended to work upon the heart of God, and ſtir up compaſſion in him, that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> was love,
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:018397_0165_0FA70C67AF8688D0"/>
and becauſe he delighted in mercy, that he "ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him not, but delivered him up for us all."</p>
            <p>The incarnation, obedience, ſufferings, and death of Chriſt are therefore to be conſidered as the way, or method, in which the wiſdom of God thought fit to bring into event the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of man. And a moſt wiſely concerted me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod it is. In this way, mankind are obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly led into juſt ſentiments of the vile nature, and deſtructive deſert of ſin; as alſo of that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred regard, which God will forever ſhew to the honor of his own governing authority: Nor could they, in any way, have been more powerfully engaged to turn from their iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and ſubmit to the government of heaven, as preparatives without which they can have no reaſonable hope of being happy. Perhaps, there is nothing more powerfully ſuited to work on the human mind, impreſſing it with an holy awe and reverence of the Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, hatred of ſin and reſolutions to forſake it, than a ſerious turn of thought to the ſorrows and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Jeſus Chriſt, appointed by the wiſdom of an infinitely benevolent God, as the only way, in which he has judged it expedient to admit his offending creatures to the benefit of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. What horrible ideas muſt that man en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain of ſin, what adorable apprehenſions of the authority, the righteouſneſs, and holineſs of the great Govern<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r of the world, who conſiders, in a believing, realiſing, affecting manner, what the bleſſed Jeſus did, and ſuffered, in his ſtate
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:018397_0166_0FA70C684BBEAB08"/>
of humiliation, as the only method conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to which the alwiſe God, though infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good, has thought fit to make the grant of forgiving mercy?</p>
            <p>Though this method of our redemption by Jeſus Chriſt appears to be a wiſely concerted one for the diſplay of the Divine benevolence, on account of the reaſons we have mentioned; yet we may, at preſent, be ignorant of other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which concur to make it ſo. We muſt indeed be acquainted with the whole affair of redemption, that is, with the whole effect that would have been conſequent upon ſin, and the whole effect of deliverance from it, and this throughout our whole exiſtence; and we muſt alſo be acquainted with all the ways, in which there may be a connection between the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating work of Chriſt, and ſalvation, before we may, with any face of propriety, pretend per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly to ſee into the wiſdom of this method of God's manifeſting his benevolence. It may be a mean moſt wiſely connected with its propoſed end in ways unthought of by us at preſent. Nor is this an objection of any weight againſt its fitneſs as a mean well adapted to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh its end. For it is a certain truth; that moral means often look forward to diſtant fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity, and the wiſdom of their connection, with the end to be effected by them, is not diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, at leaſt in perfection, till the end and the means can be compared with each other. The ſtate of things, for inſtance, under the Moſaic
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:018397_0167_0FA70C69229FB560"/>
diſpenſation, was, according to the new-teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment repreſentation, a moral mean in order to ſome future, diſtant end; and its fitneſs, as ſuch, was little underſtood till the diſpenſation of the Meſſias: Nor is it yet ſo clearly and fully perceived, as perhaps it may be, even in this world, in the coming days of greater light and knowledge, and certainly will be in that world, where we ſhall "know even as we are known." And this is undoubtedly the caſe, with reference to the method of our ſalvation by Jeſus Chriſt. It was contrived by God, in order to his wiſely diſplaying his benevolence towards ſinners. And the ſcripture has ſaid enough to ſatisfy us for the preſent, that it is a wiſe and fit method, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in thoſe ways wherein we have ſhewn it to be ſo: But there is no need of ſuppoſing, that it has fully revealed the whole of what may be known in another world, tending to il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate the wiſdom of it; what I mean is, that revelation may not have explained in direct, and poſitively clear and full terms, wherein "the obedience of Chriſt to death" has virtue and efficacy in the affair of man's redemption, as a wiſe, fit, and benevolent mean in order to this end. And, perhaps, it might not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient it ſhould, had it been poſſible.</p>
            <p>But ſome may ſay, this method of ſalvation, through the mediatory doings and ſufferings of Jeſus Chriſt, inſtead of magnifying the benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the Deity, is rather a dimination of it, if not an inconſiſtency with it. And ſo it really
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:018397_0168_0FA70C69C8AE0008"/>
would be, if God had wanted pity, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the mediation of Chriſt had been to excite it in him; but this was no part of the intention of his undertaking for ſinners. For it was God who ſent him upon this work; and he was moved to it from his own bowels of mercy. His own infinite benevolence of heart put him upon it: Nor ſhould we ever have heard of Chriſt, or of the way of redemption through him, if the motive hereto had not been within the breaſt of God. This is the account the ſcripture always gives of the matter. Says our Savior himſelf, "God ſo loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh but have everlaſting life." Every word in this text is emphatically expreſſive of the truth we are upon." God ſo loved the world," ſo greatly, ſo inconceivably; was ſo moved by the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, eſſential, and eternal goodneſs of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that "he gave," that is, of meer mercy and free favor; without any thing obliging, or conſtraining him hereto; he gave "his only begotten ſon," and for this moſt benevolent end, that "whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life." You obſerve, the gift of Chriſt, through which we have redemption, ſprang originally from the love of God. His own merciful nature put him upon the beſtowment of this gift, and upon no leſs a deſign than the ſaving of men from deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and opening a way for their admiſſion to
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:018397_0169_0FA70C6B7775A1C0"/>
life and immortality in heaven. The ſame ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count is frequently to be met with elſewhere in the new-teſtament books. Says the apoſtle Paul, "God commendeth his love towards us, in that, while we were yet ſinners, Chriſt died for us." You perceive at once, that God's love is here repreſented as that which gave riſe even to Chriſt's dying for us. To the like purpoſe is that declaration of the apoſtle John, "In this was manifeſted the love of God towards us, becauſe that God ſent his only begotten ſon into the world, that we might live through him." And the ſame thing is either expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or implied in many other paſſages in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which it would be needleſs to mention. And wherein could the Deity have more illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly diſplayed the greatneſs of his benevolence, than by the conſtitution of his own ſon to be the medium through whom ſalvation ſhould be communicated to us?</p>
            <p>It may perhaps be ſaid, Had God, by one ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle act of free, ſovereign grace, without any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervening means, proclaimed his readineſs to pardon ſinners, and admit them to his favorable notice, would he not have manifeſted more goodneſs, have more, conſpicuouſly diſplayed the riches of his grace, than he could have done in any other way?</p>
            <p>It would, no doubt, have been evidential of goodneſs, if God had thus made an abſolute ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign grant of pardoning, ſaving mercy to the ſinful ſons of men; but there would in this way,
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:018397_0170_0FA70C6C3B7FFAB8"/>
have been a far leſs manifeſtation of it, than in the method the goſpel reveals. Had the work of preſerving providence been effected by a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle act of almighty power, though it would have argued goodneſs it would not have done it, as has been ſhewn, with ſuch conſpicuous variety, and enlargedneſs, as by the interven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of means, and inſtrumental cauſes. The ſame may be ſaid, with like truth, of the work of redemption. As it is carried into effect, not by an abſolute ſovereign grant from God, but in a mediate way, his benevolence is more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly illuſtrated than it otherwiſe would, or could, have been. For it is as true, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to redeeming grace, as preſerving good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that it is inhanced by every intervening ſtep by which it is carried on, and in proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the number and important worth of theſe ſteps. It argues benevolence in God, that he ſhould find within himſelf an heart to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a thought of ſaving ſinful man; his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence is greater, in that he ſhould be willing to ſend his own Son, from heaven into our world, in order to accompliſh this purpoſe of his heart; the benevolence is ſtill heightened, in ſending him, though "in the form of God," to take upon him "the faſhion of a man;" and it riſes beyond all conception, when we behold this Son of his love, after he had aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med human nature, "becoming obedient to death, the death of the croſs," hereby making way for the beſtowment of pardoning, ſaving
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:018397_0171_0FA70C6CBB10ED08"/>
mercy, ſo as that the beſtowment of it ſhould be honorary to his perfections, and the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of his government as Ruler of the world. Surely, the goodneſs, as well as wiſdom of God, are diſplayed much more illuſtriouſly in this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate way, than if it had been effected by one meer ſovereign act of grace! Yea, ſo fear as we are able to judge, m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>re benevolence is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in this method of our redemption, than in all the other works of God's providence; and we have abundant reaſon given us, upon this occaſion, to admire and exclaim, "Herein is love, not that we have loved God, but that he has loved us, and ſent his ſon to be the propitiation for our ſins! O the breadth, and length, and depth, and height of the love of God! It paſſeth all underſtanding."</p>

            <head>PART III. Anſwering the principal objections which have been urged againſt the benevolence of the Deity.</head>
            <p>THE traces of goodneſs are ſo viſible, in every part of the creation we know any thing about, particularly in this world of our's, and in the formation of man, his implanted fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, and the methods by which, according to eſtabliſhed laws, under the government of providence, they may be improved to his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as perfect and happy as can reaſonably be deſired, that it is ſtrange any ſhould call in queſtion the Creator's benevolence: And yet, no one of his attributes have been more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently attacked. The great difficulty objected, is the evil there is in the world. This world of our's, and mankind in particular, its nobleſt inhabitants, which are repreſented as monuments of the Deity's goodneſs, are mentioned as proofs of a deficiency in this very point.</p>
            <p>Say theſe objectors, if an infinitely benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Being is the Supreme Creator, and Ruler, whence came thoſe imperfections, and poſitive evils, which abound in the world, and which all ranks of creatures are ſubjected to? How ſhall we account for the miſeries, in innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble kinds, which men in particular lie groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:018397_0173_0FA70C6E4D2A6450"/>
under? What ſhall we ſay of the many diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, accompanied with torment of body, and anguiſh of mind, to which they are liable, and which finally put an end to their preſent ſtate of exiſtence? And could theſe things be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for, who can reconcile that <hi>moral</hi> ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularity, which has been introduced into the world, and its direful effects, with the ſuper-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending agency and government of a being abſolutely holy and good?</p>
            <p>This, in general, is the difficulty pleaded. And a very great one it is; but a difficulty, it may be worth remarking, as we paſs along, not levelled againſt Chriſtians only, or the religion they profeſs, but againſt all religion, natural as well as revealed: Inſomuch, that let men's religion be what it may, whether they are Jews or Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, Deiſts or Chriſtians, they are equally em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſed with it. For it being a ſure fact, that ſin and miſery are in the world, if they believe that a wiſe and good God made and governs it, they are all under like obligations to do what they can to reconcile theſe two things, which have ſuch an appearance of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtency with each other. And this accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly has been the endeavor of perſons of all different religions, in all parts of the world. <hi>Whence came evil?</hi> has indeed, in all ages, been a perplexing queſtion; and no one, it may be, has more puzzled the greateſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders to reaſon, as well as religion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="176" facs="unknown:018397_0174_0FA70C71A4ED9918"/>It was this that gave riſe to the ſcheme of <hi>two independent oppoſite principles</hi> in the univerſe; the one good, from wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>m is derived every thing that is good; the other evil, from whom is derived every thing that is evil, whether natural or moral. It is obſervable, even this Manichean notion, however ridiculous, is yet founded on the ſuppoſition of ſuch evidences of goodneſs in the creation, as are too glaring to be denied. The fault therefore of the ſyſtem is, not ſo much that it diſputes the exiſtence of a benevolent cauſe, as that it weakly imagines the exiſtence of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther oppoſite one, equally powerful and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent; the ſuppoſition of which two co-or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate Deities looks too much like an arbitrary contrivance, invented only for the ſake of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving away the difficulty ariſing from the appearance of evil. To be ſure, it is an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion ſo far from being founded on ſolid proof, that it cannot be ſupported by any argument fetched from the principles of true reaſon. It is indeed a ſcheme utterly deſtructive of itſelf. For theſe two oppoſite principles being, by ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, perfectly equal, it is impoſſible there ſhould have been, either good or evil, unleſs by their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual conſent in operation; and it is impoſſible alſo there ſhould have been this conſent, upon any other plan than that, of the production of good and evil in equal proportions. And is this the truth of fact? So far from it, that, in the whole circle of exiſtence, there is no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of ſuch equality. The truth is, the
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:018397_0175_0FA70C73DE49A1B0"/>
uniform, invariable tendency of nature, with reſpect to all the creatures we know any thing of, is their perfection and happineſs within their proper ſphere: Nor can it be truly ſaid of any ſpecies of creatures that they do not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually attain to the enjoyment of good, much out-weighing the evil they are obliged to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer; which could not have been the caſe, if there was exiſting an evil power of opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion equal to the good one. Some of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, upon this hypotheſis, muſt have carried the marks of the evil principles that produced them, in the tendency of their conſtitution to miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, balancing the tendency of it to good: Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, there would not be an equality in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertions of theſe oppoſite equal powers.—But I need not enlarge in the refutation of ſo pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable an abſurdity. However, the difficulty, which occaſioned it, deſerves to be ſeriouſly and thoroughly debated. A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> this will be more clearly and intelligibly done, by going over its ſeveral parts, and treating them diſtinctly as ſo many objections.</p>
            <p>Only, it may be fit to make one previous general remark, which I eſteem an important one, and deſire may be kept in mind through the whole that may follow. It is this; that no objection ought to be eſteemed ſufficient to ſet aſide the poſitive proof, that has been given of the Deity's benevolence, which, when thoroughly examined, will be found finally to terminate in IGNORANCE. What I mean is, that no appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:018397_0176_0FA70C74E526C1E8"/>
in nature, capable of being alledged, ought to be looked upon as concluſively arguing an <hi>inconſiſtency</hi> with goodneſs, MEERLY or ONLY becauſe we may not be able particularly and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to point out their conſiſtency with each other: I ſay, meerly or only for this reaſon, becauſe there is an evident difference between our not particularly diſcerning wherein the <hi>conſiſtency</hi> of two things lies, and clearly perceiving that there is a <hi>real inconſiſtency</hi> between them. And could any <hi>appearance</hi> be alledged, between <hi>which</hi> and <hi>infinite goodneſs,</hi> the human mind clearly perceives a <hi>real inconſiſtency,</hi> it is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily confeſſed, it would be a ſufficient reſtraint, in true reaſon, from attributing this perfection to the <hi>Deity.</hi> But the caſe is quite otherwiſe, where the amount of all that can be ſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning any appearance is only this, that it ſurpaſſes our ability particularly to trace the ways, wherein it may tend to <hi>good.</hi> And ſhall it be thought ſtrange that there ſhould be, in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture appearances of this ſort? It is no more than might reaſonably be expected, conſidering the imperfection of our faculties, and incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city therefrom to view the works of <hi>God</hi> as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with, and dependant on, each other, in the Divine plan of operation. No eye but God's can take in the <hi>whole ſcheme</hi> of creation and providence. And therefore it is probable, the higheſt order of created beings are inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of ſeeing perfectly into the reaſons of the Divine conduct. Much leſs may it be thought,
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:018397_0177_0FA70C74F80B2330"/>
that this ſhould be the privilege of ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively low, weak creatures as we are. So far are we from comprehending the connection of the univerſe in its various parts, their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual dependence on, and ſubordination to, each other, that our knowledge is confined to a few beings and things in it, and to a very ſmall part of the ſcheme of God, even with reſpect to theſe. And ſhall it then be counted an objection of any weight againſt the goodneſs of God's works, that we are not able, in every inſtance, to ſee wherein they are connected with <hi>good?</hi> Ought it not rather, to be concluded, as to ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, that the defect lies, not in the tendency of God's works, but in our incapacity to connect them together, and view them in the reference they bear to each other? This is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly no more than a fit expreſſion of humility and modeſty in ſuch ſhort-ſighted creatures as we are. And it were to be wiſhed, that our inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries into the meaſures of the Divine conduct were more generally made under the habitual influence of theſe principles. I would not be miſunderſtood in what I now ſay. I have no intention to reſtrain mankind, imperfect as they are, from reaſoning with all freedom upon the preſent, or any other ſubject, wherein the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity is concerned: Much leſs have I it in view to ſtop the mouths of objectors, only by bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them be humble and modeſt, becauſe God is above them, and his ways and thoughts high above their's as the heavens are high above the
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:018397_0178_0FA70C75C47A2228"/>
earth. I am ſenſible, that humility duly regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by reaſon and religion, as it ought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to be, is no enemy to the freeſt debates not thoſe which relate even to the proceedings, of <hi>God.</hi> It is the pretence of humility, not the principle itſelf, that makes an out-cry againſt ſuch inquiries. And to this falſe humility, at leaſt in part, it may be owing, that ſo many ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities, horribly reproachful to the nature and government of <hi>God,</hi> have been embraced in the world. It has doubtleſs too often be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed men into ſuperſtition and bigotry, giving them a mean, abject caſt of mind, whereby their intellectual faculties have been very much unfitted for the right diſcharge of their proper office. This, in truth, is the rock which mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes have ſplit upon; not conſidering that ſubmiſſion even to the <hi>Deity</hi> ought always to be exerciſed under the conduct of reaſon and good ſenſe. And if thus exerciſed, though it will be an effectual reſtraint from pride and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogance, keeping men within the ſphere of their powers, and making them modeſt and cautious, eſpecially in regard of the things which they are able to conſider not in their <hi>intire con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection</hi> but <hi>ſingly</hi> and as <hi>ſeparate parts</hi> of ſome <hi>great whole</hi>: Yet, it will, at the ſame time, put them upon due care and pains, in the uſe of their faculties, that they kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>w the truth; it will diſpoſe them freely and fairly to hear and examine whatever may be decently offered on both ſides of a queſtion, that they may be
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:018397_0179_0FA70C767706BB20"/>
rationally prepared to make a wiſe and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial judgment in the caſe; in a word, it will influence them to form their ſentiments, not according to the authoritative deciſions of men, or the opinions generally prevailing in the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where they live, but according to the truth of things ſo far as they are able, under the advantages they are favoured with, be they more or leſs.</p>
            <p>It will not be ſuppoſed after ſaying this, that the preſent remark is made with a view to take ſhelter under the pretence of that humility and modeſty, which become creatures, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſuch imperfect ones as men are, towards the great Creato<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. It is freely confeſſed, there are many things, poſſible to conception, which are abſolutely inconſiſtent, in tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e reaſon with <hi>infinite benevolence.</hi> And it is as readily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded, that we are endowed with faculties, ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling us clearly and certainly to diſcern this inconſiſtency: Inſomuch that no ſolid reaſon can be aſſigned, why we ſhould call in queſtion the truth of our perceptions in this caſe, any more than in others. And ſhould we do it, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of humility and ſubmiſſion, I ſee not but we ſhould diſcover downright contempt of our implanted powers. And, in truth, could any appearances, in all nature, be produced between <hi>which</hi> and <hi>infinite goodneſs</hi> the human mind could, clearly perceive a <hi>real, poſitive inconſiſtency,</hi> it could, acting rationally, aſſent to it as true that there was exiſting an <hi>infinitely benevolent</hi> firſt
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:018397_0180_0FA70C7735438F20"/>
cauſe. Here therefore is full ſcope allowed for the objectors in the preſent diſpute. And if they are able to produce, in the whole compaſs of being, any <hi>appearances</hi> that will excite in the minds of rational agents the idea of a <hi>real, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted inconſiſtency with goodneſs,</hi> it is granted their end is anſwered, they have argued con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſively. But then, it ought to be acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, on the other hand, that if theſe <hi>appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances,</hi> in their laſt reſult, center in <hi>ignorance,</hi> and only prove that our capacities are ſcanty, and not formed to take in the whole of what is proper to be conſidered in the caſe; and that <hi>good,</hi> the <hi>greateſt good,</hi> may be the production of theſe <hi>appearances,</hi> in the end, for all that we know, or can prove, to the contrary; I ſay, in this view of the matter, it ought to be ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly confeſſed, that <hi>ſuch appearances,</hi> in ſtrict reaſoning, conclude nothing againſt the <hi>benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence</hi> of the <hi>Deity.</hi> For this is certainly the truth of the caſe. And all the reproach that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected on the Divine goodneſs by this kind of arguing can reaſonably be looked upon as no other than the effect of <hi>ignorance</hi>; not to ſay pride and arrogant preſumption, in taking upon us to judge and determine in matters ſo evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently beyond the reach of our powers.</p>
            <p>This general obſervation, which I believe no one will deny to be juſt, I eſteem fully ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to anſwer the general objection againſt the <hi>benevolence</hi> of the <hi>Deity,</hi> which has been brought from the appearances of evil in the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:018397_0181_0FA70C77F3F986D8"/>
However, I ſhall not content myſelf with this general reply, but proceed to a diſtinct conſideration of the particular objections con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the general one above-mentioned. And they may be reduced to theſe three, the <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect powers</hi> of ſo many of the creatures who are capable of happineſs; the <hi>moral diſorders</hi> which have taken place in the world; and the <hi>natural evils</hi> which are ſo numerous, and turn ſo much to the diſadvantage, eſpecially of <hi>man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt objection againſt the infinite be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence of the Deity is taken from the <hi>imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> of ſo many of the creatures on this earth of our's. What a diminutive creature, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively ſpeaking, is even man, the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of them all? How ſmall his capacity for happineſs? And how much ſmaller ſtill the capacities of the inferior perceiving beings, through their ſeveral ranks, in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending ſcale, of ſubordination? And could it be thus, if God was infinitely good? Could not an infinitely benevolent Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator have communicated nobler capacities for happineſs? And if he could, how can his not doing it be reconciled with the idea of him as an infinitely benevolent Being?</p>
            <p>In anſwer to this difficulty, it may be ſaid, the bringing into exiſtence an abſolutely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect creature is not within the reach of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite goodneſs, aided by almighty power. The very idea of a creature is eſſentially connected with comparative imperfection; as it derives
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:018397_0182_0FA70C7B2D582780"/>
its being from another, is dependent on that other for its continuance in being, and is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily finite in its nature and powers. To ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a created being infinite, would be to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it equal with its Creator; which is too abſurd to be admitted. Abſolute perfection therefore is an incommunicable glory of the only true God. And ſhould there be a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, comparative imperfection muſt exiſt in it, otherwiſe it could not exiſt at all. Conſequently, if ſuch imperfection is an evil, it is ſuch an one as muſt take place, or there could be no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play of the Divine benevolence. —But the truth is, meer imperfection is no evil, to be ſure no poſitive one: Nor may God, with the leaſt propriety, be conſidered as the author of it. This matter has been ſet in a clear and ſtrong point of light by Arch-Deacon Law, in his 32d. Note on Arch-Biſhop King's "origin of evil." His words are theſe, "God is the cauſe of perfection only, not of defect, which ſo far forth as it is <hi>natural</hi> to created beings hath no cauſe at all, but is meerly a <hi>negation,</hi> or <hi>non-entity.</hi> For every created thing was a negation or non-entity, before it had a poſitive being, and it had only ſo much of its primitive nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion taken away from it, as it had poſitive be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conferred on it; and therefore, ſo far forth as it is, its being is to be attributed to the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign cauſe that produced it: But ſo far forth as it is not, its not being is to be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the original <hi>non-entity</hi> out of which it
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:018397_0183_0FA70C7D591B2B78"/>
was produced. For that which was once no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing would ſtill have been nothing, had it not been for the cauſe that gave being to it; and therefore, that it is ſo far nothing ſtill, that is, limitted and defective, is only to be attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to its own primitive nothingneſs. As for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, if I give a poor man a hundred pounds, that he is worth ſo much money is wholly owing to me, but that he is not worth an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred more is owing wholly to his own pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And juſt ſo, that I have ſuch and ſuch perfections of being is wholly owing to God, who produced me out of nothing; but that I have ſuch and ſuch defects of being is only owing to that <hi>non-entity</hi> out of which he produced me."</p>
            <p>It will probably be ſaid here, we ſee in the creation innumerable beings with implanted faculties, making them the capable percipients of happineſs in indefinitely various degrees, ſome in an higher, others in a lower, till we have got down to the loweſt we can conceive of. Can this be the work of an infinitely benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Being? Would he have made ſo many crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſo imperfect, as to be capable of happineſs in ſuch low degrees only? If it was his pleaſure to bring beings into exiſtence, from non-entity, would he not if infinitely good, have endowed them with higher and more noble capacities for happineſs? The obvious anſwer is this, if in a creation, in which there are beings inconcei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vably various in their capacities for happineſs, there may be the communication of MORE
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:018397_0184_0FA70C7ED63D0DE0"/>
GOOD, than could otherwiſe have been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated, it is ſo far from being an objection againſt the Divine benevolence, that theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of lower capacities for the enjoyment of happineſs were brought into exiſtence, that it is at once an illuſtration, and ſtrong proof of it. It is readily owned, if the whole reſult of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated good was nothing more than the production of ſuch imperfect beings, as are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of happineſs in a low meaſure only, it might be thought the Deity, if infinite in benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, had been wanting in the manifeſtation of it. But, if there are other beings gradually riſing, in the ſcale of exiſtence, to an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable height in their capacities for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of happineſs, and of the moſt ſuperior kind too, why ſhould it be thought ſtrange, that there ſhould be imperfect ones alſo, in the like gradually deſcending ſcale? Eſpecially, if they are all conſidered as parts of ſome GREAT WHOLE, ſeverally concurring to make one uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, gloriouſly connected ſyſtem, capable of yielding as much good, as the infinitely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent Being, guided in his exertions by unerring wiſdom, has thought fit to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate.</p>
            <p>In this view of the matter, it is not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, that every ſyſtem making the univerſal one, or that every creature in each ſyſtem, ſhould be equally perfect. For, though, with reſpect to particular ſyſtems, and beings, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with one another, there ſhould be ever
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:018397_0185_0FA70C7F78FF33A8"/>
ſo great a <hi>diverſity</hi>; yet this ought not, in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to be eſteemed an objection againſt the Divine benevolence, if, upon the whole, there is the diſplay of as much good as infinite wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom has thought proper: Nay, upon ſuppoſition there may, in this way, be the communication of <hi>more good,</hi> than in any other, it would be an objection againſt infinite benevolence, if it was not in this way diſplayed. The creation is, in fact, a <hi>diverſified</hi> one. It therefore lies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the objectors againſt the benevolence of the Deity to make it appear, that <hi>leſs good</hi> is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of being communicated upon this plan, than might have been upon ſome other. Until this is done, which never will be, as it has never yet been, no complaint can reaſonably be made againſt the Deity, as having been wanting in his benevolence, on account of bringing into exiſtence a creation, <hi>diverſified</hi> in the manner we ſee this is in which we hold our beings.</p>
            <p>There are only two ways in general, in which an infinitely benevolent cauſe is ſuppoſed capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of exerting itſelf in the communication of good. One is, by diſplays ad ultimum poſſe, that is, to the utmoſt in all inſtances whatever; the effect of which diſplays would be one or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der only of beings, the moſt perfect there can be. But this ſuppoſition is, perhaps, an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible one, as it carries with it that which looks very like a contradiction. That which is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite is unlimited, and not to be reſtrained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in any bounds. To ſuppoſe therefore a <hi>ne plus</hi>
               <pb n="188" facs="unknown:018397_0186_0FA70C80597760F0"/>
of exertion in an infinite being, is to ſuppoſe that this being is reſtrained within certain limits; which ſeems to contradict his being infinite. If the Deity is infinitely benevolent, his exertions in manifeſting the glory of this attribute can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be exhauſted. To ſuppoſe otherwiſe, would be to ſuppoſe that he was not thus infinite, ſtrictly and properly ſpeaking, the word <hi>utmoſt,</hi> or any other word of ſimilar ſignification, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be applied to an infinite being, with reſpect to any of his communications. He ought rather to be conceived of, as having with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in himſelf an ability to go on communicating to eternity. Communications <hi>to the utmoſt,</hi> ſo far as we are able to conceive of the matter, are incompatible with the idea of an infinite ability to communicate. Beſides, ſhould the benevolence of the Deity (was this poſſible) be diſplayed in all inſtances to the <hi>utmoſt,</hi> this at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute of his would appear more like a <hi>natural inſtinct,</hi> mechanically and blindly urging him on to the communication of happineſs, than a <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral diſpoſition,</hi> immutably guided in all its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertions by unerring wiſdom, and in conſiſtency with unſpotted rectitude.—The other way of the Deity's communicating good, may be by limited diſplays of it, in particular inſtances; the conſequence of which might be the produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of creatures indefinitely <hi>diverſified</hi> in their powers; ſome capable of happineſs in one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, others in another, and ſo on, in a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual aſcention, without diſcontinuity, to the
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:018397_0187_0FA70C811E847C18"/>
higheſt conceivable perfection. This, I ſay, may be the effect of limited exertions of bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence, in an infinitely productive cauſe, with reſpect to the particular parts of ſome great and good whole. And the reaſon is obvious at firſt view. For if any one conceivable degree of imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection will argue a defect in the exertions of an infinitely benevolent Being, another will argue the ſame thing with equal truth, and no ſtop can be made till we have got to the higheſt created perfection. If a low reptile, for inſtance, cannot be the production of an infinitely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent cauſe, becauſe leſs perfect than a man; a man, for the ſame reaſon, could not have had exiſtence, becauſe leſs perfect than an angel; and an angel, for the ſame reaſon ſtill, could not have been made, becauſe leſs perfect than ſome being of a yet ſuperior order; and ſo on, till there are no creatures but of the higheſt, and moſt perfect claſs in the creation. So that, if there can be any limited exertions of Divine benevolence, there are no creatures, be their capacities for happineſs as low as any in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but may have exiſtence in a ſcale of beings, which ſhall gradually aſcend to as high perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as infinite benevolence, guided by infinite wiſdom, ſhall think fit to create.</p>
            <p>The only inquiry then is, which of theſe ſorts of exertion are capable of yielding, upon the whole, the moſt good. And it will not be denied, that the preſumption is ſtrong in favor of the latter; as they actually take place in a
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:018397_0188_0FA70C81CE973AC0"/>
world, that will readily be owned to be the effect of infinite benevolence, conducted by unerring wiſdom, if it be poſſible, that <hi>more good</hi> ſhould be the reſult of ſuch exertions, than of any other within the reach of our ability to point out. And that this is not only poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but highly probable, if not certain, I ſhall endeavour to evince by the following reaſons, which appear to me ſtrongly concluſive, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if conſidered in one conjunct view.</p>
            <p>The firſt, I would offer, may be ſet in the following light. We ſee, in fact, that the various ſpecies of creatures, living on our earth, are ſo conſtituted, as that the exiſtence of one of them is no hindrance to the exiſtence of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but they are all well enough capable of exiſting together, as the extent of the world gives a ſufficiency of room for it. The exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of man, the top-creature in this ſyſtem, is no bar to the exiſtence of any other claſs of creatures, in the deſcending ſcale, quite down to the loweſt perceiving animal: But there is as real a ſufficiency of ſpace for their exiſtence, as if <hi>he</hi> had not been made; and as like a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency for him, as if <hi>they</hi> had not been in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And the ſame may be ſaid, with equal truth, of all the other orders of beings, with reſpect to the exiſtence of one another, in this part of the creation.—And ſhould we extend our thoughts to other worlds, and the various claſſes of beings in them, there is the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſtill to think, that the exiſtence of one of
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:018397_0189_0FA70C82E12E04C0"/>
them does not interfere with the exiſtence of another. <hi>Angels,</hi> and any ſuperior order of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, may as eaſily be made capable of exiſting, at the ſame time, as if one only of theſe orders had been created. And as to all the other claſſes of beings, in all worlds, they are doubtleſs ſo made, as to be all of them capable of exiſting, as truly as if only one claſs of them had been brought into exiſtence.</p>
            <p>Upon the truth now of theſe premiſes, it plainly follows, that the capacity for happineſs, in the univerſe, is enlarged by means of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of beings that have exiſtence in it. And if the capacity is enlarged, it is, from hence, demonſtrably certain, that the <hi>quantum</hi> of good <hi>may</hi> be <hi>greater</hi> than it could have been, if, inſtead of this <hi>diverſity,</hi> fewer orders of beings, or a ſingle one only, had been made.</p>
            <p>It is, indeed, from this diverſity of beings, duly ſubordinated to each other, that the <hi>pleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi> of nature ariſes. A few orders of beings only would not have ſerved to this purpoſe. The creation is <hi>filled up,</hi> by that admirably nice and curious variety in the claſſes of creatures, whereby they are fitted to be proper links in the chain of exiſtence; all concurring, as ſo many well adjuſted parts, to conſtitute <hi>one whole</hi> without <hi>void</hi> or <hi>chaſm.</hi> Thus we are naturally led to think, from what falls within the reach of our obſervation, in this ſyſtem to which we belong. For, it is evident, that, if the order of men only had been created, the
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:018397_0190_0FA70C851FE8F9D0"/>
               <hi>room,</hi> that is now filled with the inferior ranks of creatures, would have been a <hi>vaſt chaſm. Men</hi> would have multiplied no faſter than they do, if there were no <hi>brutes</hi>: Nor would they have been better accommodated. One of the <hi>brutal</hi> ſpecies does not hinder the exiſtence, or increaſe, or ſupport, of another; but there is both room and ſuitable proviſion for them all. And ſhould any other claſſes of the creatures be pitched upon, they are ſo conſtituted as that there would be room ſtill for all the other or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. And the ſame reaſoning will hold good if extended to all other ſyſtems. There are vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ranks of creatures in them: And, perhaps, otherwiſe, they would not have been ſo full of <hi>being</hi> as they might have been.</p>
            <p>The truth is, This world of our's is ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived, as that we can no where diſcern in it any <hi>void.</hi> It appears, on the contrary, by means of the various ranks of creatures, gradually riſing in perfection to <hi>men,</hi> the higheſt order of them, to be perfectly filled with being. And, if there is no <hi>chaſm</hi> in this ſyſtem, of which we are a main part, why ſhould we ſuppoſe <hi>one,</hi> in the other ſyſtems conſtituting the univerſe? It is far more reaſonable, from the analogy of nature, to think, that the gradation ſtill goes on riſing, in other worlds, beyond the bounds of our moſt enlarged imagination.</p>
            <p>And what though, in this vaſt diverſity, there ſhould be orders of beings formed for happineſs (at leaſt in the firſt ſtages of their poſſible ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence)
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:018397_0191_0FA70C85961A3FB8"/>
in an imperfect, low degree only? Is it not ſufficient to anſwer, that <hi>no capacity</hi> for happineſs, however ſmall, ſhould be excluded the creation, ſo long as it is not an hindrance to the exiſtence of other gradually riſing capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities, till we have exceeded all conception: Eſpecially, if it be added, that the leaving out any <hi>capacity</hi> for happineſs, however diminutive, in this chain of beings, will proportionably ſubſtract from the <hi>ſum total</hi> of general happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; which, in this caſe, would not be ſo great as it might have been.</p>
            <p>The ſhort of the caſe is, the creation of God, by means of this diverſity of beings, gradually and regularly riſing in perfection, even to the higheſt poſſible degree, becomes a <hi>moſt perfect and contiguous whole</hi>; demonſtrating the riches and glory of the Creator's goodneſs, far beyond what it could have done, if the <hi>continuity</hi> had been broken, by the <hi>non-exiſtence</hi> of any of the ranks of creatures, which now make it an <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely full and well-connected univerſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may add both light and force to the preſent argument, if I juſt ſubjoin, That the various ranks of creatures are ſo far from being an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction to the exiſtence of one another, that their exiſtence in this multiform be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowment of it, is a <hi>greater bleſſing</hi> than it would have been, if they had exiſted <hi>ſingly</hi> and <hi>alone.</hi> This is certainly the truth, in fact, with reſpect to the order of man. The exiſtence of the other claſſes of beings below him is ſo far from being a diſſervice to him, that, if they had not
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:018397_0192_0FA70C866601C068"/>
been created, he muſt have enjoyed exiſtence without many of the advantages, tending to the comfort of it, which he now poſſeſſes. And this is moſt probably the truth, with reſpect to all the other ſpecies of creatures. They are placed in ſuch a degree of ſubordination, as to be fitted to be uſeful to one another: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that every claſs of beings, by reaſon of this ſubſervient diverſity, enjoys exiſtence un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der more deſirable circumſtances than it could otherwiſe have done. And this may be the real truth of the caſe, throughout the whole compaſs of <hi>percipient</hi> exiſtence.</p>
            <p>Another conſideration, not improper to be mentioned, in proof of the point we are upon, is, its being plainly <hi>impoſſible,</hi> that any <hi>ſingle</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of beings could be formed capable of <hi>all the good,</hi> which <hi>many</hi> orders, variouſly endowed with faculties, may be fitted for the enjoyment of. It is indiſputable, that every being, of whatever rank, whether high or low, muſt have its own proper nature. This, we at once perceive to be neceſſary, in regard of beings that have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial bodies. They are indeed ranked into different claſſes, on account of their different bodily make. And a difference in bodily ſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can no more exiſt in the ſame bodies, at once, than they can occupy different pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, at the ſame time. And, as different or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganizations of parts, in <hi>perceiving</hi> beings that have bodies, are intended, among other uſes, to form <hi>different capacities,</hi> in <hi>kind</hi> ſometimes,
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:018397_0193_0FA70C8A6676C958"/>
as well as <hi>degree</hi>; it is plain, that beings thus differently organized can no more be capable of <hi>juſt the ſame good,</hi> than they can partake of the ſame bodily ſtructure. And the ſame is as true of <hi>incorporeal</hi> beings. They muſt, in all their different claſſes, have different <hi>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal</hi> powers: Otherwiſe, they could not be rank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into different orders. And there is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to think, but that different <hi>mental</hi> powers, as well as bodily ones, ſhould form different <hi>capacities for happineſs,</hi> and <hi>ſuch,</hi> many times, as cannot exiſt in the ſame minds, at the ſame time: The conſequence from all which is obviouſly this;—That ſhould the moſt perfect order of beings be created that <hi>could</hi> be, it muſt be an order of ſome certain nature and conſtitution, which nature could not be capable of all the different powers of innumerably various natures, ſome of which, at leaſt, are abſolutely incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible with each other. And if no ſingle or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of beings could be endowed with the various faculties of all natures, it is impoſſible they ſhould be the ſubjects of all the various degrees and kinds of happineſs, which theſe <hi>natures</hi> may be ſeverally fitted for, and capable of.</p>
            <p>Perhaps, it will be objected here, though no ſingle order of beings could be capable of <hi>juſt the ſame happineſs,</hi> which various orders might be capable of; yet one order poſſibly might be ſo formed as to be qualified for <hi>greater</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of <hi>another</hi> and <hi>more perfect kind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="196" facs="unknown:018397_0194_0FA70C8B642887E0"/>In reply whereto, it ought to be conſidered, that the firſt link, in the chain of <hi>diverſified</hi> beings we have ſuppoſed, is the moſt perfect order that can be. And it is certain, if all the happineſs of all the ſubordinate ranks of beings be added to the happineſs of this higheſt order, the <hi>ſum-total</hi> will be greater, than if the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this higheſt order only is taken into the account. And the ſtrength of this reaſoning will ſtill increaſe, if it be remembered, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to what has been, already obſerved, that the exiſtence of none of the ſubordinate ranks of beings is any obſtruction to the exiſtence of the higheſt, but that they may all exiſt together, and as free from interference, as if only one of them had been brought into exiſtence.</p>
            <p>Another argument ſtill, to the purpoſe we are upon, is this; that the infinitely benevolent Being ought always to be ſuppoſed to exiſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in producing good, with <hi>intelligence,</hi> wiſe <hi>deſign,</hi> and according to ſome method diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exquiſite ſkill and contrivance. A myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſomething, capable of happineſs without faculties fitted for ſuch an end; or actually en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying it, without regard to any ſtated method adapted to the purpoſe, is a ſuppoſition if not impoſſible in itſelf, yet entirely diſſonant from the idea we entertain of good <hi>wiſely</hi> commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated. In order to this, there muſt be facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties previouſly created and contrived for the perception of this good; and more than this, it muſt be the effect of the exerciſe of theſe
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:018397_0195_0FA70C8B79D3C1B8"/>
faculties upon their proper objects, according to ſome well-eſtabliſhed conſtitution. And in a diverſified creation, one filled with different ranks of beings, all variouſly endowed with ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities fitted to make them happy, according to ſtated laws, in a certain degree; I ſay, in ſuch a creation as this, there <hi>may</hi> be manifeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of more art and contrivance in diſpenſing good, than in a creation in which one order only of beings ſhould have exiſtence, though the ſkill herein diſplayed ſhould be as <hi>great</hi> as it <hi>could</hi> be. For it is indeed impoſſible, that <hi>all</hi> the methods of wiſe contrivance ſhould be diſcovered in the make of any ſingle order of beings whatever. And of this we have as good proof as we can deſire; becauſe it is evident from what we ſee, in fact, that ſome of <hi>theſe methods</hi> are of ſuch a nature as to be incompatible with any one claſs of beings that can poſſibly be made. It is a contradiction that any order of beings ſhould have a mental ſtructure <hi>only,</hi> and yet, at the ſame time, poſſeſs bodies with vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous organs admirably contrived for the convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of ſenſations of ſuch a kind. And unleſs the ſame beings could have bodies, and not have them, at the ſame time, it is impoſſible that the <hi>whole</hi> of that contrivance, which is actually diſcovered in the creation, could be manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the make and circumſtances of any one order of beings that could be created. So that, had the goodneſs of the Deity been diſplayed towards one rank of beings only, however per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:018397_0196_0FA70C8C3B994748"/>
and not to numberleſs orders of them, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly endowed and ſituated, there could not have been thoſe amazing diſcoveries of exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitely wiſe contrivance and art, which are now viſible in all parts of the creation;<note n="*" place="bottom">Vid. Taylor, p. 48, of his Key.</note> obliging us to own the pertinency of thoſe words of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, <hi>How manifold are thy works, O Lord! In wiſdom haſt thou made them all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Should any object here, Though juſt the ſame traces of wiſdom which are diſcernable in the creation, according to its preſent plan, could not have taken place, if one order of beings only had been made; yet this is no reaſon why an order could not have been made, that might have diſcovered greater ſkill and wiſer contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, though of another kind. It may be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to return a like anſwer to one we had occaſion to give before, viz. That this very order of beings may be the higheſt in the aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſcale of exiſtence, and compleat the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of the riches of Divine wiſdom, in the <hi>manner</hi> of communicating good.</p>
            <p>But beſides what has been hitherto ſaid, it may be worth while to enquire, whether much of the moſt valuable kind of good could have been communicated, had not the creation been a <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſified</hi> one, like to that which really exiſts. It will not be denied, that <hi>intelligent moral</hi> beings are the moſt noble, and formed with capacities for the higheſt good, in <hi>kind</hi> as well as <hi>degree.</hi> And perhaps, upon examination, it will be found, that a great part of the good they are capable
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:018397_0197_0FA70C8D0709D1A0"/>
of is ſo eſſentially connected with a diverſified conſtitution of beings and things, as that they could not poſſeſs it but upon this plan. It is certain, in point of fact, that the <hi>intelligent moral</hi> beings, in our ſyſtem, do, from this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, receive, according to eſtabliſhed laws, thoſe numberleſs ideas, which are the ſource of all thoſe acquirements in knowledge, which give them their whole <hi>intellectual</hi> pleaſure. And it is from the ſame diverſity that thoſe various relations and dependencies ariſe, which are the foundation of their <hi>moral diſpoſitions,</hi> and give occaſion for the exerciſe of them, in infinitely various fit ways, to the production of all the happineſs they are capable of. And there is reaſon to think, that this is the truth of fact, among all <hi>intelligent moral</hi> beings, in all worlds. I do not mean, that their ideas, the ſpring of their intellectual delight, are conveyed into their minds in juſt the ſame way that ideas are let into our's; or, that the relations ſubſiſting among them, giving occaſion for moral exertments, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied or followed with high pleaſure, are preciſely the ſame that take place among us: But what I intend is, that they <hi>all</hi> come by their ideas, the foundation of their intellectual happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, according to ſome conſtitution, wiſely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived and adapted to ſuch a purpoſe; and that they are alſo ſo endowed, and ſituated with reſpect to one another, as that ther<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> may be fit occaſions for the exerciſe of their <hi>moral powers,</hi> in order to their perceiving the pleaſure that is proper to
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:018397_0198_0FA70BAB37867E28"/>
               <hi>moral agents.</hi> And it ſeems as though they could not otherwiſe, in a rational, wiſe way, enjoy the happineſs that is ſuited to ſuch kind of beings. It is true, if the happineſs of <hi>intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent moral</hi> creatures might be ſuppoſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in indolent eaſe, or a meer inactive enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of exiſtence, there would be no room for diſpute upon the matter: But ſuch an <hi>Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rean</hi> ſort of happineſs ought not to be aſcribed to an infinitely wiſe agent as its cauſe, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever benevolent; for it is not worthy of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication from him. Happineſs, in reſpect of <hi>intelligent moral</hi> beings, ought always to be conceived of as the reſult of <hi>intelligent moral</hi> powers, regularly exerted, according to eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed laws, wiſely adjuſted to the nature of ſuch beings. They ought to be conſidered, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving their ideas, not by immediate infuſion, but in conformity to ſome ſtated order, mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſting wiſe deſign and contrivance: They ought to be conſidered, as making a regular uſe of their <hi>intellectual</hi> faculties in the management of their ideas, in order to their perception of <hi>intellectual</hi> delight: And they ought alſo to be conſidered, as ſo ſituated with reſpect to other beings, as to have proper occaſions for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of their <hi>moral</hi> powers, in various fit ways, ſo as to enjoy pleaſure herefrom.</p>
            <p>And now, in a <hi>diverſified</hi> conſtitution, there is room for the conveyance of all poſſible ideas into all various minds, not by meer impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but in certain ways, and according to ſtat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:018397_0199_0FA70BA354303298"/>
laws, manifeſting the greateſt wiſdom and deſign: And there is likewiſe all the ſcope that can be deſired for all poſſible relations and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendences, from whence, according to the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract reaſon of things, may ariſe a fitneſs and propriety in infinitely various exertments of <hi>moral</hi> diſpoſitions; making the beings poſſeſſed of them wiſely and rationally as happy as they can be: Whereas, in a creation of one order of beings only, be their perfection as great as poſſible, it is not conceivable, how they ſhould be capable of that happineſs which may naturally and wiſely reſult from the contrary plan.</p>
            <p>There is certainly one ſort of happineſs, which I eſteem a conſideration ſufficient of itſelf to bear the whole weight of the preſent cauſe: I ſay, there is one ſort of happineſs (perhaps the nobleſt, and moſt God-like) which could not have place in the creation, but upon ſuppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of its being, in ſome meaſure, a <hi>diverſified</hi> one. What I mean is, that if there had been one order only of beings, <hi>equal</hi> in perfection and happineſs, there could not have been the <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi> that is the reſult of the <hi>communication of good.</hi> For it is only upon the plan of <hi>diverſity</hi> in beings, that one creature can be the object of another's beneficence. Reduce the creation to a <hi>perfect equality,</hi> and all participation of that part of the Creator's happineſs, the <hi>communication of good,</hi> is, at once, neceſſarily deſtroyed.

by all beings, it is evident, that <hi>good</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly be communicated from one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And can it be imagined that the <hi>Deity</hi> would pitch upon a plan for the communication of good, which would render it impracticable for any of his creatures, either to reſemble him in that which is his <hi>greateſt glory,</hi> or to partake, in any meaſure, of that which is his <hi>greateſt pleaſure</hi>? There is no truly benevolent mind, but will readily be reconciled to a <hi>diverſity</hi> in beings, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the <hi>pleaſure of communicating good</hi> ſhould be excluded the creation: And excluded it muſt be, if there is not ſome <hi>diverſity.</hi> Upon any other ſuppoſition, not one being, in the creation could be the object of another's beneficence; and conſequently, the nobleſt and moſt truly divine pleaſure, that which ariſes from <hi>doing good,</hi> could not have place in the whole circle of exiſting creatures. So that it is evident, a <hi>diverſity</hi> of beings is ſo far from being an <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection</hi> againſt <hi>infinite benevolence,</hi> that it really flows from it as its proper cauſe. There could not have been the manifeſtation of ſo much goodneſs, if there had not been <hi>ſome difference</hi> between the creatures brought into exiſtence. And the leaſt attention will obviouſly lead any one to determine, that if goodneſs may be the cauſe of any <hi>diverſity</hi> at all, no ſtop can be made, without continuing it down, through all variety of orders, ſo long as the balance ſhall turn in favor of happineſs, or, in other words, ſo long as exiſtence can be called a <hi>good,</hi> and pronounced <hi>better than not to be.</hi>

               <pb facs="unknown:018397_0201_0FA70BA47669A448"/>I ſhall only ſubjoin, upon the whole, that we know not but thoſe beings, who are the perci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pients of happineſs, in the loweſt and moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect degrees, may be deſigned for a much higher ſtate of exiſtence. This may be poſſible to the power and wiſdom of the infinitely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent Creator; and that he has not actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally made proviſion for it, in the <hi>plan</hi> upon which he intends to operate for the <hi>general good,</hi> is more than any one can pretend to determine. It is highly probable from <hi>reaſon</hi> only, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain from <hi>revelation,</hi> that <hi>man,</hi> though, at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, one of the loweſt <hi>intellectual moral</hi> beings, is yet deſigned for exalted perfection and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. He is now in an <hi>infant</hi> ſtate, compared with what this may be introductory to. And, for all that can be proved to the contrary, he may go on in <hi>intellectual</hi> and <hi>moral</hi> attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, till he has reached as great perfection, and is poſſeſſed of as great happineſs, as, at preſent, comes to the ſhare of any of the ranks of created beings: Though they alſo may be ſuppoſed to be gradually riſing in perfection and happineſs, in proportion to their <hi>greater</hi> ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal capacities; ſo that the diſtance will ſtill be preſerved among the various orders of creatures, and go on to be ſo, forever.</p>
            <p n="2">II. I now proceed to the <hi>ſecond</hi> objection, taken from thoſe <hi>moral</hi> diſorders, which, it is pleaded, could not have exiſtence in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if it was produced and governed by an infinitely <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>benevolent</hi> being. Such a
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:018397_0202_0FA70BA53690AC78"/>
Maker and Ruler of the univerſe, it is ſaid, muſt have taken effectual care for the preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>moral</hi> evil, and the unhappineſs ariſing therefrom. It cannot be ſuppoſed, that a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing infinitely averſe from <hi>moral</hi> impurity would have ſuffered the works of his hands to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed with it. It cannot be imagined, that an infinitely <hi>benevolent</hi> Being would have left crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of his own forming to ſuch <hi>immoral</hi> conduct as would reflect diſhonor on his goodneſs, by bringing unhappineſs and miſery into a world of his contriving and making? It is not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that ſuch a being as the Deity is repreſented to be, ſhould place his creatures in circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, wherein they might pervert their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and involve themſelves in ruin. Theſe things cannot be. They are not worthy of an infinitely holy and good <hi>God</hi>: Eſpecially, if it be conſidered, that the exiſtence of <hi>moral</hi> evil cannot be conceived of without <hi>permiſſion,</hi> at leaſt, from the Deity: Nay, it cannot be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, but that he muſt have <hi>foreſeen,</hi> not only the <hi>poſſibility,</hi> but the <hi>high probability,</hi> of its taking place in the world; and yet he ſuffered it to do ſo: Yea, ſo far was he from prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, that it ſeems as though ſome of the moſt important meaſures of his conduct were formed, upon the ſuppoſition of its <hi>actual being</hi> in the univerſe.</p>
            <p>This is the objection urged at large, and, I think, in its full force, againſt the creation and government of an infinitely holy and benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:018397_0203_0FA70BA604EFD6F8"/>
Being. And it is far from being a trifling one. Had it ſo been, ſuch numbers of philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers and divines, in all parts of the world, would not have employed ſo much of their time and pains in order to remove it. And it is, perhaps, a difficulty that cannot be perfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, in the preſent ſtate of human faculties. But this is no proof that it cannot be done. It ought to be remembered, that we men are but a low order of intelligent creatures; and what wonder is it, if that ſhould be a difficulty, and an inſuperable one, to us, which may be none at all to a ſuperior order of beings. It is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain fact that moral evil exiſts in our world; and it is as certain a truth, that God is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely benevolent. And ſhould we find our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unable to point out ſo clearly and fully, as we might deſire, the conſiſtency between this fact, and this truth, we may, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, keeping within the reach of our faculties, go ſo far as to ſay, and upon rational grounds, that which may be ſufficient, if not to ſilence all objection, yet to ſatisfy ourſelves, that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral evil may exiſt, and the Deity at the ſame time be infinitely benevolent. Let it then be obſerved,</p>
            <p>Though the being of moral evil, in our world, is not denied; it may have been exaggerated. A great deal of this kind of diſorder, it is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily owned, we are acquainted with; but not ſo much as has been pretended. If we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the repreſentations of ſome, this world, by

reaſon of the vices, of all kinds, which are almoſt univerſally committed in it, is little bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than hell itſelf. But it is not fair, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king an eſtimate of the corrupt ſtate of the world, to enumerate all the horrid immoralities which have been perpetrated, at the ſame time overlooking the many ſhining virtues which have adorned the character of multitudes. The greateſt vices can be matched with as great vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues. If ſome have ſunk their <hi>moral</hi> powers ſo as to become capable of the baſeſt and vileſt actions; others have improved them ſo as to exhibit a truly God-like temper and conduct. And, it may be, notwithſtanding the out-cry that is made of the wickedneſs of the world, if a juſt compariſon could be made, it would be found, that it is far more than balanced with the <hi>good</hi> that is in it of the <hi>moral</hi> kind. But however this is, it is not diſowned that there are <hi>moral</hi> diſorders in the world, and many of them too, and of various ſorts: Nor is it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, that this has not been the caſe in all ages; though it is very evident, that in <hi>ſome</hi> they have not prevailed to ſo great a degree as in <hi>others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, that I may, in as clear a manner as I poſſibly can, offer what may be proper in order to account for this <hi>appearance,</hi> and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile it with perfect wiſdom and goodneſs in the great Creator and Governor of the univerſe, it may be neceſſary to obſerve, that the <hi>evil</hi> ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified in the objection, and called <hi>moral,</hi> includes

in it two things, <hi>irregularity</hi> in the beings char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geable with it, and <hi>conſequent unhappineſs</hi> as the <hi>fruit</hi> thereof, either by the <hi>conſtitution of nature</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or <hi>poſitive infliction</hi> from the <hi>Deity.</hi> And I ſhall, accordingly, be diſtinct in ſpeaking to each of them.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>firſt</hi>;—The very ſuppoſition of <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral irregularity,</hi> as diſtinguiſhed from <hi>natural,</hi> and meaning the ſame thing with <hi>vice</hi> or <hi>wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs,</hi> is eſſentially connected with <hi>free agency,</hi> in the beings upon whom this guilt is faſtened.

            <p>But <hi>could</hi> not the <hi>Deity,</hi> it will be here ſaid, have prevented this abuſe of liberty, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of moral powers? And if he <hi>could</hi> have prevented this miſchief, how comes it to paſs that he did not?

In anſwer where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, I ſee not, I confeſs, but the <hi>Deity,</hi> if infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely holy and benevolent, muſt have pervented this <hi>moral</hi> diſorder, <hi>if he could have done it.</hi> Only, let it be remembered, when I ſay, <hi>if he could have done it,</hi> I ſpeak not ſo much of a <hi>natural,</hi> as <hi>moral</hi> ability; an ability invariably guided, in all its exertions, by perfect wiſdom, and in exact conformity to the abſtract reaſon and fitneſs of things. And it ſhould ſeem, as though, in this ſenſe, it was not within the power of the infinitely benevolent Cauſe of all things, to have prevented <hi>moral</hi> defection. If it was, what imaginable reaſon can be aſſigned, why it was not actually done? And, in what poſſible way, can the <hi>non-prevention</hi> of it be reconciled with that goodneſs, which is attributed to the <hi>Deity</hi> as an eſſential character?

<pb n="209" facs="unknown:018397_0207_0FA70BAF098C80F8"/>
being. And that this is the real truth of the matter, it ſhall now be my buſineſs to ſhow. In order whereto, let it be obſerved,</p>
            <p>If the <hi>Deity</hi> could have prevented the abuſe of <hi>moral</hi> liberty, it muſt have been in one of theſe three ways, either by not giving <hi>free agents</hi> a place in the ſcale of beings; or by making them ſo perfect as to be incapable of any wrong conduct; or by interpoſing, at all times, as occaſion might require, to hinder the <hi>miſuſe</hi> of <hi>moral</hi> powers, in beings that poſſeſs them, either in a higher or lower degree. Theſe are the only conceivable ways, in which the <hi>Deity</hi> can be ſuppoſed to have it in his power to prevent <hi>moral</hi> diſorder in the creation. And will any ſay, that he <hi>muſt,</hi> if infinitely benevolent, in one or other of theſe ways, have certainly prevented it? So far is this from being capable of proof, that there is good reaſon, on the contrary, to think, it was <hi>naturally,</hi> or <hi>morally</hi> impoſſible, that he ſhould, in either of them, have done it.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>firſt</hi>;—The not giving <hi>free agents</hi> a place in the ſcale of beings would have been a groſs reflection upon the <hi>benevolence</hi> of the <hi>Deity,</hi> inſtead of making way for its bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er diſplay. For the <hi>quantum</hi> of good, capable of being communicated, would, upon this ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, have been greatly leſſened, and indeed reduced to a very pitt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nce, comparatively ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: And the good enjoyed would have been of the loweſt and moſt imperfect kind too. For there is no <hi>pleaſure</hi> like that which is <hi>intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual</hi>
               <pb n="210" facs="unknown:018397_0208_0FA70BAFE1CCFC10"/>
and <hi>moral</hi>; none ſo noble and divine in its nature, none ſo ſatisfying to the ſubjects of it. Beſides, if there were no <hi>moral agents</hi> exiſting, there could be no way for the <hi>Deity</hi> to manifeſt his <hi>moral</hi> glory, which is his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt. He might, it is true, by creating and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning an <hi>unintelligent</hi> world, or creatures in it endowed with <hi>intelligence</hi> in ſo low a degree as to be incapable of <hi>moral</hi> conduct, diſplay, in a meaſure, both power, and contrivance, as well as goodneſs; but he could make no ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of holineſs or juſtice, or thoſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difications even of goodneſs, mercy, forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, long-ſuffering, forgiveneſs. If there was no <hi>free agency,</hi> there could be no virtue, nor any of that ſublime happineſs, which may be the reſult of it. There could not, in one word, be any ſuch thing as <hi>moral government,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which the richeſt diſplays of the moſt ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able perfection could have no place in the creation. And would it now have been for the honor of the <hi>Deity</hi> to have withheld the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of <hi>moral</hi> liberty, by not giving exiſtence to <hi>free agents?</hi> Can it be thought <hi>fit,</hi> that ſuch an <hi>intelligent moral</hi> agent, as <hi>God</hi> is, ſhould create beings, but with ſuch conſtituted pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, as that in the whole circle of exiſtence, there ſhould be no living images of himſelf, no creatures made capable of that <hi>intelligent moral</hi> conduct, or of that <hi>rational</hi> moral happineſs, which compleat his character as a moſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and bleſſed Being? Is it reaſonable that
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:018397_0209_0FA70BB0820A1C28"/>
the high privilege of <hi>moral intelligence</hi> ſhould be excluded the creation? That no being ſhould be made capable of <hi>virtue,</hi> and that trueſt kind of happineſs which is the reſult of it? Will any ſay, it is better there ſhould be no <hi>free agency,</hi> than that beings ſhould be liable to abuſe it? This cannot juſtly be pleaded; for if <hi>free agents</hi> are liable to abuſe their liberty, they are alſo capable of making a good uſe of it, to their conſequent, unſpeakable happineſs. And can it be thought right, that ſo glorious a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity for happineſs as <hi>free agency,</hi> ſhould be totally withheld from all beings, becauſe it might poſſibly have been perverted in its ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency? What though ſome ſhould abuſe it, might not others make a wiſe improvement of it? And why ſhould this be prevented? Why put out of their power, by the <hi>non-beſtowment</hi> of <hi>freedom of choice?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true, if the gift of <hi>liberty</hi> was likely, upon the whole, to produce more <hi>moral</hi> evil than good, it would be a ſufficient reaſon why it ſhould be withheld. But there is no ſolid ground on which to build ſuch a ſuppoſition. It may be juſtly queſtioned, whether this is the caſe, even in this world of our's, where moral freedom is enjoyed but in a low and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect degree: Much leſs may it be thought to be ſo, in other words, among ſuperior orders of <hi>intelligent moral</hi> beings. Perhaps, taking in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to conſideration all the ranks of this kind of beings, in all parts of the creation, but a <hi>few,</hi>
               <pb n="212" facs="unknown:018397_0210_0FA70BB141005900"/>
comparatively, have miſuſed their <hi>moral freedom.</hi> To be ſure, it is not known to be otherwiſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore, for all the proof that can be given to the contrary, the effect of moral and intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual endowment <hi>may</hi> have been the happineſs of the creation, inconceivably beyond what it could have been, if theſe endowments had not been beſtowed. And ſhould this be the truth of fact, as it may be, can it be thought fit, that ſo much happineſs ſhould never have been, by not giving exiſtence to <hi>free agents</hi> at all, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome have fooliſhly miſimproved their moral liberty to their own diſadvantage? It cannot, with any reaſon, be pretended.</p>
            <p>But, it will be ſaid, could not the <hi>Deity</hi> have made <hi>all</hi> free agents <hi>ſo perfect</hi> as to be <hi>incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of wrong conduct?</hi> This is the <hi>ſecond</hi> way, in which it is imagined, that he might have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented <hi>moral evil,</hi> and would have done it, if he had been infinitely benevolent. To which it may be replyed as follows.</p>
            <p>That, if <hi>all</hi> free agents had been made with ſuch <hi>perfect</hi> moral powers, as is here ſuppoſed, it muſt have been an unavoidable bar to that <hi>diverſity</hi> in the creation, which, as has been already proved, is ſo far from leſſening the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of communicable good, that it really makes way for a richer and fuller communication of it, upon the whole, than would otherwiſe have been poſſible. And, was there no other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, this muſt have been effectual to reſtrain the infinitely benevolent <hi>Deity,</hi> from making
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:018397_0211_0FA70BB1FB31F9F8"/>
all beings ſo nearly equal in their rational and moral powers.</p>
            <p>But, letting this paſs for nothing, it may be juſtly queſtioned, whether the creation of intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent beings <hi>ſo perfect</hi> as to be <hi>incapable of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conduct,</hi> is not an <hi>impoſſibility</hi> in the nature of things. For, ſhould we ſuppoſe creatures as perfect as they can be, they would yet be <hi>finite</hi>: And how <hi>intelligent moral</hi> beings that are <hi>finite</hi> ſhould be wholly incapable of becoming faulty, in any kind, or degree, is beyond all conception. It is certainly more reaſonable to think, that the infinitely perfect Being is the <hi>only one</hi> that can be <hi>abſolutely impeccable.</hi> For he only can ſee, at once, all the poſſible connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ideas, and unerringly know what is right and fit in all caſes whatever: And he only is immutably and everlaſtingly diſpoſed to chuſe and act according to the truth and reaſon of things.</p>
            <p>But, ſhould it be ſuppoſed <hi>naturally</hi> poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for <hi>free agents</hi> to be <hi>at once</hi> created ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect as that it could not be that they ſhould err in <hi>choice</hi> or <hi>behaviour,</hi> it will ſtill remain a queſtion, whether it be <hi>morally</hi> poſſible, i. e. poſſible in conſiſtency with wiſe and fit conduct in the Deity? And, perhaps, thus <hi>morally</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it is not poſſible. This, it is probable, may ſeem a paradox to ſome; but there are reaſons for its ſupport, which are juſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive; though they ſhould not amount to ſtrict demonſtration.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="214" facs="unknown:018397_0212_0FA70BB30A4A00B0"/>So far as our knowledge extends, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, in point of fact, that <hi>intelligent moral</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are not when they <hi>firſt</hi> come into exiſtence, either ſo <hi>perfect</hi> or <hi>happy</hi> as they may be, and indeed cannot but be, if the tendency of their faculties is not obſtructed. They are ſo formed, ſome of them at leaſt, as to be capable of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, both in perfection and happineſs, to a very high degree: Which progreſs is very much dependant on themſelves, the uſe they make of their implanted powers, and the pains they are at to cultivate and improve them. Thus it is with <hi>man,</hi> the higheſt intelligent moral agent we are particularly acquainted with. His facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, at firſt, are feeble, and not to be exerciſed but in a low degree: Yet they are ſo made as to be gradually capable of enlargement, even beyond what could have been imagined, if it had not been for experience.

If he makes a wiſe and good improvement of the powers he is endowed with, he will reap the advantage of his pains in correſponding attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in perfection and happineſs: Whereas, if
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:018397_0213_0FA70BB37A33DF30"/>
he takes no care to cultivate his faculties, the effect will be, their remaining in a low, imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſtate: Nay, ſuch is the conſtitution of his nature, as we may ſee afterwards, that, by miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>improving them, he may not only check their growth, but bring them into a declining con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, ſo as that they may become gradually unfit to yield him any fruit but that of unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and miſery.</p>
            <p>This is the truth of fact, reſpecting the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, if not the <hi>only,</hi> order of <hi>intelligent moral</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, in this world. And the fact, ſo far as we are able to judge, is perfectly agreeable to what is <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>fit</hi> in the reaſon of things. As the beings, we are ſpeaking of, are made capable of happineſs, in conſequence of their own <hi>choice</hi> and <hi>conduct,</hi> and in proportion to the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity</hi> therein diſcovered, what more juſt than its dependence thereon? In what more proper way could <hi>wiſe,</hi> though infinite, benevolence communicate happineſs to them? What un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitableneſs is there in making happineſs their own acquiſition, the fruit of their own induſtry? What reaſonable beings would not chuſe exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon theſe terms? And who will ſay, that they would make an unwiſe choice? It is certain, this method of communicating hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs <hi>may</hi> be the <hi>wiſeſt</hi> and <hi>beſt</hi>; and that glorious intelligent Being, who perfectly ſees the fitneſs of things, in all poſſible connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>may</hi> know it to be ſo: And ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>uld this be the caſe, as cannot be diſproved, it was not
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:018397_0214_0FA70BB7D1B3E410"/>
poſſible for him, acting <hi>morally,</hi> or, in other words, as an <hi>intelligent wiſe</hi> agent, to have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated it any other way.</p>
            <p>And this reaſoning, if extended to the other ranks of free agents, in other worlds, will equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hold good. It is <hi>fit</hi> and <hi>right,</hi> in true rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that they alſo ſhould be ſo conſtituted, as that their perfection and happineſs ſhould not be communicated with their beings, but made to depend, in ſome ſuitable meaſure, on the wiſe and regular exerciſe of their powers: The conſequence of which muſt be their <hi>liableneſs,</hi> in common with mankind, though in various degrees, according to their various capacities and circumſtances, to a <hi>voluntary perverſion</hi> of their faculties. This, I ſay, appears to an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive mind the <hi>fitteſt</hi> method of communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating <hi>good</hi> to <hi>reaſonable moral</hi> beings: And the Deity perceiving it to be ſo, may have all along obſerved this rule, in the beſtowment of it. Nor is there a <hi>known fact</hi> to the contrary, in the whole creation: Though, if we may give credit to the writings called ſacred, there is a <hi>fact,</hi> relating to ſome of the <hi>intelligent</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, in other worlds, which perfectly coincides with this method of diſpenſing happineſs. For we there read of the 'angels which ſinned,' and of the 'angels which kept not their firſt eſtate; which account of theſe <hi>moral intelligences</hi> does not conſiſt with their being created happy, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent of their own virtuous conduct, but ſuppoſes the contrary: Obviouſly leading to the
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:018397_0215_0FA70BBA405AF140"/>
thought, that they were made, as <hi>men</hi> are, capable of happineſs, but yet liable to a <hi>voluntary ſelf-cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</hi> And all the ranks of <hi>moral</hi> beings <hi>might</hi> be created in like circumſtances: And, I will add, <hi>muſt</hi> have been ſo created, if this was <hi>moſt wiſe,</hi> and <hi>fit,</hi> as we have ſeen there is reaſon to think it was, and no proof can be given to the contrary.</p>
            <p>Not but that there are <hi>free agents,</hi> who may, before this time, have got beyond any <hi>probable danger</hi> of <hi>moral</hi> defection. And this may be the caſe, even of <hi>men,</hi> in ſome other ſtate; though ſo inferior an order of <hi>intelligent</hi> beings. But then, this freedom from danger ought to be conſidered, as owing, not to the perfection of their faculties, as, at firſt, communicated to them; but partly to the <hi>ſtrong, habitual</hi> turn that has been given them, by wiſe and regular exerciſe; and partly, though principally, to the <hi>ſuperintending influence</hi> of the <hi>Deity,</hi> who may think it <hi>fit</hi> and <hi>wiſe,</hi> after ſuitable <hi>trial</hi> and <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement,</hi> to preſerve them from all faulty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, ſo far, at leaſt, as that they ſhall never fall from the perfection and happineſs of their preſent ſtate.</p>
            <p>But, before <hi>intelligent moral</hi> beings have gone through ſome ſtate of trial, wherein they have made the happineſs proper to their natures, their <hi>own choice,</hi> and have ſo conducted themſelves as to be worthy of it, and to have fitted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, by a courſe of ſuitable exerciſe, for the enjoyment of it: I ſay, before this, it does not ſeem <hi>meet</hi> and <hi>fit,</hi> that it ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:018397_0216_0FA70BBBD9BC4D78"/>
on them; much leſs in ſuch a way as that it <hi>could not be but they muſt be happy.</hi> It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly conſonant to the notions we moſt readily and naturally form of <hi>right</hi> and <hi>fit,</hi> that ſuch kind of beings ſhould come to the enjoyment of happineſs, in conformity to ſome method wiſely adjuſted to their proper natures: And what more ſuitable one can be imagined than this, which makes happineſs, not the <hi>unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble privilege</hi> of their creation, but the <hi>effect</hi> of their own <hi>moral freedom?</hi> Which beſtows it, not <hi>abſolutely,</hi> but in <hi>conſequence</hi> of their own <hi>vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous conduct,</hi> or, in other words, as the <hi>reſult</hi> herefrom, according to ſettled laws, under the notion of a <hi>motive</hi> hereto, or a ſuitable <hi>reward</hi> therefor? This, to be ſure, as has been obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, <hi>may be</hi> the <hi>fitteſt</hi> way of communicating happineſs to <hi>all</hi> moral beings, without diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and <hi>might</hi> appear to be ſo to the infinite and ſupreme Mind: And, if this was the real truth, as we cannot ſay it was not, it could not be within the <hi>moral</hi> power of the <hi>Deity,</hi> to have created <hi>free agents,</hi> and put them <hi>at once,</hi> without previous <hi>trial</hi> or <hi>improvement,</hi> in a ſtate of <hi>full perfection,</hi> and <hi>confirmed happineſs.</hi> And if ſo, they could not have been made <hi>impecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> as it is pleaded they might have been, and muſt have been, if their Maker had been an <hi>infinitely benevolent</hi> Being.</p>
            <p>There is yet another way, in which it is thought the <hi>Deity</hi> might have <hi>prevented</hi> moral evil; and this is, by interpoſing, at all times,
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:018397_0217_0FA70BBC81F80F10"/>
as occaſion ſhould require, to keep <hi>free agents</hi> from <hi>miſuſing</hi> their liberty. If by this <hi>interpoſition</hi> be meant (and it muſt mean, if to the purpoſe for which it is introduced) ſuch a <hi>preſidency</hi> of the <hi>Deity</hi> over free agents as is accompanied, at all times with <hi>ſuch exertions</hi> as ſhall be <hi>certainly effectual</hi> to reſtrain them from perverting their faculties, it may be anſwered, as under the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer head, that it looks like a <hi>moral impoſſibility,</hi> or, in other words, a method of conducting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>free agents</hi> which is <hi>unfit,</hi> in the reaſon of things; as not being ſuited to the <hi>nature</hi> of ſuch kind of beings. The exertions of the <hi>Deity</hi> ought always to be conceived of as directed by <hi>perfect wiſdom</hi>: And if, as the effect of ſuch exertions, <hi>free agents</hi> are brought into exiſtence, the ſame wiſdom that created them, requires ſuch a method of conduct towards them, as is <hi>conſiſtent</hi> with the powers beſtowed on them. And can it be juſtly ſaid, that ſuch a method would be taken, if, by any <hi>extrinſic</hi> power, their faculties were <hi>unavoidably</hi> put into exerciſe in <hi>one certain way only?</hi> If all conjunctures of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances ſhould conſtantly be prevented, in which their <hi>moral freedom</hi> could poſſibly be <hi>abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed</hi>; or, if motives ſhould, in all caſes, be ſet in ſuch a <hi>ſtrong</hi> and <hi>powerful</hi> light, as that <hi>no wrong choice could be made</hi>; or if, by <hi>immediate</hi> impreſſion from the <hi>Deity,</hi> free agents ſhould be kept, in all times of temptation, from <hi>all hazard of being drawn aſide</hi>: I ſay, if, in any of theſe ways, the <hi>Deity</hi> ſhould exert himſelf to the
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:018397_0218_0FA70BBD422D4428"/>
               <hi>prevention</hi> of <hi>moral</hi> irregularity, how would ſuch a method of operation <hi>conſiſt</hi> with the proper powers of <hi>free agents</hi>! It does not appear to the human mind a thing <hi>fit,</hi> that they ſhould be thus <hi>irreſiſtibly</hi> guided, by any <hi>extrinſic</hi> power, though it were even <hi>Divine.</hi> This method of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is well ſuited to the <hi>unintelligent</hi> part of the creation; which, being poſſeſſed of no <hi>ſelf-directing</hi> principle, muſt be abſolutely conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the power of the Supreme Will. But the influence of the <hi>Deity</hi> on <hi>free agents</hi> muſt needs be of a different kind: Otherwiſe, it would not harmonize with the <hi>eſſential</hi> powers of their nature. And why indeed ſhould there be any beings at all endowed with <hi>moral liberty,</hi> if they are not left to the <hi>free</hi> uſe of their faculties? What room would there be, upon ſuppoſition of ſome <hi>foreign over-ruling influence,</hi> either for their chuſing or acting virtuouſly? What foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for the <hi>moral</hi> government of them? And, in a word, what diſtinction would there be, in <hi>reality of conſequence,</hi> between them and meer <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animate</hi> beings, as to the <hi>Deity's</hi> exerciſing rule over them? It is true, being endowed with the faculty of perception, they would be capable of <hi>happineſs</hi>; but this could have no connection with, or dependance on, any <hi>proper choice of their own.</hi> It would be an <hi>unavoidable</hi> communication of good; good diſpenſed, not as the <hi>effect</hi> of the regular exerciſe of a <hi>ſelf-directing</hi> principle, not in <hi>conſequence</hi> of any <hi>real determining power of their own,</hi> but by the <hi>irreſiſtible</hi> will of the <hi>Deity,</hi> in
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:018397_0219_0FA70BBE23B58A60"/>
his government of them. And will any call this a <hi>fit</hi> method of dealing with <hi>free agents?</hi> It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſo pronounced, unleſs by thoſe, who have no idea of <hi>good,</hi> but as communicated to the <hi>utmoſt,</hi> without regard to the <hi>natures</hi> of <hi>eſſentially different</hi> beings, and that wiſe conduct which ought always to be uſed with reference to them.</p>
            <p>But, after all that has been offered, ſome will ſay, ſhould it be allowed to be fit, that an order of moral agents, ſuch as men are, might be brought into exiſtence, and that it would conſiſt with the benevolence we attribute to the Deity, to place them in a ſtate, wherein their virtue ſhould be put to a trial; why need this trial have been ſo dangerous an one? Why ſhould there have been the implantation of theſe appetites, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſities, affections, and paſſions, in their nature, with a variety of external objects ſo ſuited to give them pleaſure, as almoſt unavoidably to entice them to will, and to act, in contradiction to the rules of virtue, and ſo as to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unhappy? Would a kind and good Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor have put them to a trial ſo difficult and hazard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous? Yea rather could he have done it, if he had been infinitely benevolent?</p>
            <p>In anſwer to this, which, perhaps, is an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the Divine benevolence, the moſt difficult of any intirely to remove, it may be obſerved as follows.</p>
            <p>In a creation inconceivably diverſified, it may be proper there ſhould be as great a variety of moral beings, as of meerly animal ones; and
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:018397_0220_0FA70BBEB8BCEAE8"/>
that there ſhould be a ſimilar gradation from the higheſt to the loweſt order of them: The conſequence from which is, that the capacities of theſe moral beings muſt be various, and their attainment to a confirmed, virtuous temper pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably more or leſs difficult. The claſs of men, I ſuppoſe, may juſtly be reckoned the loweſt of the moral kind; for which reaſon, their conducting in life ſo as to deſerve the character of virtuous may be moſt difficult. But this notwithſtanding, it may be fit there ſhould be ſuch a claſs of moral intelligences, in order to compleat that variety in exiſtence, which the infinitely wiſe Deity might judge expedient for a full manifeſtation of his benevolence. As many orders, of beings, as might be thought proper, not united to matter of any kind, may have been brought into exiſtence, the loweſt of which may ſurpaſs in glory the higheſt of thoſe who are embodied; among whom alſo there may be as great a variety in the mode and degree of their perfection: In which view of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it is no other than might be expected, that there ſhould be, ſuch a creature as man, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever comparative imperfection may attend his make, and whatever difficulties may lie in the way of his attaining to that virtue and happineſs, he is formed capable of: Eſpecially, if it ſhould be found, that, for a being compounded as he is, there is nothing in his conſtitution but what is wiſely and kindly adapted to promote his good, with reſpect to both parts of his compoſition.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="223" facs="unknown:018397_0221_0FA70BC009C84D90"/>Has he animal appetites and propenſities? Theſe, as planted in him by his Maker, were intended, and are wiſely adapted, to guard him againſt inconveniences; and not only ſo, but to give him pleaſure. And he is, accordingly, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with objects purpoſely ſuited, by the benevolent Creator, to yield him this pleaſure: Nor can he reaſonably be charged with acting below his character, as a man, if, within proper limits, be gratifies theſe natural appetites. They are therefore a wiſe contrivance to increaſe, not to diminiſh, his happineſs.</p>
            <p>Has he implanted in him a variety of affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and paſſions? They are all deſigned to promote his good, not his hurt. Was he deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titute of ſelf-love, how feeble and languid would be his endeavors, if he endeavored at all, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve life, or render it ſo comfortable as it might be? Had he no fear, how often would he run into danger, and expoſe himſelf to numberleſs diſaſters? Had he no reſentment, how would he invite injuries, and ſuffer abuſes of every kind in ſuch a world as this? Had he no ambition, what a powerful ſtimulus would be wanting in his conſtitution to excite his endeavors to excel in this or the other art and ſcience, or in any thing laudable and praiſe-worthy? And the ſame may be ſaid of every other affection and paſſion. They all tend to good, and we ſhould enjoy leſs of it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them than with them. It is true, they are capable of abuſe; and ſo muſt have been, or we could not have been free agents, placed in a ſtate of trial.
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:018397_0222_0FA70BC297FDC4F8"/>
And ſhould we abuſe that to our hurt, which ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Maker deſigned, and wiſely adapted, to promote our good, would it not be highly unreaſonable to bring ſuch an abuſe, as a complaint againſt his benevolence? And yet, this is the real purport of the objected difficulty, put into plain Engliſh: Unleſs it ſhould be ſaid, that the Deity would have manifeſted more kindneſs to us men, if he had not planted theſe appetites and paſſions in our nature, than he has done by planting them; as the danger of our falling from virtue and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming miſerable, by means of them, is ſo great as ſcarcely to be avoided. But will any one of found underſtanding calmly and deliberately ſay, (to ſpeak in the words of a very ſenſible and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious writer) "That the Creator, if he would have approved himſelf wiſely benevolent to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, ſhould have precluded all from the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure they taſte in eating and drinking, becauſe otherwiſe ſome will prove intemperate: That he ſhould have appointed marriage, and the care of children, to be unattended with any ſenſible pleaſure, becauſe otherwiſe ſome perſons would be lewd and unjuſt; that we ſhould receive no pleaſure from beauty of any kind but moral, leſt ſome ſhould fooliſhly and wickedly prefer the beauties and pleaſures of ſenſe and imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, before the beauty of virtue: That none ſhould naturally love themſelves, and be ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excited to take care of their own welfare, leſt ſome ſhould be tempted to gratify this paſſion with the injury of others: That we ſhould
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:018397_0223_0FA70BC39FFC33B0"/>
have been formed indifferent to oppreſſion, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, and wickedneſs, and have felt no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment at the view of thoſe, to prevent any perſon's being angry, even when they are not injured: That there ſhould have been naturally no ſatisfaction attending a juſt ſelf-approbation, that men might not be inclined to value them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves without reaſon; and no deſire to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend ourſelves to the eſteem of others, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent qualities and benevolent actions, leſt ſome ſhould endeavor to gain the favorable opinion of others by fooliſh, or wicked actions: That men ſhould have been without the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſhame, to reſtrain them from what is baſe, and deſerving infamy, leſt ſome be aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of what is virtuous and honorable: That there ſhould have been no attraction in liberty, leſt ſome ſhould be tempted to licentiouſneſs; and nothing appear deſirable in a power to do great good, that none might ſtrive for a power of doing great miſchief: And that no noble emulation ſhould have been felt in the human boſom, leſt envy ſhould creep in, and make ſelf-tormentors, and miſchievous to their neighbours. Would this have been a better conſtitution, than the preſent? What wiſe and conſiderate perſon can think it?" The plain truth is, there is no appetite, affection, or paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as planted in our nature by the God who made us, but what was intended, and wiſely adapted, to anſwer ſome valuable purpoſe or other; inſomuch, that it would have been greatly diſadvantageous to us, had we not been
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:018397_0224_0FA70BC40191FE28"/>
furniſhed with them. And ſhould they, by not being kept under due government, prove the occaſion of ſin, and conſequent miſery, could the Creator, in conſiſtency with reaſon, be charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with not having been benevolent? Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, if it be conſidered, that theſe very appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites and paſſions, might have been a means, wiſely improved, of promoting that virtue in us, which would yield the full happineſs proper to ſuch beings as we are.</p>
            <p>Some will ſtill plead, if appetites and paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in ſuch a conſtitution as our's, ſhould be ſuppoſed to be proper, why need they have been heightened to ſuch a degree of ſtrength? Or if even this ſhould have been expedient, why were not our intellectual and moral powers proportionably exalted, that the undue influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of appetite and paſſion might the more eaſily be controuled? Would it not have been more kind in our Creator, and have argued greater benevolence, if he had given us ſtronger rational abilities, and weaker animal propenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties? Eſpecially, as it is principally owing to the ſtrong impetus of our bodily inclinations, that we are ſo generally, led aſide into the path of vice and folly, to our own great diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. The anſwer I would return to this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ection, which, far from being a trifling one, deſerves a ſerious conſideration, is as follows.</p>
            <p>If our appetites and paſſions, in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſtate, and as implanted in us by our Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, had been lowered in their ſtrength, they
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:018397_0225_0FA70BC6B953FEB0"/>
might have been inſufficient to anſwer the good ends of their original implantation. In like manner, had our intellectual powers been height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened, they might have unfitted us to live in ſuch a world as this is. The contrivance of the Deity in man's conſtitution, and the adjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of its various parts, both animal and mental, is perfect, and will admit, other things remaining as they were, of no amendment. One power is ſo cloſely connected with, and near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly related to another, and that other to another ſtill, and the whole to ſuch a world as we are placed in, that no alteration could be made in one part, but what would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, and ſo on, till there muſt be a total alteration, not only in man, but the world he lives in; the abſurdity of which will be explained, and the pertinency of this whole paragraph juſtified, in its proper place hereafter.</p>
            <p>It may alſo be worthy of notice, that a varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the trial of various claſſes of intelligent moral beings, in point of difficulty and hazard, may be a wiſe contrivance of the Creator for the more illuſtrious diſplay of his goodneſs, in harmony with his other moral attributes. It is certain, with reſpect to us men, that our trial, as individuals, is, for wiſe and good ends, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably various in point of difficulty and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; and why might <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t not, for like good ends, be a more difficult one, ſhould we be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as a claſs, of beings, than has been allotted
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:018397_0226_0FA70BC703E39718"/>
to other claſſes of a ſuperior order? There is an analogy in this with the whole conduct of God, which has been various, both in making and governing all the creatures he has given exiſtence to. And, it may be, his benevolence, by means of this variety, is more wiſely, and fully diſplayed, than it would have been by any other. And one claſs of beings would have no more reaſon to complain, ſhould the difficulty of their trial, in conſequence of this expedient variety, be greater, and attended with more hazard, than the trial of another claſs; I ſay, they would have no more reaſon for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, than they have becauſe they were not made that other claſs of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>atures.</p>
            <p>It ought to be conſidered ſtill further, that men's appetites and paſſions, by being indulged beyond what is fit and right, may be heighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their impetus, and quite altered from their natural ſtate. And when this is the caſe, as we all know it too commonly is, by not keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them within thoſe reſtraints we both might, and ought to have done, we ourſelves, and not our Creator, are to blame, if diſorders are introduced into our frame, and our trial, by this means, is made more difficult and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, than it otherwiſe would have been; and, inſtead of reflecting on the Deity for not hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been ſo benevolent, as we fondly imagine he might have been, we ſhould condemn our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and throw the blame wholly of our own wickedneſs and folly; for to this it ought, in all reaſon, to be aſcribed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="229" facs="unknown:018397_0227_0FA70BC9D44B7328"/>It is acknowledged, that the natural ſtate of the appetites and paſſions may be altered, and often is ſo, and much for the worſe, even where the ſubjects of this alteration are not the blam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able cauſes of it.

Beſides all which, it may be depended on as a ſure truth,
<pb facs="unknown:018397_0229_0FA70BCE61D777A8"/>
the good God will make all reaſonable allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances for whatever diſadvantages our ſtate of trial may be attended with; conducting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, conformably to that eternal rule of, equity, "according to what a man has, and not according to what he has not, ſhall be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to him." And this ſame rule, adapting it to all other claſſes of beings, in all worlds, is that by which the Supreme Ruler and Judge will meaſure his conduct towards them: In conſequence of which, they will all, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of juſt and fair treatment, be brought to an exact equality. Leſs will be required of thoſe beings, whoſe powers were ſmall, and their difficulties great; and proportionably more of thoſe, whoſe powers were greater, and their difficulties leſs. So that, however low the capacities of us men are, and whatever dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties our ſtate of trial may be attended with, the Supreme King and Judge will be equally impartial and juſt in his dealings towards us, as with reſpect to any of the beings that are above us, in the ſcale of exiſtence.</p>
            <p>The ſum of what has been ſaid, in order to reconcile moral irregularity with benevolence in the Deity is, that it ought not to be attributed to him, as its productive cauſe; but to the creatures that were made <hi>free agents</hi>: That the making of free agents was <hi>neceſſary</hi> in order to the communication of the higheſt good in kind; becauſe, if they had not been made, this kind of good would have been wanting in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:018397_0230_0FA70BCE81C85068"/>
That, if free agents were at all brought into exiſtence, it <hi>muſt</hi> have been with powers <hi>ſo far imperfect,</hi> as to import a <hi>poſſibility</hi> of their erring, without <hi>interpoſitions</hi> of the <hi>Deity</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it: That their <hi>could not</hi> have been <hi>ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſitions,</hi> in conſiſtency with wiſe and fit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct; becauſe they would, in true conſtruction, deſtroy the very notion of <hi>free agency,</hi> and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with it all foundation for any diſtinction between <hi>moral</hi> right and wrong: And finally, that however low a claſs of moral agents we men are, and however difficult our trial, by means of implanted appetites and paſſions, may be, ſuch an order of beings might be fit, in that variety of exiſtences the wiſdom of God might judge proper, in order to a full diſplay of his perfections in general, and his benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence in particular: From which premiſes, if true, as we have ſeen good reaſon to think them to be, and no proof can be given to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, it follows, that the <hi>actual defection</hi> of free agents is not to be imputed to any <hi>deficiency</hi> of goodneſs in the <hi>Deity</hi>; and therefore that there can be no <hi>real</hi> inconſiſtency between the exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of this <hi>moral depravity</hi> and <hi>infinite benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,</hi> whatever there may be in <hi>appearance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I would only obſerve, before I proceed, it is all along ſuppoſed, in the above reaſoning, that the entrance of <hi>moral diſorder</hi> into the creation would have been irreconcilable with <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>unbounded goodneſs,</hi> unleſs every thing had been <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="233" facs="unknown:018397_0231_0FA70BCF49BAD070"/>
to be done, to have prevented it. And could it be proved, in reſpect of any <hi>claſs</hi> of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent moral beings, or in reſpect of any <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual</hi> in this claſs, that the <hi>Deity</hi> had been wanting in what was <hi>reaſonably</hi> neceſſary, on his part, that there might not have been a <hi>defec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> I ſee not but it would be an invincible ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection againſt the <hi>infinite benevolence</hi> of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. For it is not ſuppoſable, but that a being ſupremely and abſolutely good ſhould deſire the happineſs of his <hi>whole creation</hi>; eſpecially of <hi>intelligent moral</hi> creatures, in all their various <hi>ranks,</hi> and numberleſs <hi>individuals</hi>: And that he ſhould operate, in all wiſe and reaſonable methods, to promote it. And it would certainly argue a <hi>deficiency</hi> in his goodneſs, if he could ſee them <hi>act wrong,</hi> and not exert himſelf <hi>ſo far</hi> as he <hi>might do,</hi> in conſiſtency with <hi>reaſon</hi> and <hi>wiſdom,</hi> to hinder it. It is indeed impoſſible, if we may ſay any thing is ſo, not only that infinite bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence ſhould put <hi>innocent moral agents</hi> into cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, wherein their <hi>ſeduction</hi> would be <hi>unavoidable</hi>; but that it ſhould withhold its co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operation, in any proper ways, agreeable to their natures, to advance the perfection and felicity they are made capable of. To us <hi>men,</hi> it may poſſibly ſeem, as though more might have been done for the <hi>human ſpecies,</hi> ſome of them at leaſt, to have ſecured their attachment to virtue: But are we ſure of this? Are we able to exhibit clear and full proof, that the <hi>Deity</hi> has been wanting in any thing, proper
<pb n="234" facs="unknown:018397_0232_0FA70BCFFAC3EE18"/>
on his part, to keep mankind from debaſing their natures? It is true, we were not placed in the higheſt claſs of moral beings: But can we ſay, that the <hi>order</hi> of the creation, and the wiſe and good ends for which it was made, would not allow, that a rank of beings, conſtituted and endowed as we are, ſhould be in it? Or will we take upon us to ſhow, that the conduct of the <hi>Deity,</hi> towards us, has not been ſo wiſely and fitly adjuſted to the deſign of making us happy, as it might reaſonably have been? Can it be proved, that the only good God expects more from us, than he ought to do, in true equity? Or that he has neglected any <hi>ſuitable</hi> method of operation to guard us againſt <hi>error,</hi> either in <hi>choice</hi> or <hi>practice</hi>? Are we not conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to ourſelves, when we do wrong, that we do it <hi>freely,</hi> and as furniſhed with all the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervatives</hi> againſt ſuch conduct, which we could <hi>reaſonably</hi> expect, or deſire, as <hi>moral</hi> agents, and which might have been effectual to our reſtraint, if we had carefully uſed them, in the due ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of underſtanding and attention? And if this is the real truth, as we are conſcious to ourſelves that it is, ſhall we reflect upon the <hi>Deity,</hi> as not having exerted himſelf, in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ways, to prevent our <hi>miſconduct</hi>? We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pretend, without the higheſt arrogance, to ſay, much leſs to prove that <hi>he</hi> has not done all that he <hi>could</hi> wiſely do to preſerve us inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent: And more than this would have been inconſiſtent with his own <hi>abſolute perfection.</hi> So
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:018397_0233_0FA70BD0D6F47700"/>
that he may be <hi>infinitely good,</hi> notwithſtanding the <hi>degeneracy</hi> of mankind, which we know moſt about, and complain moſt of.</p>
            <p>I now proceed to conſider, in the <hi>ſecond</hi> place, the <hi>unhappineſs</hi> ariſing from <hi>immoral</hi> conduct. For by the <hi>evil</hi> complained of, in the objection, is meant, not only the <hi>irregularity</hi> of <hi>free agents,</hi> but the <hi>miſery connected</hi> herewith, or <hi>conſequent</hi> hereupon, either by the <hi>conſtitution of nature,</hi> or <hi>infliction</hi> from the <hi>Deity.</hi> If wrong determinations, and unreaſonable purſuits, were not <hi>accompanied</hi> nor <hi>followed</hi> with unhappineſs, either to the <hi>faulty agents</hi> themſelves or <hi>others</hi> by their means, the objectors againſt <hi>infinite goodneſs</hi> would not, it may be, be ſo ſtrenuous in urging this difficulty: But as the <hi>fact</hi> is, they are bitter in their complaints, thinking it extremely hard, that creatures, for only miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſing their liberty, ſhould be ſubjected to <hi>conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent puniſhment, natural</hi> or <hi>penal</hi>; and that <hi>others</hi> likewiſe ſhould be made ſuch <hi>great ſufferers</hi> by their vices and follies. How, ſay they, could the <hi>Deity,</hi> if infinitely benevolent, not only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit creatures of his own forming to <hi>corrupt</hi> themſelves, but <hi>connect miſery</hi> with their ſo doing; conſtituting things ſo as to make their <hi>wrong doing</hi> an <hi>occaſion</hi> of <hi>unhappineſs,</hi> in infinitely va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious kinds, not only to themſelves, but to others alſo? What a wide door has hereby been opened for the entrance of <hi>miſery</hi> into the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Who can compute the immenſe ſum of pain and torment, of one ſort or another, this
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:018397_0234_0FA70BD38A02FD00"/>
conſtitution has paved the way for? And can it be attributed to an infinitely benevolent Cauſe? Could ſuch a ſtate of things have ever been, if a good God had been at the head of it, as its ſupreme directing Cauſe?</p>
            <p>It is anſwered, in the firſt place, by freely owning, that <hi>moral irregularity</hi> is unavoidably connected with unhappineſs; inſomuch, that by far the greater part of thoſe <hi>evils</hi> which abound in the creation are the <hi>natural</hi> or <hi>penal</hi> effect hereof: Nay, it is readily granted, that the conſtitution of things is ſuch, that <hi>moral in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent</hi> beings are capable of ſo corrupting their implanted powers, as that miſery <hi>muſt</hi> be the conſequence, both to <hi>themſelves</hi> and <hi>others</hi> alſo, in certain degrees, while they continue in this ſtate of degeneracy. Nay, I deny not, but the conſtitution of things is ſuch, as that unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs muſt be the fruit of abuſed <hi>moral</hi> freedom, in another period of exiſtence, ſo long, and in ſuch proportion, as the wiſdom of the Supreme Creator and Governor may think requiſite.</p>
            <p>But then I add, in the next place, that this is ſo far from arguing want of <hi>goodneſs</hi> in the <hi>Deity,</hi> that it very conſpicuouſly illuſtrates the benevolence of his nature. It will probably ſeem ſtrange, to thoſe who have not exerciſed their thoughts upon this ſubject, to hear it ſaid, that <hi>unhappineſs</hi> may be the fruit of <hi>benevolence,</hi> and an argument in pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>f of it, rather than an objection againſt it. And yet, this is the real truth; and I doubt not but that may be ſaid
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:018397_0235_0FA70BD645C0AFD0"/>
upon the matter, which will make it clearly and fully appear to be ſo.</p>
            <p>Only, let it be previouſly remembered, that the <hi>poſſibility</hi> of <hi>moral irregularity</hi> has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready accounted for, and the actual being of it, in the creation, reconciled with infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: Which being ſuppoſed, in this part of the argument, I proceed to ſhow,</p>
            <p>Wherein the <hi>unhappineſs</hi> that is connected, in <hi>nature,</hi> or by <hi>poſitive infliction</hi> from the <hi>Deity,</hi> with the <hi>miſuſe of moral powers,</hi> is ſubſervient to the <hi>general good</hi> of the <hi>rational</hi> creation, which is hereby more effectually promoted than it would have been, if <hi>free agents</hi> might have <hi>acted wrong with impunity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it is very obvious, in the firſt place, that a great part of the unhappineſs following upon <hi>voluntary miſconduct</hi> is of the medicinal kind, and ſtrongly tends to the cure of its pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients. The uneaſy ſenſations occaſioned by vicious practice, together with thoſe various other pains, which are <hi>naturally</hi> conſequent thereupon, what are they but ſo many <hi>motives</hi> to repentance, and a due care to make a wiſer uſe of moral powers? What better adapted <hi>means</hi> could have been contrived to rouſe the faulty agents to attention, bring them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, and put them upon endeavours to prevent their own ruin? If they found no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience in an irregular courſe, what ſhould ſtop their progreſs, having entered on it? What probable proſpect would there be, in
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:018397_0236_0FA70BD72D786D38"/>
this caſe, of their ever coming to themſelves, and recovering a right mind? And is it not for their <hi>good,</hi> that their vicious conduct ſhould be attended with <hi>ſuffering,</hi> while this <hi>ſuffering</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered under the notion of a <hi>means</hi> powerfully fitted, in a reaſonable way of operation, to check their folly, and reduce them to virtue? Does not <hi>pain,</hi> in this view of it, ceaſe to be an <hi>evil,</hi> and become a <hi>real good</hi>? And ought not the <hi>Deity,</hi> who has thus conſtituted things, to be looked upon as a phyſician and friend, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning their <hi>intereſt,</hi> and not as an enemy, who is doing them harm? And the caſe is juſt the ſame in reſpect of <hi>puniſhments</hi> more <hi>poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively</hi> inflicted. They are a <hi>means</hi> wiſely adap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to promote the welfare of thoſe who ſuffer them, and are ſo intended by the all-merciful Governor of the univerſe, ſo long as they are capable of <hi>amendment</hi> by any means whatever. And if, after this, they ſhould be continued in ſuffering circumſtances, even ſuch a method of conduct would be perfectly conſiſtent with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite goodneſs, for ſome other reaſons we may have occaſion to mention afterwards.</p>
            <p>It is very evident, in the next place, that the evils connected with immoral action, in the Divine government, are for the <hi>good</hi> of <hi>others,</hi> as well as the faulty agents themſelves. They are indeed, at leaſt in this lower world, with which we are beſt acquainted, a <hi>general</hi> diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to vicious practice, a ſtanding, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual <hi>means</hi> provided by the <hi>Deity</hi> to ſecure the
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:018397_0237_0FA70BD7858E9F68"/>
               <hi>virtue,</hi> and by conſequence the <hi>greateſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs,</hi> of the <hi>human ſpecies,</hi> it may be, the only <hi>rational moral</hi> agents here exiſting. It is highly probable, if not certain, that mankind, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering their various propenſions, though all ſuited to their <hi>condition,</hi> and ſubjected to the guidance of their <hi>reaſon,</hi> would not be reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed within any tolerable bounds of decency, if it was <hi>ſeen</hi> that no diſadvantage followed, when any of their rank perverted the order of their faculties, and purſued an irregular courſe of action. The <hi>unhappineſs,</hi> inſeparably conjoined with voluntary, continued miſconduct, by the known, eſtabliſhed laws of the Divine admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, is one of the grand reſtraints provided for their ſecurity: And were this to be taken off, they would, without all doubt, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the remonſtrances of <hi>reaſon</hi> againſt <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination,</hi> be ſoon loſt to all ſenſe of virtue, and trample upon the ſacred obligations to the practice of it. And if it is for the <hi>good</hi> of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind that this ſhould be prevented, ſo far as may be, in all ſuitable ways, it is equally for their good, that <hi>vice</hi> ſhould be connected with <hi>miſery</hi>; becauſe a powerful, and yet well adap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>means,</hi> to this end. And it ſhould ſeem indeed as though <hi>this connection</hi> was a <hi>neceſſary proviſion,</hi> in the government of the <hi>whole intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual ſyſtem,</hi> to preſerve it from confuſion, and accompliſh, by a regular and conſiſtent method of operation, the great thing intended and purſued by the <hi>Deity,</hi> viz. its <hi>greateſt good.</hi> It may, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:018397_0238_0FA70BD85EE98360"/>
be thought more noble for <hi>rational</hi> crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, eſpecially the <hi>higher</hi> order of them, to be influenced to right conduct <hi>ſolely</hi> from the <hi>fitneſs</hi> of the thing in itſelf conſidered: But, it may be, there are no created intelligences above the need of <hi>other motives.</hi> It is certain, an <hi>averſion from miſery</hi> muſt be looked upon as a leading principle in all their natures, from the <hi>higheſt</hi> to the <hi>loweſt</hi> of them: And if ſo, what a powerful guard muſt it be to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, to ſee the loſs of it, in other beings like themſelves, attended, in <hi>fact,</hi> with vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſorrow? How ſtrongly muſt it tend to ſecure their adherence to the rule of right, to behold a deviation from it, in this and the other inſtance, accompanied with miſery, by the Divine conſtitution? It is reaſonable to think, it may be owing, in part, to <hi>this connection,</hi> that the <hi>whole moral creation</hi> is preſerved, under the ſuperintendency of the Supreme Governor, in a regular, orderly ſtate. It muſt be confeſſed, it is true, that ſome ranks of <hi>rational</hi> beings have probably never acted below the dignity of their character, and conſequently that they know not, from what have ſeen among themſelves, what un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs means: But who can ſay, that the <hi>ſad effects</hi> of immoral conduct, in one ſyſtem of intelligent beings, may not, in the Divine adminiſtration, be ſo related to others, as to be uſeful to them alſo? What is there unreaſonable in ſuppoſing, that the evils ſuffered, by means of abuſed fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, in this world of our's, may, in ways,
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:018397_0239_0FA70BD908880560"/>
ſurpaſſing our comprehenſion, be capable of promoting, in a meaſure, the good of moral beings, in other parts of the creation? It is certain, in the <hi>ſyſtem of material nature,</hi> that other globes, and ſome of them vaſtly diſtant too, are uſeful to this earth, as <hi>that</hi> alſo in return may be, in ſome degree, uſeful to them: And it is by this mutual uſefulneſs, to each other, that they become one harmonious good whole. The like may be ſaid of the <hi>intellectual general ſyſtem</hi>;—It may be conſtituted the beſt whole, by the mutual ſubſerviency of the various ranks of <hi>rational</hi> beings to each other, and their jointly conſpiring, according to ſome ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled order, to advance the <hi>general good.</hi> And, among the ways, wherein the wiſdom of the infinitely benevolent firſt Cauſe may have made the ſeveral claſſes of intelligent agents capable of being thus uſeful, this we are conſidering may be one. The <hi>miſery,</hi> which the indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals of one order, of <hi>moral</hi> beings, may, by their diſorderly purſuits, bring upon themſelves, may be deſigned, in the divine plan, and adapted, to promote the <hi>good,</hi> not only of that <hi>particular</hi> order, but of <hi>other</hi> orders likewiſe, by exhibiting a moſt powerful <hi>motive</hi> to diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the like miſconduct, and ſecure an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to the law of reaſon and right.</p>
            <p>But, if any ſhould think this is carrying the matter too far, and upon conjecture only, it cannot however be denied, that the <hi>unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> accruing to ſome of the <hi>individuals</hi> of any
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:018397_0240_0FA70BD9BB0D85F0"/>
ſpecies of <hi>moral</hi> beings, in conſequence of their having choſen and acted perverſely, may be of <hi>ſervice</hi> to the <hi>reſt</hi> of the ſame ſpecies, by mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring to them ſeaſonable and proper warning. And it may, upon the whole, be a kindneſs to <hi>this order</hi> of beings, and an argument of the <hi>Deity's</hi> benevolence towards them, that he has thus connected <hi>vice</hi> and <hi>unhappineſs</hi> together. For it is one of the moſt powerful reſtraints from <hi>irregular action,</hi> and as ſtrong an induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the choice and practice of virtue. And ſo far as they are preſerved in due order, <hi>this,</hi> without all doubt, is one of the great means by which it is accompliſhed.</p>
            <p>And ſhould we purſue this reaſoning, and examine its force as applied to a <hi>future ſtate,</hi> and the <hi>puniſhments</hi> there is reaſon to think will be there inflicted on wicked men, we ſhall find it a ſufficient vindication of them. For if they are conſidered, as the preſent argument requires they ſhould be, under the notion of a <hi>needful moral mean</hi> intended and calculated to promote, upon the whole, <hi>more good</hi> in the <hi>intelligent</hi> creation, than might otherwiſe be reaſonably expected, they are ſo far from being the effect of <hi>ill-will,</hi> that they really ſpring from benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and are a proof of it. It carries the <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,</hi> I own, of hardſhip and ſeverity, for creatures to exiſt in <hi>ſuffering</hi> circumſtances: But if their ſufferings, whether in this or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtate, are the fruit of their own miſ-do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and it is for the <hi>real benefit</hi> of the <hi>moral
<pb n="243" facs="unknown:018397_0241_0FA70BDB3B0976E0"/>
creation,</hi> upon the whole, (as we have ſeen that it is) that <hi>ſuch ſufferings</hi> ſhould be the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent effect of ſuch conduct, why ſhould the goodneſs of the <hi>Deity</hi> be called in queſtion? It is true, the <hi>ſufferers</hi> in a <hi>future ſtate,</hi> if ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be paſt amendment, can reap no <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage themſelves</hi> from their ſufferings: But then, it is to be conſidered, theſe ſufferings were <hi>originally</hi> intended for <hi>their good,</hi> by being preſented, in the <hi>forebodings</hi> of their own minds, as a powerful <hi>motive,</hi> not only to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain them from thoſe courſes which would end in theſe ſufferings, but to urge them on to thoſe virtuous purſuits which would be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed with all the happineſs they were made capable of. And if, notwithſtanding ſo pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful a means uſed with them for their <hi>good,</hi> they have gone on debaſing their natures, till they have rendered them incurable by any of the means the wiſdom of God has ſeen fit to uſe with them, why ſhould it be thought a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor to infinite goodneſs to ſubject them to that <hi>miſery</hi> they have thus expoſed themſelves to by their own wickedneſs, that they might be a <hi>warning to others,</hi> and ſerve as <hi>public exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> for <hi>general good,</hi> ſo long as the wiſdom of God ſhall know it to be beſt: Is it not <hi>better</hi> that <hi>ſome individuals</hi> ſhould be in ſuffering circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances if they will not, by any of the methods of God's dealing with them, be brought back to the <hi>choice</hi> and <hi>practice</hi> of virtue; I ſay, is it not better, that <hi>ſome individuals</hi> ſhould be
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:018397_0242_0FA70BDE6AD996D8"/>
made miſerable, in conſequence of an eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed connection between <hi>vice</hi> and <hi>miſery,</hi> than that the <hi>virtue</hi> of the <hi>moral creation,</hi> together with all the happineſs dependant thereon, ſhould be endangered, through want of ſuch a proviſion for their ſecurity? The plain truth is, the benevolence of the <hi>Deity,</hi> is not confined to particular beings, or orders of beings, but is abſolutely <hi>univerſal</hi>; and ought therefore to be conceived of as exerting itſelf in thoſe ways which are beſt adapted to advance the <hi>general good</hi> of the creation. And if, by connecting <hi>miſery</hi> with <hi>moral irregularity,</hi> this end is, in the moſt effectual manner, promoted, as we have ſeen reaſon to think it is, the eſtabliſhment of ſuch a connection, notwithſtanding what may eventually happen to particular individuals, muſt be an argument of <hi>goodneſs,</hi> rather than of <hi>inconſiſtency</hi> with it.</p>
            <p>There is yet another way wherein it may be for the <hi>good</hi> of the <hi>intelligent</hi> creation, that wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs ſhould be connected, in the manner it is, with <hi>miſery.</hi> What I intend is, that by this connection <hi>occaſion</hi> is given for ſuch mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtations of the Divine glory, as are <hi>ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi> and powerfully ſuited to promote the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and <hi>conſequent</hi> happineſs, of <hi>moral</hi> beings; which manifeſtations there would have been no room for, or, at leaſt, not in ſo great a degree, had it not been for <hi>this connection.</hi> It is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently from hence, that moſt of the <hi>moral</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes of the <hi>Deity</hi> become capable of a <hi>more</hi>
               <pb n="245" facs="unknown:018397_0243_0FA70BDEF8CF1358"/>
illuſtrious diſplay, than would otherwiſe have been poſſible: And it may be, <hi>ſome</hi> of them <hi>could</hi> not have been manifeſted at all, had not this given the opportunity therefor. The <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs</hi> of the Divine Being would not have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared ſo conſpicuous, if <hi>moral</hi> agents might have behaved ill, and not found it to their diſadvantage: Neither would his <hi>juſtice</hi> have ſhone with ſuch a diſtinguiſhing luſtre; as he could not, ſo fully and impartially, have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to them according to their deſerts. And, as to the various modifications of goodneſs, ſuch as mercy, forbearance, patience, long-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, forgiveneſs, it does not appear, how theſe perfections of the <hi>Deity</hi> could have been at all diſplayed, had it not been for theſe evils that are the conſequent fruit of voluntary miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. The idea of pity, and mercy, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, as Divine attributes, exerciſed towards mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral agents, is eſſentially connected with their <hi>actual ſuffering,</hi> or, at leaſt, <hi>liableneſs</hi> to it, on account of their ill-doings: inſomuch, that, were it not for the unhappineſs we become ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to, upon being faulty in their beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior, they could have had no notion of theſe amiable, Divine glories. And it is from hence that thoſe marvellous diſplays of goodneſs, in theſe modes of exerciſe, have taken riſe, which tend, not only to the eternal honor of the <hi>Deity,</hi> but the beſt and greateſt good likewiſe of moral and intelligent beings. Nor is it difficult to conceive how the diſplay of theſe attributes of
<pb n="246" facs="unknown:018397_0244_0FA70BE3C84537D0"/>
the Supreme Creator ſhould operate to this end. For it is obvious, upon the ſlighteſt attention, that riches of forbearance, long-ſuffering and forgiveneſs, are naturally adapted to work pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully upon <hi>intelligent</hi> minds, if they have been faulty, to lead them to repentance, and bring them back to the practice of virtue, the only way to true happineſs. And, perhaps, ſo long as there are any remains of ingenuity, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more rationally ſuited to produce this effect. And where any, under the influence of theſe Divine diſplays, have been recovered to a virtuous diſpoſition, there are no motives better fitted to ſtrengthen and eſtabliſh it, than thoſe which may be ſelected from that pity and mercy, which the <hi>Deity</hi> has exerciſed towards them. Beſides, there will be the excitement of pious affections in their minds towards the <hi>Divine Being,</hi> accompanied with <hi>high pleaſure</hi>; which pleaſure they could never have perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but in this method of conduct. And, I may add, this ſame goodneſs of the <hi>Deity,</hi> appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his lenity, and patience, and mercy, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards guilty moral agents, is as naturally fitted to produce, in <hi>other</hi> intelligent beings, who are not the <hi>immediate</hi> objects of it, ſuch ſentiments and affections, attended with correſponding de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, which they could not otherwiſe have been the ſubjects of; whereby both the virtue and happineſs of the rational and moral creation is better provided for, than it could have been in a different ſtate of things.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="247" facs="unknown:018397_0245_0FA70BE4EF937950"/>It will not from hence follow, it is owned, that <hi>moral irregularity</hi> ought to have been permitted: Nor was the above reaſoning intended to juſtify ſuch a permiſſion; this having been before ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for upon other conſiderations. The only inquiry here in debate is, whether the <hi>connection</hi> of <hi>unhappineſs</hi> with this <hi>moral irregularity</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilable with goodneſs? And the argument we are upon, is, I think, ſufficient for the proof of the affirmation; as it has particularly point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out the way wherein the <hi>good</hi> of intelligent beings is better provided for by this expedient, than it could otherwiſe have been. For by means of the evils that accompany ill-doing, occaſion, we have ſeen, has been offered for ſuch a diſplay of the Divine moral perfections as is the greateſt encouragement to virtue, not only to the <hi>agents</hi> who may have acted wrong, but to <hi>others</hi> alſo; beſides that it lays a foundation for ſuch <hi>pleaſing perception</hi> as could not have been enjoyed in any other method.</p>
            <p>In fine, whereas it is complained, that <hi>wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs</hi> is made an occaſion of <hi>ſuffering,</hi> not only to the <hi>guilty</hi> agents themſelves, but to <hi>others</hi> likewiſe, in various ways, ſo as to render life very uncomfortable;—The anſwer is, that this unavoidably ariſes from the conſtitution of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, at leaſt, in reſpect of the <hi>human ſpecies.</hi> It is impoſſible, up<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſuppoſition of the exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of ſuch an order of beings as men are, but that they ſhould <hi>ſuffer</hi> more or leſs by the vices and follies of one another. According to the
<pb n="248" facs="unknown:018397_0246_0FA70BE50B1ED8F8"/>
               <hi>proverbs</hi> as old as <hi>Solomon, a fooliſh ſon is the heavineſs of his mother</hi>; and again a <hi>fooliſh ſon is a grief to his father.</hi> And the conſequences of oppreſſion, rapine and violence, whether public or private, muſt be felt and groaned under, in a world, where creatures are ſo nearly allied to, and dependant on, each other. Nay, the <hi>penal</hi> evils, which the <hi>Deity</hi> may, in kindneſs, inflict to ſtop the progreſs of wickedneſs, muſt, many times, touch the <hi>innocent</hi> as well as guilty, while they live mixed together, as in the preſent ſtate: Nor could it be otherwiſe without an inverſion of the courſe of nature. So that, if this objection proves any thing, it is that ſuch an order of beings ought not to have been crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. But we have already ſeen, that the <hi>Deity</hi> was not obliged to make only the moſt perfect beings; yea, that the communication of the <hi>greateſt good</hi> required the creation of all ranks of beings, in the deſcending line, ſo long as the enjoyment of exiſtence could be called an happineſs. Nor may ſuch creatures as we are, who have ſo narrow a view of the works of God, and the whole ſyſtem of the univerſe, take upon us to ſay, that an order of beings conſtituted as we are, could not, in conſiſtency with wiſdom and goodneſs, have a place in the creation; or that ſuch creatures, with all the evils to which they are ſubjected, would not make a beautiful, neceſſary part, in the Divine plan, contrived to form a ſcene wherein the perfections of the <hi>Deity</hi> might be moſt admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb n="249" facs="unknown:018397_0247_0FA70BE5EC9E35F0"/>
diſplayed in producing, upon the whole, the <hi>greateſt poſſible good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides, it ought to be conſidered, that <hi>theſe evils,</hi> which wicked men bring upon others by their vices, are ſuppoſed to bear hard upon the <hi>benevolence</hi> of the Creator and Governor of the univerſe, chiefly on the <hi>preſumption,</hi> that the <hi>preſent</hi> is an <hi>entire independent</hi> ſtate, not having relation to, or connection with, any <hi>future</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence: Upon which ſuppoſition, it is owned, the difficulty objected would be an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurmountable one. But will any pretend to <hi>demonſtrate,</hi> that there is no <hi>future</hi> ſtate, that death puts a total end to the being of man, and all further capacity of enjoyment? And if this cannot be <hi>demonſtrated,</hi> which muſt be confeſſed to be the truth of the matter, it is poſſible, that the evils which any ſuffer in <hi>this</hi> may be made up to them in <hi>another</hi> ſtate: Nay, it is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that theſe evils which they ſuffer may be intended as a <hi>means</hi> to prepare and qualify them for <hi>greater happineſs,</hi> in ſome future period of exiſtence, than they could otherwiſe have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed. And this leads to another remark of great importance in the preſent argument, which is,</p>
            <p>That the evils ſuffered by ſome, through the faulty conduct of others, are ſo over-ruled, in the all-wiſe, gracious government of the <hi>Deity,</hi> as to give occaſion for the exerciſe and improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſuch virtues as tend to promote their <hi>greater</hi> happineſs. Vice, it is true, has intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:018397_0248_0FA70BE971516590"/>
into the world a great many trials, griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to bear: But it is as true, that they are capable of being improved to advantage. And what though any ſhould ſuffer through the caprice, the pride, the hatred, the malice, and other ungoverned paſſions and luſts of wicked men, if they may hereby be gainers in the end? And this is made poſſible as the <hi>Deity</hi> has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted things. For theſe very diſtreſſes, which are cauſed by the prevalence of ſin and folly, are ſo many opportunities offered, in provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, for the exerciſe of meekneſs, patience, forgiveneſs, and the like virtues; which, being often, by this means, thrown out into action, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſettled <hi>moral diſpoſitions,</hi> not only forming a moſt beautiful character, but together with it a <hi>capacity</hi> for happineſs, which could not otherwiſe have been enjoyed. It is certain, that the exertment of the mind, in one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular way, is the method, according to the eſtabliſhed laws of nature, by which it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts a faculty in this way of exertion, and becomes poſſeſſed of what we call <hi>habits,</hi> in any kind. And it is as certain, that <hi>opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities</hi> offered, in the courſe of providence, for the frequent repetition of theſe exertments, are the <hi>occaſion</hi> by which the mind receives that correſponding <hi>bent,</hi> or <hi>turn,</hi> to which we give the name, <hi>habit</hi> or <hi>diſpoſition.</hi> From whence it follows, that the evils ſuffered through the fault of others, as they give opportunity for acts of meekneſs, and forbearance, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs,
<pb n="251" facs="unknown:018397_0249_0FA70BE98ED79750"/>
are properly adapted to form the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous diſpoſitions anſwering to theſe acts. And accordingly it is ſeen, in fact, that none among men are poſſeſſed of theſe excellent virtues, in ſo confirmed a degree, as thoſe who have taken occaſion, from the evils they have ſuffered, to be much in the exerciſe of acts of patience, contentment, and reſignation. They have, by this means, got formed in them, and greatly ſtrengthened, the diſpoſitions to theſe virtues. Nor is this all: But their <hi>capacity</hi> for moral rational happineſs is thereby proportionably enlarged. Theſe virtues, when called forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to exerciſe, are, at preſent, rewarded with <hi>pleaſure,</hi> and ſuch pleaſure as none know the value of but thoſe who have felt what it is, Beſides which, there is no reaſon to think but that, in ſome other and future ſtate, they ſhall further reap the fruit of their <hi>moral improvements,</hi> in anſwerable meaſures of rational ſatisfaction and delight. To be ſure, it cannot be prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that this may not; yea, that it will not, be the caſe. And upon this ſuppoſition, it is eaſy to conceive, how the evils which good men have ſuffered, through the wickedneſs of their fellow creatures, may finally turn out to their benefit. What ſpecial uſe there may be, in <hi>another</hi> ſtate, for thoſe diſpoſitions which have been formed in <hi>this,</hi> and particularly ſuited to trials from the perverſe behaviour of others, we know not: But thus much we may be ſure of, that virtuous habits, by what means ſoever they
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:018397_0250_0FA70BEA4942A2D0"/>
have been formed, improved, and ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, do enlarge the general capacity for ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al moral happineſs; inſomuch, that, if there is anothere is another ſtate, the ſubjects of them, on this account, muſt be the more happy in proportionable returns of true and ſolid plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
            <p>The ſum of the whole argument is this, that the <hi>connection of unhappineſs with moral irregula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> is a means wiſely adapted to operate pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully upon <hi>rational moral</hi> agents, to reduce them to a right conduct, if they have been faulty, and to preſerve them inviolable in their attachment to virtue, if they have been inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent: Inſomuch, that it may be owing to this <hi>connection,</hi> there is ſo much <hi>order</hi> and <hi>happineſs</hi> in the <hi>intelligent</hi> creation; of both which, had not this connection been conſtituted, there would undoubtedly have been much leſs than there now is, and has all along been. The conſequence wherefrom is, that this proviſion, fitted for the production of ſo much good, is ſo far from being <hi>inconſiſtent with benevolence,</hi> that it is a ſtrong indication of it. And whereas the <hi>ſufferings</hi> of the virtuous, by the wickedneſs of the vicious, are great and trying, theſe alſo, upon ſuppoſition of <hi>another</hi> ſtate (which cannot be proved to be an <hi>unreaſonable,</hi> much leſs an <hi>impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> one) may be, in the end, for their <hi>advantage</hi>; as they are capable of being improved ſo as that the fruit, upon the whole, ſhall be <hi>more</hi> happineſs, than if theſe ſufferings had not been
<pb n="253" facs="unknown:018397_0251_0FA70BEB50BFE720"/>
endured: And if they may poſſibly be a <hi>means</hi> to produce <hi>greater</hi> good, they cannot prove a deficiency in the benevolence of the <hi>Deity,</hi> but are rather an argument in proof that he is endowed with this attribute.</p>
            <p>I have now offered what I had to ſay in il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtration of the <hi>conſiſtency</hi> between <hi>infinite be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence,</hi> and <hi>moral irregularity,</hi> together with all its <hi>conſequent unhappineſs.</hi> And I ſee not, upon the review, but the reaſoning employed to this purpoſe is ſtrictly concluſive. <hi>God</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving created <hi>free agents,</hi> it appears, from what has been diſcourſed, that they are the proper and ſole cauſes of all the moral diſorder that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of, and not the <hi>Deity</hi>; who has done every thing that he <hi>could,</hi> in conſiſtency with reaſon and wiſdom, not only <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o prevent their abuſe of their faculties, but to promote their improvement of them ſo as to attain to the higheſt perfection and happineſs: And further, that the very <hi>evils,</hi> he has connected with their <hi>voluntary miſconduct,</hi> are kindly intended, and wiſely adapted, to bring about their <hi>beſt good,</hi> and will certainly do it, if it is not their own <hi>fault.</hi> So that, upon the whole, it cannot be conceived, what the <hi>Deity</hi> could have done more, in a wiſe and rational method of opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to have made <hi>intelligent moral</hi> beings, in all their <hi>various orders,</hi> as happy as their origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal capacities would allow of: Which is as much as can be expected, even from <hi>benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence</hi> that is <hi>infinite.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="254" facs="unknown:018397_0252_0FA70BEE215B69D8"/>It now remains to conſider the third and laſt objection to the infinite benevolence of the Deity. And this is taken from the <hi>natural</hi> evils, common to all perceiving beings, in this world of our's, in all their claſſes, from the higheſt to the loweſt; ſuch as pains, diſeaſes, and diſaſters, in various kinds, and degrees; and, at laſt, death, moſtly accompanied with diſtreſs, and ſometimes with aggravated cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of miſery and torment. And the complaint upon this head is, that theſe evils are not only permitted by the Deity, but were, in a ſenſe, appointed; as being the effect of that conſtitution of things, which he contrived, and eſtabliſhed, and has all along upheld: Nay, it is urged, with reſpect to ſome of theſe evils, as to their kind, if not degree, that the Deity intended they ſhould take place, and originally endowed the creatures with ſuch na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as that a liableneſs to them was abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary. And would an infinitely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent Being, ſay the movers of this objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, have brought creatures into exiſtence under ſuch circumſtances, ſubjected, by the very laws of their nature, to pain and miſery? Does this look like the doing of ſupremely perfect goodneſs? Can it be ſuppoſed, that ſuch a ſtate of things could have been, if ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally planned, and all along conducted by a Being eſſentially, and infinitely kind and good?</p>
            <p>I anſwer by acknowledging, that the percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving beings of all orders, in this lower world,
<pb n="255" facs="unknown:018397_0253_0FA70BEF08E2C7C0"/>
are liable to pain, and death; and that they were made thus liable by the God, who gave them exiſtence under ſuch circumſtances, as that theſe evils could not be avoided. Only, let it be remembered, and conſidered, before I come to a particular reſolution of this diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,</p>
            <p>That even theſe <hi>natural</hi> evils, ſo far as man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind are concerned in them, are all of them increaſed in their malignity, by means of that <hi>moral</hi> diſorder, which they have introduced into the world. And to this ſame cauſe, and not to the Author of our beings it is owing alſo, that the <hi>kinds</hi> of natural evils are become more numerous. Had it not been for the luſts of men, we ſhould never have heard of many tormenting diſeaſes, which multitudes now lie groaning under. And as to thoſe which were unavoidable, in conſequence of the eſtabliſhed laws of nature, they would have been comparatively few, and attended with only tolerable degrees of pain. An intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, luxurious, debauched courſe of living, through the prevalence of ungoverned appetite, and ſenſual inclination, in oppoſition to the dictates of reaſon, and the remonſtrances of conſcience, is that which has aggravated, as well as multiplied, the evils of the world. It is therefore very unfair to take occaſion, from the vexations and ſorrows of human life, in its preſent degenerate ſtate, to reflect diſhonor on the goodneſs of the Deity. The only juſt
<pb n="256" facs="unknown:018397_0254_0FA70BF1CF9D67F0"/>
way of forming an impartial judgment, in the caſe, is, to conſider theſe evils, not as multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied and aggravated, through men's pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their powers, and acting counter to the rules preſcribed for the government of them; but as it may reaſonably be ſuppoſed, they would have taken place, according to the courſe of nature, not hindered in its regular opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The miſeries that infect the human ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, in the former view, are the ſole fruit of their own folly, not an effect of God's produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, for which men themſelves, and not God, are anſwerable: Though I may add here, his goodneſs is ſuch, that he has done every thing fit and proper, that even theſe evils of men's own bringing upon themſelves may turn out, in the end, to their final good, as we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſeen. In the latter view only of the evils of life is diſcovered the proper effect of thoſe laws of nature, which the Deity has eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, and which we are, at preſent, called to conſider, in order to vindicate his ſupreme benevolence.</p>
            <p>And here it may be again proper, before I proceed to the particular evils complained of as inconſiſtences with the Divine goodneſs, to obſerve in <hi>general,</hi> that they are the effects of eſtabliſhed laws, the deſign and tendency of which are greatly beneficial. And though they may be, in ſome inſtances, more eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at certain times, the occaſion of evil, they are notwithſtanding eventually productive
<pb n="257" facs="unknown:018397_0255_0FA70BF28B514B08"/>
of a vaſt overbalance of good. The air we breath in may, in conſequence of the laws of nature, be ſometimes ſubjected to thoſe hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneous mixtures, which will, until it is purified, make it of ſuch an ill temperature, as to oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion hurt both to man and beaſt; but yet, life itſelf in all animals, without which there could be no enjoyment, is abſolutely depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant on it, and preſerved by means of it. Fire, conformably to the laws of nature, may unhappily be the occaſion of extenſively ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous deſolation; while yet, it is one of the moſt uſeful creatures of God. Storms and tempeſts, thunder and lightning, may ſometimes be the cauſes of no ſmall hurt, by deſtroying the lives, or ſubſtance, of numbers of individuals; bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> by clearing the air, and diſengaging it from thoſe noxious exhalations that were blended with it, it fits it for reſpiration, and in this way does good, beyond all compariſon for ſurpaſſing the evil it ever brings into event. The ſame may be ſaid of earthquakes, inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, famines, and peſtilences, they are the effects of laws, which are not only, in that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral tendency, good, but actually produce more and greater good, than they ever do evil In ſhort, the laws of nature are all of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial kind, and we feel that they are ſo, by the enjoyment of innumerable good things, which are the effects of their operation; and the evils they may, at any time, be the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="258" facs="unknown:018397_0256_0FA70BF375232640"/>
of, are not worthy of being mentioned, they are ſo much over-balanced with good.</p>
            <p>And it may be, upon the whole, beſt, in this world of our's, that general laws ſhould be ſo eſtabliſhed, as that evils ſhould ſometimes be occaſioned by them. The final cauſe of ſuch an eſtabliſhment might be the good, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly of mankind. A world, in which there is a mixture of evil with good, may be moſt ſuitable for ſuch creatures as we are. Were the laws of nature ſuch as to leave no room for thoſe occaſions of ſorrow, fear, and ſuffering, we are now ſubjected to, this earth might have been a place altogether unadapted for training us up for the enjoyment of God, the ſupreme good. It was, perhaps, highly expedient, if not abſolutely neceſſary, that we ſhould live in a world of <hi>diſcipline,</hi> a world that would, in the natural courſe of things, be the occaſion of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, inconveniences, and trials, by means of which we might be formed to a meetneſs for another world, in which we ſhould be totally freed from them. An uninterrupted ſtate of eaſe and pleaſure, would, morally ſpeaking, be the ruin of mankind. We need a mixture of evil with good to check our pride, to reſtrain our ſenſual appetites; to take off our affections from the things of the earth; and to excite in us a juſt ſenſe of our depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance on God. And we need alſo, every now and then, to be alarmed by this or that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, which ſhall ſpeak with a voice more
<pb n="259" facs="unknown:018397_0257_0FA70BF436796B58"/>
loud and awful, than is common and ordinary. The inhabitants of the world in general, and thoſe of this or the other place, in ſpecial, are ſometimes ſunk into a ſtate of ſuch careleſneſs and ſtupidity, have ſo little faith in God, and are ſo given up to commit all iniquity with greedineſs, that, humanly ſpeaking, there is no room left to expect their reformation and amendment, but by ſuch manifeſtations of the power, the greatneſs, and majeſty of God, as even force a faith in him, and a ſerious atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his character as the moral Governor of the world. The courſe of nature is, according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, wiſely and mercifully adapted to both theſe ends; giving occaſion, at all times, for <hi>diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plinary</hi> trials; and bringing on alſo, at certain intervals, ſuch tremendous events as are pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully ſuited to alarm their fears, and engage them to betake themſelves to a better courſe of conduct. And it is highly probable, the all-wiſe good God has ſo adjuſted the laws of nature, as that they ſhall operate, in all ages, and in all places, ſo as may beſt anſwer his benevolent deſigns in the moral government of his intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent creatures. What I mean is, he may have ſettled ſuch laws, with reſpect to natural cauſes, may have ſo proportioned their force, ſphere of action, degree and manner of opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as that, under his all-powerful and all-wiſe concurring influence, they ſhall conſpire together to produce thoſe effects, at ſuch times, and in ſuch places, which may be ſuited to
<pb n="260" facs="unknown:018397_0258_0FA70BF4F65F9610"/>
their moral ſtate, and ſerve for warning, or correction, or ruin, as he ſhould judge moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient. It is from theſe laws of nature, that tempeſts, famines, peſtilences, earthquakes, and the like evils, take their riſe. And they may reaſonably be viewed as the <hi>great inſtruments</hi> of providence. It is by theſe, at leaſt in part, that God keeps this degenerate world within reſtraint. Were it not for the diſplays he makes, at proper times, and in proper places, of his being, perfections, and governing providence, in theſe ways of terror, mankind might, at length, forget there was a God, or live as though there was none.</p>
            <p>But it will, perhaps, be ſaid here, why ſhould beings be made ſo imperfect as to need a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of things, in conſequence of which there would unavoidably be theſe <hi>evils</hi>? Could not the Deity have make mankind, in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, more perfect, and placed them in a world, in which, conformably to eſtabliſhed laws, they might have enjoyed good without any mixture of evil? And if he could, would he not have done it, if infinitely benevolent? Theſe queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and all other of a ſimilar kind, are only ſo many vague, unſupported ſuggeſtions, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting, that a world, ſo conſtituted as our's is, could not, upon the ſuppoſition of infinite bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence, have been brought into exiſtence. But this is ſo far from being a truth, that, had not the Deity created ſuch a world as this in which we live, he would not have manifeſted ſo
<pb n="261" facs="unknown:018397_0259_0FA70BF5CACDEE20"/>
much benevolence, as he might have done, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually has done. It has been already ſaid, and large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proved, that there may be the communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of more good by the creation of a diverſity of beings, variouſly capable of happineſs, from the greateſt conceivable height, quite down to the loweſt. It is therefore no objection againſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite benevolence, that all beings are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like perfect, but rather a proof of it; becauſe the leſs perfect, in all their gradations, ſo long as they are at all capable of enjoyment, inſtead of diminiſhing, increaſe the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>m total of good. Why then ſhould they be excluded the creation? Why ſhould not our world, imperfect as it is in compariſon with other worlds, have been brought into exiſtence, with all its inhabitants, animal and rational, however low ſome of them may be in their capacities for the perception of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? They are all, according to their ſeveral ranks, capable of pleaſure, and actually enjoy it, and an over-balance of it, notwithſtanding all the evils they are liable to. If therefore they had not been made, nor the world in which they live, becauſe ſo conſtituted as ſometimes to be the occaſion of evil, the place they now ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in the creation would have a vaſt void. And what a mighty chaſm in nature would this have been the means of? How much leſſened muſt have been that good, which might have been communicated? None of that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs would have been poſſible, which is now enjoyed, has been, and may hereafter be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed,
<pb n="262" facs="unknown:018397_0260_0FA70BF68FD33948"/>
by innumerable beings which have exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and may in future time exiſt, on this earth. And is it not more for the honor of the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent Deity, that this happineſs ſhould have been communicated, than that he ſhould have withheld it? In a diverſified creation, there muſt be a diverſity in the diſplays of goodneſs, ſhould they proceed even from an infinitely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent being. If the diſplays of goodneſs, therefore, in the conſtitution of our world, and the innumerably various creatures in it, are <hi>leſs</hi> than in the conſtitution of other worlds, and the creatures in them, it is no other than might reaſonably be looked for. There is, beyond all controverſy, more benevolence diſcovered in making ſuch a world as our's, than if the place it occupies in the creation had been a blank? And what is more, for aught any man living can prove to the contrary, or pretend without arrogance to prove, it may be a fit link in that chain of exiſtence, which God may have intended for as full a manifeſtation of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence, as, in his infinite wiſdom, he has judged proper.—But, inſtead of enlarging any further here, I ſhall rather proceed</p>
            <p>To a more direct anſwer to the objection againſt the infinite benevolence of the Deity, as fetched from thoſe <hi>natural</hi> evils, which all the percipient beings in our world, and mankind in ſpecial, are, from their very make, and the laws of nature, ſubjected to. And here I ſhall be <hi>particular</hi> in enumerating the principal of
<pb n="263" facs="unknown:018397_0261_0FA70BF7161624F0"/>
theſe evils, and endeavor to account for them, in conſiſtency with goodneſs, ſhould it be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be infinite, but guided, at the ſame time, by unerring wiſdom.</p>
            <p>The firſt evil complained of is <hi>pain.</hi> This indeed is nearly connected with moſt of the other evils, and conſtitutes ſo great a part of them, that it might be conſidered in general, and the anſwer to it, if juſt, eſteemed a full reply to them all. But I chuſe rather to ſpeak to it diſtinctly, and particularly, as one of the evils objected to. It is ſuppoſed in the objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that it is in itſelf an evil, and ſuch an one as there was no occaſion for, and could not have had exiſtence from an infinitely bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent Being. But this may be a great miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take. Pain, in a relative view, and as intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into ſuch a world as our's, may loſe its nature as an abſolute evil, and be rather wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of being called a real good.</p>
            <p>Some have endeavoured to account for pain, ſo as to make it conſiſt with goodneſs, by ſaying, that it gives a quicker and ſtronger reliſh for pleaſure; and that pleaſure could not have been felt, at leaſt in many caſes, and with ſo high a guſt, had it not been for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding experience of the thing meant by the ſenſation of pain. But it is evident, beyond all reaſonable diſpute, that there may be the perception of pleaſure without any previous perception of pain; becauſe this is the real truth with reſpect to him, who is God over all
<pb n="264" facs="unknown:018397_0262_0FA70BF92EDF4C50"/>
bleſſed forever more. It will not be pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the perfectly and infinitely happy Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ever knew what pain was, from any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience he ever had, or could have, of it within himſelf. And it is poſſible, I might rather ſay highly probable, that there are crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted beings of a ſuperior order to the nobleſt in our world, who never felt pain; having never had occaſion, or reaſon for ſuch percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Others, in vindication of the Divine bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence, have ſuppoſed, that the conſtitution, particularly, of man, is ſo exquiſitely nice, that a touch upon his nervous ſyſtem will oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion pleaſure, or pain, according to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree and manner in which it is done; and that the bodily mechaniſm is ſuch, that it could not have been otherwiſe. But this, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, is going too far beyond the ken of human underſtanding. We know not, nor is it poſſible we ſhould know, the height, or depth, of that contriving ſkill which is a glory peculiar to the Infinite Mind.</p>
            <p>The true and proper anſwer to the objected difficulty we are conſidering is this, that all the perceiving beings in our world, whether rational or irrational, of an higher or lower or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, were ſubjected to the ſenſation of pain, not for its own ſake, but in wiſdom and kindneſs, that it might be an excitement to their care in providing for the ſupport and comfort of life, and that it might alſo keep them upon their
<pb n="265" facs="unknown:018397_0263_0FA70BF9476860A8"/>
guard againſt whatever might be hurtful to them. We men, though the firſt order of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings on this earth, are, comparatively ſpeaking, but low creatures, perhaps the loweſt among all the moral exiſtences in the creation of God; and as we are ſuch imperfect creatures, and live in a world wherein we are ſurrounded with dangers, and liable to innumerable diſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and attacks upon our health and life, <hi>pain</hi> appears to be a wiſe and benevolent proviſion of the God of nature for our holding exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with any tolerable degree of ſafety. This has been already illuſtrated, Part II. to which I ſhall only add, the ſphere of our underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is ſo limited, and ſuch the danger of our being expoſed, in thouſands of caſes, to the loſs of health, limbs, and life itſelf, that our greateſt ſecurity is this ſenſation of pain. It ſupplies the deficiencies in our make, and aſſiſts our fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble powers, by being a conſtant, alarming mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitor, calling upon us in time to provide for our well-being, and to guard ourſelves againſt wounds, bruiſes, diſtempers, and whatever might be diſadvantageous, or deſtructive to us.</p>
            <p>It may be ſaid here, what need of ſo trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome a ſenſation as this of pain to guard us againſt dangers, and diſorders? Might not this have been done in a more eaſy way, and yet as effectual an one? And if it might, how comes it to paſs that it was not? Would not an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely benevolent Being have been thus kind to his creatures?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="266" facs="unknown:018397_0264_0FA70BFA1197DC48"/>The anſwer is obvious. The making ſuch an order of imperfect beings as we are, has been already accounted for, and ſhewn to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with infinitely wiſe benevolence. This being ſo, a more kind expedient could not have been contrived, forſuch creatures as we are, ſo far as we are able to judge, than the ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of pain, for our ſecurity from danger, and hurt, and to promote our real welfare. Moſt certainly, no one is able to point out a better, or to make it evident there could have been a better. Was it not for this expedient, mankind, notwithſtanding the utmoſt efforts of their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, wiſdom, and foreſight, would, in innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable inſtances, run into danger, and expoſe themſelves to thouſands of difficulties, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences, they are, by this contrivance of the Divine ſkill and goodneſs, in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure freed from. It is indeed ſo uſeful, I might more juſtly ſay ſo neceſſary, an ingredient in the human conſtitution, that it would be ſcarce poſſible life ſhould be preſerved without it. To be ſure, it could not with that comfort and ſafety it may now be.</p>
            <p>Beſides all which, it ought to be conſidered, that we men are moral, and not meerly animal, beings; and it might be in the view of our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent Creator, by means of this ſenſation of pain, he has made us capable of, to reſtain us from luxury, intemperance, lewdneſs, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery, an indulgence to which would be hurtful to our ſouls as well as bodies, debaſing
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:018397_0265_0FA70BFAD44F7298"/>
our nature, and bringing us down to a level with the very brutes; than which nothing would be more diſhonorary to the God who made us, or greater reproach to ourſelves as moral and intelligent agents. By this expedient alſo, ſo uſeful in ſo many other reſpects, occaſion is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, eſpecially in certain caſes, and at certain times, for the formation and improvement of the virtues, patience, meekneſs, contentment, and reſignation to the all-wiſe, righteous, and holy Governor of the world, which may be greatly ſerviceable to us here, and abundantly more ſo in ſome future ſtate of exiſtence.— To go on to other evils complained of.</p>
            <p>Such are hunger and thirſt, toil and labor, to all which we are ſubjected. But theſe, if conſidered as they ought to be, are ſo far from being deſigned evils, that they were purpoſely contrived for good, tend to good, nor could ſuch imperfect creatures as we are have poſſeſſed exiſtence ſo well without, as with them.</p>
            <p>The way in which the wiſdom of God has thought fit to manifeſt his goodneſs in preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the lives he has beſtowed on us, is by the uſe of <hi>food.</hi> Our bodies are ſo conſtituted as that, even, their ſolids are daily upon the waſte, and their fluids in a perpetual flux; inſomuch that new acceſſions of matter are neceſſary to ſupply what falls off, and wears away. Death muſt otherwiſe ſoon, and unavoidably, be the affect. Now this ſupply is made by eating and drinking; and to this we are urged, partly by
<pb n="268" facs="unknown:018397_0266_0FA70BFBF9B63F08"/>
the ſatisfaction we naturally take in what we eat and drink, but principally by that hunger and thirſt, which, though, ſometimes heighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a degree that may be greatly troubleſome, are yet neceſſary, and bring far more pleaſure, than pain along with them. Was it not for the implantation of this expedient in our nature, we ſhould be in danger of dying before our time, through negligence in providing, or throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in, the recruits that are continually neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the ſupport of our bodily ſyſtem. Hunger and thirſt are what nature has made, and intended to give us warning of this danger, and to puſh us on to a due care, to prevent, in time, thoſe inconveniences that would befall our bodies, if not ſupplied with food and drink to ſtrengthen and uphold them.</p>
            <p>But it will be ſaid, what need of labor in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to procure the things needful for the body? Could not the earth, without the toil of man, have yielded a ſufficiency for his bodily ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port? And would not this have been the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of nature, if an infinitely benevolent Cauſe had been at its head, as its Supreme Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector? I anſwer, Had the conſtitution of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture been thus altered, there muſt have been an analogous alteration in the make of man; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe greater inconveniences would have taken place, than thoſe that are now complained of, that is, the Deity would not have manifeſted ſo much benevolence, as he has now done. Had the earth been ſo made as that it ſhould ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneouſly
<pb n="269" facs="unknown:018397_0267_0FA70BFC5EAA24B8"/>
have yielded its produce, and man's labour by this means, have been rendered needleſs, what would have been the conſequence but indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in activity? And what the conſequence of that, but the loſs of health, the want vigor and ſpirit, and a general tediouſneſs accompanying life? And what is more, the bringing on death much ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and with more diſtreſſing anxiety and pain, than would otherwiſe have been the caſe. Inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and no exerciſe, naturally and powerfully tend to relax the ſolid parts of the body, to wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the circulation of the fluids, and ſo to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order the ſecretions intended for the ſmaller veſſels, as that, inſtead of affording them a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſupply, they would fill them with obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which, if not removed, would effect a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of the bodily machine, either ſuddenly, or in a more ſlow and lingering way. With reſpect, therefore, to beings conſtituted as we are, labor is highly expedient; and it is a proof of benevolence, rather than an objection againſt it, that we are ſubjected to it. Mr. Addiſon has ſet this in a beautiful, as well as clear and ſtrong point of light. His words, which none will think unworthy of tranſcribing, are theſe.—"I conſider the body as a ſyſtem of tubes and glands, or to uſe a more ruſtick phraſe, a bundle of pipes and ſtrainers, fitted to one another, after ſo wonderful a manner, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> as to make a proper engine to work with. This deſcription does not only comprehend the bowels, bones, tendons, veins, nerves, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries,
<pb n="270" facs="unknown:018397_0268_0FA70BFD1E5D0688"/>
but every muſcle, and every ligature, which is a compoſition of fibres that are ſo many imperceptible tubes or pipes, interwoven on all ſides with inviſible glands or ſtrainers. This general idea of a human body, without conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering it in the niceties of anatomy, lets us ſee how abſolutely neceſſary labor is for the right preſervation of it. There muſt be fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent motions and agitations to mix, digeſt, and ſeparate the jucies contained in it, as well as to clear and cleanſe that infinitude of pipes and ſtrainers of which it is compoſed, and to give their ſolid parts a more firm and laſting tone. Labor, or excerciſe ferments the humors, caſts them into their proper channels, throws off redundances, and helps nature in thoſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret diſtributions, without which the body can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſubſiſt in its vigor, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the ſoul act with chearfulneſs. I might here mention the effect which this has upon all the faculties of the mind, by keeping the underſtanding clear, the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination untroubled, and refining thoſe ſpirit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> that are neceſſary for the proper exertion of our intellectual faculties, during the preſent laws of union between ſoul and body. It is to a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect in this particular that we muſt aſcribe the ſpleen, which is ſo frequent in men of ſtudious and ſedentary tempers, as well as the vapors to which thoſe of the other ſex are ſo often ſubject. Had not exerciſe been abſolutely neceſſary for our well-being, nature would not have made the body ſo proper for it, by giving ſuch an
<pb n="271" facs="unknown:018397_0269_0FA70BFDB49A0C98"/>
activity to the limbs, and ſuch a pliancy to every part as neceſſarily produces thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, extenſions, contortions, dilatations, and all other kinds of motions that are neceſſary for the preſervation of ſuch a ſyſtem of tubes and glands as has been before mentioned. And that we might not want inducements to engage us in ſuch an exerciſe of the body as is proper for its welfare; it is ſo ordered that nothing valuable can be procured without it. Not to mention riches and honor, even food and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are not to be come at without the toil of the hands, and ſweat of the brows. Providence fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes materials, but expects that we ſhould work them up ourſelves. The earth muſt be labored before it gives its increaſe, and when it is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced into its ſeveral products, how many hand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> muſt they paſs through before they are fit for uſe? Manufactures, trade, and agriculture, naturally employ more than nineteen parts of the ſpecies in twenty; and as for thoſe who are not obliged to labor, by the condition in which they are born, they are more miſerable than the reſt of mankind, unleſs they indulge themſelves in that voluntary labor, which goes by the name of exerciſe."—I ſhall add here, if it was fit ſuch an order of creatures as we men ſhould have had a place in a ſcale of beings indefinitely diverſe from each other, which no one, without high arrogance, will pretend to ſay, no reaſonable complaint can be made on account of that labor we are called to. It
<pb n="272" facs="unknown:018397_0270_0FA70BFE7574C8B0"/>
was indeed, for a ſpecies of beings conſtituted as we are, nearly and neceſſarily connected with the welfare both of our ſouls and bodies. If we may pay any regard to the ſacred books of revelations, Adam, even in paradiſe was obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to labor; for he was put into the "gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of Eden to <hi>dreſs it.</hi>" The exerciſe he was called to might be different, in kind and degree, from that which falls to our ſhare, as it is our lot to live on the earth ſince it was doomed to "bring forth thorns and thiſtles," that it might be an occaſion of that toil and "ſweat of face," without which we cannot earn the bread we eat. And, as the moral ſtate of the world has been, from the time of the lapſe of the firſt of our race, it may be beſt it ſhould be thus, more conducive to the honor of God, and our own good, than otherwiſe it would have been.</p>
            <p>It may properly be ſubjoined ſtill further, had it not been for the contrivance of <hi>labor,</hi> this earth would have been a rude wilderneſs: Nor ſhould we have ſeen thoſe curious produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of art, which are ſo beautiful, and, at the ſame time beneficial, and delightſome. How could we, without labor, have had houſes accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated to the convenience and comfort of life, and other ſtructures both ornamental and ſerviceable? The world indeed is filled with a variety of works, innumerable in their kinds, adapted to gratify the ſenſes, and anſwer ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny valuable purpoſes, which could not have
<pb n="273" facs="unknown:018397_0271_0FA70C002B0E1070"/>
been brought into effect without labor of body or mind, or both. And in vain, comparative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpeaking, were we formed with hands, and eyes, and various mechanical turns, had not the Creator intended we ſhould labor: Nor would he have intended this, if a variety of wiſe and benevolent ends might not have been anſwered hereby; ſome of which we have pointed out, and might eaſily have mentioned many more.</p>
            <p>There are yet other evils complained of; among which are bodily diſorders in innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable kinds, eſpecially thoſe in conſequence of which ſome are idiots, and others diſtracted, and by this means not only objects of pity, but the occaſion of no ſmall trouble to their rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ſometimes to the communities in which they live as individuals.</p>
            <p>The exiſtence of theſe evils, in our world, in its preſent ſtate, is not denied. But it may be juſtly queſtioned, whether they would have been either ſo multiplied, or heightened in their malignity, had it not been for the prevalence of folly and vice, which is chargeable on us as its author, and not on God. Such indeed is our conſtitution, and ſuch the eſtabliſhed laws of nature, that, aſide from the wrong con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of mankind, there might have been ſome of theſe evils; but, without all doubt, they would have been far leſs in number, and far lighter in degree, in compariſon with what they now are. But be this as it may; as they are the effects of eſtabliſhed natural laws, intended
<pb n="274" facs="unknown:018397_0272_0FA70C00C2AE6AA8"/>
for good, and productive of it in innumerable inſtances, they ought not to be complained of; eſpecially, if it be remembered, that pre-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed general laws, for ſuch a world as our's, are preferable to immediate, unrelated exertions of the Divine agency; and inconveniences may have been leſſened, rather than increaſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. Were there no general laws; but every thing was effected by immediate, unrelated acts of Divine power, the bad conſequences ariſing herefrom would be at once obvious. "There would be no arts and ſciences, no ſkill or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry; no regular methods of providing for our bodies, or improving our minds in the knowledge of things; all which evidently pre-ſuppoſe, and are entirely founded on ſome ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled, certain laws of the univerſe diſcoverable by us." The reader, if he pleaſes, may turn to Part II, where he will find this point large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſidered.</p>
            <p>It may be further ſaid here, as mankind are brought into exiſtence, not by immediate exertions of Divine power, but in conſequence of the general law of propagation, they are, in virtue of this law, ſubjected to evils, which would not have been prevented, but by an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary interpoſition of heaven, which, if com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, might be followed with more inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences, for aught we can ſay to the contrary, than it would guard againſt. By a variety of ways, and means, this law of nature may be ſo obſtructed in its operation, or ſuch a turn given
<pb n="275" facs="unknown:018397_0273_0FA70C0175019C50"/>
to it, as that children may come into the world with a bodily machine, unfitted for the ſoul to work by; in conſequence of which ſome might be idiots, and ſome naturally turn wild. Theſe caſes, indeed, are comparatively rare. It is more common for children to derive from predeceſſors, and as the effect of their vices too<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> bodily conſtitutions ſubjecting them to infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and diſeaſes, various in kind, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times greatly afflictive in degree. And, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, moſt of the diſorders mankind groan un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, eſpecially as to the malignant degree of them, are owing to this cauſe. But theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences notwithſtanding, it is better, beyond all compariſon better, this law ſhould have been eſtabliſhed, than otherwiſe. For it is by ſucceſſion, and not a continued exiſtence of the ſame individuals, that the human ſpecies is preſerved in being. And as this is not done by a conſtantly created ſupply of individuals, how could it have been better effected, than by this law of propagation? Eſpecially, if it be conſidered, that it has made way for the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of riches of wiſdom, as well as good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in the formation of different ſexes, in the adjuſtment of a different bodily organization, and the contrivance of natural propenſions, all which are admirably fitted to bring into event the intention of this law. And it is ſo cloſely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with other laws, good in themſelves, and productive of good; ſuch as the law of love, particularly, between the ſexes, which
<pb n="276" facs="unknown:018397_0274_0FA70C044566D7D0"/>
gives occaſion for many reciprocal ſervices greatly beneficial, of which we could otherwiſe have had no idea; and the law of growth from infancy and childhood, to a ſtate of maturity with reſpect to both mind and body, which makes way for thouſands of kind offices in parents to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards children, as alſo for the trial and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of many important virtues: Such, I ſay, is the connection between the law of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation, and other laws of nature, that the preſent ſyſtem muſt, in many reſpects, have been altered, if this had not been eſtabliſhed; that is, in other words, this world muſt have been another world, and not the world it now is: While yet, ſuch a world as this is muſt have been brought into exiſtence, or the Divine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence would not have been ſo amply ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted, as, by this means, it might be, and really has been.</p>
            <p>There are two other evils ſtill particularly complained of; the ſhortneſs of life, and the unavoidable neceſſity of death.</p>
            <p>As to the firſt, the brevity of life; it might be enough to ſay, in general, it was ordered by unerring wiſdom, and, at the ſame time, argues benevolence; as life, ſhort as it is, is much preferable to non-exiſtence.—But we ſhall be more particular in conſidering this complaint.</p>
            <p>It is readily allowed, the general limitation of life, with reſpect either to the human ſpecies, or any of the claſſes of inferior creatures, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be accounted for upon philoſophical prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples;
<pb n="277" facs="unknown:018397_0275_0FA70C079A788CE0"/>
but muſt finally be reſolved by repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the all-wiſe pleaſure of Him, who is infinite in underſtanding, as well as goodneſs. All the ſpecies of percipient beings, in our world, are ſubjected to the ſame general laws of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and yet, the time of the duration of their exiſtence is, notwithſtanding, greatly various. Some of the brutal kind are confined within the period of twenty or thirty years; others ſeldom reach beyond fifteen or twenty; others ſtill are quite old at about ten or twelve. The like difference there is between the continuance of being in the animals of more inferior claſſes. A ſingle year completes the time of exiſtence as to ſome of them; a few months as to others; and life may be much ſhorter, with reſpect to many of thoſe ſpecies which are viſible to us, only by the help of glaſſes. This variety in the duration of life is, no doubt, effected by the operation of general laws, but then it muſt be by the operation of thoſe laws, conformably to a <hi>peculiar difference of conſtitution</hi> in theſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſpecies of creatures; and this, as alotted to them by God, and not to be accounted for, but by recurring to his all-wiſe good pleaſure.</p>
            <p>This is eminently true, with reſpect to man. Notwithſtanding the general laws of nature, and their tendency to bring on a diſſolution of our bodily ſtructure, no good philoſophical reaſon can be given, why this diſſolution ſhould be effected within ſuch a general, limited time. If we may give credit to the Moſaic hiſtory,
<pb n="278" facs="unknown:018397_0276_0FA70C091D0E27F8"/>
the Anti-Deluvian patriarchs lived, ſome of them at leaſt, till they were ſix, ſeven, eight, nine hundred years old: and it is particularly remarked of Methuſelah, that "his days were nine hundred and ſixty nine years:" Whereas, the life of man, from the time of the flood, has been confined within much narrower limits. About "ſeventy years," according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of king David, was the general period of life in his days; and ſo it has been ever ſince.</p>
            <p>Some have attempted to aſſign the philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical reaſon of this difference in the period of human life. And, in order hereto, they have recurred to the natural firmneſs and vigor of the human conſtitution, which, at firſt, was propagated without thoſe contracted weakneſſes and decays, which have been gradually increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ever ſince, and deſcending from parents to children. And, together with the original ſtrength of the human ſtructure, they have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken into conſideration the peculiar aptitude of the productions of nature to afford nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; which, they ſuppoſe, were in their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt perfection at firſt, but have been conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually upon the decline. And, adding to theſe reaſons, the <hi>kind of food,</hi> the firſt generations of men lived upon, which, they imagine, was not <hi>fleſh,</hi> but <hi>the fruit of the earth</hi>; they think it not ſtrange, that their lives ſhould be protracted to a period ſo much longer, than the common term of life at preſent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="279" facs="unknown:018397_0277_0FA70C09C4050998"/>But however plauſible this account may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to any, it is far from being ſatisfactory; and inſuperable objections might eaſily be made to it, if it would not occaſion too great, and, what ſome may think, a needleſs degreſſion. The truth is; after all that has been ſaid by learned men to ſolve this difficulty, it ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains a myſtery in reaſon and philoſophy. Nor can any thing be offered, with reference to its ſolution, that may more reaſonably be acquieſc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in than this, So it pleaſed the ſovereign good God; who, as he is the Creator of man, and of all the orders of inferior beings in our world, may aſſign to him, and to them, what time of exiſtence he ſhall judge fit. And the periods of life, however various in the various orders of creatures, were doubtleſs ordered in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as well as wiſdom. There is evidently an analogy between this diverſity, and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity that takes place in the ſeveral claſſes of beings; and it might be as fit there ſhould be both theſe diverſities, as either of them, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to a wiſe and benevolent conſtitution of the links in the chain of exiſtence. Nor may any one, unleſs endowed with a larger ſhare of underſtanding than belongs to the order of men, preſume, without vanity, to aſſert, much leſs to prove, that it was not better things ſhould have been thus, than otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>There are, moſt certainly, good reaſons, with reſpect to us men, why our years ſhould not be lengthened beyond the general period
<pb n="280" facs="unknown:018397_0278_0FA70C0A9369B230"/>
of ſeventy or eighty. Our preſent life, as we are intelligent moral beings, ought, in agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with philoſophy as well as divinity, to be looked upon, not as intended for the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the greateſt happineſs, we are made capable of, but rather as a probation-ſeaſon that will finally iſſue in it, in conſequence of an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired meetneſs for it. This is the light, in which it is reaſonable we ſhould view our life here on earth; and if the period, aſſigned for its continuance, is a duration ſufficiently long for the attainment of that perfection and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, which is the grand deſign of God, it is, in true reaſon long enough: Nor would it be deſirable it ſhould be protracted to a greater length. In ſhort, our exiſtence, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in it, in this world, were deſigned by our all-wiſe benevolent Creator for a quite dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent purpoſe from what we are too commonly apt to imagine. He intended both, not ſo much for the enjoyment of our higheſt happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs here, as to prepare us for it in a better ſtate. This is the true and proper idea of life. And the limitation of its continuance is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably well adjuſted to this notion of it: Thoſe who are formed to a preparedneſs, by a wiſe and right improvement of their time, and talents, for an admiſſion to the joys of God's preſence, will not complain of the ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of life. And as to others, who chiefly employ themſelves to the purpoſes of this, and not the coming world; who make no provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="281" facs="unknown:018397_0279_0FA70C0B61FD7638"/>
for another ſtate, but walk in the way of their hearts, and in the ſight of their eyes, fulfilling the deſires of the fleſh and mind, the period of life is full long enough for their continuance here: Nor would it anſwer any valuable end, if it were of a ſtill greater length. In all probability, they would grow more bold and daring in iniquity, more hardened in vice, and more ripe for inhanced degrees of the Divine vengeance. Beſides, the preſent term of life is, one would think, a ſpace full long enough for ſuch perſons to be continued nuſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to the world. And it is really a kindneſs to mankind in general, that they are limited, by the law of their nature, to threeſcore or fourſcore years.</p>
            <p>The other evil, I mentioned as complained of, and the laſt I ſhall mention, is the unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able neceſſity of death. And this is common to all the percipient beings in our world, from the higheſt to the loweſt claſs of them. And their ſubjection to death, in conſequence of the operation of the laws of nature, is a wiſer and better contrivance for the production of good, and a ſtronger proof of the benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the Deity, than an eſtabliſhment the reverſe of this.</p>
            <p>As to the creatures inferior to man, in all their degrees of ſubordination, it is obvious, upon the ſlighteſt attention, that more benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence may be manifeſted by their ſucceeding one another in life, than by their continuance
<pb n="282" facs="unknown:018397_0280_0FA70C0C5A6B2B18"/>
in being without death. In the former of theſe ways of communicating life, there may be inconceivably more of it, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more enjoyment of good, ſo far as life is at all a baſis for ſuch enjoyment, than in the latter. There can be no reaſonable room for doubt as to this. Should as many ſpecies of percipient beings, and as many individuals in each of theſe ſpecies, be brought into exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as this world of our's could contain, without unavoidable inconvenience; if there was no death to make way for a ſucceſſion in life, there would be but a very ſmall pittance of life, in compariſon with what there might be, conformably to the method in which hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven has contrived to communicate it. Upon the ſuppoſition of no death, in the caſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, there could be no multiplication of life. It would always continue preciſely the ſame with reſpect to the numbers that enjoyed it: Whereas, upon the preſent plan, there may be the continuance of every ſpecies, with a like number of individuals, in thouſands of ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. And ſhould a calculation be made of life multiplied in this way, it would amount to a ſum inconceivably greater, than it could otherwiſe have been. Millions of animals, in every claſs, are capable, in this way, of being brought into life, and made percipients of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment, which muſt have remained in non-en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, had it not been for this contrivance of death, and its being made an eſtabliſhment of
<pb n="283" facs="unknown:018397_0281_0FA70C0D12E0A440"/>
nature. In ſhort, by means of the preſent ſcheme of God, there has been, and may yet be, as much more life, and enjoyment, among the inferior ranks of animals, than there would have been, without the introduction of death, as there already have been, and may ſtill be, ſucceſſions in their life; for, in every ſucceſſion, there may be as much life, and enjoyment, as in the firſt claſs that had exiſtence.</p>
            <p>It ought to be conſidered yet further here, that, had it not been for death, the law of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation ſtill continuing in force, there would not have been, long before the preſent day, room in our world for a millionth part of the animals that might be brought into exiſtence; yea, the increaſe of a very few of the claſſes of theſe animals would have ſo filled the earth, that the reſt muſt have been ſhut out.</p>
            <p>And what has been thus ſaid of the inferior animals is equally true, ſhould it be applied to us men. Was it not for death, there muſt have been, beyond conception, leſs life, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently enjoyment, than there has been, and ſtill may be, upon the preſent plan of nature. If we take into conſideration only thoſe of our race, who, in ſucceſſive generations, have had exiſtence, there would not have been room on this earth for a thouſandth part of them, at one and the ſame time; much leſs would there have been a poſſibility of this, if all that have died, before their arrival to a capacity of increaſing their kind, ſhould be taken into the number
<pb n="284" facs="unknown:018397_0282_0FA70C0D8D210DB0"/>
and they had all gone on multiplying to this day, conformably to the law of propagation. Perhaps, an hundred worlds, as large as this, would not have been ſufficiently extenſive for their exiſtence, and comfortable ſupport, in the way they are now provided for. Inſtead there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of objecting againſt the benevolence of the Deity for the introduction of death into the world, we have reaſon rather to admire and adore that wiſdom of his, which has contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and eſtabliſhed this effectual way for the fuller illuſtration of that infinite goodneſs, which is ſo amiable an attribute of his nature.</p>
            <p>Some, that they might keep at the utmoſt diſtance from reflecting diſhonor on the Divine benevolence, on account of the law of death, have ſuppoſed it was in itſelf a matter of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, and could not have been otherwiſe; as the bodies of all animals, from the loweſt to the higheſt claſs of them, being compounded of heterogeneous parts, are naturally corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and muſt unavoidably, in time, undergo that diſſolution, which is the thing meant, by death. Whether it be true, or not, that animal bodies muſt have been ſubjected to SUCH corruptibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, as that a diſſolution could not have been guarded againſt, and prevented, I ſhall not diſpute at preſent. But thus much is unqueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably true, that the time of exiſtence, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the coming on of a diſſolution, is different in different claſſes of the inferior animals; which cannot be accounted for, by the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="285" facs="unknown:018397_0283_0FA70C0E9CABB8C0"/>
of any of the laws of nature, without recurring to that wiſdom of God, which ſo formed the bodily conſtitution of all animals, and ſo differenced it with reſpect to the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent claſſes of them, that the laws of nature ſhould be unable, unleſs by accidental interfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, to effect a diſſolution in any of them, but in conformity to that <hi>ſpecial difference,</hi> as to the general time, that had been previouſly alot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for their continuance in being.</p>
            <p>And with reſpect to the race of men, in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, ſo far as we may receive for truth what Moſes has related, the <hi>time</hi> of their bodily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, the ſame general laws of nature ſtill ſubſiſting, and in operation, has been greatly varied. Men live now, generally ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but ſeventy, or eighty years: Whereas, in the Anti-Diluvian ages, they lived ſome hundreds of years; and they might, had God ſo pleaſed, have gone on living as many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands: Yea, their ſpecial conſtitution might have been ſuch, for aught any one can prove to the contrary, as that they ſhould not have ſeen corruption.<note n="*" place="bottom">According to the new-teſtament writings, there will be no death, among the true ſervants of Jeſus Chriſt, in the reſurrection-world. They will have bodies there, as they have here. Their bodies may be there more refined, and with greater ſkill organized, ſo as to be fitter machines for the ſoul to act by; but they will be bodies ſtill, and yet not ſubject to mortality. Hence that emphatically ſtrong declaration of the apoſtle Paul, "This corruptible muſt put on incorruption, and this mortal muſt put on immortality. So, when this corruptible ſhall have put on incorruption, and this mortal has put on immortality, then ſhall be brought to paſs the ſaying that is written, "death is ſwallowed up in victory." It is from hence evident, that material bodies may, by the ſkill of the all-wiſe and all-powerful Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect, be ſo formed, as that, under his over-ruling guidance and protection, they may continue in exiſtence without death forever. According to the ſame writings alſo it is evident, that mankind would not have been ſubjected to death, had it not been for the lapſe of the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſt man, Adam. But it is evident likewiſe, that it could not have been the intention of God, that Adam, together with all that might proceed from him, ſhould have lived on this earth at one and the ſame time; and for this very good reaſon, becauſe it was plainly impoſſible that they ſhould. This world could not have contained and ſubſiſted them; unleſs their bodies, and the manner of ſupporting them, had been quite diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from what they now are. If therefore they had not died, ſome other way muſt have been provided to make room for thoſe who would have been brought into being. Perhaps, in certain periods, numbers of thoſe who had been fitted therefor, might have been tranſlated to ſome other place of abode, to enjoy happineſs there, in ſome ſuperior mode of exiſtence. But be this as it may, this non-ſubjection to death was not owing to a created natural incorruptibility, but to a ſpecial promiſe from Almighty God, that, while innocent, they ſhould be ſo protected, and preſerved, as not to ſee corruption. But, innocence being loſt, the promiſe of immortality became vacated, and death of courſe too<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> place: Only, it was left with God to fix the general period of life; which he has done with wiſdom that diſcovers great goodneſs.</note> But, in the plan of God,
<pb n="286" facs="unknown:018397_0284_0FA70C1057E78990"/>
it has been ordered otherwiſe. He has ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted our bodily ſtructure, that it ſhall, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſuch a general period, naturally fall to pieces. And this general period he has fixed, not from any neceſſity there was for it by reaſon of the corruptibility of the materials of which it is formed; but by ſo contriving the continuance
<pb n="287" facs="unknown:018397_0285_0FA70C10B40FD5C8"/>
of one generation, as that the ſucceſſion of another ſhould be admirably adapted to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt both wiſdom and goodneſs in providing for the exiſtence of mere life, and conſequent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment, than there would otherwiſe have been on this earth.</p>
            <p>It might alſo be with a view to promote morally good purpoſes, that the law of death, eſpecially as to its general time, has been eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by God. It is not eaſy to conceive of any motive more ſtrikingly adapted to excite to conſideration, and ſuch a behavior in life as may lay a juſt foundation for calmneſs and ſerenity of mind, when the time comes that we muſt depart out of this into another ſtate. And it is, moſt certainly, a very powerful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint from vicious practices, eſpecially in thoſe kinds, and degrees, which naturally tend to haſten death, and bring it on before its proper time. It is indeed one of the wiſeſt and beſt contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances for the government of men, and to keep them within the reſtraints of reaſon and virtue. As Dr. Sherlock, in his excellent treatiſe on death, expreſſes it, "Mortality and death are neceſſary to the good government of the world. Nothing elſe can give a check to ſome men's wickedneſs, but either the fear of death, or exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of it. Some men are ſo outrageouſly wicked, that nothing can put a ſtop to them, and prevent the miſchief they do in the world, but to cut them off. This is the reaſon of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital puniſhments among men, to remove thoſe
<pb n="288" facs="unknown:018397_0286_0FA70C1177CC4D40"/>
out of the world who will be a plague to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind kind while they live in it. For this reaſon God deſtroyed the whole race of mankind by a deluge of water, excepting Noah, and his family, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were incurably wicked. For this reaſon he ſends plagues, and famine, and ſword, to correct the exorbitant growth of wickedneſs, to leſſen the number of ſinners, and to lay re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints on them. And if the world be ſuch a bedlam as it is under all theſe reſtraints, what would it be were it filled with immortal ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners!"</p>
            <p>Upon the whole that has been ſaid, in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to natural evil, it appears either that it could not have been prevented in ſuch a world as our's; or, that it is miſcalled evil, being rather the contrivance of wiſdom in order to the production of more good, than there other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe would have been. It is conceded, a better world than this, more perfect, and more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully adapted to make happy, might be created by the Deity; but then it ought to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered, ſuch a better world may be already one of the links in the diverſified chain of exiſtence. The only proper queſtion therefore is, whether the making ſuch a world as this, is not a proof of more benevolence, than a chaſm would be in that part of the creation, which it now occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies? If ſo, imperfect as it is, comparatively ſpeaking, it is better it ſhould be, than not be. And, for ſuch an imperfect world as this ought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

order to its being a proper part in the chain of exiſtence, no alteration, it may be, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the complaints that have been made of deficiences, redundances, deformities, and evils, could be made without damage to the ſyſtem. If in ſome things, abſolutely viewed, an alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation for the better might be ſuppoſed, yet this very alteration, conſidered, as it ought to be, in its relation to other parts, which, as truly as theſe, go to the conſtitution of the whole, it might turn out greatly to its diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. Arch Deacon Law, in his 42 Note, on Arch Biſhop King's "origin of evil," has well expreſſed himſelf upon this head. Says he, "we may ſafely conclude, that there could have been no partial alteration of this ſyſtem, but for the worſe, as far as we know, at leaſt not for the better. They who hold that there might have been a total one, that the whole ſcheme of things might poſſibly have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, or reverſed, and that either the direct contrary, or a quite different one, would have been equally, or more worthy of God; the men, I ſay, that hold this, are obliged to ſhow the poſſibility of conceiving of it, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the manner of how it may be, before we are obliged to believe them.—And when they have done this, and compleated their ſyſtem, and made a total alteration of things, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

in every conceivable degree of perfection, were ſuppoſed to be entirely filled at the firſt. We muſt therefore take things as they are, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue only from the preſent nature of them, col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectively. In which view, we ſhall find no poſſible alteration of any thing, but what would produce greater inconveniences, either in itſelf, or others, to which it bears a ſtrict relation." He goes on, taking occaſion to borrow a ſection from Mr. Maxwell's general remarks on Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland, in theſe words. "The nature of things, in the natural world, is ſo exactly fitted to the natural faculties and diſpoſitions of mankind, that were any thing in it otherwiſe than it is, even in degree, mankind would be leſs happy, than they now are, Thus the dependence of all natural effects upon a few ſimple principles, is wonderfully advantageous in many reſpects. The degrees of all the ſenſible pleaſures are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly ſuited to the uſe of each; ſo that if we enjoyed any of them in a greater degree we ſhould be leſs happy: For our appetites of thoſe pleaſures would, by that means, be too ſtrong for our reaſon; and, as we are framed, tempt us to an immoderate enjoyment of them, ſo as to prejudice our bodies. And, where we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy ſome of them in ſo high a degree, as that, it is, in many caſes, very difficult for the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to regulate and moderate the appetites of thoſe pleaſures, it is in ſuch inſtances where it was neceſſary to counterpoize ſome diſadvanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, which are the conſequences of the purſuit
<pb n="291" facs="unknown:018397_0289_0FA70C14C582E768"/>
of thoſe pleaſures. Thus the pleaſing ideas, which accompany the love of the ſexes, are neceſſary to be poſſeſſed in ſo high a degree, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap>o ſpeculative, and leſs active. It ſeems alſo probable, that the degree of our intellec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual capacity is very well ſuited to our objects of knowledge, and that had we a greater degree thereof, we ſhould be leſs happy. Moreover, it is probably ſo adapted to the inward frame of our bodies, that it could not be greater, without either an alteration in the laws of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or in the laws of union between the ſoul and body. Farther; were it much greater than it is, our thoughts and purſuits would be ſo ſpiritual and refined, that we ſhould be taken too much off from ſenſible pleaſures. We ſhould probably be conſcious of ſome defects or wants in our bodily organs, and would be ſenſible that they were unequal to ſo great a capacity, which would neceſſarily be followed by uneaſineſs of mind. And this ſeems to hold in the br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>te-creation. For, methinks, it would be for the diſadvantage of a h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rſe to be endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the underſtanding of a man: Such an
<pb n="292" facs="unknown:018397_0290_0FA70C1549BE0C90"/>
unequal union muſt be attended with continual diſquietudes, and diſcontents. As for our pains, they are all either warnings againſt bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily diſorders, or are ſuch as, had we wanted them, the laws of nature remaining as they are, we ſhould either have wanted ſome pleaſures we now enjoy, or have poſſeſſed them in a leſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. Thoſe things in nature which we cannot reconcile to the foregoing opinion, as being ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of their uſe, we have good reaſon, from analogy, to believe are really advantageous, and adapted to the happineſs of intelligent beings of the ſyſtem; though we have not ſo full and complete a knowledge of the entire ſyſtem, as to be able to point out their particularities. From theſe obſervations we may conclude, that all the various parts of our ſyſtem are ſo admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably ſuited to one another, and the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived with ſuch exquiſite wiſdom, that were any thing, in any part thereof, in the leaſt otherwiſe than it is, without an alteration in the whole, there would be a leſs ſum of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in the ſyſtem than there now is."</p>
            <p>I have now ſaid all that I intended to ſay in illuſtration of the ſupremely perfect benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the Deity, as alſo in ſolving the objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which have been made againſt this attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of his from the known appearances in nature. How far what I have offered, may be worthy of notice, muſt be left with thoſe into whoſe hands it may fall, to judge. If any ſhould think the arguing is inconcluſive, finding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="293" facs="unknown:018397_0291_0FA70C16373E3258"/>
at the ſame time, unable to reconcile the manifeſtations of Divine goodneſs with the character of God, as infinitely benevolent, let them not, on this account, queſtion in their hearts whether he is endowed with this moſt amiable perfection. For there is no way of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, by which we can prove that he poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes any perfection, but it may in the ſame way be proved, that he is ſupremely benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent. Nor would it be any thing ſtrange ſhould we, who are ſo low an order in the ſcale of intelligent beings, be unable to remove away theſe difficulties that may attend, in ſome inſtances, the diſplay of this Divine attribute. Inſtead therefore of perplexing our own minds, or the minds of others, with ſeeming inconſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencies in God's manifeſtations of his goodneſs, let us adore before him as a Being infinitely benevolent; patiently waiting for the coming day of revelation, when it ſhall be made to appear with a meridian loſtre, that nothing was ever done in the conduct of God towards our world but in harmony with wiſe goodneſs, accurate juſtice, and the moſt perfect conſiſtency with all thoſe moral qualities, which conſtitute the bleſſed God an infinitely amiable Being.</p>
