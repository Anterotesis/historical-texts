            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <bibl>II SAMUEL, XXIII. 3.</bibl>
               <q>THE GOD OF ISRAEL SAID, THE ROCK OF ISRAEL SPAKE TO ME, HE THAT RULETH OVER MEN MUST BE JUST, RULING IN THE FEAR OF GOD.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IMPORTANT are the rights of mankind, to the ſafe and unmoleſted enjoyment of life, liberty and property, and to the beſt improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all their powers, with every reaſonable and equitable advantage they have to promote their preſent and everlaſting welfare. Theſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural rights, civil and religious, are the gifts of God, as ſuch ſacred; nor may any but He, as original proprietor, reſume them at pleaſure. But in ſuch a world as this, lying in wickedneſs, abounding with unruly paſſions, miſtaken views, claſhing intereſts and violence, there can be no
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:011691_0005_0F87EC329D23FDD0"/>
rational foundation for the ſecurity of them, without civil government.</p>
            <p>THIS evinces the urgent neceſſity and high utility of civil inſtitution; and proclaims it the dictate of reaſon, of nature, and the will of God. Divine revelation, in expreſs and peremptory lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, confirms it, "the ordinance of God."<note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. 13. 2.</note> This likewiſe points out to view, the good of the community, to be the high end of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the ſupreme law of the ſtate. The important rights, liberties, privileges and immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of the community, (ſo far as is requiſite to the end of government) being by ſpecial truſt put into the hand of rulers, by God and the people, for their preſervation, beſt enjoyment and improvement. A truſt, of very high and endearing importance, by which they are conſtituted the immediate guardians of them.</p>
            <p>THESE, as the ſalutary objects, and ſublime end of government, are tacitly pointed out in the text. "He that ruleth over men," not brutes, who may be made ſlaves, or killed for the conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of others; but men, of the ſame rank of being, dignity of nature, and veſted with the ſame great and eſſential rights with themſelves, "muſt be juſt" in his attentive regard to them, "ruling in the fear of God."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:011691_0006_0F87EC335D249240"/>
UPON theſe principles, it is evident, that the dignity of government, and the great eſſential rights and privileges of ſubjects, muſt, of right, be inviolably maintained. "He that ruleth over men," muſt be known, duly honored and obeyed, in his exalted ſtation. If the dignity of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, be degraded and weakened, the ſtrength and energy of government, will be proportionably enervated, that it cannot reach, and effectuate, the great deſign of it. On the other hand, if the great and eſſential rights and privileges of the people, be invaded and ſupplanted, uſurped and deſtroyed: the deſign of government is ſubverted, and the end of it fruſtrated, in the primary and fundamental intention of it. No exalted ideas of power and prerogative, can be juſt, as applying it to ſuch deſtructive purpoſes. All the high prerogatives of power, are for the good of the ſubjects, their wanton exertion therefore, for the deſtruction of their unforfeited lives, liberties and properties, muſt be the perverſion of them, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travention and ſubverſion of their true intention.</p>
            <p>THESE two important objects, which demand every one's attention, may with great reaſon be ſuppoſed to be invariably united, in the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and nature of things—and yet, there may ſometimes happen no ſmall difficulty, to adjuſt
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:011691_0007_0F87EC341D24F7D0"/>
and compromiſe both: but perhaps, this will ſeldom or never occur; except, where there has been a deviation, from true wiſdom, good policy and righteouſneſs: in ſuch caſe, the remedy may ſeem equally plain and eaſy, in a ſpeedy reverſion of the meaſures, which have occaſioned ſuch perplexity in adminiſtration.</p>
            <p>THERE is a method, in the conſtitution and nature of things, forever to maintain (ſo far as is within the power of the ſtate to do it) the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of government, with the rights and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges of ſubjects, in the greateſt harmony. This will be found, in a good conſtitution of civil polity—in a good adminiſtration of civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, purſuant to the ſpirit and intention of ſuch a conſtitution—and in the joint concurrence and co-opperation of ſubjects with their rulers, to the ſame noble and important deſign.</p>
            <p>A GOOD conſtitution of civil polity, by which, rulers of every rank and order from the higheſt to the loweſt, hold all their powers and prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives, emoluments and honors; and the ſubjects, all their rights and liberties, privileges and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities; is of very intereſting importance to every free ſtate; without which, all the rights and privileges of ſubjects, reſt upon a very weak
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:011691_0008_0F87EC34DD2063F0"/>
foundation, and are held by a very ſlippery and uncertain tenure, the will and caprice of rulers in power. What a miſerable foundation of ſecurity this! is fatally ſeen and felt, in deſpotic and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary governments through the world. Whereas, in a well framed conſtitution, which contains ample proviſion, to maintain the dignity of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, with the privileges of the people—where power and privilege are ſo eſſentially incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated—that the one cannot of right, be held and exerciſed, without the protection of the other—nor the other enjoyed, without the ſupport of the powers of government; there is the beſt and ſtrongeſt ſecurities, both to rulers and ſubjects, that can be, in the imperfect and mutable ſtate of things, in this world. Such is the ſtrong, the beautiful and happy complection of the Britiſh, of our own conſtitution.</p>
            <p>A GOOD adminiſtration purſuant to the ſpirit and intention of a free and good conſtitution, is of like importance with the conſtitution itſelf. The beſt conſtitution cannot operate, as an efficient effectual machine to the ends of government, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs life and energy be given to it, in adminiſtration. The Jews were endow'd by the ſingular favour and gift of God, with an excellent conſtitution: adapted with infinite wiſdom and goodneſs to their ſtate,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:011691_0009_0F87EC359D22CD20"/>
and to the beſt ends of government and religion to them; (it were eaſy to ſhew the eminent advantages of it, were there time and were it not foreign to the occaſion) but the Rock of Iſrael ſaid—there muſt be juſt rulers in adminiſtration, <q>ruling in the fear of God.</q> And if rulers and ſubjects had fully anſwered the great deſign of their conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution; God would have exalted them in name and praiſe, felicity and honour; high above all the nations of the earth.<note n="¶" place="bottom">Deut. 26. 18, 19.</note> Their hiſtory fully evinces, it went well or ill with them, according to good or bad adminiſtration, and their conduct under it. The great conſequences which follow a good or bad adminiſtration, do moſt fully evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence the importance of a good one. The ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow may remain, and the ſubſtance be deſtroyed, the form be retained and the ſpirit of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution evaniſh, and the great intention of it be defeated; yea the powers erected by the beſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution may be turn'd againſt it, to invade, ſubvert and deſtroy it, in the fundamental intention and municipal privileges of it: Subjects may feel them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves very ſenſibly injur'd, perplex'd, diſtreſs'd and wretched; and the cry of grievance and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, complaints and groans may be heard from every quarter, under the tragedy of a bad admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration. Whilſt on the other hand, the ends of government may be tollerably anſwer'd, the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:011691_0010_0F87EC365D18C2D0"/>
people enjoy much peace and quiet, under the moſt defective conſtitutions and ill-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>m'd governments in the world; under a wiſe, righteous, lenient and good adminiſtration: which however rarely hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens in them; but how much more under the meridian ſhines of a good adminiſtration, purſuant to the ſpirit and intention of a free and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent conſtitution; where they enjoy it with its beſt and moſt deſirable advantages: <hi>and whereby</hi> the dignity of government, and privileges of the people will be exalted in ſafety.</p>
            <p>THIS ſhews the vigilant attention, every free people ſhould give, to the ſpirit, tenor and tendency of adminiſtration: Their peace and welfare, their conſtitution itſelf, with all its important privileges and ſecurities, to themſelves and poſterity to the lateſt generations, is nearly concern'd in it.</p>
            <p>PERHAPS, this view of adminiſtration may alſo ſuggeſt to us, why the all-wiſe and gracious God has inſtituted and enjoin'd no particular form of government, for all the nations, kingdoms, empires and governments of this world; but left each to chooſe and determine for themſelves, as is judg'd moſt ſuitable, convenient or neceſſary to them. <q>The God of Iſrael hath ſaid</q> in the revelation given us, that civil government is "the ordinance of God"—has ſet to view the end of it, rulers are the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of God for good—has aſcertain'd the general
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:011691_0011_0F87EC371D1C2218"/>
duties of rulers and ſubjects, and bound them thereto, by the ſtrongeſt ties of intereſt and conſcience, in the motives of this world and eternity—theſe well at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to by both, and the ends of government are well anſwered.</p>
            <p>IT is of weighty concern, that there be the joint concurrence and co-operation of ſubjects with their rulers to the ſame excellent and important deſign.</p>
            <p>THE duty and intereſts of ſubjects, inſeparably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd, moſt ſtrongly oblige to it: and ordinarily, under a free government and good adminiſtration, they will fully effect it. Indeed, the infatuated with ſlaviſh principles of religion and policy, may, under a foreign influence, be inſtigated to inſurrections and rebellions under a good adminiſtration; (as happen'd in the good reigns of our illuſtrious Kings GEORGE I. and II. of precious memory) but it is not the true ſpirit of Britiſh ſubjects, Europeans or Americans, (however ſlandered) to act ſuch a treacherous and deteſtable part: but the body of the people, well uſed, will readily unite their power and influence, in ſupport of the conſtitution and powers of a good adminiſtration.</p>
            <p>IT is allow'd, that parties and factions may be form'd by the uneaſy, reſtleſs and ambitious, under the beſt adminiſtrations, may injure and diſturb go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and obſtruct the ſalutary good effects of
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:011691_0012_0F87EC37DD1A1E78"/>
it for a ſeaſon—but can ſeldom riſe high, ſpread far, or long continue without real and very ſenſible in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries and grievances: And are uſually reduced or remedied without great difficulty or hazard.</p>
            <p>BUT too often, the moſt loyal, beſt and vertuous ſubjects are miſrepreſented, and blacken'd with the wrong imputation of thoſe heinous crimes of diſloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, diſaffection, rebellion, &amp;c. which they abhor with all their hearts: As it was with Daniel and his brethren, when they refus'd obedience to the moſt ſtupid edict of idolatry. And this is commonly the caſe, where a brave, loyal, and vertuous people, are to be ſtrip'd of their invaluable privileges, and reduc'd to abject ſlavery, by the arm of power. But no arts, falſhoods, or diſguiſeful colourings, can alter the nature, or long conceal this plain truth—that an unoppreſſed, free and vertuous people, will ſee it their intereſt and important duty; and will readily concur and co-opperate with their rulers in ſupporting the dignity of government, with their own rights and privileges—the laſt, and finiſhing ſtroke by the hand of man; to the harmonious accompliſhment, of this great and excellent deſign.</p>
            <p>WE rejoice, we boaſt in the Britiſh conſtitution, and in our royal charter, the beſt privileges and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities, the happieſt conſtitution and form of government in the whole world: the next matter of higheſt moment to us, to our enjoyment of the

beſt bleſſings we can hope from civil polity, is a good adminiſtration purſuant to the ſpirit and grand intention of it.</p>
            <p>To inveſtigate the ſpirit and beſt principles of ſuch an adminiſtration, is of importance in it ſelf, ſuitable to the preſent occaſion, and what I ſhall briefly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.</p>
            <p>IT is conciſely and comprehenſively ſuggeſted, in this inſpired meſſage from God, to the exalted King of Iſrael, and to all the rulers of this world, where his revelation comes. <q>He that ruleth over men muſt be juſt, ruling in the fear of God.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THE phraſealogy of the ſacred cannon, will war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant us to underſtand by juſtice, <hi>integrity;</hi> and by the fear of God, <hi>piety.</hi> Nor will it be doubted, but this royal inſtruction and mandate, from the ſupreme and eternal King, is to all the powers of government, ſupreme or ſubordinate, legiſlative or executive, to every department and truſt in the ſtate.</p>
            <p>WHENCE we collect this obſervation;</p>
            <p>INTEGRITY and piety, joyn'd with ſuitable tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, are the beſt principles, and give the ſtrongeſt aſſurance of a good adminiſtration of government:</p>
            <p>Or,</p>

               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:011691_0014_0F87EC395D193030"/>
AN adminiſtration, form'd and conducted, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity and the fear of God; will beſt ſupport the dignity of government, ſecure the liberty of ſubjects, and advance the public welfare.</p>
            <p>THIS might be illuſtrated by ſhewing—theſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine principles are the higheſt and moſt energetic principles of good action in general, and proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably in rulers in their high ſpheres of action—they are the beſt ſafe-guards againſt all the high temptations of power, from fear, intereſt or ambition—they dictate the moſt excellent deſigns, and urge to the beſt proſecution of them—they derive great energy and ſupport, from the moſt weighty motives of religion and eternity—they enſure the beſt and moſt excellent rewards to enforce duty—the beſt eſteem of mankind, at leaſt of the wiſer and better part—the approbation of God and conſcience, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely to be preferred to the plaudit of the whole world—and in connection herewith, the great and bliſsful rewards of eternity. But waving theſe, with many other topicks—it may appear with full evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, by tracing the genuine ſpirit, principal lina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and characters of an adminiſtration formed upon theſe divine and excellent principles.</p>
            <p>To make this evident, it is ſufficient to obſerve,</p>
            <p>WISDOM will conduct—righteouſneſs ſhine—
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:011691_0015_0F87EC3A1D1A0708"/>
lenity temper—religion be warmly cheriſh'd—the public welfare inſpire and envigorate—and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trepid courage and magnanimity ſupport, an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration form'd upon the principles of integrity and piety.</p>
            <p>FIRST, Wiſdom and prudence will conduct the adminiſtration, form'd upon the principles of inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity and piety. The wiſdom of its councils, is the high honour as well as ſafety, of every ſtate. Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior talents are very important, in exalted ſtations of power; but it is wiſdom and integrity, gives them a right direction; and turns them to the greateſt advantage: ſever'd from theſe vertues, they will be in a great degree uſeleſs, and may be turn'd to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious purpoſes. Theſe illuſtrious vertues, are of high utility and continual importance, in the widely extended concerns and intereſts of the ſtate; to guide the exterior connections and internal regulations of it, by the wiſeſt meaſures, to the moſt ſalutary pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes: and eminently ſo, in ſeaſons of peculiar em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baraſſment, perplexity and dangers. Under the beſt conſtitution, things will not long remain upon their proper baſis—the ſpirit of it will not be retained, nor the beſt intereſts of the ſtate purſued and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed—nor can they ordinarily be reliev'd, when reduced to great perplexity and embaraſſment;
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:011691_0016_0F87EC3ADD148CB0"/>
without wiſdom and prudence conduct the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration. This wanting, the beſt opportunities and advantages may be loſt, and the beſt deſigns defeated: The wiſeſt king of Iſrael long ago ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed the world, <q>by wiſdom and counſel purpoſes are eſtabliſhed,</q> and by the want of it are defeated. An antient adage founded on the experience of ages, may be applied to the greateſt powers of this world—vis concilii expers, mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>â ſuâ ruit, <q>power void of counſel, ruſhes to ruin of its own weight.</q> No arts, frauds, diſguiſing tricks of ſtate, or political reaches of refin'd cunning, can be ſubſtituted and ſupply the place of wiſdom; as they tend in their nature, ſo they have often reduced flouriſhing ſtates to great embarraſſing perplexities, and to the brink of ruin; while it is ſound wiſdom, integrity and righteouſneſs only, that conducts the ſtate in dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and ſafety. Perhaps as many ſtates have been ruined by the infatuated folly of falſe policy, as determined perverſeneſs. The ruin of Jeroboam, his family, and finally of the ten tribes of Iſrael was laid in his impious ſcheme of falſe policy. To a ruined people, the conſequences are juſt the ſame; whether it be brought on, in the one way or the other. The man of integrity muſt know and feel, he cannot anſwer it to his own conſcience, to the ſtate, nor to God the righteous judge, if ſuch
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:011691_0017_0F87EC3B9D144E30"/>
ſpacious ruin be brought on by his neglect, criminal ignorance or ill policy. This may induce him mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly to decline ſtations he cannot fill with honour and uſefulneſs—this will engage him, when in an exalted ſtation, to have his ears and heart open to the dictates of ſound wiſdom and policy—to uſe the beſt means to attain it for all occaſions; above all to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent applications to Him who proclaims, "Wiſdom and council are mine," and "who gives liberally and upbraideth not," as the ſureſt way of a ſupply: exemplified with great encouragement in king Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. In a word, this will determine and excite him to the beſt exertion and uſe of all his wiſdom and prudence, in the important concerns of an exalted ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: in imitation of king David, who guided Iſrael by the ſkilfulneſs of his hands. What illuſtrious wiſdom conducted the adminiſtrations of Joſeph in Egypt, Daniel in Babylon, form'd upon the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of integrity and piety.</p>
            <p>SECONDLY, Righteouſneſs will ſhine with luſtre in an adminiſtration founded on the exalted princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of integrity, goodneſs and piety.</p>
            <p>THE ruler of this excellent ſpirit, will cloath himſelf with righteouſneſs as a robe; and eſtimate it a dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem of glory. His love of righteouſneſs, the high importance of it, by which a nation and government is exalted and eſtabliſhed—his benevolent and tender
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:011691_0018_0F87EC3C5D0D4568"/>
regard for the rights and intereſts of the community and of mankind—above all, his ſupreme love to God, and his accountableneſs to him, who is the almighty patron of right and juſtice, and avenger of unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, will urge him to promote the intereſt of righteouſneſs, to the utmoſt of his power. Under an adminiſtration form'd by a ſpirit of righteouſneſs, effectual care will be taken, that the properties of ſubjects, and their great eſſential rights and privileges, they have by nature or conſtitution, be preſerved to them, inviolate. Theſe being their beſt birthright inheritance in this world, and dear to them as life, an injury here muſt be highly injurious to the ſtate, and of moſt fatal conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence—theſe may by no means be invaded and uſurped, betrayed or ſacrificed. When leaders of adminiſtration openly adopt arbitrary and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive meaſures in a free ſtate, government is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt as in its fountain, and the foundations of it are ſhaken. Rulers of integrity will do their utmoſt in their places to prevent or remedy ſuch meaſures, with all their ruinous operations and conſequences—that all their privileges may be am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply enjoyed in their day, and tranſmitted full and unimpaired to ſucceeding poſterity. Tyranny and anarchy they will equally avoid, and if poſſible prevent; each being replete with infinite miſchiefs to the ſtate. The juſt prerogatives of power and
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:011691_0019_0F87EC3D1D0FE930"/>
rights of ſubjects will alike engage their attentive care: The peace of God and the King will be preſerved, and good order eſtabliſhed—public merit and good ſervices be amply rewarded—men of vertue and merit be impartially promoted, and continued du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring good behaviour; while miſdemeanor in office will be properly diſcountenanced—The treaſures of the people will not be laviſhed to ſupport idle drones, favorites and minions of power; who add no ſtrength or glory to the ſtate, but are a ſcandal to government, debilitate and degrade the dignity of it: And much leſs will ſuch treaſures be ſqueez'd out of the community, by the wilds or arms of oppreſſion for ſuch deſtructive purpoſes.—Bribery and corruption will be diſcountenanced, and if poſſible baniſhed the ſtate, by rulers of integrity, as condemned by the law of God, and of moſt ruinous tendency to every free ſtate.—The lives of ſubjects will be precious—the blood of war will not be ſhed in peace with impunity—righteouſneſs of adminiſtration will purſue the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable law of God, <q>He that ſheddeth man's blood, by man ſhall his blood be ſhed;</q> and, <q>A man that doth violence to the blood of any perſon, ſhall flee to the pit, let no man ſtay him.</q>—The channels of public juſtice will be kept open, pure and uncorrupt—righteouſneſs be impartially
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:011691_0020_0F87EC3DDD0BBEC8"/>
adminiſtred to all high and low, of every rank and order—the conduct of trials will be purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant to the ſpirit of the conſtitution, to the accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed rules and known law of the land; nor will any other methods, excluding ſubjects of their birthright privileges, and of redreſs by the law of the land, be adopted and encouraged, but as much as may be prevented—complaints of grievance and oppreſſion will be willingly heard, and where found to be juſt, as readily redreſſed.—In a word; the innocent will be impartially pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected—the diſobedient as impartially puniſhed—the injured righted, without favor or affection, fraud, or unneceſſary delay or embarraſſment of juſtice.</p>
            <p>SUCH, I apprehend, the ſpirit of an admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration founded in integrity, goodneſs and piety; wherein righteouſneſs will ſhine with luſtre, or in the metaphor of the prophet, <q>will be as the waves of the ſea, bearing down all oppoſition; and peace and proſperity flow as a river.</q>—Such an overflowing benignant protection of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and adminiſtration, as extended to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent incorporate nations, and to diſtant climes and countries, is beautifully repreſented by the prophet Ezekiel, under the figure of a tall pine, with wide-extending boughs and branches, affording
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:011691_0021_0F87EC3E9D0F58A8"/>
lodgment for birds of every wing, and ſhelter for every beaſt of the field.<note n="*" place="bottom">Ezek. 17. 22, 23. ch. 31. 3,—7.</note>
            </p>
            <p>THIRDLY, Lenity and moderation will temper, and be the glory of an adminiſtration, formed upon theſe excellent principles: Wiſdom will dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate it, and the benevolence of an upright and pious heart will ſtrongly diſpoſe to it.</p>
            <p>THE throne is upheld by mercy as well as righteouſneſs. Crimes of high malignity againſt God and the ſtate, or particular ſubjects are not to be ſpared: juſtice muſt take place—the exerciſe of lenity to ſuch offenders may be cruelty to the ſtate. But ſlight diſorders, not of a malignant nature, nor long continuance, like the follies of children, are oft beſt cured by wiſe paternal lenities. 'Tis no departing from the dignity of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to conduct with lenity and moderation; but adds luſtre to it. Sudden ſallies and emotions, perhaps from laudible principles, but miſguided zeal, and without malignity of deſign, have often been rectified by lenient moderation; while ſlight diſorders magnified by miſrepreſentation, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed with an undue exerciſe of power and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity, have produced ſerious evils and much greater diſorders and ill conſequences in the ſtate.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:011691_0022_0F87EC3F5D101BF8"/>
WISDOM and lenity may temper the heat of parties, remove miſunderſtandings, and allay ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſities; when rigor and undue ſeverity would but alienate and diſaffect, irritate and inflame.—When the two tribes and half tribe in Iſrael built an altar by Jordan, there were great apprehenſions in the reſt of the tribes, of a very criminal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and revolt; a fire was inkindling and ready to burſt into a flame: but by wiſe and moderate meaſures, true information was obtained, all miſunderſtanding removed, and the fatal fire extinguiſhed.<note n="*" place="bottom">Joſhua 22. 10, to the end.</note> Afterward, when a threatning ſtorm was ariſing in Ephraim, Gideon by his wiſdom and lenity, calms and diverts the leading paſſions into another channel, and allays the tempeſt.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Judges 8. 1,—4.</note> It is the glory of an adminiſtration, where wiſdom and juſtice, lenity and moderation, each ſhine in their proper place and with due luſtre.</p>
            <p>FOURTHLY, Religion and vertue will be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronized and warmly cheriſhed in an adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion formed upon the principles of integrity and piety.</p>
            <p>THE man of integrity and piety cannot feel indifferent to the important intereſts of religion and vertue, which ought proportionably more to
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:011691_0023_0F87EC401D0BC2B0"/>
engage his attention, in a ſuperior ſphere of action and influence. Are they miniſters of God? In reaſon and gratitude they ought to acknowledge and honor him, as the fountain of their abilities and authority, honor and influence. They muſt be juſt in their care of the rights and intereſts of ſubjects; they muſt rule in the fear of God and for God, with a ſupreme regard to his will and law, authority, honor and approbation. The intereſts of true religion and vertue, as well as juſtice, muſt be patronized and encouraged accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to its benignant influence to the good of the ſtate and happineſs of rulers and ſubjects, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the character of nurſing fathers to the church of God. It is by no means my deſign, to labor this point, and purſue the argument at large—But allowing king David to underſtand the inſtruction of God to him in the text, and his example in adminiſtration to be a juſt comment upon it, (which is but a reaſonable allowance, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering he was a man after God's own heart, and alſo an inſpired prophet) and the point ſeems clear. So he underſtood and practiſed upon it, removing the wicked far from him, and putting the faithful of the land in office; who would have a care of religion and vertue, as well as juſtice. He was an illuſtrious patron and encourager of the worſhip of God, of true religion and vertue, by word, example and influence.
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:011691_0024_0F87EC40DD0F1E10"/>
He may not be imitated by uninſpired men, in things which he did as an inſpired prophet: but in his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral conduct as an eminent friend, patron and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courager of piety and vertue; he is ſet up by God, as an example for his ſucceſſors in adminiſtration. 1 Kings 11. 28. ch. 14. 8. and other places.</p>
            <p>MUCH may be done by rulers, in making ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary proviſion for the protection and ſupport of public worſhip, religion and vertue, and by counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, example and influence, without interfering with the ſacred rights of conſcience, or the prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives of the Lord of conſcience, in adding to, or diminiſhing from what is already eſtabliſhed by his ſupreme authority. And it is evidently import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, becauſe religion and vertue are the great ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of the ſtate. This is ſo plain a dictate of reaſon and obſervation, that it has had the general concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent teſtimony of the wiſeſt and beſt in all ages. Impiety, immorality and vice are a wound to the vitals of the ſtate; nor can any long flouriſh, or if free, retain their liberty, if theſe enemies are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent in the bowels of it. The favour of God, (from whoſe grace and providence comes all good) will accompany true religion and vertue: but his wrath will be pour'd out on profligate ſtates and kingdoms. Great were the effects of a good or bad adminiſtration in this point, in Judah; it went
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:011691_0025_0F87EB231D099800"/>
well or ill with them accordingly; purſuant to the fix'd rule of divine diſpenſation, addreſs'd by the prophet to the king of Judah, <q>The Lord is with you, while ye be with him; if ye ſeek him, he will be found of you; but if ye forſake him, he will forſake you.</q>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">II Chron. 15. 2.</note> The ſubverſion or perverſion of true religion and vertue for political ends, is the worſt policy in the world, as is fully exemplified in the inſtance of Jeroboam. Upon every principle of duty and good policy, rulers of integrity and piety will diſcountenance all impiety and wickedneſs, and patronize true religion and vertue, as the beſt means and token of a flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and happy ſtate.</p>
            <p>FIFTHLY, The public welfare will fix the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, inſpire and invigorate the beſt efforts for the advancement of it; in rulers of integrity and piety. Actuated by the exalted principles of love to God, to their country and to mankind; they will be born on, with an inextinguiſhable ardor in the purſuit of the public welfare. Theſe exalted prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples will inſpire noble deſigns, make them attentive to the wiſeſt and beſt meaſures, and invigorate the purſuit of them, in exalted ſtations, with unwearied conſtancy. Rulers of this excellent ſpirit, will feel themſelves moſt ſtrongly united in intereſt and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:011691_0026_0F87EC419D0EA4F8"/>
to their country, and to the community whoſe intereſts are intruſted to their care: will view all their own intereſts in this world, as cloſely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with the public welfare; and all embarked upon the ſame bottom, will regard the freedom or ſlavery, glory or diſhonour, proſperity or adverſity of the community as their own. This is a ſource of the beſt paternal or patriotic affection and labors; which cannot fail of the benignant effects of true patriotiſm, controuling and ſubordinating all irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular ſelfiſh views and intereſts to the good of the public. This excellent ſpirit, with its benign influence and effects, ſhone with great luſtre in the adminiſtrations of Moſes, Mordecai, Daniel and others in ſacred hiſtory. The public good, in all its im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant branches, the liberty, wealth, power and honor of the community, whatever tends to make it eaſy, proſperous and reſpectable, will engage the attention, and invigorate the labors, of rulers of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity and piety. Vigilant care will be taken, that the beſt ends be propoſed, the beſt and wiſeſt meaſures be concerted, and carried into execution, for the public welfare.</p>
            <p>LASTLY, A dignity of ſpirit, an intrepid cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age and magnanimity will ſupport an adminiſtration form'd upon the principles of integrity and piety.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:011691_0027_0F87EC425D0AE020"/>
A PERTINACIOUS obſtinacy in the purſuit of wrong meaſures, evidently injurious to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth; and an eaſy flexibility and inſtability that turns with every wind, are alike very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious to government. They greatly fully the glory, degrade the dignity, and weaken down the ſtrength of an adminiſtration. Whereas, 'tis the dignity, ſtrength and glory of an adminiſtration, where the beſt ends are purſued—the beſt cauſes ſupported—the beſt meaſures adopted and carried into execution with unſhaken firmneſs, intrepid courage, and unfailing magnanimity. And beyond controverſy, conſcious integrity and piety, whereby in the language of the prophet, they lay hold of God's ſtrength; and the Almighty becomes their dependance and ſtrength; is the beſt ſupport of ſuch firmneſs, courage and magnanimity. The frowns or flatteries of the world, the cavils or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of the diſcontented and factious cannot ſhake ſuch a firm foundation. The high tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of intereſt or ambition—the wily promiſes or menacing threats of power, will be uſeleſs and vain—integrity makes them proof againſt the one, and the fear of God againſt the other. Of this we have a memorable example in the three worthies in Babylon—they ſtood forth the illuſtrious advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates of liberty and religion, and with what eaſy,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:011691_0028_0F87EC431D028F38"/>
amiable dignity! with what intrepid firmneſs, cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age and magnanimity! do they make anſwer to their menacing prince, <q>We are not careful to anſwer thee in this matter. If it be ſo, our God whom we ſerve, is able to deliver us from the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, fiery furnace; and he will deliver us out of thine hand, O king. But if not, be it known to thee, O king, we will not ſerve thy Gods, nor worſhip the image which thou haſt ſet up,</q> Daniel 3. 16, 17, 18.</p>
            <p>THE general obſervation being ſufficiently illuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated in the courſe of this repreſentation, we may not omit theſe two remarks.</p>
            <p>REMARK I. IT were ingratitude to God, and to our Britiſh ſovereigns, not to acknowlege we have generally enjoy'd ample indulgence and protection of our liberties and privileges under the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Britiſh court: eſpecially ſince the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious revolution. But juſtice requires it to be ſaid, we have ever made anſwerable returns of affection and loyalty, duty and obedience. We never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed their truſts, their confidence or their inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts; but every requiſition conſtitutionally made, has been readily anſwered with duty and loyalty, to the good acceptance of his majeſty and the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh

court: and, in conjunction with our ſiſter colonies, have been an eminent ſource of the wealth, power and glory of Great-Britain. The character and conduct of this government and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican colonies in general, in this point, ſtands unimpeachable and irreproachable, but to ignorance and miſrepreſentation.</p>
            <p>REMARK II. IT were ingratitude to God, and to the memory of our honorable rulers, not to acknowlege, we have generally enjoy'd in this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony (from the beginning, to this day) as wiſe, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and benignant an adminiſtration, as can be boaſted in any part or province of the Britiſh em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. And in juſtice to the community it muſt be ſaid, that in general there has been as free and unanimous a concurrence of ſubjects with their rulers, to ſupport the dignity and attain the beſt ends of government, as can any where be found. An evident proof, of ample proviſion made in our royal charter, for the beſt adminiſtration and ends of government; without any ſuperadded regulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons whatſoever.</p>
            <p>NOR may we paſs the tribute we owe to the memory of our late honorable and very worthy governor PITKIN, deceas'd, a chriſtian of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:011691_0030_0F87EC449D00D9B8"/>
ſtamp, a patron of liberty, religion and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; a dignified ruler of diſtinguiſhed integrity and piety, well anſwering the inſtruction of God in the text, who filled his exalted ſtation with honor and uſefulneſs—liv'd reſpected and died lamented; whoſe memory will be deſervedly precious. May the divine hand that has given, ſanctify this rebuke to us, and the whole colony.</p>
            <p>I WOULD now turn the diſcourſe in a reſpectful addreſs to your honors the Governor, Deputy-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, the Aſſiſtants and Repreſentatives in general court aſſembled.</p>
            <p>HIGHLY honor'd and rever'd,</p>
            <p>YOUR candid and noble minds will indulge a reſpectful freedom, in the language of confidence in you, ſuitable to the dignity of the miniſterial office and preſent occaſion.</p>
            <p>THIS day brings us the recognition and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the important privileges we hold, by the ſpirit of the Britiſh conſtitution and by our royal charter—Privileges more precious than the gold of Oph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>r, and of greater importance to the welfare of humane ſociety, than all the treaſures of the Indies; privileges, whether we conſider their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſic

importance and uſe, or the manner in which they have been retained, ſecured and tranſmitted to us, by our glorious anceſtors, through extraordinary ſtruggles and ſcenes of blood, muſt be very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to every heart. Privileges, we have confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in you (highly rever'd ſenators) will never be loſt out of our hands, by any neglect or default of yours. In our conſtitution a good foundation is laid; may I ſay 'tis yours ſirs, to build the noble ſtructure of a wiſe, righteous and benignant admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of government upon it. The work is made eaſy to your hands, by the wiſdom and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity of foregoing adminiſtrations, into whoſe labors you enter. We doubt not your wiſdom and beſt abilities will be exerted, to further and compleat what has been ſo well begun: that in reſpect to our civil ſtate, we may be one of the happieſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces in the world. The welfare of the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity you will ever regard as the high end of your betruſtments—The man that betrays his truſt, or ſacrifices the intereſt of the public to his own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate ends, intereſt or ambition, will ever ſtand ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to the juſt reſentment of God and men. The dignity of government, in conjunction with the liberties and privileges of ſubjects, is an object you will never looſe ſight of: whatever is injurious to the one or the other, will engage your vigilant care
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:011691_0032_0F87EC461CF8C750"/>
and attention to prevent. Your eyes will be upon the faithful of the land, men of integrity and vertue, to fill the executive truſts of government.—You will ſhew yourſelves the amiable patrons, examples and encouragers of true religion and vertue—juſtice be impartially adminiſtered—vice and wickedneſs you will bear down with an equal, ſteady, impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial but powerful hand. Whatever your wiſdom may ſuggeſt to increaſe the wealth, power, reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and intereſt of the government will engage your attention. We have full confidence, you will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue your paternal patronage and generous ſupport of the college. We rejoice in the great utility of that inſtitution, in the widely extended benefits flowing from that ſociety, to the colony and land, to church and ſtate. It ſpreads not only a literary glory upon the government, but imparts an important, real advantage, in the knowlege there obtain'd, and then communicated and diffus'd (in ſome degrees) through all ranks and orders of men, of unſpeakable ſervice to church and ſtate.</p>
            <p>YOU will have it in view and at heart, that wiſdom, righteouſneſs and benignity may ſhine forth in the adminiſtration of this government, to the glory of God, and the beſt good of the ſtate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that ſuch as may ſeek occaſion againſt you, or the government, may find no place for accuſation
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:011691_0033_0F87EC46DCF91570"/>
or reproach. You need no information, of the alarming apprehenſions of your conſtituents and of Americans in general, from the late parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary regulations, and the meaſures adopted to carry them into execution. We look up to you as our more immediate guardians, of whatever is moſt dear to us and to our poſterity pertaining to this world: With ſuch a truſt repos'd in you, and ſuch an expectation may I ſay from God and us, you will feel a moſt tender, paternal regard for us, and execute a moſt vigilant care and endeavor for our rights and intereſts: that our privileges may be amply enjoy'd by us, and tranſmitted full and unimpaired to poſterity after us. You will adopt the moſt wiſe, ſalutary, conſtitutional mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures for their ſecurity, and confiding in God, adhere to them with decent dignity, unſhaken firmneſs and intrepidity. You will not omit any thing, nor do any thing, which you cannot an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for, to conſcience, to the ſtate and to God the righteous Judge,—to whoſe wiſdom and grace, care and bleſſing we moſt heartily commend you.</p>
            <p>I WOULD now proceed, in a reſpectful addreſs to my honoured fathers and brethren in the goſpel miniſtry.</p>
            <p>REVEREND and beloved,</p>

As miniſters of the Lord Jeſus, our principal buſineſs, doubtleſs, centres in the great concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the kingdom of God. But is there not an important ſervice, which we owe to the ſtate, to the ſupport of government, and to the welfare of our country; which may properly be touch'd on this occaſion? The public welfare muſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tach and deeply affect us; nor can we behold the approach of danger and ruin to our country, from any quarter, without ſtrong emotions of heart: and proportionable ſhould be our endeavours, in our proper ſphere, to prevent it. While a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic ſpirit, a love to their country, to their privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, and to righteous, vertuous liberty is che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh'd, in our people, which in every free ſtate is of importance to be encouraged: 'tis our's to maintain civil government "the ordinance of God:" to inculcate and encourage all due obedience to the higher powers, to magiſtrates of every rank and order, in the due execution of their office, "as miniſters of God for good"—to forward the good deſigns of government—teaching the right improvement of it, in living ſoberly, righteouſly, peaceably and godly in the world. We are to inculcate faith and univerſal obedience to the goſpel of Chriſt: and exert our beſt endeavours to form our people to be good chriſtians good ſubjects, uſeful members of the ſtate, as well as amiable
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:011691_0035_0F87EC485CFB1140"/>
ſubjects and happy heirs of the kingdom of God. It is our's to lay open to them the moral cauſes of all the calamities we feel or fear, to lead them to a due acknowlegement of the hand of God in every providence, to direct and urge their appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to the grace of God in Chriſt, to ſanctify and form them for his ſervice, in the beſt manner to anſwer the great deſigns of providence, and of their creation and redemption. To us it belongs to cry aloud and ſpare not to ſhew them their tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and warn them of thoſe ſins and provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which bring down the wrath of God upon the children of diſobedience, in this world and to eternity—to give warnings againſt that impiety, vice and wickedneſs which has ſtrip'd many a people of their beſt privileges, and fix'd the galling yoke of arbitrary power and tyranny upon the necks of ſo many of the great and mighty nations, kingdoms and empires of the world: whereby they are rul'd as with a rod of iron; and fruitful lands are turn'd into barrenneſs. And ſhould our nation and land follow their examples of corruption, wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs and provocation (which God mercifully for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid and prevent) how can they always eſcape their exemplified, tremendous puniſhment. In a word, it is our's to urge a thorough repentance and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of the evils found with us, and a hearty return to God in Jeſus Chriſt—to the beſt
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:011691_0036_0F87EC491CF26298"/>
improvement of the glorious goſpel, and of all our privileges; as the way to ſecure the favour, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection and bleſſing of the almighty, as the ſureſt foundation of laſting peace, tranquility and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity. Our principal labours are to be employed, to carry into execution the great deſigns of redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing love, in the ſalvation of periſhing ſinners in Jeſus Chriſt to the glory of God and the Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er—This is a ſervice ſo every way important, as diſcloſes the moſt glorious proſpects which can open upon the humane mind—and brings with it the ſtrongeſt motives that can influence the heart of man. May it ever deeply impreſs us, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite to all fidelity: May we obtain mercy of the Lord, to ſerve the beſt intereſt of the public, and to ſave our ſelves and them that hear us.</p>
            <p>I SHALL now cloſe the diſcourſe with a ſolemn addreſs to the audience in general.</p>
            <p>INTEGRITY and true piety, which are of ſuch uſe and importance to rulers in their exalted ſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; are of abſolute neceſſity to every one of you—to render you good chriſtians, moſt uſeful mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of ſociety in your ſeveral places, and above all to inſure you the approbation of God our righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Judge, and a bleſſed inheritance in his ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting kingdom. Be it your principal care then
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:011691_0037_0F87EC49DCF43F28"/>
to ſeek and ſecure the grace of God in Chriſt—to form you into this excellent ſpirit; and to improve it in a ſober righteous, peaceable, holy, uſeful, godly life. Be attentive to your privileges, thankful for them, careful to improve them to the beſt purpoſes, and ſtand faſt in the liberty where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Chriſt has made you free. Be it your care to be good chriſtians, good ſubjects, to honour and obey your civil rulers, as the miniſters of God—purſuing their proper office and truſts, and to co-operate with them, in carrying into execution the beſt deſigns of government; and to proſecute the duties of your reſpective callings faithfully, that you may be the children of God, without rebuke, and worthy members of ſociety.—We are here, but beginning our exiſtence, bound and haſtening to another and eternal ſtate—in the beſt ſtate, and under the beſt adminiſtrations of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this world, we are not to expect true and laſting happineſs. All things here, are tranſient, and upon the wheel of change—but bleſſed be God, there is a reſt which remains for the people of God, in heaven—far out of the reach of all the calamities of this world, and the power of death, and where the cry of the oppreſſor will be no more heard: be it our principal care to ſecure and attain it. To this we are urged by the importance of the prize ſet before us, and all the peculiar mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives

of the goſpel, and loudly admoniſhed by the great changes which have paſs'd over us—of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated imminent dangers, and then of eminent ſalvations brought us, by the hand of our God—and more eſpecially by the threatning clouds which ſpread over us, and the ſhaking apprehenſions which are felt through the land—Be it our care to make God our friend and truſt—to put away all evil from before him—and make ſure an intereſt and glorious inheritance in that kingdom which ſhall never be moved.—Then ſhall we be happily prepared for all events—and in that all-important day which haſtens—(when the governments and kingdoms of this world, with all their powers, pomps and pageantry ſhall paſs away and be no more), ſhall we rejoice and triumph in the GREAT SALVATION OF GOD.</p>
