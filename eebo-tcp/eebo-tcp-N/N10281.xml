            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>IT is become an univerſal cuſtom for every Author, before he gives himſelf up to the fury of the Critics, to make his dying ſpeech in a Preface; in which, according to the uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſtyle of criminals, he confeſſes his faults, tells the temptations that led him to the crime of ſcribbling, gives good advice to the reſt of his fraternity, and throws himſelf upon the mercy of the Court. Theſe ſpeeches are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly addreſſed to a ſort of imaginary being, called the <hi>kind, courteous, candid</hi> and ſometimes, <hi>benevolent Reader.</hi> Not that I would deny the exiſtence of ſuch a being, as an Epicurean once did of the ſoul, becauſe he could not find an account of it, in the complete zoology of animals. The firſt part of this Poem met with very kind reception from many of this claſs: nor am I concerned leaſt the ſecond ſhould receive any ill uſage from them. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors have much more to fear from readers of a different ſtamp; and though we are uſually loth to ſpeak out ſo plainly, the truth is, we ſhould not make ſuch long prologues to the Candid, were we aſſured of our ſafety from the attacks of the Malicious. For my own part, being an enemy to ceremony and circumlocution, and having moreover ſome outſtanding accounts to ſettle, I ſhall directly addreſs myſelf to this laſt kind of Critic;
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:013051_0004_0F8FF6765FD4A6B0"/>
aſſuring him however, upon my word of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, that I was not moved to do him this homage, as the Indians are to worſhip the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, out of any fear of his power to do miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief; ſince I have already experienced that his malice has its proper antidote in his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence.</p>

                     <hi>AS you have expreſſed great reſentment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the firſt part of this Poem and its Author, you might perchance think your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſlighted, if I ſhould let the ſecond come abroad without paying you my proper acknowledgements. I own myſelf much your debtor; and am only ſorry that the number of your brotherhood is ſo inconſiderable, that the world may perhaps think this dedication almoſt entirely needleſs. Had a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter number ſhown themſelves affected, I ſhould have had more grounds to hope that the Poem might be uſeful. Satire is a medicine very ſalutary in its effects, but quite unpleaſant in its operation; nor do I know a more evident ſymptom that the potion has taken its proper effect, than the groans and diſtortions of the Patient.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I had the pleaſure, my Illnatured Reader, on the firſt publication of my poem, to hear the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks made upon it by a cluſter of your fraternity, who might each of them have ſate for the picture of</hi> Tom Brainleſs. <hi>And as you may have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:013051_0005_0F8FF67716531680"/>
occaſion to talk againſt it yourſelf, and yet be at ſome loſs what to alledge in its reproach, I will do you the favor to acquaint you with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of their criticiſms; in order to ſave you the trouble of ſo much thinking, and aſſiſt you a little in the ſtyle and expreſſion of your reſentments.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It was determined by the meeting,</hi> nem. con. <hi>that the whole piece was low, paltry ſtuff, and both ſcurrilous in the ſentiments and dirty in the ſtyle; that it was evident, the Author knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of language, or verſification, and was inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of writing with any degree of elegance; that he was an open reviler of the Clergy, and an enemy to truth and learning; that his apparent deſign was to ridicule religion, diſgrace morality, ſneer at the preſent methods of education, and in ſhort, write a ſatire upon</hi> Yale-College <hi>and the ten commandments; that he treated the ſubject in the moſt partial and prejudiced manner, and muſt certainly be either a Separatiſt, or a Sandemanian. Though the truth of the aſſertions in the poem could not ſo conveniently be denied, yet much was ſaid againſt the intention of the Author; and it was affirmed that if indeed the world in one or two points was not quite ſo good, as they could wiſh it, yet things in the preſent ſtate could never be altered for the better, and it was folly, or mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs alone could propoſe it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Now to give you as much light as poſſible into this matter, I would aſſure you, the Author had very little hopes that the world would, in his day, arrive at the point of perfection, from which it is at preſent he knows not how many leagues diſtant; and his expectations are not very ſanguine, that
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:013051_0006_0F8FF677D8F196F0"/>
theſe pictures of the modern defective manners will do much ſervice. He is fully ſenſible, that the moral World is as difficult to be moved out of its courſe, as the natural; that there is in it as much power of reſiſtance or</hi> vis inertiae, <hi>as the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers term it; and that the projectors are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually at a loſs for engines and foothold. He is as much ſatiſfied that the preſent year hath borne a ſufficient number of fools to keep up the breed, as that there has been a tolerable crop produced every ſeaſon, for theſe forty years paſt. But he thought, though perhaps the picture might not reclaim ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, there could be no harm in trying his hand at the draught: In which, if the good people, who ſate for the painting, have the ill hap to find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves drawn with a wide mouth, a long noſe, or a blear eye, he begs of them to get a little acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with their own faces, and ſee whether theſe be not their real defects of nature, before they begin to rail at the Painter, for the badneſs of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I am fully ſenſible, my Illnatured Reader, that you have good reaſons in your own breaſt, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for your reſentment againſt my firſt eſſay, and direct you in the manner of your remarks. You ought in gratitude to defend that careleſſneſs in the examination of Candidates for preaching, to which it is not at all impoſſible, but you may yourſelf be indebted for your reverence and your band. Juſtly may you deſpiſe the ſtudy of thoſe finer Arts and Sciences, of which, in a ſmooth journey through life, you never once knew the want, or perceived the advantages: juſtly ſhould you undervalue them in compariſon with that antient Learning, which
<pb n="ix" facs="unknown:013051_0007_0F8FF6789938D150"/>
from experience you rightly term</hi> Solid, <hi>as your own wits were never able to penetrate it. With good reaſon alſo do you affirm the ſatire to be level<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at the Clergy in general, ſince that aſſertion is the beſt method of preventing the public from drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to view thoſe particular men, at whom it is, and ought to be, pointed; though you might diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, with any other eye than that of wilful pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, that the Author hath the higheſt veneration for the miniſterial robe, or he would never thus trouble himſelf about the ſpots that defile it. As for thoſe,</hi> however dignified in ſtation, <hi>who rail at the Progreſs of Dulneſs, to gain favour with a particular party, or order of men, he thinks them unworthy the notice of an anſwer. He would hint only to ſuch as hope to ſcreen themſelves in the croud, and draw on him the reſentment of thoſe he eſteems, by affirming the ſatire to be general, that he would thank them, if they would ſo far throw off the maſk, that by acquiring a right to their names, he may have an opportunity hereafter to render it more particular. He eſpecially recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends this hint to two Perſons, the haughtieſt Dullard, and the moſt impertinent Coxcomb of this age; from whom he has already received number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs favours, and who by their future good conduct may ſtand a chance, at ſome fortunate period, to figure at the head of a Dedication to the firſt and ſecond parts of the Progreſs of Dulneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And new, my Evil Reader, with regard to the Poem before you, which is properly a counterpart to the other, I deſign pretty much to let it ſpeak for itſelf. Perhaps, ſince I have now endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ridicule and explode both extremes, this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond part may aſſiſt you a little to judge what are
<pb n="x" facs="unknown:013051_0008_0F8FF6795043DD38"/>
the ſentiments I would wiſh to enforce: but in plain truth, I have very little hopes of you. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs before I leave you, I will tell you one ſecret, and give you a few words of advice. The ſecret, which I am ſure you would never have been able to diſcover, is this; In conformity to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacy of your taſte, I have raiſed the ſtyle of this part, about two degrees by the ſcale, higher than the other. The advice is, that it will be no unwiſe proceedure in you to hint that the ſpirit of the piece is not well ſupported, nor this part half ſo good as the firſt: and an obſervation, or two, upon the Author's impudence, ſeaſonably introduced, might not be wholly without effect. But as to the old trite way of calling men, Heretics, Deiſts and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians, it hath been lately ſo much hackneyed and worn out by ſome Reverend Gentlemen, that I cannot promiſe it would do you any manner of ſervice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I cannot conclude without declaring to the world in this public manner, that whoever ſhall take on himſelf this character, by criticizing on theſe Poems in the method above ſpecified, ſhall have my free licence and permiſſion to appropriate to himſelf the whole of this dedication, and be diſtinguiſhed for the future by the title of my Envious and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious Reader: and I do aſſure him that this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face was written purpoſely for him; not deſigning however to exclude from a proper ſhare every one, who ſhall join with him in thoſe ſentiments, from this firſt day of January, new ſtyle, A. D.</hi> 1773, <hi>henceforth, and as long as the world ſhall endure, be the ſame term longer or ſhorter.</hi>

Not all his oaths can Duns diſmay,</l>

               <l>Not all his compliments can bail,</l>

               <l>The meteor's gaudy light is gone;</l>
               <l>Lone Age with haſty ſtep comes on;</l>
               <l>The charms he once with pride diſplay'd,</l>

               <l>Low-ſhivring in the vale of years;</l>
               <l>The ghoſt of all his former days,</l>

               <l>From ev'ry place, that bleſs'd his hopes,</l>
               <l>He's elbow'd out by younger Fops.</l>
               <l>Each pleaſing thought unknown, that chears</l>

               <l>The Coxcomb's courſe were wondrous clever,</l>
