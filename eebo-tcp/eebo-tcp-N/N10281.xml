            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>IT is become an univer≈øal cu≈øtom for every Author, before he gives him≈øelf up to the fury of the Critics, to make his dying ≈øpeech in a Preface; in which, according to the u≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ≈øtyle of criminals, he confe≈ø≈øes his faults, tells the temptations that led him to the crime of ≈øcribbling, gives good advice to the re≈øt of his fraternity, and throws him≈øelf upon the mercy of the Court. The≈øe ≈øpeeches are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly addre≈ø≈øed to a ≈øort of imaginary being, called the <hi>kind, courteous, candid</hi> and ≈øometimes, <hi>benevolent Reader.</hi> Not that I would deny the exi≈øtence of ≈øuch a being, as an Epicurean once did of the ≈øoul, becau≈øe he could not find an account of it, in the complete zoology of animals. The fir≈øt part of this Poem met with very kind reception from many of this cla≈øs: nor am I concerned lea≈øt the ≈øecond ≈øhould receive any ill u≈øage from them. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors have much more to fear from readers of a different ≈øtamp; and though we are u≈øually loth to ≈øpeak out ≈øo plainly, the truth is, we ≈øhould not make ≈øuch long prologues to the Candid, were we a≈ø≈øured of our ≈øafety from the attacks of the Malicious. For my own part, being an enemy to ceremony and circumlocution, and having moreover ≈øome out≈øtanding accounts to ≈øettle, I ≈øhall directly addre≈øs my≈øelf to this la≈øt kind of Critic;

a≈ø≈øuring him however, upon my word of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, that I was not moved to do him this homage, as the Indians are to wor≈øhip the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, out of any fear of his power to do mi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief; ≈øince I have already experienced that his malice has its proper antidote in his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence.</p>

I own my≈øelf much your debtor; and am only ≈øorry that the number of your brotherhood is ≈øo incon≈øiderable, that the world may perhaps think this dedication almo≈øt entirely needle≈øs.

                     <hi>I had the plea≈øure, my Illnatured Reader, on the fir≈øt publication of my poem, to hear the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks made upon it by a clu≈øter of your fraternity, who might each of them have ≈øate for the picture of</hi> Tom Brainle≈øs. <hi>And as you may have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent

occa≈øion to talk again≈øt it your≈øelf, and yet be at ≈øome lo≈øs what to alledge in its reproach, I will do you the favor to acquaint you with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øult of their critici≈øms; in order to ≈øave you the trouble of ≈øo much thinking, and a≈ø≈øi≈øt you a little in the ≈øtyle and expre≈ø≈øion of your re≈øentments.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>It was determined by the meeting,</hi> nem. con. <hi>that the whole piece was low, paltry ≈øtuff, and both ≈øcurrilous in the ≈øentiments and dirty in the ≈øtyle; that it was evident, the Author knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of language, or ver≈øification, and was inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of writing with any degree of elegance; that he was an open reviler of the Clergy, and an enemy to truth and learning; that his apparent de≈øign was to ridicule religion, di≈øgrace morality, ≈øneer at the pre≈øent methods of education, and in ≈øhort, write a ≈øatire upon</hi> Yale-College <hi>and the ten commandments; that he treated the ≈øubject in the mo≈øt partial and prejudiced manner, and mu≈øt certainly be either a Separati≈øt, or a Sandemanian. Though the truth of the a≈ø≈øertions in the poem could not ≈øo conveniently be denied, yet much was ≈øaid again≈øt the intention of the Author; and it was affirmed that if indeed the world in one or two points was not quite ≈øo good, as they could wi≈øh it, yet things in the pre≈øent ≈øtate could never be altered for the better, and it was folly, or mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs alone could propo≈øe it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Now to give you as much light as po≈ø≈øible into this matter, I would a≈ø≈øure you, the Author had very little hopes that the world would, in his day, arrive at the point of perfection, from which it is at pre≈øent he knows not how many leagues di≈øtant; and his expectations are not very ≈øanguine, that
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:013051_0006_0F8FF677D8F196F0"/>
the≈øe pictures of the modern defective manners will do much ≈øervice. He is fully ≈øen≈øible, that the moral World is as difficult to be moved out of its cour≈øe, as the natural; that there is in it as much power of re≈øi≈øtance or</hi> vis inertiae, <hi>as the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øophers term it; and that the projectors are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually at a lo≈øs for engines and foothold. He is as much ≈øati≈øfied that the pre≈øent year hath borne a ≈øufficient number of fools to keep up the breed, as that there has been a tolerable crop produced every ≈øea≈øon, for the≈øe forty years pa≈øt. But he thought, though perhaps the picture might not reclaim ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, there could be no harm in trying his hand at the draught: In which, if the good people, who ≈øate for the painting, have the ill hap to find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves drawn with a wide mouth, a long no≈øe, or a blear eye, he begs of them to get a little acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with their own faces, and ≈øee whether the≈øe be not their real defects of nature, before they begin to rail at the Painter, for the badne≈øs of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øemblance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I am fully ≈øen≈øible, my Illnatured Reader, that you have good rea≈øons in your own brea≈øt, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for your re≈øentment again≈øt my fir≈øt e≈ø≈øay, and direct you in the manner of your remarks. You ought in gratitude to defend that carele≈ø≈øne≈øs in the examination of Candidates for preaching, to which it is not at all impo≈ø≈øible, but you may your≈øelf be indebted for your reverence and your band. Ju≈øtly may you de≈øpi≈øe the ≈øtudy of tho≈øe finer Arts and Sciences, of which, in a ≈ømooth journey through life, you never once knew the want, or perceived the advantages: ju≈øtly ≈øhould you undervalue them in compari≈øon with that antient Learning, which
<pb n="ix" facs="unknown:013051_0007_0F8FF6789938D150"/>
from experience you rightly term</hi> Solid, <hi>as your own wits were never able to penetrate it. With good rea≈øon al≈øo do you affirm the ≈øatire to be level<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at the Clergy in general, ≈øince that a≈ø≈øertion is the be≈øt method of preventing the public from drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to view tho≈øe particular men, at whom it is, and ought to be, pointed; though you might di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, with any other eye than that of wilful pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, that the Author hath the highe≈øt veneration for the mini≈øterial robe, or he would never thus trouble him≈øelf about the ≈øpots that defile it. As for tho≈øe,</hi> however dignified in ≈øtation, <hi>who rail at the Progre≈øs of Dulne≈øs, to gain favour with a particular party, or order of men, he thinks them unworthy the notice of an an≈øwer. He would hint only to ≈øuch as hope to ≈øcreen them≈øelves in the croud, and draw on him the re≈øentment of tho≈øe he e≈øteems, by affirming the ≈øatire to be general, that he would thank them, if they would ≈øo far throw off the ma≈øk, that by acquiring a right to their names, he may have an opportunity hereafter to render it more particular. He e≈øpecially recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends this hint to two Per≈øons, the haughtie≈øt Dullard, and the mo≈øt impertinent Coxcomb of this age; from whom he has already received number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈øs favours, and who by their future good conduct may ≈øtand a chance, at ≈øome fortunate period, to figure at the head of a Dedication to the fir≈øt and ≈øecond parts of the Progre≈øs of Dulne≈øs.</hi>

                     <hi>And new, my Evil Reader, with regard to the Poem before you, which is properly a counterpart to the other, I de≈øign pretty much to let it ≈øpeak for it≈øelf. Perhaps, ≈øince I have now endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ridicule and explode both extremes, this ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond part may a≈ø≈øi≈øt you a little to judge what are
<pb n="x" facs="unknown:013051_0008_0F8FF6795043DD38"/>
the ≈øentiments I would wi≈øh to enforce: but in plain truth, I have very little hopes of you. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthele≈øs before I leave you, I will tell you one ≈øecret, and give you a few words of advice. The ≈øecret, which I am ≈øure you would never have been able to di≈øcover, is this; In conformity to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacy of your ta≈øte, I have rai≈øed the ≈øtyle of this part, about two degrees by the ≈øcale, higher than the other. The advice is, that it will be no unwi≈øe proceedure in you to hint that the ≈øpirit of the piece is not well ≈øupported, nor this part half ≈øo good as the fir≈øt: and an ob≈øervation, or two, upon the Author's impudence, ≈øea≈øonably introduced, might not be wholly without effect. But as to the old trite way of calling men, Heretics, Dei≈øts and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians, it hath been lately ≈øo much hackneyed and worn out by ≈øome Reverend Gentlemen, that I cannot promi≈øe it would do you any manner of ≈øervice.</hi>
