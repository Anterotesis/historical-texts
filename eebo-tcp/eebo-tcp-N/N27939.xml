            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>BIOGRAPHICAL MEMOIRS OF GEN. GEORGE WASHINGTON, ESQ. <hi>Late President of the United States, &amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>GEORGE WASHINGTON was born Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary 2nd. 1732, in the pariſh of Waſhington, in Weſtmoreland county, in the ſtate of Virginia. His anceſtors were poſſeſſed of property in England, near Cave, in the eaſt riding of Yorkſhire, which they ſold, and came over to America, in the year 1657, and purchaſed lands in king George's county, Virginia. His father, Mr. Auguſtus Waſhing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, was the ſecond in decent after their emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration, and had a numerous offspring. He was poſſeſſed of large property, and of diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed reputation. George was his third ſon, and the firſt fruit of his ſecond marriage. He received his education from a private tutor, under, whom he acquired a knowledge of the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin language ſufficient for the ordinary purpoſes
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:037222_0004_100C97BA6FAD8D18"/>of life, his mother-tongue grammatically, and the elements of mathematics, which he, in his riſing years, carefully improved by practical experiments in topographical and military plans. When he was but ten years of age, his father died, and at fifteen he was entered a midſhipman on board a Britiſh ſhip of war then ſtationed on the coaſt of Virginia. But after his baggage had been packed up for embarkation, the plan was abandoned in obedience to the calls of maternal affection. For ſeveral years after he quitted his tutor, the learning he had acquired was much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by a diſpoſition to ſtudy, and he par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly applied himſelf to the practical parts of ſurveying, a knowledge of which was then, as it is now, very important and neceſſary to men of landed property in every part of the American continent. His merits in this branch of knowledge, occaſioned him being nominated Surveyor to a certain diſtrict in Virginia, an appointment rather <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>editable than lucrative; but which afforded him ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous opportunities, particularly an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with the country, the properties of lands, and the ſituations and direction of creeks and rivers, and it enabled him to make a choice of ſome valuable tracts of land for ſubſequent purchaſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:037222_0004_100C97BA6FAD8D18"/>
After his father died, the charge of the family devolved on his eldeſt brother, a young man of the moſt promiſing talents; who, at that time, was a captain under admiral Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, in the colonial troops, employed in the expedition againſt Carthagena; upon his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, having come into the poſſeſſion of his patrimonial eſtates, in honour of his admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, from whom he had received many civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities he named his new manſion <hi>Mount-Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non.</hi> He was afterwards made adjutant-ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of the militia of Virginia, but did not long ſurvive, and on his demiſe (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding there were heirs of an elder branch, who poſſeſs a large ſhare of the patrimony) the eldeſt ſon by the ſecond marriage, inherited the part upon which that ſent now ſtands, and a conſiderable landed property attached to it.</p>
            <p>At the death of his brother, the vacant of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of adjutant-general, was, in conſequence of the encreaſed population and extenſive limits of the colony, divided into three diſtricts, and the <hi>future Hero of America,</hi> before he was twenty years of age, began his military ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reer, by an appointment to the tank of major in that department.</p>
            <p>In 1753, an event occurred, which called his abilities into more active public notice.
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:037222_0005_100C97BD31FE04F8"/>The jealouſies of the French and Engliſh governments were at their height. Encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were reported to have been made by the former from their ſettlements in Canada, on the frontier territories of the Britiſh co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, along the rivers Ohio and de Boeuf, —Orders were received from England, by the governor and council of Virginia, to repel by force theſe encroachments; in conſequence of which, lieutenant-governor Dinwiddie diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched young major Waſhington, with ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary powers to aſcertain the facts, treat with the Indians, and warn the French to de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>t from the inroads they were making, in direct violation of the treaties then ſubſiſting between the two crowns. This miſſion he performed with ſingular induſtry, intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and addreſs.</p>
            <p>The appointment of major Waſhington was deemed a circumſtance ſomewhat extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary at that period; it was ſaid that a youth unacquainted with the enlarged com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce of the world, unexperienced in politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal concerns, appeared to be unfit to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to conduct a negociation, wherein ſubjects of the greateſt importance were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved: It was very true that the ſubjects were important, for they ſhortly after be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the origin of a war between the two
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:037222_0005_100C97BD31FE04F8"/>nations, which raged for many years, and extended throughout every part of the globe, and which ended in the final expulſion of the French from the continent.</p>
            <p>But thoſe who had formed ſuch ſuperfical notions of the major were in the end deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſucceſs and abilities manifeſted through the whole tranſaction. This having been the firſt effort of that career which has terminated with ſo much ſplendor in hiſtory, and honour and happineſs to himſelf and his country. It will be pleaſing to peruſe his journal, given in as a report of his proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to governor Dinwiddie of Virginia, on that occaſion; it is highly illuſtrative of that activity and penetration which have ſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized his character—On a more extenſive theatre, at a ſubſequent period, we ſhall give it to our readers from an authentic ſource.</p>

From thence we went to Wincheſter, and got baggage, horſes, &amp;c. and from thence we purſued the new road to Wills Creek, where we arrived the 14th of November.</p>

<pb n="11" facs="unknown:037222_0006_100C97BF63E4CC08"/>The waters were quite impaſſable, without ſwimming our horſes; which obliged us to get the loan of a canoe from Frazier, and to ſend Barnaby Currin, and Henry Stewart, down the Monongahela, with our baggage, to meet us at the forks of the Ohio, about ten miles, there to croſs the Aligany <note n="*" place="bottom">The Ohio and Alligany are the ſame river.</note>.</p>
                        <p>As I got down before the canoe, I ſpent ſome time in viewing the rivers, and the land in the Fork, which I think extremely well ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated for a fort, as it has the abſolute command of both rivers. The land at the point is 20 or 25 feet above the common ſurface of the water; and a conſiderable bottom of flat well-timbered land all around it, very convenient for building: The rivers are each a quarter of a mile, or more a croſs, and run here very near at right angles: Aligany bearing N. E. and Monongahela S. E. The former of theſe two is a very rapid and ſwift running water; the other deep and ſtill, without any percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible fall.</p>
                        <p>About two miles from this on the South Eaſt ſide of the river, at the place where the Ohio company intended to erect a fort, lives Shingiſs, King of the Delawares: We called upon him to invite him to council at the Loggs Town.</p>

As I had taken a good deal of notice yeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terday of the ſituation at the Forks, my cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity led me to examine this more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, and I think it greatly inferior, either for defence or advantages; eſpecially the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: For a fort at the Forks would be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually well ſituated on the Ohio, and have the entire command of the Monongahela; which runs up to our ſettlements, and is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely well deſigned for water carriage, as it is of a deep ſtill nature. Beſides a fort at the Fork might be built at much lefs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe than at the other place.</p>
                        <p>Nature has well contrived this lower place for water defence; but the hill whereon it muſt ſtand being about a quarter of a mile in length, and then deſcending gradually on the land ſide, will render it difficult and very expenſive, to make a ſufficient forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication there. The whole flat upon the hill muſt be taken in, the ſide next the deſcent made extremely high, or elſe the hill itſelf cut away: Otherwiſe, the enemy may raiſe batteries within that diſtance without being expoſed to a ſingle ſhot from the fort.</p>
                        <p>Shingiſs attended us to the Loggs Town, where we arrived between ſun ſetting and dark, the 25th day after I left Williamſburg.
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:037222_0007_100C97C1B1A8EBD0"/>We travelled over ſome extreme good and bad land, to get to this place.</p>
                        <p>As ſoon as I came into town, I went to Monakatoocha (as the half king was out at his hunting cabbin on little Beaver Creek, about 15 miles off) and informed him by John Daviſon my Indian interpreter, that I was ſent a meſſenger to the French general; and was ordered to call upon the ſachems of the ſix nations, to acquaint them with it. I gave him a ſtring of wampum, <note n="*" place="bottom">A kind of Indian Money; alſo given as a preſent or mark of friendship.</note> and a twiſt of tobacco, and deſired him to ſend for the half king; which he promiſed to do by a runner in the morning, and for other ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chems. I invited him and the other great men preſent, to my tent, where they ſtayed about an hour and returned.</p>
                        <p>According to the beſt obſervations I could make, Mr. Giff's new ſettlement (which we paſſed by) bears about W. N. W. 70 miles, from Wills Creek, Shanapins, or the Forks N. by W. or N. N. W. about 50 miles from that: and from thence to the Loggs Town, the courſe is nearly weſt about 18 or 20 miles: So that the whole diſtance, as we
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:037222_0008_100C97C39D660FE0"/>went and computed it, is at leaſt 135 or 140 miles from our back inhabitants.</p>
                        <p>25th. Came to town four of ten French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men who had deſerted from a company at the Kuſkuſkas, which lies at the mouth of this river. I got the following account from them. They were ſent from New-Orleans with 100 men, and 8 canoe loads of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to this place; where they expected to have met the ſame number of men, from the forts on this ſide of Lake Erie, to convoy them and the ſtores up, who were not ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived when they run off.</p>
                        <p>I enquired into the ſituation of the French, on the Miſſiſippi, their number, and what forts they had built. They informed me, that there were four ſmall forts between New-Orleans and the Black Iſlands, garris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned with about 30 or 40 men, and a few ſmall pieces in each: That at New Orleans, which is near the mouth of the Miſſiſippi, there are 35 companies, of 40 men cach, with a pretty ſtrong fort mounting 8 carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age guns; and at the Black Iſlands there are ſeveral companies and a fort with 6 guns. The Black Iſlands are about 130 leagues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the mouth of the Ohio, which is about 350 above New-Orleans. They alſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted me, that there was a ſmall palliſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doed
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:037222_0008_100C97C39D660FE0"/>fort on the Ohio, at the mouth of the Obaiſh, about 60 leagues from the Miſſiſip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi. The Obaiſh <note n="*" place="bottom">Or Wabaſh, written by the French, Quabach.</note> heads near the weſt end of Lake Erie, and affords the communication between the French on Miſſiſippi and thoſe on the Lakes. Theſe deſerters came up from the lower Shannoah Town with one Brown, an Indian trader, and were going to Philadelphia.</p>
                        <p>About 3 o'clock this evening the half king came to town. I went up and invited him with Daviſon, privately, to my tent; and deſired him to relate ſome of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars of his journey to the French com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandant, and reception there. Alſo to give me an account of the ways and diſtance. He told me that the neareſt and levelleſt way was now impaſaſable, by reaſon of many large meiry ſavannas; that we muſt be obliged to go by Venango, and ſhould not get to the near fort under five or fix nights ſleep, good travelling. When he went to the fort, he ſaid he was received in a very ſtern manner by the late commander; who aſked him very abruptly, what he had came about, and to declare his buſineſs: which he ſaid he did in the following ſpeech:—</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="16" facs="unknown:037222_0009_100C97C5986DDC48"/>
"Fathers, I am come to tell you your own ſpeeches; what your own mouths have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared. Fathers, you, in former days, ſet a ſilver baſon before us, wherein there was the leg of a beaver, and deſired all the nations to come and eat of it; to eat in peace and plenty, and not to be churliſh to one another: And that if any ſuch perſon ſhould be ſound to be a diſturber, I here lay down by the edge of the diſh a rod, which you muſt ſcourge them with; and if I your father, ſhould get fooliſh in my old days, I deſire you may uſe it upon me as well as others.</p>
                        <p>"Now, fathers, it is you who are the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbers in this land, by coming and building your towns; and taking it away unknown to us, and by force.</p>
                        <p>"Fathers, we kindled a fire a long time ago, at a place called Montreal, where we deſired you to ſtay, and not to come and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude upon our land. I now deſire you may diſpatch to that place; for be it known to you, fathers, that this is our land, and not yours.</p>
                        <p>"Fathers, I deſire you may hear me in civilneſs; it not, we muſt handle that rod which was laid down for the uſe of the obſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petons. If you had come in a peaceable manner, like our brothers the Engliſh, we
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:037222_0009_100C97C5986DDC48"/>ſhould not have been againſt your trading with us, as they do: <hi>But to come, Fathers, and build houses upon our land, and to take it by force, is what we cannot submit to.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>"Fathers, both you and the Engliſh are white, we live in a country between; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the land belongs to neither one nor the other: But the great Being above allowed it to be a place of reſidence for us; ſo fathers I deſire you to withdraw, as I have done our brothers the Engliſh: For I will keep you at armslength. I lay this down as a trial for both, to ſee which will have the greateſt regard to it, and that ſide we will ſtand by, and make equal ſharers with us. Our brothers the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh have heard this, and I come now to tell it to you; for I am not afraid to diſcharge you off this land."</p>
                        <p>This he ſaid was the ſubſtance of what he ſpoke to the general, who made this reply.</p>
                        <p>"Now, my child, I have heard your ſpeech: You ſpoke firſt, but its my time to ſpeak now. Where is my wampum that you took away, with the marks of towns in it? This wampum I do not know, which you have diſcharged me off the land with: But you need not put yourſelf to the trouble of ſpeaking, for I will not hear you. I am not afraid of flies, or muſquitoes, for Indians
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:037222_0010_100C97C727D645D0"/>are ſuch as thoſe. I tell you, down that river I will go, and build upon it, according to my command. If the river was blocked up, I have forces ſufficient to burſt it open, and tread under my feet all that ſtand in oppoſition, together with their alliances; for my force is as the ſand upon the ſea-ſhore: Therefore, here is vour wampum, I fling it at you. Child you talk fooliſh; you ſay this land belongs to you, but there is not the black of my nail yours. I ſaw that land ſooner than you did, before the Shannoahs and you were at war: Lead was the man who went down and took poſſeſſion of that river: It is my land, and I will have it, let who will ſtand up for or ſay againſt it. I'll buy and ſell with the Engliſh (mockingly.) If people will be ruled by me, they may expect kindneſs, but not elſe."</p>

                        <p>He informed me that they had built two

                        <p>The Indians enquired very particular after their brothers in Carolina jail.</p>
                        <p>They alſo aſked what fort of a boy it was who was taken from the South Branch; for they were told by ſome Indians, that a party of French Indians had carried a white boy by Kuſkuſkas Town, towards the lakes.</p>
                        <p>November 26, 1753, we met in council, at the Long Houſe, at about 9 o'clock, where I ſpake to them as follows:—</p>

                        <p>"I was deſired, brothers, by your brother, the governor, to call upon you, the ſachems of the nations, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

                        <p>"His honour likewiſe deſired me to apply to you for ſome of your young men, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and provide proviſions for us on our way; and be a ſafeguard againſt thoſe <hi>French Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> who have taken up the hatchet againſt us. I have ſpoke this particularly to you, brothers, becauſe his honour, our governor, treats you as good friends and allies; and holds you in great eſteem. To confirm what I have ſaid, I give this ſtring of wampum."</p>
                        <p>After they had conſidered for ſome time on the above diſcourſe, the half-king got up and ſpoke:— "Now my brother, in regard to what my brother the governor had deſired me, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn you this anſwer.</p>
                        <p>"I rely upon you as a brother ought to do, as you ſay we are brothers and one people. We ſhall put heart in hand, and ſpeak to our fathers the French concerning the ſpeech they made to me: and you may depend that we will endeavour to be your guard.</p>
                        <p>"Brother, as you have aſked my advice, I hope you will be ruled by it, and ſtay till I can provide a company to go with you. The <hi>French</hi> ſpeech belt is not here. I have it to

                        <p>"I intend to ſend the guard of <hi>Mingos, Shannoahs, and Delawares,</hi> that our brothers may ſee the love and loyalty we bear them."</p>
                        <p>As I had orders to make all poſſible diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch, and waiting here was very contrary to my inclination, I thanked him in the moſt ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble manner I could; and told him that my buſineſs required the greateſt expedition, and would not admit of delay.

Beſides, ſays he, this is a matter of no ſmall moment, and muſt not be entered into without due con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration: for now I intend to deliver up the French ſpeech belt, and make the Shannoahs and Delawares do the ſame.

                        <p>I gave them back a ſtring of wampum, which I met with at Mr. Frazier's, and which they ſent with a ſpeech to his honour the governor, to inform him, that three na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of French Indians, viz Chippoways, Ottoways, and Orundaks; had taken up the hatchet againſt the Engliſh; and deſired them to repeat it over again: but this they poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned doing till they met in full council with the Shannoah and Delaware chiefs.</p>
                        <p>27th. Runners were diſpatched very early for the Shannoah chiefs. The half-king ſet out himſelf to fetch the French ſpeech belt from his hunting cabbin.</p>

                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>katoocha informed me, that an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian from Venango brought news, a few days ago, that the French had called all the Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gos, Delawares, &amp;c. together at that place;
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:037222_0012_100C97CACEFF5EE8"/>and told them that they intended to have been down the river this fall, but the waters were growing cold, and the winter advancing, which obliged them to go into quarters; but that they might aſſuredly expect them in the ſpring, with a far greater number; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired that they might be quite paſſive, and not to intermeddle, unleſs they had a mind to draw all their force upon them: for that they expected to ſight the Engliſh three years (as they ſuppoſed there would be ſome attempts made to ſtop them) in which time they ſhould conquer: but that if they ſhould prove equally ſtrong, they and the Engliſh, would join to cut them all off, and divide the land between them: that though they had loſt their general, and ſome ſew of their ſoldiers, yet there were men enough to reinforce them, and make them maſters of the Ohio.</p>
                        <p>This ſpeech, he ſaid, was delivered to them by one captain Joncaire, their interpreter in chief, living at Venango, and a man of note in the army.</p>
                        <p>29th. The half king and Monokatoocha came very early and begged me to ſtay one day more; for netwithſtanding they had uſed all the diligence in their power, the Shannoah chiefs had not brought the wampum they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="24" facs="unknown:037222_0013_100C97CEAC7F6B20"/>not, they would delay me no longer, but would ſend it after us as ſoon as they arrived. When I found them ſo preſſing in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, and knew that the returning of wam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pum was the aboliſhing of agreements, and giving this up, was ſhaking off all dependence upon the French. I conſented to ſtay, as I believed an offence offered at this criſis, might be attended with greater ill conſequence than another day's delay. They alſo informed me that Shingiſs could not get in his men; and was prevented from coming himſelf by his wife's ſickneſs, (I believe, by fear of the French) but that the wampum of that nation was lodged with Kuſtaloga one of their chiefs at Venango.</p>
                        <p>In the evening, late, they came again and acquainted me that the Shannoahs were not yet arrived, but that it ſhould not retard the proſecution of our journey. He delivered in my hearing, the ſpeeches that were to be made to the French by Jeſkakake, one of their old chiefs which was giving up the belt the late commandant had aſked for, and repeating near the ſame ſpeech he himſelf had done before.</p>
                        <p>He alſo delivered a ſtring of wampum to this chief who was ſent by king Shingiſs, to

                        <p>He likewiſe gave a very large ſtring of black and white wampum which was to be ſent up immediately to the ſix nations, if the French refuſed to qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>30th. Laſt night the great men aſſembled at their council houſe, to conſult further about this jonrney, and who were to go: the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of which was, that only three of their chiefs, with one of their beſt hunters, ſhould be our convoy. The reaſon they gave for not ſending more, after what had been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed at council the 26th, was, that a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er number might give the French ſuſpicions of ſome bad deſign, and cauſe them to be treated rudely: but I rather think they could not get their hunters in.</p>
                        <p>We ſet out about 9 o'clock with the half king, Jeſkakake, White Thunder, and the Hunter; and travelled on the road to the Venango, where we arrived the 4th of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember, without any thing remarkable hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening, but a continued ſeries of bad wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                        <p>This is an old Indian town, ſituated at the mouth of French Creek on Ohio; and
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:037222_0014_100C97D09058D080"/>lies near N. about ſixty miles from the Loggs town, but more than ſeventy the way we were obliged to go.</p>
                        <p>We found the French colours hoiſted at a houſe from which they had driven Mr. John Frazier, an Engliſh ſubject. I imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately repaired to it, to know where the commander reſided. There were three of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, one of whom, captain Joncaire, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed me, that he had the command of the Ohio: but that there was a general of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer at the near fort, where he adviſed me to apply for an anſwer. He invited us to ſup with them; and treated us with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt complaiſance.</p>
                        <p>The wine, as they dozed themſelves pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty plentifully with it, ſoon baniſhed the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint which at firſt appeared in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation; and gave a licenſe to their tongues to reveal their ſentiments more freely.</p>

The tirſt of them is on French Creek, near a ſmall Lake, about ſixty miles from Venango, near N. N. W. The next lies on Lake Erie, where the greater part of their ſtores are kept, about fifteen miles from the other. From this it is one hundred and twenty miles to the carrying place, at the falls of Lake Erie, where there is a ſmall fort; which they lodge their goods at, in bringing them from Montreal, the place whence all their ſtores come from. The next fort lies about twenty miles from this, on Ontario Lake. Between this fort and Montreal there are three others, the firſt of which is nearly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to the Engliſh fort Oſwego. From the fort on Lake Erie to Montreal is about ſix hundred miles, which they ſay requires no more, if good weather, than four week's voyage, if they go in barks or large veſſels,

                        <p>5th. Rained exceſſively all day, which prevented our travelling. Captain Joncaire ſent for the half king, as he had but juſt heard that he came with me: he affected to be much concerned that I did not make free to bring them in before. I excuſed it in the beſt manner I was capable, and told him, I did not think their company agreeable, as I had heard him ſay a good deal in diſpraiſe of Indians in general. But another motive prevented me from bringing them into his company: I knew he was interpreter, and a perſon of very great influence among the Indians, and had lately uſed all poſſible means to draw them over to their intereſt; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I was deſirous of giving no opportunity that could be avoided.</p>
                        <p>When they came in, there was great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure expreſſed at ſeeing them. He wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed how they could be ſo near without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to viſit him; made ſeveral triſing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents; and applied liqour ſo faſt, that they were ſoon rendered incapable of the buſineſs they came about, notwithſtanding the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which was given.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="29" facs="unknown:037222_0015_100C97D2A6A036D0"/>
6th. The half king came to my tent, quite ſober, and inſiſted very much that I ſhould ſtay and hear what he had to ſay to the French. I fain would have prevented his ſpeaking any thing, till he came to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandant; but could not prevail. He told me, that at this place a council fire was kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled, where all their buſineſs with thoſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was to be tranſacted: and that the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of the Indian affairs was left ſole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to monſieur Joncaire. As I was deſirous of knowing the iſſue of this, I agreed to ſtay: but ſent our horſes a little ways up French Greck, to raſt over and encamp; which I knew would make it near night.</p>
                        <p>About ten o'clock they met in council. The king ſpoke much the ſame as he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore done to the general; and offered the French ſpeech belt which had before been demanded with the marks of four towns on it, which monſieur Joncaire refuſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive; but deſired him to carry it to the fort to the commander.</p>
                        <p>7th. Monſieur La Force, commiſſary of the French ſtores, and three other ſoldiers, came over to accompany us up. We ſound it extremely difficult to get the Indians off to-day, as every ſtratagem had been uſed to prevent their going up with me. I had laſt
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:037222_0016_100C97D4E288AED8"/>night left John Daviſon (the Indian interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) whom I had brought with me from town, and ſtrictly charged him not to be out of their company, as I could not get them over to my tent: for they had ſome buſineſs with Kuſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loga, chiefly to know the reaſon why he did not deliver up the French belt which he had in keeping: but I was obliged to ſend Mr. Giſt over to-day to fetch them; which he did with great perſuaſion.</p>
                        <p>At twelve o'clock we ſet out for the fort, and were prevented from arriving there till the 11th, by exceſſive rains, ſnows, and bad travelling, through many mires and ſwamps. Theſe we were obliged to paſs, to avoid croſſing the creek, which was impoſſible ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by fording or rafting, the water was ſo high and rapid.</p>
                        <p>We paſſed over much good land ſince we left Venango, and through ſeveral extenſive and very rich meadows; one of which, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, was near four miles in length, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably wide in ſome places.</p>
                        <p>12th. I prepared early to wait upon the commander, and was received and conducted to him by the ſecond oſſicer in command. I acquainted him with my buſineſs, and oſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my commiſſion and letter: both of which he deſired me to keep till the arrival of mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:037222_0016_100C97D4E288AED8"/>Raparti, captain, at the next fort, who was ſent for, and expected every hour.</p>
                        <p>This commander is a knight of the milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry order of St. Lewis, and named Legardeur de St. Piere. He is an elderly gentleman, and has much the air of a ſoldier. He was ſent over to take the command, immediately upon the death of the late general, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived here but about ſeven days before me.</p>
                        <p>At two o'clock the gentleman who was ſent for arrived, when I offered the letter, &amp;c. again; which they received, adjourned into a private apartment for the captain to tranſlate, who underſtood a little Engliſh. After he had done it, the commander deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed I would walk in, and bring my interpreter to peruſe and correct it; which I did.</p>
                        <p>13th. The chief oſſicers retired, to hold a council of war; which gave me an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of taking the dimenſions of the fort, and making what obſervations I could.</p>
                        <p>It is ſituated on the ſouth, or weſt fork of French creek, near the water; and is almoſt ſurrounded by the creek, and a ſmall branch of it which forms a kind of iſland. Four houſes compoſe the ſides. The baſtions are made of piles driven into the ground, ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more than twelve feet above it, and ſharp at the top; with port holes cut for
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:037222_0017_100C97D709990BE8"/>cannon and loop holes for the ſmall arms to mounted in each baſtion; and one piece of four pounds before the gate. In the baſtions are a guard houſe, chapel, doctor's lodging, and the commander's private ſtore; round which are laid platforms for the cannon and men to ſtand on. There are ſeveral barracks without the fort for the ſoldiers' dwelling; covered, ſome with bark, and ſome with boards, made chiefly of logs. There are alſo ſeveral other houſes, ſuch as ſtables, ſmith's ſhop, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>I could get no certain account of the number of men here; but according to the be judgment I could form, there are an hundred excluſive of oſſicers, of which there are many. I alſo gave orders to the people who were with me, to take an exact ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the canoes which were hauled up to convey their ſorces down in the ſpring. This they did, and told fifty of birch bark, and one hundred and ſeventy of pine; beſides many others which were blocked out, in readineſs to make.</p>
                        <p>14th. As the ſnow increaſed very faſt, and our horſes daily became weaker, I ſent them off unloaded; under the care of Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Currin, and two others, to make all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:037222_0017_100C97D709990BE8"/>diſpatch to Venango, and there wait our arrival, if there was a proſpect of the river's freezing; if not, then to continue down to Shannapin's town, at the forks of the Ohio, and there to wait till we came to croſs Aligany; intending myſelf to go down by water, as I had the offer of a canoe or two.</p>
                        <p>As I found many plots concerted to retard the Indians' buſinefs, and prevent their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning with me; I endeavoured all that lay in my power to fruſtrate their ſchemes and hurry them on to execute their intended de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. They accordingly preſſed for admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance this evening, which at length was granted them, privately, with the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and one or two other officers. The half king told me, that he offered the wampum to the commander, who evaded taking it, and made many fair promiſes of love and friendſhip; ſaid he wanted to live in peace, and trade amicably with them, as a proof of which he would ſend ſome goods immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly down to the Loggs town for them. But I rather think the deſign of that is, to bring away all our ſtraggling traders they meet with, as I privately underſtood they intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to carry an officer, &amp;c. with them. And what rather confirms this opinion, I was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring of the commander, by what autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:037222_0018_100C97D8F1C8FEC0"/>he had made priſoners of ſeveral of cur Engliſh ſubjects. He told me that the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try belonging to them; no Engliſhman had a right to trade upon thoſe waters; and that he had orders to make every one pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner who attempted it on the Ohio, or the waters of it.</p>
                        <p>I enquired of captain Riparti about the boy who was carried by this place, as it was done while the command devolved on him between the death of the late general, and the arrival of the preſent. He acknowledged that a boy had been carried paſt; and that the Indians had two or three white men's ſcalps, (I was told by ſome of the Indians at Venango eight) but pretended to have forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the name of the place which the boy came from, and all the particularfacts, though he had queſtioned him for ſome hours, as they were carrying him paſt. I likewiſe enquired what they had done with John Trotter and James Mac Clocklin, two Pennſylvania traders, whom they had taken, with all their goods. They told me, that they had been ſent to Canada, but were now returned home.</p>
                        <p>This evening I received an anſwer to his honour the governor's letter from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandant.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="35" facs="unknown:037222_0018_100C97D8F1C8FEC0"/>
15th. The commandant ordered a plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſtore of liquor, proviſion, &amp;c. to be put on board our canoe; and appeared to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely complaiſant, though he was exerting every artifice which he could invent to ſet our own Indians at varience with us, to prevent their going until alter our departure. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, rewards, and every thing which could be ſuggeſted by him or his officers. I can<hi rend="sup">3</hi>: ſay that ever in my life I ſuffered ſo much anxiety as I did in this affair: I ſaw that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtratagem which the moſt ſruitful brain could invent, was practiſed, to win the half king to their intereſt; and that leaving him here was giving them the opportunity they aimed at. I went to the half king and preſs'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I then went to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandant, and deſired him to do their buſineſs; and complained of ill treatment: For keeping them, as they were part of my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, was detaining me. This he promiſed not to do, but to forward my journey as much as he could. He proteſted he did not keep them, but was ignorant of the cauſe of their ſtay; though I ſoon found it out:—He had promiſed them a preſent of guns, &amp;c. if they would wait till the morning. As I was very much preſs'd by the Indians to wait this day for
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:037222_0019_100C97DBF3B93600"/>them, I conſented, on a promiſe, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhould hinder them in the morning.</p>
                        <p>16th. The Erench were not ſlack in their inventions to keep the Indians this day alſo: But as they were obligated according to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, to give the preſent, they then endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to try the power of l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

We took this fellow into cuſtody, and kept him until about 9 o'clock at night: Then let him go, and walked all the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part of the night without making any ſtop; that we might get the ſtart, ſo far, as to be out of the reach of their purſuit next day, ſince we were well aſſured they would ſollow our track as ſoon as it was light. The next day we continued travelling till quite dark, and got to the river about two miles above Shannapins. We expected to have found the river frozen, but it was not, only about 50 yards from each ſhore: The ice I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe had broken up above, for it was dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in vaſt quantities.</p>
                        <p>There was no way for getting over but on a raſt: which we ſet about, but with one poor hatcher, and finiſhed juſt after ſun ſetting.

But before we were half way over, we were jammed in the ice, in ſuch a manner that we expected every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment our raft to ſink, and ourſelves to periſh. I put out my ſetting pole to ſtop the raſt, that the ice might paſs by; when the rapidity of the ſtream threw it with ſo much violenc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>The cold was ſo extremely ſevere, that Mr. Giſt had all his fingers, and ſome of his toes frozen; and the water was ſhut up ſo hard, that we found no difficulty in getting off the iſland, on the ice, in the morning; and went to Mr. F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

We met here with twenty warriors who were going to the ſouthward to war: But coming to a place upon the head of the great Kunnaway, where they found ſeven people killed and ſcalped (all but one woman with very light hair) they turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout and ran back for fear the inhabitants ſhould riſe and take them as the authors of the murder. They report that the bodies were lying about the houſe, and ſome of them much torn and eaten by hogs: By the marks which were left, they ſay they were French Indians of the Ottoway nation, &amp;c. who did it.</p>
                        <p>As we intended to take horſes here, and it required ſome time to find them, I went up about three miles to the mouth of the Yaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yaugh gane to viſit Queen Alliquippa, who had expreded great co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                        <p>Tueſday the Iſt day of January, we left Mr. Frazier's houſe, and arrived at Mr. Giſt's at Monongahela the 2d, where I bought a horſe, ſaddle, &amp;c. The 6th we met 17 horſes loaded with materials and ſtores for a fort at the forks of Ohio, and the day after ſome familtes going out to ſettle: This day we arrived at Wills Creck, after as fatiguing a journey as it is poſſible to conceive, render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo by exceſſive bad weather.

                        <p>On the 11th I got to Belvoir; where I ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped one day to take neceſſary reſt; and then ſet out, and arrived in Williamſburg the 16th; when I waited on his honour the governor with the letter I had brought from the French commandant; and to give an account of the ſucceſs of my proceedings.

            <p>On his return from this perilous embaſſy, with monſieur de St. Piere's anſwer, and his good ſucceſs in the Indian negociations Maj. Waſhington was complimented with the thanks and approbation of his country. His Journal does great credit to his induſtry, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and judgment; and it has ſince prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of infinite ſervice to thoſe who have been doomed to traverſe the ſame inhoſpitable tracts.</p>
            <p>Governor Dinwiddie's letter to the French commandant and M. de St. Piere's anſwer were both publiſhed in the newſpapers in London. The French commandants anſwer, only ſtated that he was on French ground,
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:037222_0022_100C97E20FD15100"/>and by the order of his general to whom he was going to diſpatch the governor's letter.</p>
            <p>In 1754, the deſigns of the French be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming more manifeſt, and their movements more daring, orders were iſſued by admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration for the colonies to arm and unite in one confederacy. The aſſembly of Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia took the lead, by voting a ſum of money for the public ſervice, and raiſing a regiment for the protection of the frontiers of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony. Of this corps, Mr. Fry, one of the profeſſors of the college was appointed Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel, and Major Waſhington received the commiſſion of Lieutenant Colonel. Hut Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel Fry died without ever having joined; and of courſe leſt his regiment to the ſecond in command. Colonel Waſhington began his march on the 2d. of April, from Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria, having under his command one hundred and fifty men. His orders were to march towards the Ohio, there to a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

               </gap>t captain Trent to build ſorts, and defend the poſſeſſions of his majeſty againſt the attempts and hoſtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the French. During his march he was joined by a ſmall detachment under com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of captain Stephens, and when he had proceeded as far as Wills-Creck, he receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed intelligence that captain Trent had been obliged to ſurrender the fort which he had
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:037222_0023_100C97E5A1A910C0"/>erected between the Ohio and French creek, to a body of about eight hundred French, commanded by captain Contrecoeur; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, Colonel Waſhington deeming it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable to march towards the fort without Fuſſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ient force, thought it moſt prudent to proceed to open roads ſo as to pre-occupy the advantageous poſt at the conſluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers, which in his preceding Journal he recommends for 01 that purpoſe. He was to have been joined by a detachment of independent regulars from the ſouthern colonies, together with ſome companies of Provincials from North Carolina and Maryland. But perceiving the neceſſity of expedition, and without waiting for their arrival, he commenced his march before they arrived; but, notwithſtanding his precipitated advance, the French had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready taken poſſeſſion and erected a fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which they named fort <hi>Du Quesne,</hi> in honour of the marquis du Queſne, the French governor of Canada.</p>
            <p>Colonel Waſhington accordingly proceeded on his march from Wills-Creek; bravely encountering all the obſlecles and difficulties of an impervious wilderneſs, croſſing mires, ſavannas and rivers. His men were ſome time, forced to ford rivers ſo deep as to
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:037222_0023_100C97E5A1A910C0"/>take them up to the arm-pits; when he had proceeded as far as Turkyfoot, he received inforination that a party of French com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by M. de Jumonville, were conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed within a ſhort diſtance of his camp; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, he ſecured his waggons and put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the beſt means of defence he was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of, until he had learned the ſtrength of the enemy, and the place where they were.</p>
            <p>Having received from the Indians the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary information, on the night of the 27th May, he ſet out with his men (except about forty, which was left to guard his ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, &amp;c.) and a party of Indians, which the half king ſent to his aſſiſtance, under a heavy rain, and a night dark as pitch, they travelled along a path ſcarcely broad enough for one man; they were ſometimes fifteen or twenty minutes out of the path before they could come to it again, and ſo dark, that they would often ſtrike one againſt another; all night they continued their ront, and in the morning about ſun-riſe, formed themſelves for an engagement, marching one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Indian manner, the enemy did not diſcover them until they were cloſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, when Colonel Waſhington's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany ſired, and was ſupported by Mr. Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger's;
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:037222_0024_100C97E730100038"/>theſe two companies received the whole ſire of the French, which laſted a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an hour before the enemy was routed out. M. de Jumonville and nine others were killed, one wounded, and twenty one made priſoners. Among the priſoners was the celebrated woodsman, monſieur de la Force, commiſſary of the French ſtores, and two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther officers. Only one of the whole party eſcaped. A Canadian, named Monceau, whoſe report of the action was ſuch, as to impreſs upon the minds of the French, a belief that Colonel Waſhington's conduct was highly treacherous and diſhonourable. The French account of this engagement is contained in a letter from M. de Contrecoeur to the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis du Queſne, dated Fort du Queſne, May 23d. 1754. It ſtates that M. de Jumonville ſet out with a ſmall eſcort, charged with a written ſummons, in form of a letter, direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the firſt Engliſh officer he ſhould meet on the lands claimed by the French king, ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moning him to withdraw his troops in peace from ſaid territory, otherwiſe that they would repel force to force, deſiring the Engliſh of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer to return his anſwer by M. de Jumon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville and to treat that officer with that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction and reſpect which he deſerved, that the deputy ſet out, and next morning found
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:037222_0024_100C97E730100038"/>himſelf ſurrounded by a number of Engliſh and Indians, that the Engliſh quicky fired two vollies, which killed ſome ſoldiers, that M. Jumonville made a ſign that he had a letter from his commander, whereupon the fire ceaſed, and the Engliſh ſurrounded the French officer, in order to hear it, that as he was reading the ſummons a ſecond time, he was killed by a muſket ſhot in the head, and, that, had it not been for the Indians, who ruſhed in between the French and the Engliſh, the former would have been all aſladinated; that the Indians did not fire upon the French. This report was made the moſt of by the French, who impreſſed it upon the minds of the ſurrounding Indians, as a moſt ſhocking and baſe murder, perpetrated by the expreſs command of Colonel Waſhington. But the following extract from Colonel Waſhington's Journal, of his proceedings given in to Gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernor Dinwiddie, places it in a quite differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent point of view, he ſtates, via, "We were advanced pretty near to them as we thought, when they diſcovered us; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, I ordered my company to fire, mine was ſupported by Mr. Wager's, and my company and his, received the whole fire or the French, during the greateſt part of the
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:037222_0025_100C97E8D03AE458"/>action, which only laſted a quarter of an hour, before the enemy was routed.</p>
            <p>"We killed Mr. de Jumonville, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of that Party, as alſo nine others; we wounded one, and made twenty-one pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, among whom were M. la Force, M. Drouillon, and two Cadets. The Indians ſcalped the dead, and took away moſt part of their arms, after which we marched on with the priſoners and the guard, to the Indian camp, where again I held a council with the Half-King; and there informed him that, the governor was deſirous to ſee him, and was waiting for him at Wincheſter; he anſwered, that, he could not go juſt then, as his people were in too eminent a danger from the French, whom they had fallen upon; that he muſt ſend meſſenges to all the allied nations, in order to invite them to take up the Hatchet. He ſent a young Delaware Indian to the Delaware Nation, and gave him alſo a French Scalp to carry to them. This young man deſired to have a part of the preſents which were allotted for them, but that the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part might be kept for another opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: He ſaid he would go to his own family, and to ſeveral others, and would wait on them at Mr. Giſt's, where he deſired men and horſes ſhould be ſent ready to bring them up to our
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:037222_0025_100C97E8D03AE458"/>camp. After this I marched on with the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners; They informed me that they had been font with a ſummons to order me to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part. A plauſible pretence to diſcover our camp, and to obtain the knowledge of our forces and our ſituation! It was ſo clear that they were come to reconnoitre what we were, that I admired at their aſſurance, when they told me they were come as an Embaſſy; for their inſtructions mentioned that they ſhould get what knowledge they could of the roads, rivers, and of all the country as far as Potowmack: And inſtead of c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ng as an Embaſſador, publicly, and in an open man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, they came ſecretly, and ſought after the moſt hidden retreats, more like deſerters than embaſſadors; in ſuch retreats they encamped, and remained hid whole days together, and that, no more than five miles from us: from thence they ſent ſpies to reconnoitre our camp; after this was done, they went back two miles, from whence the ſent the two meſſengers ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of in the inſtruction, to acquaint M. de Contrecoeur of the place we were at, and of our diſpoſition, that he might ſend his detatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to inforce the ſummons, as ſoon as i ſhould be given.</p>
            <p>"Beſides, an embaſlador has princely at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants; whereas this was only a ſimple
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:037222_0026_100C97EB686C30B8"/>petty French officer; an embaſſador has no need of ſpies, his character being always ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred: And ſeeing their intention was ſo good, why did they tarry two days, at five miles diſtance from us, without acquainting me with the ſummons, or, at leaſt, with ſome, thing that related to the embaſly? That a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone would be ſufficient to raiſe the greateſt ſuſpicions, we ought to do them the juſtice to ſay, that, as they wanted to hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they could not pick out better places than they had done.</p>
            <p>"The ſummons was ſo inſolent, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured the gaſconade ſo much, that if it had been brought openly by two men, it would have been an immediate indulgence, to have ſuffered them to return.</p>
            <p>"It was the opinien of the half king in this caſe, that their intentions were evil, and that it was a pure pretence; that they never intended to come tous but as onenies; and if we had been ſuch fools as to let them go, they would never help us any more to take other Frenchmen.</p>
            <p>"They ſay they called to us as ſoon as they had diſcovered us, which is an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute falſehood, for, I was then marching at the head of the company going towards them, and can poſitively affirm, that, when they
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:037222_0026_100C97EB686C30B8"/>firſt ſaw us, they ran to their arms, without calling; as I muſt have heard them, had they ſo done."</p>
            <p>From the French priſoners, Colonel Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington had intelligence, that the French forces on the Ohio conſiſted of upwards of one thouſand regulars, and ſome hundreds of Indians. Upon this intelligence, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering his little army which was ſomewhat reduced, and entirely inſufficient to act offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive againſt the French and Indians, he fell back to a place known by the appellation of the <hi>Great Meadows,</hi> for the ſake of forage and ſupplies. Here he built a temporary ſtockade, merely to cover his ſtores; it was from its fate called <hi>Fort Necessity.</hi> Colonel Waſhington was too ſendi le of the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of Fort du Queſne, to abandon the idea of taking it. Ever ſince he leſt Wills-creek, he had been indefatigable in his exertions to form the regiment, open roads, and gain the Indians over to the ſide of the Engliſh, as alſo to watch the operations of the French, and gain a knowledge of their ſorts, ſituation, and forces, even as far as the lakes. He had wrote to the Governors of Pennſylvania and Maryland, requeſting their aid in the augmentation of his army. He remained at Fort Neceſſity for the arrival of ſome expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:037222_0027_100C97EDD07568D0"/>ſuccour from New York and Penaſylvania, and remained un moleſted, until the July ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, when his ſmall ſorce, even after it was joined by captain M'Kay's regulars did not amount to four hundred effectives, was attacked by an army of French and Indians, computed to have been ſixteen hundred ſtrong, under the command of the Sieur de Villiers, the brother of M. de Jumonville. The chief intention of this campaign, the French officer acknowledged, was to revenge the aſſaſſination of his brother, and to hinder any eſtabliſhments on the lands claimed by the king of France.</p>
            <p>The Virginians ſuſtained the attack of the enemy's whole force for ſeveral hours, and laid near two hundred of them dead in the field, when the French commander, diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by ſuch determined reſolution, propoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the leſs dangerous method of diſlodging his enemy by a parly, which ended in a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulation. It was ſtipulated, that Colonel Waſhington ſhould march away with all the honours of war, and be allewed to carry off all his military ſtores, eſſects and baggage. This capitulation was violated from the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>governable diſpoſition of the Indians, whom the French commander could not reſtrain from plundering the provinclas on the outſet
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:037222_0027_100C97EDD07568D0"/>of their march, and from making a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſlaughter of men, cattle and horſes. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this diſaſter the remains of the Virginia regiment returned to Alexandria to be recruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edand furniſh with neceſſary ſupplies: During this period, the French redoubled their activity and deligence on the Ohio, and in other places, and Virginia who determined to ſend out a larger force, in the ſpring follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, erected the forts Cumberland and Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and formed a camp at Wills-creek, in order to annoy the enemy on the Ohio. In theſe ſeveral ſervices (particularly in the conſtruction of forts) Colonel Waſhington was principally employed.</p>
            <p>In 1755, the Britiſh government ſent to this county, General braddock, who was appointed to the command of all the troops and forces which were, or that ſhould be raiſed in, or ſent to, North America; he land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at Williamſburg, Virginia, in February, with two veteran regiments from Ireland, but ſent his men up the Potomack to Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria, there to encamp until he was joined with the independent and provincial corps of America; with this army he was to pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate through the country to fort Da Queſne (now fort Pitt) by the rout of Wills-creek to repel the French from the confines of the
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:037222_0028_100C97F079E00658"/>Britiſh ſettlements, and as no perſon was was better acquainted with the frontier country than Coloned Waſhington, and no one in the colony enjoyed ſo well eſtabliſhed a military character, he was judged to be highly ſerviceable to General Braddock, but from a royal arrangement of rank, by which "no officer who did not immediately derive his commiſſion from the king, could command one who did." Colonel Waſhington cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly relinquiſhed his regiment and went as a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In this capacity, at the battle of the Monongahela, on the oth of July, 1755, he attended that General, whoſe life was gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantly ſacraficed in attempting to extricate his troops from the fatal ambuſcade into which him over-weaning confidence had conducted them. Braddock had ſeveral horſes ſhot under him, before he feli himſelf; and there was not as officer, whoſe duty obliged him to be on horſe-back that day, excepting Colonel Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington, who was not either killed or wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. This circumſtance enabled him to diſplay greater abilities in covering the retreat and ſaving the wreck of the army, than he could otherwiſe have done. As ſoon as he had ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured their paſſage over the ford of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nongahela, and found they were not purſued
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:037222_0028_100C97F079E00658"/>he haſted to concert meaſures for their further ſecurity with Colonel Dunbar, who had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained with the ſecond diviſion and heavy baggage at ſome diſtance in the rear. To effect this he travelled with two guides, all night, through an almoſt impervious wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, not withſtanding the fatigues he had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone in the day, and although he had ſo imperfectly recovered from ſickneſs, that he was obliged in the morning to be ſupported with cuſhions on his horſe. The public ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts in Britain and America were not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimonious of applauſe for the eſſential ſervice he had rendered on ſo trying an occaſion.</p>
            <p>Not long after this time, the regulation of rank, which had been ſo injurious to the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial officers, was changed to their ſatisfaction, in conſequence of the diſcontent of the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and the remonſtrance of Colonel Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington; and the ſupreme power of Virginia, impreſſed with a due ſenſe of his merits, gave him, in a new and extenfive commiſſion, the command of all the troops raiſed and to be raiſed in that colony.</p>
            <p>It would not comport with the intended brevity of this ſketch, to mention in detail the plans he ſuggeſted or the ſyſtem he purſued for deſending the frontiers, until the year 1758, when he commanded the van brigade
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:037222_0029_100C97F25A583B70"/>of General Forbe's army in the capture of Fort Du Queſne. A ſimilar reaſon will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the recital of the perſonal hazards and atchievements which happened in the courſe of his ſervice. The tranquility on the fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers of the middle colonies having been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored by the ſucceſs of this campaign, and the health of Colonel Waſhington having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come extrentely debilitated by an inveterate pulmonary complaint, in 1759 he reſigned his military appointment. Authentie documents are not wanting to ſhew the tender regret which the Virginia line expreſſed at parting with their commander, and the affectionate regard which he entertained for them.</p>
            <p>Shortly after Colonel Waſhington's reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, his health was gradually re-eſtabliſhed and he, married Mrs. Cuſtis <note n="*" place="bottom">General and Mrs. Waſhington were both born in the ſame year.</note>, an amiable young widow, ſaid to have poſſeſſed a fortune of twenty thouſand pounds ſtarling (about 88,900 dollars) in her own right, beſides her dower in one of the principal eſlates in Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia. With this lady Colonel Waſhington ſettled as a planter and farmer on his eſtate in Fairfax county, Virginia.</p>
            <p>After ſome years he gave up planting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco, and went altogether into the farming
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:037222_0029_100C97F25A583B70"/>buſineſs. He has raiſed ſeven thouſand buſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of wheat, and ten thouſand of Indian corn in one year. Although he has confined his own cultivation to this domeſtic tract of about mine thouſand acres, yet he poſſeſſes excellent lands, in large quantities, in ſeveral other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. His judgment in the quality of ſoils, his command of money to avail himſelf of purchaſes, and his occaſional employment in early liſe as a ſurveyor, gave him opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of making advantageous locations; many of which are much improved.</p>
            <p>Aſter he leſt the army, until the year 1774, he thus cultivated the arts of peace. He was conſtantly a member of aſſembly, a magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate of his county and a judge of the court, At this period he was appointed by the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of Virginia, in conformity with the univerſal wiſh of the people, to be one of their four delegates at the firſt General Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of delegates from all the provinces, which net at Philadelphia on the 26th of October, 1774, and conſilted of fiſty-one members. It was with no ſmall reluctance that he engaged again in the active ſcenes of life; and we incerely believe that no motives but ſuch as ſpring from the moſt diſintereſted patriotiſm, ſould have prevailed upon him to relinquiſh the moſt reſined domeſtic pleaſure, which it
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:037222_0030_100C97F423B69018"/>was ever in his power to command, and the great delight he took in farming and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of his eſtate.</p>
            <p>He was alſo appointed delegate to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs which aſſembled in 1775, in which in was at length determined, after every ſtep t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>His conduct as a general and commander in chief is well known. He underwent ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hardſhips, dangers and difficulties and con
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:037222_0032_100C97F9D258E640"/>ducted his military operations with much ſkill and ability.</p>
            <p>It would not comport with the intended brevity of the preſent memoirs, for us to particularize, all his tranſactions in the courſe of the revolutionary war, the impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which they made, is yet freſh in the mind of every citizen, they are alſo ſo inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately connected with the American revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a hiſtory of which will perhaps ſoon be preſented to the public, from the modeſt pen of the hero himſelf, <note n="*" place="bottom">We learn that General Waſhington has leſt, in his legacy to Judge Waſhington, a Hiſtory of the American Revolution, written by himſelf, accompanied with all the important documents.</note> which will, no doubt, place the whole in a more eminent point of view than has heretoſore appeared.</p>
            <p>But it is hoped, poſterity will be taught, in what manner he transformed an undiſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plined body of peaſantry into a regular army of ſoldiers. Commentaries on his cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paigns would undoubtedly be highly intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and inſtructive to future generations. The conduct of his firſt campaign, in March, 1776, in compelling the Britiſh troops to abandon Boſton, by a bloodleſs victory, will merit a minute narration. But a volume would ſcarcely contain the mortifications he
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:037222_0032_100C97F9D258E640"/>experienced, and the hazards to which he was expoſed in the years 1776 and 1777, in contending againſt the proweſs of Britain, with an inadequate force. Her armies were far ſuperior to his in number, well organized and diſciplined, inured to a camp life, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by officers well experienced in mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary tacticks, and aided by powerful fleets, while his was compoſed of raw and undiſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plined peaſants, "juſt dragged from the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſcenes of domeſtic life—unaccuſtomed to the din of arms—totally unacquainted with every kind of military ſkill,"—unſed to the ſubordination ſo eſſentially requiſite in an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and often in want of arms, amunition, cloaths, and even food; often expoſed to the inclemency of the weather, in the moſt vig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orous ſeaſons, without tents or even a blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, and diſcouraged by the want of regular pay. Theſe circumſtances fully account for the unſucceſsful iſſue of his firſt campaigns.</p>
            <p>The battle of Long-Iſland was fought in Auguſt, 1776; his army were driven from their poſts by the Britiſh; above two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Americans fell on the field, and about half that number were taken priſoners. Fort Waſhington on York-Iſland, ſurrendered ſoon after, with two thouſand priſoners: Deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſickneſs added to his misfortunes.
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:037222_0033_100C97FBD3C94EC0"/>His army, which, at the time Lord Howe landed on Long-Iſland, amounted to twenty-five thouſand men, was now reduced to about one eighth part of the number.</p>
            <p>The approach of winter happily checked the progreſs of the enemy. General Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington's perſeverance and intrepidity, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved this circumſtance into important ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages. At Trenton, on the morning of the twenty-ſixth of December, he ſurpriſed a body of the enemy's troops, who, finding themſelyes ſurrounded, without further re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, agreed to lay down their arms.— Twenty-five oſſicers, and nearly one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſoldiers were made priſoners; while the American army had only four or five men wounded.</p>
            <p>On the third of January following, at Princeton, he made another ſucceſsful at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, there he took three hundred priſoners. Theſe enterpriſes cheered the drooping ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of his men, and again added reputation to the American arms. He afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired to Morriſtown, and remained during the winter, with an inferior force, but with ſuperior ſkill, checking the enemy from any further encroachments in that part of the country. We ſhall not enter into a minute deſcription of the various battles and ſkir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes,
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:037222_0033_100C97FBD3C94EC0"/>in which he was perſonally engaged during the campa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>gn of 1777. At the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of Brandywine, he made a gallant reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, but was at laſt forced to quit his ground with the loſs of about twelve hundred men killed, wounded, or taken priſoners. At Germantown he was repulſed with the loſs of ſix hundred killed or wounded, and about four hundred priſoners. He afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired to winter quarters at Valley Forge. His army was at this time in a moſt miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble condition, marching, without ſtockings or ſhoes, over the frozen ground, their feet were ſo gaſhed, that their ſteps were marked with blood: Some hundreds of them were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blankets; and in this condition they were in the middle of winter, to ſit down in a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, and build buts for a ſhelter. The deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titute ſituation of the American army at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and cauſed frequent deſertion. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, nothing but the good deſtiny and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate prudence of the commander in chief, prevented want of ſucceſs from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:037222_0034_100C97FD91271148"/>want of confidence on the part of the public; for want of ſucceſs is apt to lead to the adoption of pernicious counſels, through the levity of the people or the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of their demagogues. In the three ſucceeding years, the germ of diſcipline un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded; and the reſources of America hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been called into co-operation with the land and naval armies of France, produced the glorious concluſion of the campaign in 1781.

<pb n="67" facs="unknown:037222_0034_100C97FD91271148"/>the moſt proper man on this continent, and probably any where elſe, to be placed at the head of an American Army. The very high eſtimation he ſtood in for integrity and honour, his engaging in the cauſe of his country from ſentiment and a conviction of her wrongs, his moderation in politics, his extenſive property, and his approved abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as a commander, were motives which neceſſarily obliged the choice of America to fall upon him.</p>
            <p>That nature had given him extraordinary military talents, will hardly be controverted by his moſt bitter enemies; and having been early actuated with a warm paſſion to ſerve his country in the military line, he has greatly improved them by unwearied induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and a cloſe application to the beſt wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters upon tacticks, and by a more than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon method and exactneſs; and, in reality, when it comes to be conſidered, that at firſt he only headed a body of men entirely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with military diſcipline or opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſomewhat ungovernable in temper, and who at beſt could only be ſtiled an alert and good militia, acting under very ſhort enliſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, unclothed, unaccoutred, and at all times very ill ſupplied with ammunition and artillery; and that with ſuch an army he
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:037222_0035_100C97FFDC0CC558"/>withſtood the ravages and progreſs of nearly forty thouſand veteran troops, plentifully provided with every neceſſary article, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the braveſt officers in Europe, and ſupported by a very powerful navy which effectually prevented all movements by wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; when, we ſay, all this comes to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially conſidered, we think we may ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to pronounce, that General Waſhington will be regarded by mankind as one of the greateſt military ornaments of the preſent age, and that his name will command the veneration of the lateſt poſterity.</p>
            <p>No perſon, but thoſe who had an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of viewing the continental army, can form any adequate idea of its imperfect ſtate when General Waſhington firſt aſſumed the command, nor was it without the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied application and perſeverance, which few men but him, could have undergone, that be was able to eſtabliſh that diſcipline which ultimately aided his ſucceſs. From the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod he firſt aſſumed the command, mutil the final diſſolution of the army, his care and anxiety for them continued.

                  <p>"IT gives me great pain to be obliged to ſolicit the attention of the honorable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs to the ſtate of this army, in terms which imply the ſlighteſt apprehenſion of being ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected But my ſituation is inexpreſſibly diſtreſſing, to ſee the winter faſt approaching upon a naked army; the time of their ſervice within a few weeks of expiring; and no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion yet made for ſuch important events. Added to theſe the military cheſt is totally exhauſted: the pay maſter has not a ſingle dollar in hand: the commiſſary general aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures me he has ſtrained his credit, for the ſubſiſtence of the army, to the utmoſt. The quarter-maſter-general is preciſely in the ſame ſituation; and the greater part of the troops
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:037222_0036_100C98018E3B1100"/>are in a ſtate not far from mutiny, upon the deduction from their ſtated allowance. I know not to whom I am to impute this fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure: but I am of opinion, if the evil is no immediately remedied, and more punctually obſerved in future, the army muſt abſolutely break up. I hoped I had ſo fully expreſſed myſelf on this ſubject, (both by letter, and to thoſe members of the congr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>"DISAGREEABLE as it is to me and unpleaſing as it may be to Congreſs to multiply officers, I find myſelf under the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable neceſſity of aſking an increaſe of my aides-de-camp. The augmentation of my command, —the increaſe of my correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, —the orders to give, —the inſtructions to draw, —cut out more buſineſs than I am able to execute in time with propriety. The buſineſs of ſo many different departments centering with me, and by me to be handed on to Congreſs for their information, —added to the intercourſe I am obliged to keep up with the adjacent States, —and incidental oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences, —all of which require confidential and not hack writers to execute, —renders it impoſſible, in the preſent ſtate of things, for my fam to diſcharge the ſeveral duties ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected of me, with that preciſion and diſpatch that I could with.

                  <p>"AS my intelligence of late has been rather unfavorable, and would be received with anxiety and concern; peculiarly happy ſhould I oſteem myſelf, were it in my power at this time, to tranſmit ſuch information to congreſs as would be more pleaſing and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their wiſhes:—but, unfortunately for me, —unfortunately for them, —it is not.</p>
                  <p>"Our ſituation is truly diſtreſſing. The check our detachment ſuſtained on the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-ſeventh ultimo, has diſpirited t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>

<pb n="73" facs="unknown:037222_0037_100C98040420BF58"/>proportion of our troops, and filled their minds with apprehenſion and deſpair. The militia, inſtead of calling forth their utmoſt efforts to a brave and manly oppoſition in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to repair our loſſes, are diſmayed, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractable, and impatient to return. Great numbers of them have gone off, —in ſome inſtances, almoſt by whole regiments, by half ones, and by companies at a time. This circumſtance, of itſelf, independent of others, when fronted by a well-appointed enemy ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior in number to our whole collected force, would be ſufficiently diſagreeable: but, when their example has infected another part of the army, —when their want of diſcipline, and refuſal of almoſt every kind of reſtraint and government, have produced a like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct but too common to the whole, and an entire diſregard of that order and ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion neceſſary to the well-doing of an army, and which had been inculcated before, as well as the nature of our military eſtabliſhment would admit of, —our condition is ſtill more alarming: and with the deepeſt concern I am obliged to confeſs my want of confidence in the generality of the troops.</p>
                  <p>"All theſe circumſtances fully confirm the opinion I ever entertained, and which I more than once in my letters took the liberty of
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:037222_0038_100C9806C99D0B58"/>mentioning to congreſs, that no dependence could be put in a militia, or other troops than thoſe enliſted and embodied for a long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er period than our regulations heretofore have preſcribed. I am perſuaded, and as fully convinced as I am of any one fact that has happened, that our liberties muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity be greatly hazarded if not entirely loſt, if their defence is left to any but a perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent ſtanding army, —I mean, one to exiſt during the war. Nor would the expenſe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to the ſupport of ſuch a body of troops as would be competent to almoſt ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery exigency, far exceed that which is daily incurred by calling in ſuccour, and new en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtments, which, when effected, are not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with any good conſequences. Meo who have been free, and ſubject to no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trol, cannot been free, and ſubject to no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trol, cannot be reduced to order in an inſtant: and the privileges and exemptions they clain and will have, influence the conduct of oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; and the aid derived from them is nearly counterbalanced by the diſorder, irregulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and conſuſion they occaſion.</p>
                  <p>"I cannot find that the bounty of ten dollars is likely to produce the deſired effect, When men can get double that ſum to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage for a month or two in the militia, and that militia frequently called out, it is hardly
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:037222_0038_100C9806C99D0B58"/>to be expected. The addition of land might have a conſiderable inſluence on a permanent enliſtment."</p>

                  <p>"FROM the hours allotted to ſleep, I will borrow a few moments to convey my thoughts on ſundry important matters to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs. I ſhall offer them with the ſincerity which ought to characteriſe a man of candor, and with the freedom which may be uſed in giving uſeful information, without incurring the imputation of preſumption.</p>
                  <p>"We are now, as it were, upon the eve of another diſſolution of our army. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the difficulties which happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the occaſion laſt year, the conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which might have followed the change if proper advantages had been taken by the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emy, added to a knowledge of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent temper and ſituation of the troops, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect but a gloomy proſpect upon the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of things now, and fatisfy me beyond the poſſibility of d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="76" facs="unknown:037222_0039_100C980859AFBAB8"/>ſpeedy and effectual meaſures are adopted by congreſs, our cauſe will be loſt.</p>
                  <p>"It is in vain to expect that any or more than a trifling part of this army will again engage in the ſervice on the encouragement offered by congreſs, When men find that their townſmen and companions are receiving twenty, thirty, and more doliars, for a few months' ſervice (which is truly the caſe, it cannot be expected, without uſing compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and to force them into the ſer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>ce would anſwer no valuable purpoſe. When men are irritated, and the paſſions inſlamed, they fly haſtily and cheerfully to a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ms; but after the firſt emotions are over * * *, a ſoldier, reaſoned with upon the goodneſs of the cauſe he is engaged in, and the ineſtimable rights he is contending for, hears you with patience, and acknowledges the truth of your obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but adds, that it is of no more impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to him than others. The officer makes you the ſame reply, with this further remark, that his pay will not ſupport him, and he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ruin himſelf and tamily to ſerve his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, when every member of the community is equally intereſted and benefined by his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. * * *</p>
                  <p>"It becomes evidently clear then, that, as this conteſt is not likely to be the work of a
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:037222_0039_100C980859AFBAB8"/>day, —as the war muſt be carried on ſyſtema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically, —and to do it you muſt have good of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, —there are, in my judgment, no other poſſible means to obtain them but by eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing your army upon a permanent footing, and giving your oſſicers good pay. This will induce gentlemen and men of character to engage: and, till the bulk of your officers are compoſed of ſuch perſons as are actuated by principles of honor and a ſpirit of enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, you have little to expect from them. They ought to have ſuch allowances as will enable them to live like and ſupport the characters of gentlemen. * * * Beſides, ſomething is due to the man who puts his life in [<hi>your</hi>] hands, hazards his health, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſakes the ſweets of domeſtic enjoyment.

"The completion of the continental re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments is a matter of ſuch infinite impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that I think no means ſhould be left uneſſayed to accompliſh it. Draughting, where the powers of government are adequate, would be the ſpeedieſt and moſt effectual: but if it ſhould be thought unadviſeable to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt this mode, —next to it I would recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend that the buſineſs of recruiting ſhould be taken entirely out of the hands of the officers of the army, and that each State ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point ſome perſon of known activity (one for inſtance, who has been a good under-ſheriff) in each county or townſhip, not only to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruit, but to apprehend deſerters: theſe perſons to be liberally rewarded for each recruit, and deſerter whom they ſhall deliver, at ſtated peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ods and places, to officers appointed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, diſcipline, and march them to the army, —none of theſe recruiters to have the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt power to act out of their own diſtricts, but to be abſolutely fixed to them.</p>
                  <p>"A mode of this kind would, in my hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble opinion, be leſs burthen ſome to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic than the preſent, —prevent the idle habits which recruiting officers contract, not only injurious to themſelves, but to others, —the
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:037222_0044_100C9815758C09D0"/>moſt effectual means which can be deviſed or the recovery of deſerters, —the ſureſt way of keeping your regiments of equal ſtrength, and of making the duty more equal in the detail of it: in a word, many valuable advantages would reſult from it, whilſt I can ſuggeſt but one reaſon againſt it, —and that, (fully ſatisfied I am) when weighed in the ſcale of intereſt, will not operate, —I mean, the keeping ſo many officers in camp, who might be ſpared from the duties of the field till the regiments are ſtronger than at preſent. The ſixteen ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional regiments labor under ſuch diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages in ſome ſtates, as to render the interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of congreſs, in ſome ſhape or other, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſably neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>"With reſpect to food, conſidering we are in ſuch an extenſive and abundant country, no army was ever worſe ſupplied than ours, with many eſſential articles of it. Our ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, the greateſt part of laſt campaign and the whole of this, have ſcarcely taſted any kind of vegetables, —had but little ſalt;— and vinegar, which would have been a tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſubſtitute for vegetables, they have been in a great meaſure ſtrangers to. Neither have they been provided with proper drink: beer or cider ſeldom comes within the verge of the camp, and rum in much too ſmall quantities.
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:037222_0044_100C9815758C09D0"/>Thus, to devouring large quantities of animal food, untempered by vegetables or vinegar, or by any kind of drink but water, —and eating indifferent bread, (but for this laſt, a remedy is provided)—are to be aſcribed the many putrid diſeaſes incident to the army, and the lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able mortality that attended us laſt campaign. If theſe evils can be remedied, the expenſe and trouble ought not to be obſtacles. Though ſome kinds of vegetables are not to be had, others are, which, together with ſour krout and vinegar, might eaſily be had, if proper perſons acquainted with the buſineſs were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed therein.</p>
                  <p>"Soap is another article in great demand, the continental allowance is too ſmall: and, dear as every neceſſary of life is now got, a ſoldier's pay will not enable him to purchaſe; by which means his conſequent dirtineſs adds not a little to the diſeaſes of the army.</p>
                  <p>"I have no reaſon to accuſe the clothier-general of inattention to his department; and therefore, as his ſupplies are incompetent to the wants of the army. I am to ſuppoſe his reſources are unequal. Ought not each ſtate then to be called upon to draw ſuch ſupplies from the country manufactories, as can be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded? particularly of ſhoes, ſtockings, ſhirts and blankets, —articles indiſpenſably neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:037222_0045_100C98171BD38CE8"/>and of which ſcarce too many can be provided:—in the mean while every proviſion to be making, for clothing the troops uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly and warm in the winter. It is a maxim which needs no illuſtration, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be of more importance in an army, than the clothing and feeding it well. On theſe the health, comfort and ſpirits of the ſoldiers eſſentially depend; and it is a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy fact, that the American army are miſerably defective in both theſe reſpects. The diſtreſs moſt of them are in for want of clothing is painful to humanity, diſpiriting to themſelves, and diſcouraging to every officer. It makes every pretention to the preſervation of cleanlineſs impoſſible, expoſes them to a variety of diſorders, and abates or deſtroys that military pride without which nothing can be expected from any army,</p>
                  <p>"The conſequence of giving rank indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminately is much to be dreaded: great diſſatisfaction has already ariſen on account, of beſtowing this on officers in the civil de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments of the army, on the inſerior ſtaff, waggon-maſter, &amp;c. who, by cuſtom, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, and every other motive, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from it in all well-regulated armies. The too great liberality practiſed in this reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect will deſtroy the pride of rank where it
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:037222_0045_100C98171BD38CE8"/>ought to exiſt, and will not only render it cheap, but contemptible. It is the policy of all armies to make it valued and reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as a ſtimulus to emulation, and an incite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to bold and gallant undertakings: it muſt be very unadviſeable therefore, in our infant ſtate of war, to adopt novel cuſtoms to bring it it into diſcredit—which muſt and will be the conſequence of making it too common, beſides the diſguſt it creates in others.</p>
                  <p>"An auditor of accounts, to be conſtantly with the army, is abſolutely requiſite.

If the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had a channel of intelligence, that, from its uſual authenticity, they could look up to with confidence, they might often be preſerved from that deſpondency which they are apt to fall into from the exaggerated pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures our enemies and their emiſſaries among us commonly draw of any misfortunes we meet with, —and from that diffidence of truths favorable to us, which they muſt natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally feel from the frequent deception they are expoſed to, by the extravagant colourings our friends often give to our ſucceſſes. It would alſo be very uſeful to diſpatch buſineſs in camp, being the moſt expeditious means of taking copies of orders or other matters that require to be diſperſed, and would ſave a good deal in returns and other papers we are often obliged to get printed in Philadelphia. An ingenious man, to accompany this preſs, and be employed wholy in writing for it, might render it ſingularly beneficial.</p>
                  <p>"I am exceedingly embarraſſed how to diſpoſe of the French officers in general, but more eſpecially the artillery officers, who are come out under the ſanction of a compact.

                           <p>"I underſtand that the officers, engaged in the cauſe of liberty and their country, who by the fourtune of war, have fallen into your hands, have been thrown indiſcriminately in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a common jail, appropriated for felons—that no conſideration has been had for thoſe of the moſt reſpectable rank, when languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with wounds and ſickneſs—that ſome of them have been even amputated in this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy ſituation.</p>

But political opinions, I conceive, are fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign to this point, The obligations ariſing from the right of humanity and claims of rank, are univerſally binding and extenſive, except in caſe of retaliation.

<pb n="94" facs="unknown:037222_0048_100C981EF785BEC0"/>chance or war had put in your power.

                           <p>"TO the glory of civilized nations, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity and war have been compatible; and
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:037222_0048_100C981EF785BEC0"/>compaſſion to the ſubdued is become almoſt a general ſyſtem.</p>
                           <p>"Britons, ever pre-eminent in mercy; have outgone common examples, and overlooked the criminal in the captive. Upon theſe principles, your priſoners, whoſe lives, by the laws of the land, are deſtined to the cord, have hitherto been treated with care and kindneſs, and more comfortably lodged, than the king's troops, in the hoſpitals; indiſcrim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inately, it is true, for I acknowledge no rank that is not derived from the king.</p>
                           <p>"My intelligence from your army would juſtify ſevere recrimination, I underſtand there are ſome of the king's faithful ſubjects, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſome time ſince by the rebels, labouring like negro ſlaves, to gain their daily ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or reduced to the wretched alternative, to periſh by famine, or take arms againſt their king and country. Thoſe, who have made the treatment of the priſoners in my hands, or of your other friends in Boſton, a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence for ſuch meaſures, found barbarity up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſalſhood.</p>
                           <p>"I would willingly hope, ſir, that the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of liberality, which I have always be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved you to poſſeſs, will be exerted to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect their miſdoings.

I truſt, that Britiſh ſoldiers, aſſerting the rights of the ſtate, the laws of the land, the being of the conſtitution, will meet all events with becoming fortitude. They will court victory with the ſpirit their cauſe inſpires, and from the ſame motive will ſind the patience of martyrs under misfortune.</p>
                           <p>"Till I read your inſinuations in regard to miniſters, I conceived that I had acted under the king; whoſe wiſhes it is true, as well as thoſe of his miniſters, and of every honeſt man, have been to ſee this unhappy breach forever cloſed; but unfortunately for both countries, thoſe, who have long ſince projected the preſent criſis, and influence the councils of America, have views very diſtant from ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation.

                           <p>"I addreſſed you on the 11th inſtant in terms which gave the faireſt ſcope for the exerciſe of that humanity and politeneſs, which were ſuppoſed to form a part of your character. I remonſtrated with you on the unworthy treatment ſnewn to the officers and citizens of America, whom the fortune of war, chance, or a miſtaken confidence, had thrown into your hands.</p>
                           <p>"Whether Britiſh or American mercy, fortitude, and patience, are moſt pre-eminent, —whether our virtuous citizens, whom the hand of tyranny has forced into arms, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend their wives, heir children, and their property, or the mercenary inſtruments of lawleſs domination, avarice and revenge, beſt deſerve the appellation of rebels, and the puniſhment of that cord, which your affected clemency has forborn to inflict—whether the authority under which I act, is uſurped, or ſounded on the genuine principles of liberty, were altogether foreign to the ſubject. I purpoſely avoided all political diſquiſition, nor ſhall I now avail myſelf of thoſe advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, which the ſacred cauſe of my country,
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:037222_0050_100C9822E8CBB5D8"/>of liberty, and human nature, give me over you; much leſs ſhall I ſtoop to retort any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vective. But the intelligence, you ſay you have received from our army, requires a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply. I have taken time, ſir, to make a ſtrict enquiry, and find that it has not the leaſt foundation in truth. Not only your officers and ſoldiers have been treated with a tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs due to fellow-citizens and brethren, but even thoſe execrable paracides, whoſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils and aid have deluged their country with blood, have been protected from the fury of a juſtly enraged people. Far from compelling or permitting their aſſiſtance, I am embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſed with the numbers who croud to our camp, animated with the pureſt principles of virtue and love of their country. You adviſe me to give free operation to truth; to puniſh miſrepreſentation and falſhood. If experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſtamps value upon counſel, yours muſt have a weight which few can claim. You beſt can tell, how far the convulſion, which has brought ſuch ruin on both countries, and ſhaken the mighty empire of Britain to its foundation, may be traced to theſe malignant cauſes.</p>
                           <p>"You affect, ſir, to deſpiſe all rank, not derived from the ſame ſource with your own. I cannot conceive one more honorable, than
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:037222_0050_100C9822E8CBB5D8"/>that which flows from the uncorrupted choice of a brave and free people, the pureſt ſource and original fountain of all power.— Far from making it a plea for cruelty, a mind of true magnanimity and enlarged ideas, would comprehend and reſpect it.</p>
                           <p>"What may have been the miniſterial views which have precipitated the preſent criſis, Lexington, Concord, and Charleſtown, can beſt declare. May that God, to whom you then appealed, judge between America and you. Under his providence, thoſe who influence the councils of America, and all the other inhabitants of the united colonies, at the hazard of their lives, are determined to hand down to poſterity, thoſe juſt and invalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able privileges which they received from their anceſtors.</p>
                           <p>"I ſhall now, ſir, cloſe my correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with you, perhaps for ever. If your officers, our priſoners, receive a treatment from me, different from what I wiſhed to ſhew them, they and you will remember the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of it.</p>

<pb n="112" facs="unknown:037222_0057_100C982B21A91C78"/>them may be) and to bid them an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate —a long farewell.</p>
                        <p>But before the commander in chief takes his final leave of thoſe he holds moſt dear, he wiſhes to indulge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a few moments in calling to mind a ſlight review of the paſt—he will then take the liberty of exploring, with his military friends, their future proſpects, of adviſing the general line of conduct which, in his opinion, ought to be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued; and he will conclude the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, by expreſſing the obligations he feels himſelf under for the ſpirited and able aſſiſtance he has experienced from thern, in the performance of an ardu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous office.</p>
                        <p>A contemplation of the complete at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, at a period earlier than could have been expected, of the object for which we contended, againſt ſo formid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a power, cannot but inſpire us with aſtoniſhment and gratitude.

<pb n="113" facs="unknown:037222_0057_100C982B21A91C78"/>can never be forgotten. The ſingular interpoſitions of providence in our feeble condition, were ſuch as could ſcarcely eſcape the attention of the moſt unobſerving; while the unparalled perſeverance of the armies of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited States, through almoſt every poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fible ſuffering and diſcouragement, for the ſpace of eight long years, was little ſhort of a ſtanding miracle.</p>
                        <p>It is not the meaning, nor within the compaſs of this addreſs, to detail the hardſhips peculiarly incident to our ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, or to deſcribe the diſtreſſes, which, in ſeveral inſyances, have reſulted from the extremes of hunger and nakedneſs, combined with the rigors of an incle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeaſon; nor is it neceſſary to dwell on the dark ſide of our paſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs. Every American officer and ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier muſt now conſole himſelf for any unpleaſant circumſtances which may have occurred by the recollection of the uncommon ſcenes in which he has been called to act no inglorious part,
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:037222_0058_100C982CACC44808"/>and the aſtoniſhing events of which he has been a witneſs; events which have ſeldom, if ever before taken place on the ſtage of human action, nor can they probably ever happen again. For who has before ſeen a diſciplined army formed at once from ſuch raw materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als? Who that was not a witneſs, could imagine, that the moſt violent local prejudices would ceaſe ſo ſoon, and that men who came from the different parts of the continent, ſtrongly diſpoſed, by the habits of education, to deſpiſe and quarrel with each other, would inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly become but one patriotic band of brothers? or who that was not on the ſpot, can trace the ſteps, by which ſuch a wondcrful revolution has been effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſuch a glorious period put to all our warlike toils?</p>

Every one may reſt aſſured that much, very much of the future happineſs of the officers and men, will depend upon the wiſe and manly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct which ſhall be adopted by them, when they are mingled with the great body of the community.

                        <p>The commander in chief conceives little is now wanting to enable the ſold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier to change his military character into that of the citizen, but that ſteady and decent tenor of behavour, which has generally diſtinguiſhed, not only the army under his immediate command, but the different detachments and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate armies, through the courſe of

When I was firſt called to the ſtation with which I was honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed during the late conſlict for our liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; to the diffidence which I had ſo many reaſons to feel in accepting it, I thought it my duty to join A FIRM RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SOLUTION TO SHUT MY HAND AGAINST EVERY PECUNIARY RECOMPENSE.

Upon this requeſt, the legiſlature of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia, repealed ſo much of the act referred to as related to the veſting the above-mentioned ſhares in General Waſhington and heirs, and enacted that the ſhares and profits accruing therefrom, ſhould ſtand appropriated to ſuch objects of a public nature as his Excellency ſhould direct and appoint. Sometime after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, General Waſhington applied theſe ſhares of the canal company to the erection and eſtabliſhment of two ſeminaries of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Virginia, which were accompliſhed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his immediate direction.</p>
            <p>General Waſhington having retired from all public employment, now aſſumed the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a private gentleman, he employed himſelf in improving his farms and planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and in cultivating the arts of peace.— But in this retreat of happineſs and rural ſimplicity he was not ſuſſered long to remain, it was too ſoon for the <hi>father of America</hi> to leave his inſant care, his well tried virtues were generally and juſtly known to his fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citizens, and their confidence in his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, experience and diſintereſted patriot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm, was univerſal even to enthuſiaſm. Four years had not expired from the period at which he reſigned his military command, when the voice of his country again called
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:037222_0069_100C9848597C4AC0"/>him to its ſervice—in the year 1787, he was elected a delegate to the federal convention which met at Philadelphia to form the new conſtitution, and was choſen preſident there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Whatever difference of ſentiment there might have been amongſt the citizens with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the principle, ſtructure, or adoption of the new conſtitution, there appeared but one ſentiment as to the man who ſhould ſit at the helm of its adminiſtration. General Waſhington, after the adoption of the federal conſtitution, was, on the 6th of April, 1789, unanimouſly elected Preſident of the United States—whereupon the citizens teſtified with becoming joy, their confidence and approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at his appointment to the office of chief magiſtrate, and innumerable addreſſes reitera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his praiſe from every part of the union.</p>
            <p>His triumphal entry into Philadelphia on his way to New-York, the ſeat of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to aſſume the duties of his important office, merit a minute deſcription, Early on the morning of the 20th of April, his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency Thomas Mifflin, Eſq. governor of the ſtate, the Hon. Richard Peters, Eſq. ſpeaker of the legiſlature of the ſtate, the old city troop of horſe, and another troop from the city commanded by captain Bingham, waited the arrival of their beloved <hi>Washington,</hi> at
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:037222_0069_100C9848597C4AC0"/>the line between the ſtates of Pennſylvania and Delaware, to which place they had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded on the evening before.</p>
            <p>After paying him the tribute of military honor due to his rank and exalted character, by proper ſalutes and otherwiſe, they eſcort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him into Cheſter, where they breakfaſted, and reſted a couple of hours.</p>
            <p>This great and worthy man, finding he could not poſiibly elude the parade which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily muſt attend manifeſtations of joy and affection, when diſplayed by a grateful peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to their patriot benefactor, ordered his carriages into the rear of the whole line, and mounted an elegant horſe, accompanied by the venerable patriot Charles Thomſon, Eſq. and his former aid-de-camp, the celebrated Colonel Humphries; both of whom were alſo on horſe-back.</p>
            <p>On their way to the city, they were joined by detachments from the Cheſter and Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia troops of horſe, and alſo by a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of reſpectable citizens, at whoſe head was the worthy citizen and ſoldier, his Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy Arthur St. Clair, Eſq. governor of the Weſtern Territory. Thus they proceeded to Gray's ferry, on Schuylkill; obſerving the ſtricteſt order and regularity during the march. But here ſuch a ſcene preſented itſelf, that
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:037222_0070_100C984A38E06108"/>even the pencil of a Raphael could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineate.</p>
            <p>The bridge was highly decorated with laurel and other evergreens, by Mr. Gray, the ingenious Mr. Peale, and others, and in ſuch a ſtyle as to diſplay uncommon taſte in theſe gentlemen. At each end there were erected magnificent arches, compoſed of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, emblematical of the ancient triumphal arches, uſed by the Romans, and on each ſide of the bridge, a laurel ſhrubbery, which ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to challenge even nature herſelf, for ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, eaſe and elegance. And as our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved WASHINGTON paſſed the bridge, a lad, beautifully ornamented with ſprigs of laurel, aſſiſted by certain machinery, let drop, above the hero's head, unperceived by him, a civic crown of laurel. There was alſo a very ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant diſplay of variegated flags on each ſide of the bridge, as well as other places, which alternately caught the eye, and filled the ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator's ſoul with admiration and delight.</p>
            <p>But who can deſcribe the heart-felt congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulations of more than twenty thouſand free citizens, who lined every fence, field, and avenue between the bridge and city? The aged ſire, the venerable matron, the bloom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing virgin, and the ruddy youth, were all emulous in their plaudits—nay the liſping
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:037222_0070_100C984A38E06108"/>infant did not withhold its innocent ſmile of praiſe and approbation.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, all claſſes and deſcriptions of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens diſcovered (and they felt what they diſcovered) the moſt undiſguiſed attachment and unbounded zeal for their dear chief, and I may add, under God, the Saviour of their country. Not all the pomp of majeſty, not even imperial dignity itſelf, ſurrounded with its uſual ſplendor and magnificence, could equal this intereſting ſcene.</p>
            <p>On approaching near the city, our illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious chief was highly gratified with a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther military diſplay of intantry, and artillery, who joined in the proceſſion, and thouſands of freemon, whoſe hearts burned with patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otic fire, alſo fell into the ranks, almoſt every ſquare they marched, until the column ſwelled beyond credibility itſelf, and having conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the man of their hearts to the city tavern, he was introduced to a very grand and plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful banquet, which was prepared for him by the citizens. At dinner, thirteen patriotic toaſts were drank. The pleaſures and teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the day being over, they were ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a handſome diſplay of fire-works in the evening; this may give a faint idea of this glorious proceſſion, and of the univerſal
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:037222_0071_100C984C635D7F50"/>joy which inſpired every heart upon this in tereſting, this important occaſion.</p>

                        <p>"Among the viciſſitudes incident to life, no event could have filled me with greater anxieties, than that, of which the notification was tranſmitted by your order, and received on the fourteenth day of the preſent month: on the one hand, I was ſummoned by my country, whoſe voice I can never hear but with veneration and love, from a retreat which I had choſen with the fondeſt predeliction, and, in my flattering hopes, with an immutable deciſion, as the aſylum of my declining years: a retreat which was rendered every day more neceſſary, as well as more dear to me, by the addition of habit to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, and of frequent interruptions
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:037222_0071_100C984C635D7F50"/>in health, to the gradual waſte commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on it by time. On the other hand, the magnitude and difficulty of the truſt, to which the voice of my country called me, being ſufficient to awaken in the wiſeſt and moſt experienced of her citizens, a diſtruſtful ſcrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with deſpondence, one, who, inherit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inferior endowments from nature, and unpractiſed in the duties of civil adminiſtration, ought to be peculiarly conſcious of his own deſiciencies. In this conflict of emotions, all I dare aver, is, that it has been my faithful ſtudy to collect my duty from a juſt appreciation of every circumſtance, by which it might be affected. All I dare hope, is, that if, in executing this taſk, I have been too much ſwayed by a grateful remembrance of former inſtances, or by an affectionate ſenſibility to this tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent proof of the confidence of my fellow-citizens—and have thence too little conſulted my incapacity as well as
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:037222_0072_100C985084925190"/>diſinclination for the weighty and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tried cares before me—my error will be palliated by the motives which miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lead me, and its conſequences be judged by my country, with ſome ſhare of the partiality in which they originated.</p>
                        <p>"Such being the impreſſions under which I have, in obedience to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic ſummons, repaired to the preſent ſtation—it would be peculiarly impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to omit in the firſt official act, my fervent ſupplications to that Almighty Being who rules over the univerſe, who precides in the councils of nations, — and whoſe providential aids can ſupply every human defect, that his benedic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may conſecrate to the liberties and happineſs of the people of the United States, a government inſtituted by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for theſe eſſential purpoſes: and may enable every inſtrument, employed in its adminiſtration, to execute with ſucceſs the functions allotted to his charge. In tendering this homage to the great Author of every public and
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:037222_0072_100C985084925190"/>private good, I aſſure myſelf that it expreſſes your ſentiments not leſs than my own, nor thoſe of my fellow-citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens at large, leſs than either. No peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple can be bound to acknowledge and adore the inviſible hand, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts the affairs of men, more than the people of the United States. Every ſtep, by which they have advanced to the character of an independent nation, ſeems to have been diſtinguiſhed by ſome tokens of providential agency. And in the important revolution juſt accompliſhed in the ſyſtem of their Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted government, the tranquil delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and voluntary conſent of ſo many diſtinct communities, from which the event has reſulted, cannot be compared with the means by which moſt govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have been eſtabliſhed, without ſome return of pious gratitude, along with an humble anticipation of the future bleſſings which the paſt ſeem to preſage. Theſe reflexions, ariſing out of the preſent criſis, have forced themſelves
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:037222_0073_100C9852452EDBC8"/>too ſtrongly on my mind to be ſuppreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. You will join with me, I truſt, in thinking, that there are none under the influence of which, the proceedings of a new and free government can more auſpiciouſly commence.</p>
                        <p>"By the article eſtabliſhing the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive department, it is made the duty of the preſident "to recommend to your conſideration ſuch meaſures as he ſhall judge neceſſary and expedient." The circumſtances under which I now meet you, will acquit me from entering into that ſubject, farther than to refer to the great conſtitutional charter under which you are aſſembled; and which, in defining your powers, deſignates the objects to which your attention is to be given. It will be more conſiſtent with thoſe circumſtances, and far more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genial with the feelings which actuate me, to ſubſtitute in place of a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of particular meaſures, the tribute that is due to the talents, the rectitude, and the patriotiſm which
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:037222_0073_100C9852452EDBC8"/>adorn the characters ſelected to deviſe and to adopt them. In theſe honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble qualifications. I behold the ſureſt pledges, that as, on one ſide, no local prejudices or attachments—no ſeparate views—nor party animoſities, will miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct the comprehenſive and equal eye which ought to watch over this great aſſemblage of communities and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts; ſo, on another, that the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our national policy will be laid in the pure and immutable principles of private morality; and the pre-eminence of free government, be exemplified by all the attributes which can win the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of its citizens, and command the reſpect of the world I dwell on this proſpect with every ſatisfaction which an ardent love for my country can inſpire: ſince there is no truth more thoroughly eſtabliſhed, than that there exiſts in the economy and courſe of nature, an indiſſoluble union between virtue and happineſs, between duty and advantage, between the genuine max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:037222_0074_100C985406ACEC60"/>of an honeſt and magnanimous policy, and the ſolid rewards of public proſperity and felicity: ſince we ought to be no leſs perſuaded, that the propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious ſmiles of heaven can never be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected on a nation that diſregards the eternal rules of order and right, which heaven itſelf hath ordained: and ſince the preſervation of the ſacred fire of liberty, and the deſtiny of the repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican model of government, are juſtly conſidered as deeply, perhaps as finally ſtaked, on the experiment entruſted to the hands of the American people.</p>
                        <p>"Beſides the ordinary objects ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to your care, it will remain with your judgment to decide, how far an exerciſe of the occaſional power dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated by the fifth article of the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution is rendered expedient at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent juncture, by the nature of objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which have been urged againſt the ſyſtem, or by the degree of inquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude which has given birth to them.

<pb n="147" facs="unknown:037222_0074_100C985406ACEC60"/>on this ſubject, in which I could be guided by no lights derived from official opportunities, I ſhall again give way to my entire confiderce in your diſcernment and purſuit of the public good: for I aſſure myſelf that whilſt you carefully avoid every alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation which might endanger the benefits of an united and effective government, or which ought to await the future leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of experience; a reverence for the characteriſtic rights of freemen, and a regard for the public harmony, will ſufficiently influence your deliberations on the queſtion, how far the former can be more impregnably fortified, or the latter be ſafely and advantageouſly promoted.</p>
                        <p>"To the preceding obſervations, I have one to add, which will be moſt properly addreſſed to the houſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives.

From this reſolution I have in no inſtance departed. And being ſtill un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the impreſſions which produced it, I muſt decline, as inapplicable to myſelf, any ſhare in the perſonal emoluments, which may be indiſpenſably included in a permanent proviſion for the executive department; and muſt accordingly pray that the pecuniary eſtimates for the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in which I am placed, may, during my continuance in it, be limited to ſuch actual expenditures as the public good may be thought to require.</p>
                        <p>Having thus imparted to you my ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, as they have been awakened by the occaſion which brings us toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I ſhall take my preſent leave; but not without reſorting once more to the benign Parent of the human race, in humble ſupplication, that ſince he has been pleaſed to favor the American peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,

            <p>The firſt ſeſſion of congreſs, under the new conſtitution, continued their ſittings from the 4th of March until the 29th of Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, their attention was chiefly directed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the eſtabliſhment of various regulations for the reſtoration of the public credit of the United States, and other objects of political economy.

               </gap> tour to the ſtates of Connecticut, Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts,
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:037222_0076_100C98598D7213E0"/>ſetts, and N. Hampſhire, attended by Meſſrs. Lear and Jackſon, his ſecretaries. In every part of the country through which he paſſed, the citizens embraced the opportunity of perſonally teſtifying their eſteem and reſpect of the <hi>man of their choice,</hi> in whoſe character, whatever is great and good—whatever dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies and adorns human nature, are ſo happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly united. All that a grateful people could pay, was paid, whenever he approached a town or village, the roads were lined with ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens to hail him welcome, —the military eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corted him from place to place. Particularly to relate all the grateful teſtimonials which were paid him during this viſit, is impoſſible from their number. If our limits would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, a deſcription of the manner in which he was received at Boſton would be particularly intereſting; nor can we ſpecify the numer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous congratulatory addreſſes which were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented him. But no particular circumſtance gave him more pleaſure, during his whole tour, than the plain and hearty manner in which Mr. Northey, the chairman of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectmen at Salem received him. This gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman is of the ſociety of Friends, and when the Preſident was preſented to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectmen, Mr. Northey being covered, took him by the hand and ſaid, "Friend Waſhing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:037222_0076_100C98598D7213E0"/>we are glad to ſee thee, and in behalf of the inhabitants, bid thee a hearty welcome to Salem."</p>
            <p>On his arrival at Newburyport, the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing incident occurred, a poor old ſoldier, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Cotton, who was with him in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable battle on the Ohio, when Braddock was defeated, requeſted, and was admitted into the room where the Preſident was, —on the ſoldier's aſking "<hi>how Major Washington lid?</hi>" the Preſident immediately recollected his perſon, and riſing from his chair, took him by the hand, and tenderly enquired into the ſcenes of his life, and preſent circumſtances, "I thank God," anſwered the ſoldier, "that I have an opportunity of ſeeing my old com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander once more, I have ſeen him in adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fity, and now ſeeing him in glory, I can go home and die contented." The next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he came again to take leave of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident, who gave him a guinea, which he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted he ſaid, "merely as a token in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of his commander," and which he wore pendent on his boſom, declaring that nothing earthly ſhould ſeparate it from him.</p>
            <p>While General Waſhington was Preſident of the United States, the following circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which does honor to his humanity oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred. One Reuben Rouzy, of Virginia,
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:037222_0077_100C985C5A12C630"/>owed him about a thouſand pounds; one of the Preſident's agents brought a ſuit for the money, judgment was obtained, and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion iſſued againſt the body of the defendant, who was taken to goal. He had a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble landed property, but this kind of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, cannot be ſold in Virginia for debts, unleſs at the diſcretion of the perſon. He had a large family, and preſerred lying in goal to ſelling his land, for the ſake of his children. —Some of his acquaintance hinted to him, that probably General Waſhington did not know any thing of the proceeding, and it might be well to ſend him a petition, with a ſtatement of the circumſtances. He did ſo, and the very next poſt from Philadelphia, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his petition arrived, brought him a releaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with a ſevere <hi>reprimand</hi> on the agent for acting in ſuch a cruel manner without conſent. Poor Rouzy was, in conſequence, reſtored to his family and happineſs, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver laid down their heads at night, without offering their prayers to Heaven for our <hi>much beloved</hi> WASHINGTON.</p>
            <p>On the 4th of January 1790, congreſs held their ſecond ſeſſion at New-York. The Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident opened it with a ſpeech, he congratula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them on the ſavorable proſpects which the public affairs then aſſumed; the acceſtion of
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:037222_0077_100C985C5A12C630"/>the ſtate of North-Carolina to the Union, the riſing credit and reſpectability of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and the concord, peace and plenty with which they were bleſſed: he directed their attention towards the making proviſion for the common defence, aſſuring them that "to be prepared for war, is one of the moſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual means of preſeving peace, and that a free people ought not only to be armed but diſciplined;" he recommended the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the Weſtern and Southern fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers againſt the depredations of the hoſtile Indians; the eſtabliſhment of intercourſe with other nations; the framing of an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form law for the naturalization of foreigners; the importance of uniformity in the currency, weights, and meaſures throughout the Union; the advancement of agriculture, commerce, and manufactures; the encouragement of exertions of ſkill, and genius, and to facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the intercourſe between the diſtant parts of the country, by a due attention to the poſt-oſtice and poſt-roads. He particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly recommended the promotion of ſcience and literature, as the ſureſt baſis of public happineſs, and beſt means of ſecuring a free conſtitution, by teaching the people to know and to value their rights, to diſcern and provide againſt innovations of them, to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:037222_0078_100C985E07D9C7E8"/>between oppreſſion and the neceſſary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of lawful authority, to deſcriminate the ſpirit of liberty from that of licentiouſneſs, cherriſhing the firſt, avoiding the laſt, and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a ſpeedy but temperate vigilance againſt encroachments, with an inviolable reſpect to the laws. He informed them that he had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected the papers and eſtimates to be laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, which were neceſſary to convey to them, that information of the ſtate of the Union, which it was his duty to afford. He concluded by aſſuring them, that "He ſhould derive great ſatisfaction, from a co-operation with them, in the pleaſing, though arduous taſk, of inſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ring to their fellow-citizens the bleſſings which they have a right to expect from a free, efficient government."</p>
            <p>This ſeſſion continued their ſittings until the 12th of Auguſt following; in that month the Preſident negotiated a treaty of Peace and friendſhip between the United States and the Creek nation of Indians; the ceremony took place at New-York, on the 30th of Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. The ſame year General Harmar, with 320 United States troops and 1, 133 mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia, gave battle to the Miami Indians, by whom he was defeated with the loſs of 183 men killed, and 31 wounded; about 100 or upwards of the Indians were killed. The
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:037222_0078_100C985E07D9C7E8"/>Miami village containing about 100 Log hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes or wigwams, with 20,000 buſhels of corn, was deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>The third ſeſſion of Congreſs met on the 6th of December 1790, and roſe on the 3d of March following; their deliberations were chiefly directed towards the regulation of commerce, further improvement of the judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial ſyſtem, and making proviſion for the appointment of conſuls in foreign countries. The ſtate of Kentucky was admitted into the Union as a diſtinct ſtate, and a loan was nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated with the ſtates of Holland.</p>
            <p>The Indian war continued on the frontier of the ſtates. During the ſummer of 1791, Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Scott ſurpriſed the Wabaſh towns, he killed about thirty Indians, took fiſty priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and brought with him two hundred horſes loaded with peltry and other articles of plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, with the loſs of three men only. The attention of the Preſident during the period of this Congreſs, was chiefly directed towards the adoption of meaſures for the protection of the froutiers, and eſtabliſhment of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce.</p>
            <p>On the 24th of October 1791, the ſecond Congreſs commenced their firſt ſeſſion, the Preſident as uſual opened the ſeſſion by a ſpeech to both houſes, he began by remarking
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:037222_0079_100C9861B5E89D08"/>the abundance of the preceding harveſt, the progreſſive ſtate of agriculture, manufactures, commerce and navigation, and the general and happy effects which had been produced by the revival of public and private confidence, to which the laws of the United States had ſo eminently contributed. He mentioned the plan laid down for conciliating the friendſhip of the Indians; the baſis of which was a ſtrict adherence to the dictates of juſtice and humanity. The act for laying a duty on diſtilled ſpirits, had been, he ſaid, attended with ſome difficulty, from the want of expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience in the Federal government, to make the proper arrangements, and, in ſome parts of the union, there had been a miſconception of its proviſions; but he entertained no doubt that the diſcontent produced from it would be removed by a proper explanation of the law. The Preſident next obſerved, that, agreeable to ſeveral acts on that ſubject, a diſtrict of ten miles ſquare, for the perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent ſeat of the government of the United States, had been fixed upon, and announced by proclamation; that the diſtrict compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended lands on both ſides of the Patowmac, and the towns of Alexandria and George<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town; that a city had accordingly been laid out, and that there was every reaſon to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:037222_0079_100C9861B5E89D08"/>a due progreſs in the buildings. He alſo informed the two houſes that a cenſus of the inhabitants of the United States, had been almoſt compleated, and afforded the pleaſing aſſurance that the preſent population bordered upon four millions of perſons, that a further loan of two millions and an half of florins had been compleated in Holland upon terms ſimilar to the laſt, and that another loan for ſix millions of florins had been ſet on foot. He concluded by recommending to their particular attention, the ſupporting of the militia on an effective plan; the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the poſt-office, the extention and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of the poſt roads, the neceſſity for a public mint, an uniformity of weights and meaſures, and a proviſion for the ſale of the vacant lands of the United States.</p>
            <p>This ſeſſion continued their deliberations, until the 8th of May, 1792, when they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed till the firſt Monday of November following. During their ſeſſion and adjourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, there was no remarkable or important event, a ſeries of maſſacres, were, as formerly committed on the frontiers, the hopes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by the Preſident, of being able to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate the diſputes with the Indians, did not prove ſucceſsful. On the 4th of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember, 1791, the United States army under
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:037222_0080_100C98636A521370"/>the command of General St. Clair was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked by ſurpriſe, within fifteen miles of the Miami village; the conteſt laſted for four hours, when the Indians became victorious, the retreat of the Americans was accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the loſs of forty-ſix officers, ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred privates, eight pieces of artillery and their whole baggage. In this battle, it is ſaid, that twelve hundred Canadians fought under the diſguiſe of Indians. The attention of the Executive during this period, was alſo engaged in deviſing modes to reconcile the citizens in ſome diſtricts of the union to the law, enacted for the purpoſe of collecting a certain duty o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He iſſued a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, recommending a compliance with the laws, and warning the citizens againſt all unlawful proceedings and combinations, having a tendency to obſtruct the ſame.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Congreſs met again in Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 1792. The Preſident opened the ſeſſion with a ſpeech, the greateſt part of which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected the unfortunate endeavours to termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:037222_0080_100C98636A521370"/>the Indian hoſtilities. He informed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of the oppoſition which had been mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted to the exciſe law, and recommended a reviſion of the judiciary ſyſtem. He further obſerved, that three loans had been negociated for the uſe of the United States, one at Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werp, and two at Amſterdam, each for three millions of florins, on very reaſonable terms, which afforded a pleaſing evidence of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing credit of the new government. On the 2d of March 1793, this ſeſſion adjourned.</p>
            <p>Heretofore the proſperity of the United States met with little or no interruption, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept from the hoſtility of the Indians. The attention of the executive was chiefly directed to the eſtabliſhment of thoſe meaſures which the organization of the infant republic rendered neceſſary. Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> extenſion of commerce and the diſputes of the European powers, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it neceſſary for the United States to ſend and receive, miniſters and agents, for the better regulation of affairs.</p>
            <p>This neceſſary meaſure created troubles and perplexities hitherto unknown to the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive of the United States. On the 8th of April, 1793 Citizen Genet arrived at Charleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, as miniſter plenipotentiary from the executive of France to the Preſident of the United States. On the 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d of the ſame month
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:037222_0081_100C98652BB168D8"/>the Preſident iſſued a proclamation enjoining the citizens of the United States to a ſtrict neutrality, in the conteſt between the mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time powers, and threatening proſecution to all who ſhould infringe the ſame. The pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic approbation of this wiſe meaſure, for the preſervation of the public tranquility, was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted in numerous addreſſes to the Preſident, thanking him In warm terms for his attention to the intereſt of the citizens—many how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever were offended at the meaſure, as they conceived that it implied a deficiency of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and gratitude to the republic of France, to whom the United States were highly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted for their independence. Genet arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Philadelphia, the ſeat of government, on the 17th of May. The conduct of this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter is perhaps unexampled in diplomatic hiſtory. It was not until the publication of the proclamation of the Preſident enjoining neutrality, that the government firſt heard of his arrival, and even then, they were only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed through the medium of the news-pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, about a fortnight after his arrival; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of preſenting his credentials to the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, he began to aſſume a conduct, impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and unbecoming, he undertook to au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſe the fitting out of armed veſſels, he enliſted citizens and others, and gave com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:037222_0081_100C98652BB168D8"/>to cruiſe and commit hoſtilities a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the veſſels of England and other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions at war with France, but who were at the ſame time at peace with the United States. Theſe veſſels had actually taken prizes, brought them into American ports, where the conſuls of France held courts of admiralty, tried, condemned, and authoriſed their ſale as legal prizes. Theſe proceedings, in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the peace of the United States, were inſtantly complained of by Mr. Hammond the Britiſh Miniſter—Thus were the ſeeds of future controverſy planted. The government of the United States interfered, and in ſome caſes overruled the proceedings of both the Britiſh and French as illegal, remonſtrances were exhibited to the Preſident from both ſides, which created a ſeries of diplomatic correſpondence. A new ſource of diſcontent on the part of the French now aroſe, Genet demanded with ſome abruptneſs, money from the Treaſury of the United States in part payment of their debt to France with which the American government found it inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to comply. This ſtate of diplomatic hoſtility could not be expected to hold out long without coming to a criſis. According<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the 16th of Auguſt the Preſident ordered Mr. Jeſterſon the ſecretary of ſtate to addreſs
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:037222_0082_100C9867CB5C62E0"/>a letter to Mr. Morris the American Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor in France, ſoliciting the republic to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call their Miniſter. In the mean time Citizen Duplaine, Vice conſul for the republic of France, in the port of Boſton, having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted ſundry encroachments on the laws of the United States, the Preſident in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence thereof, ſuſpended his powers.</p>
            <p>The term for which General Waſhington was elected Preſident having expired, he was again re-elected to the ſame office. On the 2d of December, 1793, the third congreſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced their firſt ſeſſion. The Preſident, in his ſpeech to both houſes expreſſed a reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſenſe of the confidence that he enjoyed, in being again called, by the ſuffrage of his fellow-citizens, to the office of chief magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate. He recited the meaſures which he had adopted to avoid a rupture with any of the powers at war, and to inſure to the citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of the United States, the rights of neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trality. He further recommended to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, the neceſſity of placing the country in a ſtate of defence; that while the United States fulfilled their duties to the reſt of the world, they may likewiſe exact the fulfillment of the like duties towards them. He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed them of the means which had been purſued for conciliating the diſpoſitions of
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:037222_0082_100C9867CB5C62E0"/>the Indians, and recommended to congreſs to make proviſion for the eſtabliſhment of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with the Indian nations, as the beſt means of ſecuring their intereſt, and render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their tranquility permanent; he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded by recommending a repeal of the tax on the tranſportation of public prints, as they contained the beſt means of informing the minds, and ſecuring the affections of their conſtituents;—he afterwards, by a ſpecial meſſage, informed the houſe of repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, "that although the government of the French nation, had generally manifeſted a friendly diſpoſition to the U. States, yet the perſon unfortunately appointed their miniſter plenipotentiary, had breathed nothing of the friendly diſpoſition of the nation which ſent him; his proceedings had uniformly tended "to involve us in war abroad, and diſcord and anarchy at home." He hoped that the French government would not long ſuffer the United States to remain expoſed to the action of a perſon, who had ſo little reſpected the mutual diſpoſitions of the two countries. Soon after this period, this miniſter was recalled, his conduct having been unequivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally diſapproved of. About this period the commerce of the United States, began to ſuffer greatly, from the depredations of the
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:037222_0083_100C986AC49B36E8"/>Britiſh, under pretence of their being load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with French property—it alſo ſuffered from the piracy of privateers, who, for the moſt part diſclaiming juſtice altogether, ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both veſſels and cargo, and diſpoſed of the ſame for their own uſe; a conſiderable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of American veſſels were likewiſe cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured in the Weſtern Ocean by the Algerine corſairs. Theſe ſubjects were aſſumed by congreſs, and many modes were propoſed for the purpoſe of putting a ſtop to the unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable exceſſes. A bill was paſſed, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide a naval armament againſt the Algerines. On the 25th of March, a motion was made in the houſe of repreſentatives, aſſented to by the ſenate, and ſigned by the Preſident, laying an embargo for 30 days on all veſſels bound to foreign ports, this embargo was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards continued until the 25th of May. The Preſident was empowered to raiſe an additional corps of artillery-men for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of garriſoning the fortifications for the defence of the ſea-coaſts; he was alſo autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized to call on the executives of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſtates, to take effectual meaſures for or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganizing eighty thouſand effective militia.</p>
            <p>On the 19th of May, intelligence was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the territory N. W. of the river Ohio, ſtating the hardſhips which the citizens
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:037222_0083_100C986AC49B36E8"/>of that territory ſuſtained from the hoſtile diſpoſition of the Cherobee Indians; the maſſacre of two hundred people, and the loſs of two thouſand horſes, formed a part of the liſt of their diſaſters. On the 20th of May the Preſident, by a meſſage, informed the houſe of repreſentatives, that there had been ſome danger of hoſtilities againſt the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories of Spain, in the neighbourhood of the United States, that the governor of Kentucky had indicated, that he would make no exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to prevent the expulſion of the Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iards from the banks of the Miſſiſſippi, as he had found them a perfidious and worthleſs people, conſtantly exciting the Indians to murder the ſettlers in that quarter.</p>
            <p>During this ſeſſion of congreſs, many im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant laws were enacted. The act aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Marquis de la Fayette, the ſum of 24,424 dollars, for his ſervices during the war, being the pay of a major general; and the act forbidding American citizens or foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers reſiding in the United States, under ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere penalties, from being concerned in the ſlave trade, does great honor to the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. On the 9th of June, 1794 this ſeſſion adjourned.</p>
            <p>In 1794, during the receſs of congreſs, the attention of the Preſident of the United
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:037222_0084_100C986D0F166958"/>States, was called to ſuppreſs an inſurrection, which began to aſſume a very formidable aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect. It was confined to the weſtern parts of the ſtate of Pennſylvania. The outlines of it are as follows, viz. During the year 1790, the congreſs of the United States found it neceſſary "t lay and collect exciſes." This mode of taxation, diſcordant to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius of the citizens, in many parts of the Union, met with conſiderable oppoſition, which however, was gradually baniſhed by reaſon and patriotiſm, excepting in the four weſtern counties of Pennſylvania, where a prejudice ſtill remained, and produced ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of not and violence. The diſaffection was at firſt vented in general complaints— certain aſſociations were formed to prevent the operation of the laws, and the exciſe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers received ſome marks of contempt and rudeneſs. Theſe aſſociations held public meetings, and publiſhed their reſolutions.— Beſides the exciſe law, they cenſured ſeveral other acts of the federal government, as the exorbitant ſalaries of office, the inſtitution of a national bank, the intereſt of the public debt &amp;c.</p>
            <p>On the 6th of September, 1791, the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector of the revenue for that diſtrict, was ſeized by a party, armed and in diſguiſe; they
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:037222_0084_100C986D0F166958"/>tarred and feathered him, cut off his hair and committed other acts of violence, legal proceſs was therefore iſſued againſt the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; but the inſurgents prevented the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall from ſerving them, they fired upon him, arreſted, and for ſometime detained him as a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> priſoner, a number of ſimilar outrages were committed. The Preſident, the ever watchful guardian of the conſtitution, beheld with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, theſe exceſſes, he ſought and weighed what was beſt to be done in this momentous criſis, he beheld the judiciary ſtripped of its capacity to enforce the laws, and crimes, which reached to the very exiſtence of ſocial order, perpetrated without control; the friends of government inſulted, and that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution violated, which he had made a ſacred vow to protect;—he beheld with abhorrence the idea, of "arraying citizen againſt citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen," until every lenient meaſure ſhould be exhauſted. He iſſued proclamations exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the rioters to deſiſt from ſuch diſorderly proceedings, he recommended obedience to the laws, he appointed commiſſioners to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair to the ſcene of inſurrection, authorized them to confer with the inſurgents, to ſtate to them his ſenſations, to aſſure them that it was his earneſt with to avoid a reſort to coercion, he even offered them pardon, on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> held their ſecond ſeſſion, at Philadelphia.— The Preſident began his ſpeech with a hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of the oppoſition which had been mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted to the conſtitution and laws of the United States and of the means which he had purſued to ſuppreſs it, the alacrity which the militia, and others who volunteered their ſervice diſplayed, exhibited, he ſaid, "to the

            <p>Ever ſince the formal ratification of the treaties of peace between the United States and Great Britain, numerous cauſes of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint has exiſted on the part of both com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries reſpecting its fulfillment.

<pb n="171" facs="unknown:037222_0086_100C987322C03D80"/>which are highly intereſting. This corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence was publiſhed by congreſs in 1794. The arguments of Mr. Jeſſerſon appeared to have contained unanſwerable weight, as no reply or explanation were ever made to them, although requeſted by him—Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs remained in this ſtate of ſuſpenſe until June 1793, when the Britiſh, in conſequence of their hoſtilities with France, iſſued orders to the commanders of their veſſels, to ſtop all neutral veſſels carrying proviſions to any port in that republic; ſhips attempting to enter any French port, blockaded by the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh, were to be condemned, both veſſel and cargo, whatever it may conſiſt of: the order contained a limited exception in favour of Denmark and Sweden, but in the execution of it, the rights of America were entirely diſregarded. This matter produced a diplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic diſcuſſion between the miniſters of the two countries, both at London and Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia: their correſpondence produced a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual with on both ſides to eſtabliſh a treaty of commerce, and a friendly adjuſtment of all complaints. The Preſident of the United States, accordingly nominated Mr. John Jay, chief judge of the United States, as an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy extraordinary to the court of London. After a ſhort paſſage, Mr. Jay arrived in

                        <p>Theſe conſiderations ſpeak a perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive language to every reflecting and virtuous mind, and exhibit the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of the Union as a primary ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of patriotic deſire.—Is there a doubt whether a common government can embrace ſo large a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>In contemplating the cauſes which may diſturb our Union, it occurs as matter of ſerious concern, that any ground ſhould have been furniſhed for characteriſing parties by <hi>Geographical</hi> diſcriminations—<hi>"Northern</hi> and <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern —Atlantic</hi> and <hi>Weſtern;"</hi> whence deſigning men may endeavour to excite a belief, that there is a real difference of local intereſts and views.

To the efficacy and permanency of your union, a government for the whole is indiſpenſable.—No alliances, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſtrict, between the parts, can be an adequate ſubſtitute; they muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitably experience the infractions and interruptions which all alliances in all times have experienced.

But in thoſe of the popular character, in governments purely elective, it is a ſpirit not to be encouraged. From their natural ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, it is certain there will always be enough of that ſpirit for every ſalutary purpoſe. And there being conſtant danger of exceſs, the effort ought to be, by force of public opinion, to mitigate and aſſuage it.

                        <p>It is important likewiſe, that the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits of thinking in a free country ſhould inſpire caution, in thoſe entruſted with its adminiſtration, to confine themſelves within their reſpective conſtitutional ſpheres, avoiding in the exerciſe of their powers of one department to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croach upon another.

To preſerve them muſt be as neceſſary as to inſtitute them.

The execution of theſe maxims belongs to your repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives; but it is neceſſary that public opinion ſhould co-operate.</p>
                        <p>To facilitate to them the performance of their duty, it is eſſential that you ſhould practically bear in mind, that to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the payment of debts there muſt be revenue: that to have revenue, there muſt be taxes; that no taxes can be deviſed that are not more or leſs incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient and unplcaſant; that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſic embarraſſment inſeparable from

Who can doubt, that in the courſe of time and things, the fruits of ſuch a plan would richly repay any temporary advantages which might be loſt by a ſteady adherence to it?— Can it be that Providence has not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected the permanent felicity of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

                        <p>In the execution of ſuch a plan, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more eſſential than that perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, inveterate antipathies againſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular nations, and paſſionate attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for others, ſhould be excluded; and that in the place of them, juſt and amicable feelings towards all ſhould be cultivated. The nation which indulges towards another an habitual hatred, or an habitual fondneſs, is in ſome degree a ſlave. It is a ſlave to its animoſity or its affection, either of which is ſufficient to lead it aſtray from its duty and its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt. Antipathy in one nation againſt another, diſpoſes each more readily to offer inſult and injury, to lay hold of ſlight cauſes of umbrage, and to be haughty and untractable, when acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental or trifling occaſions of diſpute occur.</p>

Hence, frequent colliſions, obſtinate, envenomed and bloody conteſts.—The nation, prompted by ill-will and reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſometimes impels to war the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, contrary to the beſt calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of policy. The government ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times participates in the national pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſity, and adopts, through paſſion, what reaſon would reject; at other times it makes the animoſity of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſubſervient to projects of hoſtility, inſtigated by pride, ambition, and other ſiniſter and pernicious motives. The peace often, ſometimes perhaps the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of nations, has been the victim.</p>
                        <p>So likewiſe, a paſſionate attachment of one nation for another, produces a variety of evils. Sympathy for the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite nation, facilitating the illuſion of an imaginary common intereſt, in caſes where no real common intereſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts, and infuſing into one the enmities of the other, betrays the former into a participation in the quarrels and wars of the latter, without adequate induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:037222_0104_100C989D86A93340"/>or juſtification. It leads alſo to conceſſions to the favourite nation of privileges denied to others, which is apt doubly to injure the nation making the conceſſions; by unneceſſarily parting with what ought to have been retained; and by exciting jealouſy, ill will, and a diſpoſition to retaliate, in the parties from whom equal privileges are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held: And it gives to ambitious, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted or deluded citizens (who devote themſelves to the favourite nation) fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility to betray or ſacrifice the intereſts of their own country, without odium, ſometimes even with popularity; gild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the appearances of a virtuous ſenſe of obligation, a commendable deference for public opinion, or a laudable zeal for public good, the baſe or fooliſh compliances of ambition, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption or infatuation.</p>
                        <p>As avenues to foreign influence in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable ways, ſuch attachments are particularly alarming to the enlightened and independent patriot. How many
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:037222_0104_100C989D86A93340"/>opportunities do they afford to tamper with domeſtic factions, to practice the arts of ſeduction, to miſlead public opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, to influence or awe the public councils! Such an attachment of a ſmall or weak, towards a great and powerful nation, dooms the former to be the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellite of the other.</p>
                        <p>Againſt the inſidious wiles of foreign influence (I conjure you to believe me, fellow citizens) the jealouſy of a free people ought to be <hi>conſtantly</hi> awake, ſince hiſtory and experience prove, that foreign influence is one of the moſt baneful foes of republican government. But that jealouſy to be uſeful muſt be impartial; elſe it becomes the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the very influence to be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, inſtead of a defence againſt it.

Our detached and diſtant ſituation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites and enables us to purſue a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent courſe. If we remain one people, under an efficient government, the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod is not far off, when we may defy material injury from external annoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: when we may take ſuch an atti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude as will cauſe the neutrality, we may at any time reſolve upon, to be ſcrupulouſly reſpected; when bellige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant nations, under the impoſſibility of making acquiſitions upon us, will not lightly hazard the giving us provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; when we may chooſe peace or war, as our intereſt, guided by juſtice, ſhall counſel.</p>

'Tis our true policy to ſteer clear of permanent alliances, with any portion of the foreign world; ſo far, I mean, as we are now at liberty to do it: for let me not be underſtood as capable of patronizing infidelity to exiſting engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. I hold the maxim no leſs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable to public than private affairs, that honeſty is always the beſt policy. I repeat it, therefore, let thoſe engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments be obſerved in their genuine ſenſe. But in my opinion, it is unneceſſary and would be unwiſe to extend them.</p>
                        <p>Taking care always to keep ourſelves, by ſuitable eſtabliſhments, on a reſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble defenſive poſture, we may ſafely truſt to temporary alliances for extraordinary emergencies.</p>
                        <p>Harmony and liberal intercourſe with all nations, are recommended by policy, humanity and intereſt. But even our commercial policy ſhould hold an equal and impartial hand; neither ſeeking nor granting excluſive favours or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences; conſulting the natural courſe
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:037222_0106_100C98A1DE846890"/>of things; diffuſing and diverſifying by gentle means the ſtreams of commerce, but forcing nothing, eftabliſhing, with powers ſo diſpoſed, in order to give trade a ſtable courſe, to define the rights of our merchants, and to enable the government to ſupport them; conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional rules of intercourſe, the beſt that preſent circumſtances and mutual opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion will permit, but temporary, and liable to be from time to time abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or varied, as experience and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances ſhall dictate; conſtantly keeping in view, that 'tis folly in one nation to look for diſintereſted favours from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; that it muſt pay with a portion of its independence for whatever it may accept under that character; that by ſuch ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance it may place itſelf in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of having given equivalents for nominal favours, and yet of being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached with ingratitude for not giving more. There can be no greater error than to expect, or calculate upon real favours from nation to nation. 'Tis
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:037222_0107_100C98A36C34D948"/>an illuſion which experience muſt cure, which a juſt pride ought to diſcard.</p>
                        <p>In offering to you, my countrymen, theſe counſels of an old and affection<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate friend, I dare not hope they will make the ſtrong and laſting impreſſion I could wiſh; that they will controul the uſual current of the paſſions, or prevent our nation from running the courſe which has hitherto marked the deſtiny of nations: But if I may even flatter myſelf, that they may be productive of ſome partial benefit, ſome occaſional good; that they may now and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur to, to moderate the fury of party ſpirit, to warn againſt the miſchiefs of foreign intrigue, to guard againſt the impoſtures of pretended patriotiſm; this hope will be a full recompence for the ſolicitude of your welſare, by which they have been dictated.</p>
                        <p>How far in the diſcharge of my of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial duties, I have been guided by the principles that they have been delinea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the public records and other evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences

                        <p>In relation to the ſtill ſubſiſting war in Europe, my proclamation of the 22d of April, 1793, is the index to my plan. Sanctioned by your approving voice and by that of you Repreſentatives in both Houſes of Congreſs, the ſpirit of that meaſure has continually governed me; uninfluenced by any attempts to deter or divert me from it.</p>
                        <p>After deliberate examination, with the aid of the beſt lights I could ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, I was well ſatisfied that our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, under all the circumſtances of the caſe, had a right to take, and was bound in duty and intereſt, to take a neutral poſition. Having taken it, I determined, as far as ſhould depend upon me, to maintain it, with moderation, perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and firmneſs.</p>

The conſiderations which reſpect the right to hold this conduct, it is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary on this occaſion to detail. I will only obſerve, that according to my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the matter, that right, ſo far from being denied by any of the belligerant powers, has been virtually admitted by all.</p>
                        <p>The duty of holding a neutral con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct may be inferred, without any thing more, from the obligations which juſtice and humanity impoſe on every nation, in caſes in which it is free to act, to maintain inviolate the relations of peace and amity towards other nations.</p>
                        <p>The inducements of intereſt for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving that conduct will beſt be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to your own reflections and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.

                        <p>Though in reviewing the incidents of my adminiſtration, I am unconſcious of intentional error: I am, nevertheleſs, too ſenſible of my defects not to think it probable that I may have committed many errors. <hi>Whatever they may be, I fervently beſeech the Almighty to avert or mitigate the evils to which they may tend.

            <p>The inſtitution of a military academy, he alſo obſerves, is recommended by cogent rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. However pacific, ſays he, the general policy of a nation may be, it ought never to be without an adequate ſtock of military knowledge, for emergencies.</p>

The conſequences of a defective proviſion are of ſerious import to the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. If private wealth is to ſupply the defect of public contribution, it will greatly contract the ſphere, within which the ſelec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of character for office is to be made, and will proportionably diminiſh the probability of a choice of men able, as well as upright.

            <p>The Preſident then expreſſes his regret at the unpleaſant circumſtances which have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred relative to the French republic; his ardent wiſh being to maintain cordial harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, as far as is conſiſtent with the rights and honour of our country.</p>

They were publiſhed at the two moſt critical periods of his life, with the view of ſtriking at the integrity of his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, of wounding his character, and of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the people. At the concluſion, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of his public employments, he deemed it a duty which he owed to himſelf, to his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and to truth, to detail the circumſtances, and ſolemnly to declare, that the letters (the dates of which he recites) are a baſe forgery, were never written by him, and that he never ſaw or heard of them, until they appeared in print. During the period in which he held the ſupreme command of the army, and his civil adminiſtration, the purity of his own mind prevented him from contradicting the falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood by any public declaration, but upon his retiring to private life, and not knowing how ſoon a more ſerious event might take place, he made this public declaration, and requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that it might be depoſited in the office of the department of ſtate, as a teſtimony of the truth to the preſent generation and to poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>

On the and of March, 1797, General Waſhington took farewell of all public em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, and loſt Philadelphia for his eſmte at Mount Vernon; in every town through which he paſſed on his way, he received the grateful and affectionate addreſſes, which were, ſo juſtly due to his merits from an etlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and grateful people.</p>
            <p>Having thus amply deſeribed the <hi>august Washington</hi> in his, public character and offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial capacity, ſuffer, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> life of General Waſhington, tho'<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs known than the dazzling ſplendor of his military activements, is not leſs ediſying in example, or worthy the attention of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen. The conſpicuous character he has acted on the theatre of human affair, the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form dignity with which he ſuſtained his part amidſt difficuties of the moſt diſcour aging na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the glory of having arrived through them at the hour of triumph, have made many official and literary perſons, on both ſides of the ocean, ambitious of a correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with him. Theſe correſpondencies unavoidably engroſſed a great, portion of his
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:037222_0112_100C98AEDF636298"/>time; and the communications contained in them, comb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ed with the numerous period<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical publications and news-papers which he peruſed, rendered him as it were, the <hi>focus of political intelligence for the new world.</hi> Nor were his converſations with well informed men leſs conducive to bring him acquainted with the various events which happened in the different countries of the globe. Every foreigner of diſtinction who travelled in America made it a point to viſit him. Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Congreſs and other dignified perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages did not paſs his houſe without calling to pay their reſpects. As another ſource of information it may be mentioned, that many literary productions were ſent to him annual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by their authors in Europe; and that there is ſcarcely one work written in America on any art, ſcience, or ſubject, which did not ſeek his protection, or which was not offered to him as a token of gratitude. Mechanical inventions were frequently ſubmitted to him for his approbation, and natural curioſities preſented to him for his inveſtigation. But the multiplicity of epiſtolary applications, often on the remains of ſome buſineſs which happened when he was in office, ſometimes on ſubjects foreign to his ſituation, frivolous in their nature, and intended merely to gratify
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:037222_0113_100C98B07A841658"/>the vanity of the writers by drawing anſwers from him, were truly diſtreſſing and almoſt incredible. His benignity in anſwering, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps increaſed the number. Did he not huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band every moment to the beſt advantage, it would not have been in his power to notice the vaſt variety of ſubjects that claimed his attention.</p>
            <p>In his manner of living he was extremely regular, temperate and induſtrious. He roſe winter and ſummer at the dawn of day, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally read or wrote ſometime before break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt: breakfaſted about ſeven o'clock on In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian hoe-cake and tea, and often rode imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to his different farms, and remained with his labourers till a little after two o'clock, when he returned; at three he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, commonly on a ſingle diſh, and drank from half a pint to a pint of Madeira wine, this, with one ſmall diſh of tea which he took half an hour before the ſetting of the ſun, conſtituted his whole ſuſtenance till the next day. His table, however, was always furniſhed with elegance and exuberance, but was void of pomp: and whether he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany or not, he remained an hour at table in familiar converſation.—His temper was of a ſerious caſt, and his countenance carried the impreſſion of thoughtfulneſs; yet he perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:037222_0113_100C98B07A841658"/>reliſhed a pleaſant ſtory, an unaffected ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of wit, or a burleſque deſcription. After dinner he applied himſelf to buſineſs and about nine retired to reſt; but when he had company he politely attended upon them till they wiſhed to withdraw.—Agriculture was his favourite employment, he made obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on the pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uce of lands, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to throw new light upon the buſineſs of the farmer; linen and woolen cloaths were manufactured under his roof, and order and economy were eſtabliſhed in all his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments both within and without doors.— Mrs. Waſhington preſided over the whole, and united to the qualities of an excellent farmer's wife, that ſimple dignity which ought to characteriſe a woman whoſe huſband has acted ſo diſtinguiſhed a part on the public theatre.—Such is the hiſtory of the private life of this great character.</p>
            <p>In 1798, the unparalleled treatment which the American miniſters received at Paris from the republic of France, left little ground to hope for any amicable accommodation with that republic, in conſequence of which, the military forces of the United States were greatly augmented, and the Preſident, with the advice of the Senate, appointed <hi>George Washington, Lieutenant General and
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:037222_0114_100C98B2C8C5CDC8"/>commander in chief of all the armies raised or to be raised by the United States,</hi> this wiſe 02 and judicious appointment was attended with the happieſt effect, the virtue of a general ſo well experienced in war, eſtabliſhed the nation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al dignity and independence, and inſpired the citizens with enthuſiaſm. On receiving the appointment, the General expreſſed a wiſh that it had fallen upon a man leſs advanced in years, and better qualified to encounter the viciſſitudes of war, he recurred to his deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of cloſing his life in retirement and peace, but the conduct of the directory of France towards our country, he ſaid "exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in his breaſt correſponding ſentiments with the reſt of his countrymen," in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of which, he accepted the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with this reſerve, that, "he ſhould not be called into the field, until the army was in a ſituation to require his preſence, or it became indiſpenſable by the urgency of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances," he informed the Preſident, "he could not accept of any emolument annexed to the appointment, before entering into a ſituation to incur expence."</p>
            <p>He held this command, and contributed his advice and aſſiſtance towards the arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and organization of the army until the 14th of December, 1799, when it pleaſed
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:037222_0114_100C98B2C8C5CDC8"/>Divine Providence to remove him from this life—he was in his 68th year, and in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of perfect health, the diſorder of which he died was an inflamatory ſore throat, which proceeded from a ſlight cold.</p>
            <p>"On Friday, the 13th, he rode out to one of his plantations, and was much wet by the rain, on returning He was taken with the <hi>croup</hi> that night; but from humanity to his ſervants and tenderneſs to his phyſician, <hi>very unfortunately</hi> declined ſending for medical aid, until day-light on Saturday morning.</p>
            <p>"Before Dr. Craik arrived at Mount Vernon, the General had been bled by one of his over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeers. The doctor repeated the ſame imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately; to whom the General obſerved, "he had ſent for him too late;" and ſeemed to have a preſentiment of his diſſolution, Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors Dick and Brown alſo attended.</p>
            <p>"As his reſpiration became difficult, he ſaid calmly, "<hi>doctors, I die hard</hi>" But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the excrutiating agonies of his violent diſeaſe, he tranquilly aſked ſeveral queſtions during the evening. About fifteen minutes before he died (which was between 11 and 12 o'clock, on Saturday night, the 14th of December) he ſaid to Doctor Craik "<hi>doctor, what is the clock? how long am I to continue in this situation?</hi>" The doctor an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:037222_0115_100C98B53B442268"/>
               <hi>"Not long sir?"</hi> He then rejoined with the firmeſt countenance imaginable, "<hi>I 02 have no fear, doctor, to die."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mrs. Waſhington was at the bed ſide with his family, and a number of domeſtics in the room. He would not wound their ſenſibility by taking a formal leave of any one.—At laſt his breathing grew ſhorter, —<hi>be closed his eyes and mouth with his own hands,</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired! —Thus did the laſt moments of this venerable man correſpond with the whole te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of his well ſpent life. He died with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect reſignation to the will of Heaven, and in full poſſeſſion of his reaſon, not a groan or complaint eſcaped him!</p>
            <p>His body was entombed, with ſolemn ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and funeral pomp, in the family vault, upon the eſtate of Mount Vernon, attended by the clergy, military, maſonic brethren, and a numerous concourſe of citizens.</p>
            <p>The melancholy intelligence of the death of General Waſhington, was every where re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived throughout the United States, with ſenſations of ſorrow and regret; the houſes of Congreſs for a period adjourned; they condoled with the Preſident of the United States, on the loſs our country had ſuſtained in the death of her worthieſt citizen, they went into mourning, and requeſted the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:037222_0115_100C98B53B442268"/>to iſſue his proclamation, recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the citizens throughout the Union, to wear black crape on the leſt arm for thirty days; all the ſtate aſſemblies followed the example: orders were iſſued from the war of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, navy department, &amp;c. requeſting the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers to wear crape on the left arm for ſix months, and the voſſels of the navy to put on mourning for one week, by wearing their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours half maſt high</p>
            <p>Orders were iſſued by the direction of the Preſident of the United States, announcing to the army the death of its <hi>beloved chief,</hi> and requeſted the military honours therein, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying to be paid at the ſeveral ſtations of the army.</p>
            <p>The Senate and Houſe of Repreſentatives of the United States, enacted "that a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble monument be erected in the capitol in the city of Waſhington, to the memory of Gen. Waſhington; and that his family be requeſted to permit his body to be depoſited under it— and that the monument be ſo deſigned as to commemorate the great military and political events of his life. That there be a funeral proceſſion, and a public oration delivered on the occaſion. To the above reſolution Mrs. Waſhington aſſented, ſacrifing her private wiſhes and individual feelings to the public
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:037222_0116_100C98B753E89690"/>will. The public proceſſion took place in Philadelphia on thurſday December the 26th, the ceremony was judiciouſly conducted; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps there never was a greater diſplay of public mourning, ſolemnity and reſpect, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited in the weſtern hemiſphere; the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangements united every deſcription of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic and private character, civil and military; the funeral ſervice, adapted with great felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the occaſion, was pronounced by Biſhop White, the deceaſed being of the epiſcopal church, after which, General Lee, who was appointed by Congreſs for that purpoſe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered the funeral oration—we ſhall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>Having purſued this diſtinguiſhed man throughout his public life and in his private retreat, it only now remains that we deſcribe his perſon, which bears a very great analogy to the qualifications of his mind.</p>
            <p>General Waſhington was a tall well made man, rather large boned, and had a tolerable genteel addreſs: his features were manly and bold, his eyes of a bluiſh caſt and very lively; his hair a deep brown, his face rather long and marked with the ſmall pox; his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion ſun burnt and without much colour,
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:037222_0116_100C98B753E89690"/>and his countenance ſenſible, compoſed, and thoughtful; there was a remarkable air of dignity about him, with a ſtriking degree of gracefulneſs: He had an excellent under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding without much quickneſs; was ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly juſt, vigilant, and generous; an affection<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate huſband, a faithful friend, a father to the deſerving; gentle in his manners, in temper rather reſerved; a total ſtranger to religious prejudices, which have ſo often excited Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians of one denomination to cut the throats of thoſe of another; in his morals irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachable; he was never known to exceed the bounds of the moſt rigid temperance: in a word, all his friends and acquaintance univerſally allow that no man ever united in his own perſon, a more perfect alliance of the virtues of a philoſopher with the talents of a ſtateſman and a general. Condour, ſincerity, affability and ſimplicity ſeem to have been the ſtriking features of his character. The beſt portraits ever taken of him, are thoſe paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ingenious Mr. Stewart of German<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town, and the beſt engraving is the large me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zotinto done by Mr. Savage of Philadelphia.</p>
            <p>Such is the life and character of the man to whom America intruſted her important cauſe, and ſhe has had every reaſon to be ſatisfied with her choice; and moſt ungrateful would

Whether eaſy or nor to ſelect the man who might comport with his lordſhip's opinion in this reſpect, is not for me to ſay; but conceiving that no diſpoſition of this va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable curioſity can be more eligible than the re-commitment of it to his own cabinet, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeably to the original deſign of the Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmith's company of Edinburgh, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented it to him, and, at his requeſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented that it ſhould be transferred to me— I bequeath the ſame to his lordſhip; and, in caſe of his deceaſe, to his heir, with my grateful thanks for the diſtinguiſhed honour of preſenting it to me, and more eſpecially for the favourable ſentiments with which he accompanied it.</p>

To my compatriot in arms and old and intimate friend, Dr. Craik,
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:037222_0120_100C98C0618423A0"/>I give my bureau (or as the cabinet makers call it, tambour ſecretary) and the circular chair, an appendage to my ſtudy. To Dr. David Stuart I give my large ſhaving and dreſſing table, and my teleſcope. To the Rev. now Bryan Lord Fairfax, I give a bible in three large folio volumes, with notes, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to me by the Rt. Rev. Thomas Wilſon, Biſhop of Sodor and Man. To Gen. de la Fayette I give a pair of finely wrought ſteel piſtols, taken from the enemy during the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutionary war. To my ſiſters-in-law, Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah Waſhington and Mildred Waſhington— to my friends Elenor Stuart, Hannah Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington of Fairfield, and Elizabeth Waſhing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton of Hayfield, I give, each, a mourning ring, of the value of one hundred dollars. Theſe bequeſts are not made for the intrinſic value of them, but as mementos of my eſteem and regard. To Tobias Lear I give the uſe of the farm which he now holds free from rent during his life. To Sally B. Haynie (a diſtant relation of mine) I give and bequeath three hundred dollars. To Sarah Green, daughter of the deceaſed Thomas Biſhop, and to Ann Walker, daughter of John Alton, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo deceaſed, I give each one hundred dollars, in conſideration of the attachment of their fathers to me; each of whom having lived nearly forty years in my family.
