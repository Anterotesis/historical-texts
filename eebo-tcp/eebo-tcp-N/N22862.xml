            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>BIOGRAPHICAL memoirs of perſons, famous for the great good or the great miſchief they have done, are ſo ſure to meet with a favourable reception in print, that it has long been ſubject of
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:030204_0004_0FE51038D7D009F0"/>
aſtoniſhment, that none of the diſciples of Paine ſhould ever have thought of obliging the world with an account of his life. His being of mean birth could form no reaſonable objection: when the life of his hero is ſpotleſs, the biographer feels a pride as well as a pleaſure in tracing him from the penu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſhed to the pinnacle of renown. Beſides, thoſe from whom we might have expected the hiſtory of Old Common Senſe, are profeſſed admirers of all that is of low and even baſe extraction. They are continually boaſting of the ſuperior virtues of their "democratic floor," as they call it; it, therefore, ſeems wonderful, that they ſhould have neglected giving an inſtance of this ſuperiority in the life of their <hi>virtuous</hi> leader.</p>
            <p>This unaccountable negligence of Paine's friends has, in ſome meaſure, been compenſated by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of the friends of order and religion. His life was publiſhed in London, in 1793; but, like moſt other works calculated to ſtem the torrent of popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar prejudice, it has never found admittance into the American preſs. I am afraid it will be a laſting reproach on thoſe, into whoſe hands this preſs has fallen, that while thouſands upon thouſands of that blaſphemous work, "the Age of Reaſon," were ſtruck off, the inſtant it arrived in the country, not a ſingle copy of the life and crimes of the blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer, ſo fit to counteract his diabolical efforts, was printed in the whole Union.</p>
            <p>This little pamphlet has, at laſt, fallen into my hands, and were I to delay communicating it to the public, I ſhould be unworthy of that liberty of the preſs, which, in ſpite of lying pamphlets and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:030204_0005_0FE51084A72656C0"/>
letters, I am determined to enjoy, while I have types and paper at my command.</p>
            <p>The reader muſt obſerve that this account of Paine's Life, is an abſtract of his life, a larger work, written by <hi>Francis Oldys,</hi> A. M. of the Univerſity of Pennſylvania, and publiſhed by Mr. Stockdale of London. The following extract is taken from the London Review of the work.—<q>A more co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent reaſon cannot be given for this publication, than that which is aſſigned by the writer of Mr. Paine's Life, in the following ſhort exordium.— <hi>It has been eſtabliſhed by the reiterated ſuffrage of mankind, that the lives of thoſe perſons, who have either performed uſeful actions, or neglected eſſential duties, ought to be recounted, as much for an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to the preſent age, as for the inſtruction of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture times.</hi>—THOMAS PAIN <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <q>In a note we are informed by <hi>Mr. Oldys,</hi> that this is the real name; and that his fictitious name is <hi>Paine</hi> with a final <hi>e;</hi> for that his father's name was <hi>Pain;</hi> his own name was <hi>Pain</hi> when he married, when he correſponded with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, and when he firſt appeared in America. But finding ſome inconvenience in his real name, or ſeeing ſome advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in a fictitious one, he thus changed the name of his family; and he thus exerciſed a freedom which <hi>the great</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy for honourable ends.</q>
                  </note> (proceed the Reviewers) is placed preciſely in this predica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. His actions have ſtamped him a public character, and from his public conduct much uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful information and inſtruction may be derived. In his tranſactions as a private individual, we find the records of villainy in various ſhapes, not impoſing upon mankind under any impene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trable maſk, or cloſe-wrought veil, but, almoſt from the beginning, openly and avowedly prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:030204_0006_0FE5103A60450068"/>
in the broad face of day. The facts on which he ſtands convicted by his Biographer are not lightly ſtated, but are ſupported by authentic documents and ſubſtantiated by evidence.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall detain the reader here but a moment, to obſerve, that theſe Reviewers were, and are, the partizans of Paine, rather than otherwiſe; and that, in many parts of their review, they have attempted to palliate his crimes.</p>
            <q>
               <p>The following abſtract of the Life of <hi>Paine,</hi> by Mr. <hi>Oldys</hi> of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> will perhaps be accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the world; as every fact in it is, by the confeſſion of Paine himſelf, of his friends, and of his enemies, undeniably authentic.<note n="*" place="bottom">That part of this eſſay which the reader finds thus mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with inverted commas, is taken from the printed copy. The reſt, whether good or bad, whether republican or anti-republican, I am ready to take upon myſelf.</note>
               </p>
               <p>THOMAS PAINE was born at Thetford, in the county of Norfolk (in England), on the 29th of January, 1736-7. His father was Joſeph Pain, a ſtaymaker by trade, and of the ſect of the Quakers. His mother, Frances Cocke, daughter of an attorney at Thetford, and of the eſtabliſhed Church.</p>
               <p>By ſome accident, probably ariſing from the diſagreement of his parents in their religious ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:030204_0007_0FE5108777664810"/>
the ſon was never baptized. He was, however, confirmed at the uſual age, by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Norwich, through the care of his aunt, Miſtreſs Cocke.</p>
               <p>At the free-ſchool of Thetford, under Mr. Knowles, young Paine was inſtructed in reading, writing, and arithmetic. The expenſe of his edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation was defrayed by his father, with ſome aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance from his mother's relations.—At the age of thirteen, he became his father's apprentice, in the trade of a ſtaymaker. At this employment he continued for five years; although he, himſelf, forgetful or regardleſs of the truth, has, in the ſecond part of his Rights of Man, related, that he entered, at the age of ſixteen, on board the <hi>Terrible</hi> privateer, Captain Death; which was not fitted out till ſome years afterwards.</p>
               <p>He went, at the age of nineteen, to try his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune in London; where he worked for ſome time with Mr. <hi>Morris,</hi> an eminent ſtaymaker in Hano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-ſtreet, Long-acre.—After a very ſhort ſtay in this ſituation, he repaired to Dover; and there obtained employment with Mr. <hi>Grace,</hi> a reſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſtaymaker. While Paine remained here, an attachment began between him and Miſs Grace, his maſter's daughter: in conſequence of which, Mr. Grace was induced to lend our adventurer ten pounds, to enable him to ſettle as a maſter-ſtaymaker at Sandwich.</p>
               <p>He ſettled at Sandwich in April, 1759; but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got to repay the ten pounds, or to fulfil the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, in expectation of which the money had
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:030204_0008_0FE5103D310A5628"/>
been advanced to him.—Here, it ſeems, he took up his lodging in the market place; and formed a little congregation, to whom he preached, in his lodging, as <hi>an independent miniſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean time, he fell in love with a pretty, modeſt, young woman, <hi>Mary Lambert,</hi> daughter of James Lambert; who, with his wife Mary, had come to <hi>Sittingbourne</hi> as an exciſeman, before the year 1736; but, having been diſmiſſed for miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conduct, had opened a ſhop, and acted, beſides, as bum-bailiff of Sittingbourne. Both father and mother were by this time dead, in indigent cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances; and the daughter was now waiting-woman to Mrs. Solly, wife of Richard Solly, an eminent woollen-draper at Sandwich.—Mary Lambert and Thomas Paine were married on the 27th of September, 1759. Although he was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly twenty-two, and ſhe twenty-one years of age, yet, by the ſcars of diſeaſe, or by the native harſhneſs of his features, he appeared at the time of the marriage ſo much older than ſhe, that the good women of Sandwich expreſſed their aſtoniſhment, that <hi>ſo fine a girl ſhould marry ſo old a fellow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thomas, ſoon after the marriage, finding himſelf ſomehow diſappointed, began to maltreat his wife. Little more than two months had paſſed, when this became viſible to the whole town. By Mrs. Solly's aid, their poverty was occaſionally relieved. From the furniſhed lodging in which Paine had hitherto lived, the young couple ſoon removed to a houſe, for which they, with ſome difficulty, obtained furniture upon credit. But he having contracted debts which he was unable to diſcharge, our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturer,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:030204_0009_0FE5108F35A571B8"/>
with his wife, found themſelves obliged to take what is called in Scotland, a <hi>moonlight flitting;</hi> and, on the night between the ſeventh and eighth of April, 1760, they ſet out from Sandwich to Margate; Thomas carrying with him the furniture which he had purchaſed on credit, a ſtove belonging to his houſe, and the ſtays of a cuſtomer. The ſtays were recovered from him by a timeful claim. He ſold the furniture by auc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at Margate.—The ſale of goods obtained upon credit on a falſe pretext, is a crime that was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly puniſhed by expoſure on the pillory, which has ſince been changed for tranſportation.</p>
            </q>
            <p>At this place, the reader will undoubtedly call to mind Paine's vehement ſallies againſt the Engliſh penal code. All the <hi>patriots</hi> look upon law-givers, judges, juries, and the whole ſuite of juſtice, as their mortal enemies. "Inhuman wretches," ſays Tom, <q>that are leagued together to rob Man of his Rights, and with them of his exiſtence.</q> This is like the thief, who, when about to receive ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of death, proteſted he would ſwear the peace againſt the judge, for that he verily believed he had a deſign upon his life.—Reader, while you live ſuſpect thoſe tender-hearted fellows who ſhudder at the name of the gallows. When you hear a man loud againſt the ſeverity of the laws, ſet him down for a rogue.</p>

               <q>From Margate, Paine returned to London. His wife ſet out with him: but her ſubſequent fate is not well known. Some ſay that ſhe periſhed on the road, by ill uſage and a premature birth:
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:030204_0010_0FE5104385742DE0"/>
others, in conſequence of diligent inquiry, believe her to be ſtill alive; although the obſcurity of her retreat prevents ready diſcovery.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now, who that reads this, does not feel a deſire to kick the ſcoundrel of a ſtay-maker, for exclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt ariſtocracy, becauſe, as he pretends, its laws and cuſtoms are cruel and unnatural?— "With what kind of parental reflections," ſays the hypocrite in his Rights of Man, <q>can the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and mother contemplate their tender off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring?—To reſtore parents to their children, and children to their parents, relations to each other, and man to ſociety, the French Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has deſtroyed the law of primogenitureſhip.</q> —Is not this fine cant to entrap the unſuſpecting vulgar? Who would not imagine that the ſoul which pours itſelf forth in joy for the reſtoration of all theſe dear relatives to each other, was made up of conſtancy and tenderneſs? Who would ſuſpect the man whoſe benevolence is thus extended to foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, whom he never ſaw, of being a brutal and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage huſband, and an unnatural father?—Do you aſk, <q>with what kind of parental reflections the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and mother can contemplate their tender offspring?</q>—Hypocritical monſter! with what kind of reflections did you contemplate the laſt agonies of a poor, weak, credulous woman, who had braved the ſcoffs of the world, who had aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned every thing for your ſake, had put her all in your poſſeſſion, and who looked up to you, and you alone, for ſupport?</p>
            <p>Paine's humanity, like that of all the reforming philoſophers of the preſent enlightened day, is of
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:030204_0011_0FE5109206797C68"/>
the ſpeculative kind. It never breaks out into ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Hear theſe people, and you would think them overflowing with the milk of human kindneſs. They ſtretch their benevolence to the extremities of the globe: it embraces every living creature—except thoſe who have the misfortune to come in contact with them. They are all citizens of the world: country and friends and relations are unworthy the attention of men who are occupied in rendering all mankind happy and free.</p>
            <p>I ever ſuſpect the ſincerity of a man whoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe abounds in expreſſions of univerſal philan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropy. Nothing is eaſier than for a perſon of ſome imagination to raiſe himſelf to a ſwell of ſentiment, without the aid of one ſingle feeling of the heart. Rouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeau, for inſtance, is everlaſtingly babbling about his <hi>genre humain</hi> (human race) and his <hi>"coeur aimant et tendre"</hi> (tender and loving heart). He writes for the human race, his heart bleeds for the diſtreſſes of the human race, and, in the midſt of all this, he ſends his unfortunate baſtards to the poor-houſe, the receptacle of miſery! Virtuous and tender-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſympathetic Rouſſeau! Certainly nothing is ſo diſguſting as this, except it be to ſee the humane and ſentimental Sterne wiping away a tear at the ſight of a dead jack-aſs, while his injured wife and child were pining away their days in a nunnery, and while he was debauching the wife of his friend.<note n="*" place="bottom">Sterne's writings are moſt admirably calculated to deſtroy the morals of the youth of both ſexes; but it was reſerved for ſome of the printers in the United States to give thoſe writings the finiſhing touch. What the lewd author was aſhamed to do, they have done for him. They have explained his <hi>double en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendres</hi> and <hi>filthy inuendos</hi> by a ſet of the moſt bawdy cuts that ever diſgraced the pencil.—I was ſhown a copy of the <hi>Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental</hi> Journey in this ſtyle at the ſhop of Citizen Thomas Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford of Philadelphia, the only place in the city, I believe, where it is to be had.</note>

               <p>In July, 1761<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thomas returned, without her, to his father's houſe.—Having been unſucceſsful in the buſineſs of a ſtay-maker, he was now willing to leave it for the Exciſe. In the Exciſe, after four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen months of ſtudy and trials, he was eſtabliſhed on the 1ſt of December 1762, at the age of twenty-five. The kindneſs of Mr. Cockſedge, record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Thetford, procured for him this appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. He was ſent, as a ſupernumerary, firſt to Grantham; and on the 8th of Auguſt 1764, to Alford.—Being detected in ſome miſconduct, he was, on the 27th of Auguſt 1765, diſmiſſed from his office.</p>
               <p>In this ſtate of wretchedneſs and diſgrace, he repaired to London a third time. Here charity ſupplied him with clothes, money, and lodging; till he was, on the 11th of July 1766, reſtored to the Exciſe, although not to immediate employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.—For ſupport, in the mean time, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged himſelf for a ſalary of five and twenty pounds a year, in the ſervice of Mr. Noble; who keeping an academy in Lemon-ſtreet, Goodman's fields, wanted an uſher to teach Engliſh, and walk out with the children. He won nobody's favour in this family: and, at Chriſtmas, left the ſervice of Mr. Noble for that of Mr. Gardner, who then taught a reputable ſchool at Kenſington. With Mr. Gardner he continued only three months.—He would now willingly have taken orders; but, being only an Engliſh ſcholar, could
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:030204_0013_0FE51093FAF21A68"/>
not obtain the certificate of his qualifications previouſly neceſſary. Being violently moved, however, with the ſpirit of preaching, he wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered about for a while as an itinerant Methodiſt; and, as urged by his neceſſities, or directed by his ſpirit, preached in Moorfields, and in various populous places in England.</p>
               <p>At length, in March 1768, he again obtained employment in his calling of an Exciſe-officer; and was ſent in this capacity, to Lewes in Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex.—He was now, at the age of thirty-one, ambitious of ſhining as a <hi>jolly fellow</hi> among his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions; yet without reſtraining his ſullen, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing temper; although to the neglect of his duty as an Exciſe-man. By his intrepidity in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and on ice, he gained the appellation of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modore.</hi> He had gone to live with Mr. Samuel Ollive, a tobacconiſt; and in his houſe he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued till that worthy man's death. Mr. Ollive died in bad circumſtances; leaving a widow, one daughter, and ſeveral ſons. For ſome diſhoneſt intermeddling with the effects of his deceaſed land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord, Paine was turned out of the houſe by Mr. Atterſol, the executor. But, being more favourably regarded by the widow and daughter, he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived again by them in 1770. He ſoon after commenced grocer; opening Ollive's ſhop in his own name. He, at the ſame time worked the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco mill on his own behalf; and, regardleſs of the regulations of the Exciſe, and of his duty as an Exciſe-officer, for ſeveral years continued this trade, engaging without ſcruple in ſmuggling prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices, in order to render it lucrative.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="unknown:030204_0014_0FE5104809A5C1D0"/>In 1771, at the age of thirty-four, he again ventured on matrimony. Elizabeth Ollive, the daughter of his late landlord, whom he now mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, was a handſome and worthy woman, eleven years younger than himſelf; and, had it not been for her unfortunate attachment to him, might have married to much greater advantage.—Upon the occaſion of this ſecond marriage, Thomas Paine thought proper to repreſent himſelf as a batchelor, although he muſt have known that he was either a widower,—or, indeed, if his former wife was then alive, a married man;—and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the marriage act has declared it to be felo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, without benefit of clergy, for a perſon thus wilfully to make a falſe entry on the regiſter.— In the ſame year, Paine firſt commenced author. —<hi>Rumbold,</hi> candidate for New Shoreham, requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſong to celebrate the patriotiſm and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viviality of the occaſion. Paine produced one, which was accepted, and rewarded with three gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas.—His poetical honours he ſeems to have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards forgotten; for, in 1779, he aſſerted in the news-papers, that, till the appearance of his <hi>Common Senſe,</hi> he had never publiſhed a ſylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>By a certain boldneſs and buſtle of character, although without the recommendation of honeſty, he had become a ſort of chief among the Exciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. They began about this time to be diſſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, that their ſalaries were not augmented with the increaſe of the national wealth, of the public revenue, and of the price of the neceſſaries of life. Citizen Paine undertook to write their <hi>Caſe;</hi> and, in 1772, produced an octavo pamphlet of one
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:030204_0015_0FE5109588E24EA8"/>
and twenty pages, containing an <hi>Introduction; The State of the Salary of the Officers of Exciſe; and Thoughts on the Corruption ariſing from the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty of Exciſe-Officers.</hi> Of this pamphlet four thouſand copies were printed. A contribution was made by the Exciſemen, to ſupply the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſes attending the ſolicitation of their caſe. Paine buſtled about, as their agent, in London, in the winter of 1773. But nothing was done; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though liberally paid by his employers, he forgot to pay his printer.</p>
               <p>In his attention to the common cauſe of the Exciſemen, he had neglected his own private af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs. His credit failed. He ſunk into difficulties and diſtreſs: and, in this ſituation, made a bill of ſale of his whole effects to Mr. Whitfield, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable grocer at Lewes, and his principal credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. Mr. Whitfield, ſeeing no proſpect of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, took poſſeſſion of the premiſes, and, in April 1774, diſpoſed of them as his own. The other creditors, thinking themſelves outwitted by Whitfield, and cheated by Paine, had recourſe to the rigours of law. Paine ſought concealment for a time in the cock-loft of the Whitehorſe-inn.</p>
               <p>About the ſame time, he was again diſmiſſed from the Exciſe. His careleſſneſs of the duties of his office—dealing as a grocer in exciſeable articles—buying ſmuggled tobacco, as a grinder of ſnuff—and conniving at others for the conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it himſelf—could no longer be overlooked or excuſed. His diſmiſſion took place on the 8th of April, 1774. He petitioned to be reſtored, but without ſucceſs.</p>

               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:030204_0016_0FE5104990EC7948"/>Reader, how often have I obſerved, that diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, and refuſal of favours aſked from go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, are the great ſources of what is now-a-days called patriotiſm? Here we are arrived at the cauſe of Tom Paine's mortal enmity to the Britiſh government. Had his humble petition been grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; had he been reſtored to his office, he might, and undoubtedly would, have ſtigmatized the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans as rebels and traitors. He would have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably been among the ſuppleſt tools of Lord North, inſtead of by the champion of American Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence.</p>
            <p>Who, after reading this, will believe that he was actuated by laudable motives, when he wrote againſt taxation; when he called the exciſe a hell-born monſter? He long was, you ſee, an advocate for this hell-born monſter, and even one of its choice miniſters, and ſuch would he have been to this day, had not his <hi>petition</hi> been rejected. What, Thomas! Petition to be one of the under-devils of a hell-born monſter!</p>
            <p>Whatever may be the ſervices which his vindic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive pen rendered to the cauſe of the United States, the people of this country owe him no tribute of gratitude, any more than they do to the pretended friendſhip of the French court, or nation. Both had the ſame objects in view: the furthering of their intereſts and glutting of their revenge. They looked upon the revolted coloniſts as their tools, and if America profited by their interference, it was owing to the wiſdom of her councils, and not to their good-will.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:030204_0017_0FE510A07AD98570"/>When patriot Tom began his career in America, it was aſſuredly very neceſſary for him to aſſert, that, till the appearance of his <hi>Common Senſe,</hi> he had never publiſhed a ſingle ſyllable; for, it would have looked a little aukward to ſee that work coming from the pen of a diſcarded exciſe officer, who had petitioned for a reinſtatement in his oppreſſive of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. Not a whit leſs aukward does it now appear, to hear clamours againſt the expenſes of the Britiſh government coming from the very man who would willingly have added to thoſe expenſes by an aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation of his own ſalary. He tells the poor peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Great Britain, that their <q>hard-earned pence are wrung from them by the king and his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters;</q> yet, we ſee, that he wiſhed a little more to be wrung from them, when he expected a ſhare.— Diſintereſted and compaſſionate ſoul!</p>
            <p>The Engliſh Clergy, too, and the tithes they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, have been conſiderable objects of Thomas's out-cry. Thoſe battering-rams, called the Rights of Man, have been directed againſt theſe with their full force. But what would the hypocrite have ſaid, had he been able to ſlip within the walls of the church? Like Dr. Prieſtley, Tom looks upon tithes as oppreſſive, merely becauſe he is not a rector.</p>
            <p>How little his attempt to obtain. Holy Orders (ſacrilegious monſter!) and his Methodiſt preaching agree with the opinions expreſſed in his <q>Age of Reaſon</q> I ſhall notice, when I come to that epoch in his life, when he found it convenient to throw aſide the maſk, and become an open blaſphemer; but I cannot quit him in this place, without obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the remarkable ſimilarity in the career of
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:030204_0018_0FE510536AFE64B8"/>
Tom and that of <hi>Old John Swanwick.</hi> Both had paid off their debts in England with a ſpunge, both had been field preachers, and both had been exciſe officers, when the American war broke out: at this moment they ſeparated. After having gone ſide by ſide during their whole lives, they ſteered a courſe directly oppoſite to each other. Paine became a flaming patriot, while Swanwick remained a royaliſt. —How came this? Why, Swanwick was ſtill in office, whereas poor Tom was diſmiſſed. Had Swanwick been diſmiſſed and Paine in office, Tom would have followed the Britiſh waggons to New-York, and Swanwick would, probably, have written <hi>Common Sense.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With the reader's permiſſion, I will juſt ſtep aſide from my ſubject, to aſk, how it happened, that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen John Swanwick, now one of the auguſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives of the city of which I have the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to be an inhabitant, came to be a ſtanch whig, while his reſpectable ſire was as zealous a waggon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter as any in the Royal army? Mr. Swanwick was, I preſume, too young, at that time, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the amazing advantage that a citizen enjoys over a ſubject; and, as he profeſſes a great deal of filial piety, one may reaſonably ſuppoſe, that he would have followed the fortunes of his father, had not his remaining behind been in conſequence of a concerted plan. This is a ſtroke of domeſtic policy, which has been often practiſed in tickliſh times, but never with more complete ſucceſs than in the preſent inſtance. The father was a <hi>faithful subject</hi> and the ſon a <hi>firm patriot;</hi> the father ſang <hi>God save the king</hi> and the ſon <hi>Yankey-doodle;</hi> the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther got a <hi>penſion</hi> and the ſon a <hi>seat in Congreſs.</hi>—
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:030204_0019_0FE510A261969648"/>
I could continue a little further here, but it is time to return to our old broken exciſeman.</p>
            <q>
               <p>Amid this knavery and miſmanagement, Paine had not diſtinguiſhed himſelf by conjugal tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to his ſecond wife. He had now lived with her three years and a half, and, beſides cruelly beating, had otherwiſe treated her, wilfully and ſhamefully, in a manner which would excite the indignation and reſentment of every virtuous married woman; and which muſt enſure to him the deteſtation of every honourable man. From an attention to the known delicacy and modeſty of our fair country-women, we forbear, in this abſtract, to ſtate the particulars, though they are publiſhed at length in Mr. Oldys's pamphlet.—The conſequence of all this was a ſeparation between him and his wife, upon the conditions of her paying her huſband thirty-five pounds ſterling, and his agreeing to claim no part of whatever property ſhe might thereafter acquire.</p>
               <p>Paine now retired to London; but would not leave his wife in peace till they had mutually en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into new articles of ſeparation; in which it was declared on his part, that <hi>he no longer found a wife a convenience,</hi> and on hers, that <hi>ſhe had too long suffered the miseries of such a husband.</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>This is the kind and philanthropic Tom Paine, who ſets up ſuch a piteous howl about the cruelty and tyranny of kings!—<q>I have known many of thoſe bold champions for liberty in my time,</q> ſays the good old Vicar of Wakefield, <q>yet do I not
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:030204_0020_0FE51055291AB868"/>
remember one who was not in his heart and in his family a tyrant.</q> What Dr. Johnſon obſerves of Milton may with juſtice be applied to every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual of the king-killing crew: <q>he looked upon woman as made only for obedience and man only for rebellion.</q> I would requeſt the reader to look round among his acquaintance, and ſee if this obſervation does not every where hold good; ſee if there be one among the yelping ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel of modern patriots, who is not a bad huſband, father, brother, or ſon. The ſame pride and turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of ſpirit that lead them to withhold every mark of reſpect and obedience from their ſuperiors, lead them alſo to tyrannize over thoſe who are ſo unfortunate as to be ſubjected to their will. The laws of nature will ſeldom, if ever, be reſpected by the man who has ſet thoſe of his country and of decorum at defiance; and from this degree of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity there is but one ſtep to the defiance of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven itſelf. The good citizen or ſubject, the good huſband, parent and child, and the good chriſtian, exiſt together or they exiſt not at all.</p>
            <p>From the circumſtances attending Tom's ſeparation from this laſt wife, we may make a pretty correct cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation of his value as a huſband. The poor woman was obliged to pay him thirty-five pounds ſterling to get rid of him; ſo that, a <hi>democratic spouse,</hi> even ſuppoſing him to come up to his great leader in worth is (in Federal currency) juſt one hundred and fifty-ſix dollars, ſixty-ſix cents and two-thirds of a cent, <hi>worse than nothing.</hi> Oh, baſe democra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy! Why, it is abſolutely worſe than ſtreet-ſweep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, or the filth of common-ſewers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:030204_0021_0FE510A3E9AC9FF8"/>The mob of kings that the poor French have got, have lately ſet Thomas to writing down the credit of Engliſh bank-notes, a taſk that the dregs of his old brain were quite unequal to. Inſtead of uſeleſs labours of this kind, inſtead of attempting to write down the Bible and bank-notes, I would recommend to him to oblige the people of his <q>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved America,</q> as he calls it, with a ſtatement of the ſums neceſſary to pay off all the democratic huſbands in this continent, at the price his own wife fixed on himſelf; adding to the groſs amount as much as would defray the expenſes of their tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation to their proper climate, France. Their wives, I dare ſay, would have no objection to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate Mrs. Paine, as far as their laſt farthing would go, and if all wiſdom is not baniſhed from within the walls of the Congreſs, they would never refuſe to make up the deficiency.</p>
            <p>We have ſeen enough of Tom as a huſband; now let us ſee what it is to be curſed with ſuch a ſon.</p>
            <q>
               <p>Citizen Paine now finding that his notoriouſly bad character rendered it adviſable for him to leave a country where he was known; he had the addreſs to procure a recommendation to the late Dr. Franklin, in America, as a perſon who might, at ſuch a criſis, be uſeful there. He accordingly ſailed for America in September 1774.</p>
               <p>The following letter from his mother to his wife, written about this time, proves that ſhe had the diſtreſs of knowing his crimes and misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,

            <q>
               <p>He arrived at Philadelphia in the winter of 1774, a few months before the battle of Lexington. He was firſt engaged as ſhopman, by Mr. Aitkin, a bookſeller in Philadelphia, at the wages of twenty pounds a year. In November 1775, he was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in a laboratory. He took great pains in experiments for the purpoſe of diſcovering ſome cheap, eaſy, and expeditious method of making ſaltpetre. He was alſo the propoſer of a plan for the voluntary ſupplyiog of the public magazines with gun-powder; and earneſtly laboured to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade the inhabitants of Philadelphia to adopt it.</p>
               <p>On the 10th of January 1776, was publiſhed his <hi>Common Sense,</hi> an 8vo. pamphlet of ſixty-three pages. This pamphlet was eagerly read, paſſed through ſeveral editions, and was even tranſlated into German. Proſecuting the career, upon which he had thus not unſucceſsfully entered, he, on the 19th of December 1776, publiſhed, in the <hi>Pennsylvania Journal,</hi> the firſt number of the <hi>Crisis,</hi> intended like the former work, to encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:030204_0024_0FE51059844BFDA8"/>
the Americans in their oppoſition to the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh government.—The <hi>Crisis,</hi> he continued to publiſh in occaſional numbers, till the 13th and laſt appeared on the ſame day on which a ceſſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of hoſtilities between America and Britain was proclaimed at Philadelphia, the 19th of April 1783.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Thus, we ſee, that he was hardly arrived in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, when he ſet about digging up ſaltpetre for the deſtruction of his countrymen, the ſervants of that king whom he himſelf had ſerved, and whom he would ſtill have ſerved, had he not been diſmiſſed in diſgrace. And can any one have the folly to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, or the impudence to ſay, that this man was actuated by a love of liberty and America?</p>
            <p>The unprincipled, or ſilly, admirers of Paine, when they hear their hero attacked, never fail to ſtigmatize his enemies as enemies of the American cauſe. Their object in doing this is evident enough: but, in the name of common ſenſe, what has the juſtice or injuſtice of that cauſe to do with an inquiry into the actions and motives of Paine? Is a man to be looked upon as regretting that America obtained its independence, merely becauſe he deteſts a cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, treacherous, and blaſphemous ruffian who once wrote in favour of it? Are the characters of the men who effected the ſeparation from Britain ſo cloſely united with that of Paine, that they muſt ſtand or fall together? Are the merits of the revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution itſelf at laſt to be linked to all that is baſe and infamous?</p>
            <p>No one, not even Congreſs itſelf, ever attempted to juſtify the coloniſts in their revolt againſt their
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:030204_0025_0FE510AB42BBC888"/>
ſovereign upon any other ground than this: <hi>that they were an oppressed people, unable to obtain a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress of their grievances, without appealing to arms.</hi> Seeing them in this light we muſt be careful to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude from this juſtification all thoſe ſubjects of the king, who aſſiſted them without having partaken of the oppreſſion of which they complained. Among the Americans themſelves a difference of opinion might, and did, prevail. Some looked upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as oppreſſed, others did not; both parties were fully juſtified upon the ſuppoſition that they acted agreeably to their conſciences: but a man like Paine, juſt landed in the country, could have no oppreſſion to complain of, and, therefore, his hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility againſt his country admits of no defence. He was a traitor, as were the Prieſtleys, the Prices and all others of the ſame deſcription. No good man, however zealous he might be in the revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ever reſpected Paine, of which the coldneſs and neglect he experienced, as ſoon as order was re-eſtabliſhed, is a certain proof. The faithful ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen, or ſubject, naturally deteſts a traitor: it is an impulſe that none of us can reſiſt: however we may differ in opinion in other reſpects, we all agree (to uſe one of Tom's own expreſſions) that <q>a trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor is the fouleſt fiend on earth.</q>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>In 1777, he was appointed by the Congreſs, ſecretary to their committee for foreign affairs. When Silas Deane, commercial agent for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in Europe, was recalled, to make room for William Lee once alderman of London, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention enſued between Deane and the family of the Lees; and Paine took part in the controverſy,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:030204_0026_0FE510632A2F54E8"/>
by attacking Deane. He took occaſion to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve in the diſpute the famous Robert Morris, financier of the United States. Morris inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered againſt him. And Paine was inadvertantly provoked to retail, through the channel of the newſpapers, <hi>information which had been communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to him in his office of secretary.</hi> This infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation betraying intrigues of the French court, their ambaſſador complained to Congreſs. Paine being interrogated, confeſſed himſelf the author of the newſpaper correſpondence in queſtion, and was in conſequence diſmiſſed from his office.</p>
            </q>
            <p>What remarks I have to make here I ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face by an extract from Swift's excellent work, lately publiſhed, on the laws of Connecticut, Book V. Chap. vii. Speaking of Paine's <q>baſeneſs in his attack on Chriſtianity by publiſhing his <hi>Age of Reaſon,</hi>" Mr. Swift obſerves: "this work is ſaid to be written by Thomas Paine, <hi>Secretary for fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign affairs to Congreſs in the American War.</hi> Now, the truth is, that during ſome period of the American War, Congreſs appointed a committee for foreign affairs, to which Paine was ſecretary, but he had no power, and performed no duty, but that of clerk to the committee; without any portion of the authority, afterwards annexed to the office of ſecretary for foreign affairs. From the poſt of ſecretary to the committee for foreign affairs, he was <hi>dismissed</hi> for <hi>a scandalous breach of trust.</hi> What muſt we think of a man, who is capable of ſuch a pitiful artifice to gratify his vanity, and render himſelf important?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="unknown:030204_0027_0FE510B0757F7328"/>Theſe are not the words of an Engliſhman, but of a native American, a learned and elegant writer, and a tried friend and ſervant of his country.</p>
            <p>The account given by Mr. Swift of Tom's diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion confirms that which is given of it in his life. Both accounts, however, are ſilent as to the nature of the intrigues which he divulged. As I have heard this matter often ſpoken of, by my old book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeller and others, I will juſt repeat what I have heard, without pledging myſelf for the truth of it.</p>
            <p>While Silas Deane was agent under the plenipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiary adminiſtration of Doctor Franklin, at the court of Verſailles; theſe intriguing patriots had the addreſs to procure a preſent of 200,000 ſtand of <hi>condemned arms</hi> from the king of France to the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican Congreſs: but, as this was done at a time when the French court had ſolemnly, though trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherouſly, engaged not to interfere in the diſpute, the <hi>present</hi> was to be kept a ſecret among the immediate agents. The <hi>condemned</hi> arms, given <hi>as a present,</hi> were, by the <hi>faithful agents, charged</hi> as <hi>good</hi> ones, and paid for by the United States. Who pocketed the money, was then, and is ſtill a queſtion; but there ſeems to have been but little doubt of its hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing undergone a diviſion and a ſubdiviſion, as the ſecret had extended far and wide, before poor Tom was ſilenced. I have heard more than one Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can, reputed democrats, curſe Dr. Franklin for having miſapplied the money of the country, and I imagine this muſt be what they allude to. He muſt certainly have found the philoſopher's-ſtone, if he thus poſſeſſed the gift of turning old iron into gold; and, as I do not ſee, in his will, to whom he
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:030204_0028_0FE51064B1C689D8"/>
bequeathed this precious ſtone, I would thank his <hi>grand-child</hi> to inform us, in the next number of his polite and patriotic paper, who the happy mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal is.</p>
            <p>After having heard theſe accounts of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, which all agree, let us hear what Thomas ſays about it himſelf, in the ſecond part of his <hi>Rights of Man.</hi> 
               <q>After the declaration of Independence, Congreſs unanimouſly appointed me <hi>secretary in the foreign department.</hi> But a miſunderſtanding ariſing <hi>between Congress and me,</hi> reſpecting one of their commiſſioners then in Europe, Mr. Silas Deane, <hi>I reſigned the office.</hi>
               </q>—Was there ever a more pitiful attempt at acquiring reputation than this? He was in England when he wrote thus; he would not have dared to write this paſſage in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica. He calls himſelf <hi>secretary in the foreign de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment,</hi> thereby giving to underſtand that he was a ſecretary of ſtate in America, as Lord Grenville or the Duke of Portland is in England, and as Mr. Jefferſon then was in the United States. <hi>Secretary to the committee</hi> for foreign affairs would have ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſmall; it would have made a jingle like that of half-pence, whereas <hi>secretary of state</hi> rang in the ears of his empty-headed diſciples, like guineas upon a hollow counter.</p>
            <p>
               <q>But a miſunderſtanding ariſing <hi>between Congress and me.</hi>
               </q> Here is another fetch at importance. "Between Congreſs and me!" How the London Correſponding Society and affiliated mobs ſtared at this, I dare ſay. If his miſconduct ever became a ſubject of diſcuſſion before Congreſs, that was all. A complaint was lodged againſt him, and Congreſs
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:030204_0029_0FE510B24C4B52D8"/>
diſmiſſed him; but his offence was expoſing what ſhould have been kept ſecret, in writing for the Lees againſt Silas Deane. How does he twiſt this into a miſunderſtanding between Congreſs and him? As well may the criminal ſay, he has had a miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding with the judge who condemns him.</p>
            <p>"And ſo I <hi>resigned the office.</hi>" Mr. Swift ſays, and every one in America knows, that he was <q>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missed <hi>for a</hi> scandalous breach of trust;</q> but this would not have been ſo convenient for the purpoſe of thoſe infamous combinations of men who had undertaken to ſpread his works about the three kingdoms. In the courtier's vocabulary, <hi>resigned</hi> has long been ſynonymous with <hi>dismissed, discarded,</hi> and <hi>turned out,</hi> and we ſee that Thomas, though he rails againſt courts and courtiers, did not ſcruple to employ it in the ſame way.</p>
            <p>But there was another reaſon for ſubſtituting <hi>resign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> for <hi>turned out.</hi> He had every reaſon to believe that his <hi>life</hi> would be publiſhed, and he wiſely fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw, that his having been <hi>turned out</hi> of the exciſe, and again turned out in America, would ſtagger the faith of ſome of his proſelytes. To be <hi>turned out</hi> by a monarchical government, and afterwards by a republican one, would have been a pretty convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proof, that he was friendly to no government whatever. I ſincerely believe that he hated, and that he ſtill hates, the general government of the United States (as at preſent happily eſtabliſhed), as much as the government of Great Britain. But it was neceſſary that he ſhould find out ſomething to hold up to the imitation of the Engliſh; no matter what, ſo as it differed from what they poſſeſſed.
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:030204_0030_0FE510663B23F038"/>
Being obliged, therefore, to make this uſe of the American government, he was the more anxious to hide the truth with reſpect to his <hi>dismission;</hi> for how awkward would it have looked, at the end of his pompous encomiums on the government of Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, to add: <hi>this was the government that turned me out?</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>In Auguſt 1782, Thomas Paine publiſhed a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſial letter to the Abbè Raynal, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the latter author's publication of his hiſtory of the <hi>Revolution of America.</hi> Abſurd as were the general principles which Paine had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced in his <hi>Common Sense,</hi> Raynal being in great diſtreſs for want of ſomething to ſay on the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, had adopted ſome of them. Pain reclaimed what was his own, and controverted much of the reſt that the Abbè ſaid.—His next production was a letter to the Earl of Shelburne, on the effects likely to ariſe to Great Britain from the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged independence of America.</p>
               <p>His labours had not yet received any ſubſtantial reward. He, in the mean time, ſuffered all the miſeries of penury. He now ſolicited the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can Aſſemblies to grant ſome recompenſe for the ſervices by which he had contributed to the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of their independence. New York be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on him lands of little value at New Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelle; Pennſylvania granted him five hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>In the autumn of 1786, he departed for France, after having, at New York, ſeduced a young wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of a reputable family. In the beginning of
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:030204_0031_0FE510B3D4F19668"/>
the year 1787, he arrived in Paris, and exhibited before the French academy of ſciences, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del of a bridge of peculiar conſtruction.</p>
               <p>On the 3d of September, in this ſame year, Thomas Paine arrived at the <hi>White Bear</hi> in Picca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilly, London, after an abſence of thirteen years from Britain.—His old friends recollected him; although he might have been better ſatisfied to have been forgotten by ſome of them.</p>
               <p>Before the end of 1787, he publiſhed a pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet, intituled <hi>Prospects on the Rubicon,</hi> &amp;c.—In the year 1788, he was buſy at Rotherham, in York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, about the caſting of an iron arch for the bridge of which he had preſented a model to the French academy. This bridge proved merely an expenſive project, by which the contriver was impoveriſhed, and the community not benefited. At Rotherham, his familiarities became diſagreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the women.</p>
               <p>Through various circumſtances, Paine became indebted to Whiteſide, the American merchant, whom he had employed to receive his remittances, and to furniſh his expenſes, in the ſum of ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twenty pounds. Upon the bankruptcy of Whiteſide, Paine was arreſted by order of the aſſignees, at the White Bear, Piccadilly, on the 29th of October 1789. He remained for three weeks, confined in a ſpunging-houſe, till he was at length relieved by the kind interference of two eminent American merchants, Meſſrs. Clagget and Murdock.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="unknown:030204_0032_0FE51067C7122288"/>Meanwhile, Paine had, during his involuntary retirement, liſtened eagerly to the news of the riſing commotions in France. Soon after he was ſet at liberty, therefore, he croſſed the channel, in order to be a nearer ſpectator of events in which he rejoiced. He returned to England about the time of the publication of Mr. Burke's pamphlet on the French revolution. His next work was an anſwer to Mr. Burke, in the firſt part of his <hi>Rights of Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This work was publiſhed on the 13th of March 1791, by a Mr. Jordan in Fleetſtreet. Conſcious of the ſeditious falſehoods which he had advanced in it, Paine dreaded even then the inquiries of the King's meſſengers, and ſought concealment in the houſe of his friend, Mr. Brand Hollis; while it was induſtriouſly given out by thoſe in his ſecret, that he had haſtily departed for Paris.</p>
               <p>The work which cauſed theſe fears, was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly of that caſt, by which ſuperficial read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and thinkers are moſt readily affected; groſsly invective, frequently quibbling, confounding ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals with particulars, and particulars with ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, audaciouſly bold, and ſpeaking the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of prevalent prejudices. It was, beſides, warmly recommended to the people by a <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety,</hi> who took the denomination of <hi>Constitutional.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the middle of May, after having thus labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to enlighten or confound the Britiſh nation, Paine returned to Paris. While <hi>sojourning</hi> there, he entered into a controverſy with Emanuel Syeyes,
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:030204_0033_0FE510C0C48C7D60"/>
who had been chiefly active in framing the new conſtitution of France; Syeyes in defence of that limited monarchy which the new conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution had eſtabliſhed; Paine, <hi>against the whole hell of monarchy,</hi>—to uſe his own words. This controverſy was ſoon dropped.</p>
               <p>On the 13th of July 1791, Paine again arrived at the White Bear in Piccadilly, juſt in time to aſſiſt in the celebration of the anniverſary of the French Revolution. He did not, however, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear at the public dinner on the following day. But he joined the celebrators about eight o'clock in the evening; when the people, enraged to ſee them brave the laws, and exult in events unfriend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the happineſs of Britain, had aſſembled tumultuouſly, to drive them away from the Crown and Anchor tavern, the place of their meeting. Mortified at finding thoſe hoſtile to them, whom they had hoped to ſeduce to become the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their turbulence, our republicans pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, on the 20th of Auguſt 1791, from the thatched houſe tavern, a <hi>seditious declaration,</hi> the writing of Paine, which obliged the inn-keeper to forbid them his houſe.</p>
               <p>After theſe tranſactions, Paine was preparing to viſit Ireland, in the character of an apoſtle of Democracy, when he learned that the Iriſh were already ſo well acquainted with his <hi>real character,</hi> that he might probably meet with an unfavourable reception. On this news, he retired in diſguſt, to Greenwich.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="unknown:030204_0034_0FE510728ED1BF38"/>On the 4th of November 1791, he aſſiſted, on the eve of the gun powder plot, at the accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed commemoration of the 5th of November, by the Revolution Society. He was thanked for his <hi>Rights of Man;</hi> and gave for his toaſt, the <hi>Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Immediately after this, preparing to bring forth the <hi>Second Part</hi> of his <hi>Rights of Man,</hi> he hid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in FETTER-LANE. None knew where he was concealed, except Mr. Horne—Tooke, whoſe friendly care corrected the inaccuracies of his ſtyle, and Mr. Chapman, who was employed to print his book. At Mr. Chapman's table he oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally ſpent a pleaſant evening, after the ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary labours of the day. After this commodious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe had ſubſiſted for ſeveral months, Paine was ſomehow moved to inſult Mr. Chapman's wife;<note n="*" place="bottom">See Chapman's teſtimony on oath; Paine's trial.</note> in conſequence of which the printer turned him out of doors with indignation; exclaiming that he had <hi>no more principle than a poſt, and no more religion than a ruffian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Paine has aſcribed a different origin to this quarrel with his printer: but, it is proper that even in ſo ſmall a matter the truth ſhould be known. A falſe tale was held out to the public, as is ſtated at length in Mr. Oldys's pamphlet; and that part of the work which had been rejected by Mr. Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was transferred to a Mr. Crowther.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Second Part</hi> was at length printed and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed: being recommended by the ſame qualities
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:030204_0035_0FE510C2C7AEB0A8"/>
as the <hi>First,</hi> it met with a ſimilar reception. Its au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, finding that he had now excited againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the ſtrongeſt abhorrence of all the worthier part of the nation, thought it prudent to retire to France. In the mean time he printed a letter to Mr. Secretary Dundas, and another to Lord On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlow, the abſurd ſcurrility of which, might be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed matchleſs; were it not that the ſame author has ſince exceeded it in an <hi>Address to the Address<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> upon his Majeſty's proclamation for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of ſeditious writings,—and in a <hi>Letter to the National Convention of France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His actions and writings, however little credit they may have done him in Britain, recommended him to a ſeat in the French Convention.</p>
               <p>It would be difficult for him to find any other aſſembly in the world in which he would be not leſs reſpectable than moſt of the leaders. To what iſſue this laſt preferment of his may lead, it is not eaſy to predict. But, from the complexion of ſome of the late ſittings of the Convention, it ſeems extremely probable that his career may fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh with that miſerable end to which providence generally permits the machinations of ſuch men to conduct them at laſt.</p>
               <p>For the publication of thoſe writings, the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of which is avowedly ſeditious, and of which there has been too much uſe made towards the diſturbing of the domeſtic tranquillity of the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh empire—our author has, ſince his retreat into France, been indicted at the inſtance of the king, as uſual in ſuch caſes; tried at Guildhall, before
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:030204_0036_0FE510745FD3C808"/>
Lord Kenyon; and found guilty by a very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable jury, as the Author and publiſher of a book, called "Second Part of the Rights of Man, containing many falſe, wicked, ſcandalous, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious, and ſeditious aſſertions.</p>
               <p>It is ſcarcely neceſſary to add, that bookſellers and other venders of Paine's works muſt ſee, by this <hi>Verdict,</hi> that the laws of their country, if dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently enforced, are ready to puniſh them for ſo diſhoneſt a <hi>Traffic.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The reader of this plain, candid narrative, may judge for himſelf, whether Paine be a friend to Great Britain, or a man whoſe conduct he would chooſe to imitate, or whoſe advice he would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in ordinary caſes; and what reliance can be placed on the facts which he has boldly aſſerted as the ground work of moſt of his wild theories.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Here ends the account of Paine's life, as I find it in print, and which, as I formerly obſerved, was publiſhed about the beginning of 1793. I ſhall now attempt a continuation of it down to the preſent time, dwelling on ſuch parts only of his conduct as will admit of no diſpute reſpecting facts.</p>
            <p>Thomas's having merited death, or, at leaſt, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation in England, was a ſtrong recommendation to him in France, whoſe newly enlightened inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants ſeem to have conceived a wonderful partial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity for all that's vile. Several of the departments diſputed with each other the <hi>honour</hi> of having a <hi>convict</hi> for their repreſentative; a thing not ſo much to be wondered at, when we recollect, that their
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:030204_0037_0FE510C451EA8858"/>

            <p>The exact time of Tom's flight to this country of liberty and virtue is not mentioned, I believe, in the above account; but I recollect hearing his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival talked of in the month of June, 1792. I had been on a trip from St. Omer's to Dunkirk, and on my return, I firſt heard the news announced to a pretty numerous company in the canal ſtage. <q>Voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lá (ſays an old monk, who had been driven from his cell by the ſans-culottes, and who was now look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over the gazette) "Voilá ce coquin de Paine qui nous arrive de l'Angleterre."<note n="*" place="bottom">"Why, that raſcal Paine is juſt arrived from England."</note>—"Ah, mon Dieu</q> (exclaimed a well-dreſſed woman who was ſitting beſide me) <q>Ah, la pauvre France!

               </note> The juſtneſs of this obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſtruck me at the time, and has often occurred to my memory ſince. Indeed, every man of infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous character, every felon and every traitor, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, at the time I am now ſpeaking of, to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on France as his home; and this circumſtance, better than any other, marks the true character of the revolution. The property of the nation was laid proſtrate, and theſe villains were aſſembling round it, as birds of prey hover over an expiring carcaſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="unknown:030204_0038_0FE51075E7077098"/>Whether Paine was really in France, or not, in June 1792, is immaterial: it is certain that he took his ſeat among that gang of bloodthirſty tyrants, uſually called the <hi>Convention,</hi> juſt time enough to aſſiſt in proſcribing that Conſtitution which he had written two whole books in defence of, and in conferring every epithet of ridicule and reproach on the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituent Aſſembly, whom he had a few months be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore extolled, as <q>the moſt auguſt, illuminated and illuminating body of men on earth.</q> It was now that the Engliſh reformers and the democrats of America would have bluſhed, had not their fronts been covered with bull-hide, for the pompous eulo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giums they had heaped on the author of the <hi>Rights of Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt job that Tom was ſet about, after the deſtruction of the Conſtitution, was, making ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. This was a thing of courſe, for there is no ſuch thing as living without conſtitutions now-a-days. Thomas and his fellow journeymen, Briſſot, Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vière and about half a dozen others, fell to work, and, in a very few days, hammered out the clumſy, ill-proportioned devil of a thing, commonly called the Conſtitution of 1793. Of this ridiculous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument I ſhall only obſerve, that, after being cried up by the American Newſpapers, as the maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece of legiſlative wiſdom, it was rejected with every mark of contempt, even by the French them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. What is too abſurd for them to ſwallow muſt be abſurd indeed!</p>
            <p>About the time that this conſtitution work was going on, the unfortunate king was brought to trial by his ten times perjured and rebellious ſubjects.
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:030204_0039_0FE510C5D93BD2D8"/>
Paine did not vote for his death, a circumſtance that his friends produce as a proof of his juſtice and humanity, forgetting at the ſame time, that they thereby brand all thoſe who did vote for it, with injuſtice and barbarity. However, upon cloſer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, we ſhall find little reaſon for diſtinctions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Tom and his colleagues. He voted for the king's <hi>baniſhment,</hi> the baniſhment of a man perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly innocent, and it was owing merely to his being embarked with the faction of Briſſot, inſtead of that of Danton, that he did not vote for his death. Briſſot afterwards publiſhed, in the name of his whole party, the reaſons why they looked on it as <hi>good policy</hi> not to put the king to death; on theſe reaſons was the vote of Paine founded, and not on his humanity or his juſtice. Petion, the infamous Petion de Ville-neuve, did not vote for the king's death; yet certainly no one will believe that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of juſtice or humanity reſtrained the man, who, after having plotted the inſurrection of the tenth of Auguſt, brought it againſt the king as a crime, and who loaded the royal captives and their children with every inſult and cruelty that the heart of an upſtart ſavage tyrant could ſuggeſt.</p>
            <p>The whole proceſs of the trial of the king of France, from the beginning to the end, was the moſt flagrant act of injuſtice that ever ſtained the annals of the world. It was well known to every one, and particularly to the audacious regicides themſelves, that he was innocent of every crime laid to his charge. The ſentence of baniſhment was therefore as unjuſt as that of death. Injuſtice is ever injuſtice: it may exiſt in different degrees, but it can never change its nature. Had Paine been
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:030204_0040_0FE596A0ADAC0828"/>
a juſt and humane man, he would have ſtood up boldly in the defence of innocence, in place of ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering himſelf under a vote for <hi>baniſhment.</hi> Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment! Great God! Baniſhment on the head of the towering family of Bourbon, pronounced by a diſcarded Engliſh Exciſeman!—What muſt have been the feelings of this forſaken prince, who was once called the great and good ally of America, when he heard the word <hi>baniſhment!</hi> come from the lips of a wretch raiſed to notice by the ſucceſs of a revolution of which he himſelf had been a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal ſupport!—I hope no ſuch thought came athwart the mind of the unfortunate Louis; if it did, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain I am it muſt have been ten million times more poignant than the pangs of death.</p>
            <p>However Paine might find it convenient to vote upon this occaſion, it is certain he did not feel much horror at the murder of the benefactor of his <q>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved America,</q> or he would not have remained with, and in the ſervice of, his murderers. He was told this by his quondam friend Mr. King, in a letter ſent him from England ſoon afterwards. <q>
                  <hi>If the French kill their king, it will be a signal for my departure, for I will not abide among such sangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary men.</hi>—Theſe, Mr. Paine, were your words at our laſt meeting; yet, after this, you are not only with them, but the chief modeller of their new conſtitution, formed ſo heterogeneous and inconſiſtent, ſo hypothetical and contradictory, as ſhows me, that provided your theories obtain fame, you are indifferent how the people may be diſappointed in the practice of them.</q>

               <pb n="41" facs="unknown:030204_0041_0FE510D02AE20AE8"/>Having introduced this correſpondence here, it is a proper place for me to give the reader a ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proof of Thomas's diſintereſtedneſs, a quality for which he ſets a very high value on himſelf. <q>Politics and ſelf-intereſt" (ſays he, in the ſecond part of what he calls his <hi>Rights of Man</hi>) "have been ſo uniformly connected, that the world has a right to be ſuſpicious of <hi>public characters:</hi> but, <hi>with regard to myſelf,</hi> I am <hi>perfectly easy</hi> on this head. I did not, at my firſt ſetting out in <hi>public life,</hi> turn my thoughts on ſubjects of government from motives of ſelf-intereſt; and my conduct from that moment to this proves the fact.</q>— After this bouncing out-ſet, he goes on and tells his readers how diſintereſted he was in America, quite forgetting, however, to obſerve that he ſolicited, and obtained, a recompenſe for his ſervices, as is ſtated in the above account of his life.—The fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing letter will put his diſintereſtedneſs in a very clear point of view, and may, perhaps, ſerve to remove the film from the eyes of ſome of thoſe, who are apt to place too much confidence in the profeſſions of our diſintereſted patriots.</p>

            <p>This letter ought to be ſtuck upon every wall and every poſt in the United States, and in every other country where the voice of the people is of any conſequence. It is the creed, the <hi>multum in parvo,</hi> of all the pretended patriots that ever infeſted the earth. It is all in all; it is concluſive, and requires neither colouring nor commentary.</p>
            <p>After the death of the king of France, there was a long ſtruggle between the faction of Briſſot, to which Tom had attached himſelf, and that of Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, Robeſpierre and Marat. The laſt named mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer was diſpatched by a murdereſs of Briſſot's faction, after which her abettors were all guillotin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, impriſoned, or proſcribed. Thomas ſaved his life by countenancing the degradation of the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian religion, in his "Age of Reaſon."</p>
            <p>When Danton was ſolicited to ſpare him on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his talents as a writer in the cauſe of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:030204_0043_0FE510D1B2FE36E8"/>
"tu ne vois pas donc fo— tu bête," replied he to the ſolicitor, <q>que nous n'avons plus beſoin de pareils fanatiques.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <q>You do not perceive then, you ſimpleton, that we no longer want fanatics of that ſort.</q>
                  </note>
               </q> Cut-throat Danton was right enough: indeed they no longer ſtood in need of a fanatical writer in the cauſe of liberty, when they had made it a crime for men to weep.</p>
            <p>Danton made a calculation of Tom's head and talents, juſt as a farmer makes a calculation of the labour, carcaſs, hide and offal of a bullock; and he found that he would fetch more living than dead. By writing againſt religion, he might do his cauſe ſome ſervice, and there was little or no danger to be apprehended from him; becauſe, being an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſhman, it was only giving him that name, and he could any when have him killed and dreſſed, <hi>à la mode de Paris,</hi> at five minutes warning.</p>
            <p>Horrid as Paine's attack on revealed religion muſt appear to every one untainted with deiſm or atheiſm, the baſe aſſailant is not ſeen in his true colours, in his blackeſt hue, till the opinions in his <q>Age of Reaſon</q> are compared with the hypocritical cant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing profeſſions of reſpect for "the Word <hi>of God,</hi>" contained in ſome of his former writings. In his <hi>Common Senſe,</hi> calling on the people to ſeparate themſelves from the government that had diſcarded him, he ſays it is <q>a form of government that the <hi>word of God</hi> bears teſtimony againſt;</q> and in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other part of the ſame work, propoſing the promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of a new charter, he ſays: <q>that we may not appear to be defective even in earthly honours, let
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:030204_0044_0FE5107FD0B52920"/>
a day be ſolemnly ſet apart for proclaiming the charter; let it be brought forth placed on the <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine law,</hi> the <hi>word of God.</hi>
               </q>—In another place he ſpends whole pages in endeavouring to perſuade his readers that monarchy is diſapproved of by God, and he brings his proofs from Holy Writ, conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with theſe words. <q>Theſe portions of the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures</hi> are direct and poſitive. <hi>They admit of no equivocal construction.</hi>
               </q>—In one part of the ſame writings he complains of the <hi>"impiety"</hi> of the Tories, and in another of <q>the <hi>unchristian</hi> peeviſhneſs of the Quakers.</q> He calls upon the people to turn out in the name of God. <q>Say not," adds he, "that thouſands are gone out, turn out your tens of thouſands; throw not the burthen of the day upon <hi>Providence,</hi> but <hi>"ſhow your faith by your works,"</hi> that God may bleſs you.</q>
            </p>
            <p>—<q>We claim (ſays he again, keeping up the cant) we claim brotherhood with every European <hi>christian,</hi> and glory in the generoſity of the ſentiment.</q>—Generous and ſentimental raſcal! Whom do you claim brotherhood with now? Who will admit as a brother, the wretch, who, at one time calls the Scriptures the <hi>word of God,</hi> and quotes them as an infallible guide, and at another, ridicules them as a ſeries of fictions, contrived by artful prieſts to amuſe, delude, and cheat mankind?</p>
            <p>From Paine's <hi>Common Sense</hi> and his <hi>Age of Reason</hi> we may perceive how his opinion differed concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Americans at the two epochs of his writing. When he wrote the former, he looked upon them as a conſcientious and pious people; but when he wrote
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:030204_0045_0FE510D3F91A7C08"/>
the latter, he certainly looked upon them in the oppoſite light, or he never would have ventured to addreſs the work to them. The fact is, he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered his opinion of them upon the ſtrength of what he ſaw in the greateſt part of the public papers. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſeeing a miniſter of the goſpel abuſed, for hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing boldly aſſerted the truth of its doctrines, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the horrid decrees of the French Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention; after having ſeen the name of <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> placed in a liſt of famous democrats, along with the names of <hi>Paine</hi> and <hi>Marat,</hi> it was no wonder if he thought that his manual of blaſphemy would be an acceptable preſent to his "beloved Americans."</p>
            <p>Indeed, there is but too much reaſon to fear, that the <hi>Age of Reaſon</hi> being tranſlated into Engliſh, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently for the ſole purpoſe of being publiſhed here, its being dedicated to the citizens of the Unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed States, together with the uncommon pains that have been taken to propagate it and the abuſe that has been heaped upon all thoſe who have attempted to counteract its effects, will do but little credit to the national character, in the opinions of thoſe foreigners who are not well acquainted with it. Every effort ſhould, therefore, be exerted to convince the world, that all men of ſenſe and worth in America agree in their abhorrence of the work and its malignant author. From this perſuaſion it was, that I inſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the <hi>Political Cenſor for May,</hi> an extract from Judge Ruſh's pious addreſs to the grand jury at Reading, and that I now honour the preſent <hi>Cenſor</hi> with an extract from Mr. Swift's Syſtem of Laws of Connecticut, a work that every one ſhould read, and that every one who reads muſt admire.</p>

               <q>To prohibit (ſays this learned and elegant writer) To prohibit the open, public, and expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit denial of the popular religion of a country, is a neceſſary meaſure to preſerve the tranquillity of a government. Of this no perſon in a chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an country can complain; for, admitting him to be an infidel, he muſt acknowledge, that no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit can be derived from the ſubverſion of a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion which enforces the beſt ſyſtem of morality, and inculcates the divine doctrine of doing juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, loving mercy, and walking humbly with God. In this view of the ſubject, we cannot ſufficiently reprobate the baſeneſs of Thomas Paine, in his attack on chriſtianity, by publiſhing his Age of Reaſon. While <hi>experiencing in a prison,</hi> the <hi>fruits of his viſionary theories of government,</hi> he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to diſturb the world by his religious opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. He has the impudence and effrontery to addreſs to the citizens of the United States of America, a paltry performance, which is intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſhake their faith in the religion of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; a religion, which, while it inculcates the practice of moral virtue, contributes to ſmooth the thorny road of this life, by opening the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of a future and better: and all this he does, not to make them happier, or to introduce a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter religion, but to embitter their days by the cheerleſs and dreary viſions of unbelief. No language can deſcribe the wickedneſs of the man, who will attempt to ſubvert a religion which is a ſource of comfort and conſolation to its votaries, merely for the ſake of eradicating all ſentiments of religion.</q>

with years and infamy. This, reader, whatever you may think of him, is the author of the Rights of Man, the eulogiſt of French liberty. <q>The very ſame man who a few months back boaſted of being <hi>the representative of twenty-five millions of free men.</hi>
               </q> Look at him. Do you think now, in your conſcience, that he has the appearance of a legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, a civilian, a conſtitution maker?

He was condemned by his colleagues, and his fetters were rivetted by his own dear conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents. Here he is, fairly caught in his own trap, a ſtriking example for the diſturbers of mankind.</p>
            <p>After Thomas got out of his <hi>câchot</hi> (a word that, I dare ſay, he underſtands better than any other in the French language), it was reported that he was dead, which occaſioned the epitaph on him, to be ſeen in the Cenſor for May; but, it has appeared ſince, that the report of his death was owing to a mode of expreſſion which the French have, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a perſon ſunk into inſignificance is ſaid to be dead. He, or ſome one in his name, has lately written a work, entitled, the <hi>Decline and Fall of the Britiſh System of Finance,</hi> of which it is quite enough to ſay, that it is of equal merit with the reſt of his writings. All his predictions have hitherto remained unfulfilled, and thoſe contained in the laſt effort of his malice will ſhare the ſame fate. It is extremely favourable for Britiſh bank-notes, that he who doubts of their ſolidity will not believe in the Bible.</p>
            <p>How Tom gets a living now, or what brothel he inhabits, I know not, nor does it much ſignify to

            <p>When I had the honour to ſerve King George, I was elated enough at the putting on of my worſted ſhoulder-knot, and, afterwards, my ſilver-laced coat; what muſt my feelings be then, upon ſeeing half a dozen authors, all <hi>Doctors</hi> or the devil knows what, writing about me at one time, and ten times that number of printers, book-binders, and book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellers, buſtling, running and flying about in all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, to announce my fame to the impatient pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic? What muſt I feel upon ſeeing the news-papers filled from top to bottom, and the windows and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the hoofes placarded, with, a <hi>Blue Shop for Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Porcupine,</hi> a <hi>Pill for Peter Porcupine, Peter Porcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine detected,</hi> a <hi>Roaſter for Peter Porcupine,</hi> a <hi>Hiſtory of Peter Porcupine,</hi> a <hi>Picture of Peter Porcupine?</hi> The public will certainly excuſe me, if after all this, I ſhould begin to think myſelf a perſon of ſome importance.</p>
            <p>It is true, my heroic adverſaries do all ſet out with telling their readers, that I am a contemptible wretch <hi>not worth notice.</hi> They ſhould have ſaid, not worth the notice <hi>of any honeſt man,</hi> and, as they would all naturally have excluded themſelves by ſuch an addition, they would have preſerved con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency at leaſt: but, to ſit down hammering their brains for a fortnight or three weeks, and at laſt publiſh each of them a pamphlet about me and my performances, and then tell the public that <hi>I am not worth notice,</hi> is ſuch a groſs inſult to common ſenſe

They think they ſee me proſtrate, and they are ſwaggering over me, like a popiſh prieſt over a dead corps. It would require other pens than theirs to ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence me.

            <p>I muſt now beg the reader to accompany me in ſome few remarks that I think it neceſſary to make on each of their productions, following the order in which they appeared.</p>

               <p>This pamphlet ought, on every account, to come laſt: we have ſeen the reſt riſing above each other progreſſively; this of <hi>Bradford's</hi> crowns the whole, caps the climax of falſehood and villainy.</p>
               <p>The former part of it bears the aſſumed name of <hi>Tickletoby,</hi> the latter, that of <hi>Samuel F. Bradford.</hi> It is evident, however, that both are by the ſame author; who he is, is not of much conſequence: it is clear that he acted under the directions of Bradford, and Bradford muſt and ſhall anſwer for the whole.</p>
               <p>What every one recoils at the bare idea of, is Bradford's writing a pamphlet <hi>againſt the works</hi> of Peter Porcupine. Had he confined his attack to my private character and opinions, he would not have
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:030204_0061_0FE510F5C9BE85A8"/>
ſo completely expoſed himſelf; but this, I ſuppoſe, his author would not conſent to; I do not know any other way of accounting for his conduct.</p>
               <p>Every one perceives that the letter which Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford inſerts in <hi>Tickletoby's</hi> part of the pamphlet, is nothing but a poor and vain attempt to preſerve con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency. However, to leave no room for diſpute on this ſcore, and to convict the ſhuffling Bradford on his own words, I am willing to allow him to be neuter with reſpect to <hi>Tickletoby's</hi> part, and will take him up on the contents of the letter which he ſigns. <q>That I have made uſe," ſays he, "of the Britiſh Corporal for a good purpoſe, I have little doubt —<hi>Dirty water</hi> will quench fire.</q>

that it was not for the ſake of the <hi>profit</hi> but the <hi>honour</hi> of publiſhing my works, that made him ſo anxious to continue.—My wife was preſent at this interview, and can, with me, make oath to the truth of what I have here aſſerted.</p>
               <p>Nay, if my works were <hi>dirty water,</hi> why did he threaten to proſecute me for <hi>not continuing them?</hi> Dirty water is not a thing to go to law about. Did ever any body hear of a man's proſecuting another, becauſe he refuſed to bring him dirty water to throw on the public?</p>
               <p>After all this praiſing and flattering and menacing, my poor labours are good for nothing. The writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings which had given ſo much pleaſure to Doctor Green, that the Attorney General would have loved me for ever for, that charmed all ſexes and all ages, that made grave Senators ſhake their ſides with laughter, and Congreſs-men want to treat and hug me; that were ſo highly approved of by the officers of government, that it was an <hi>honour</hi> to publiſh, and that I was threatened with a proſecution for not continuing; theſe writings are now become <hi>dirty water!</hi>—Say rather, <hi>sour grapes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I muſt, however, do the Bradfords the juſtice to ſay, that they very candidly told me, that every body could perceive a falling off, <hi>after the Congreſs Gallery.</hi> How ſingular it was, that I ſhould begin to ſink the inſtant I quitted them! Was this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they did no longer <hi>amend my works</hi> for me, or becauſe they no longer pocketed the caſh they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced! The Bradfords are bookſellers died in grain.

Heaven is with them worth nothing, unleſs they can get ſomething by it.</p>
               <p>With reſpect to the motives that gave riſe to my pamphlets, I have already ſtated them, and as to their literary merit, though I have no very great opinion of it, yet, after having heard them aſcribed to Mr. Bond, Mr. Thornton (not the <hi>language maker</hi> but the ſecretary to the Engliſh Embaſſador), Dr. Andrews, The Rev. Mr. Biſſet, Mr. Lewis, Mr. Sedgewick, Dr. Smith, and, in ſhort, to almoſt every gentleman of diſtinguiſhed talents among the friends of the Federal Government, it would be mere gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mace for me to pretend, that they have no merit at all. It is ſomething ſingular, that the democrats never pitched upon any low fellow as the author; their ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions always alighted among gentlemen of family and gentlemen of learning. It is therefore too late to decry my performances as taſteleſs and illiterate, now it is diſcovered that the author was brought up at the plough tail, and was a few years ago, a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate ſoldier in the Britiſh army.</p>
               <p>To return to my friend Bradford. Though I am ready to admit him as a neutral in all that is ſaid by <hi>Tickletoby,</hi> I cannot do this with regard to what is uſhered into the world as the performance of <hi>Samuel F. Bradford.</hi> This <hi>hatter-turned-printer,</hi> this ſooty-fiſted ſon of ink and urine, whoſe heart is as black and as foul as the liquid in which he dabbles, muſt have written, if he did write, at the ſpecial inſtance and requeſt of his father; for, the Lampblack ſays, "a father's wiſh is a law with me."</p>
               <p>After having premiſed this, making Bradford re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponſible for what is contained in his letter and his
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:030204_0064_0FE51103366E7A90"/>
ſon's, I ſhall proceed to remark on ſuch parts of both as I think worth my notice.</p>
               <p>And firſt on the grand diſcovery of the letter to the <hi>Aurora-Man.</hi>—This is a letter which I wrote to the gazette, under the ſignature of A Correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, againſt the ſecond part of the Bone to Gnaw. The letter, as now printed by Bradford, may, for ought I know, be a very correct copy. I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the time and all the circumſtances well. Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, who is as eager to get money into his hands as he is unwilling to let it out again, repeatedly aſked me for a <hi>Puff</hi> to this pamphlet. This very ſon came to me for it as many as half a dozen times. I at laſt complied; not that I was unwilling to do it at firſt (for I had bored the cunning grand-child of the cunning almanack-maker ſeveral times before), but I could with difficulty ſpare time to write it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Puffs</hi> are of ſeveral ſorts. I believe the one now before us, is what is called a <hi>Puff indirect,</hi> which means, a piece written by an author, or by his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, againſt his own performances, thereby to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite oppoſition, awaken the attention of the public, and ſo advance the renown or ſale of his labours. <hi>A Puff indirect</hi> is, then, what I ſtand accuſed of, and as I have no argument at hand to prove the moral fitneſs of the thing, I muſt, as pleaders do in all knotty points, appeal to precedents. My authorities are very high, being no other than Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſon, Phillips and Pope.</p>
               <p>No one that has read the Spectator (and who has not done that) can have failed to obſerve, that he publiſhed many letters againſt his own writings, imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:030204_0065_0FE5113895AE3390"/>
the ſtyle and manner of his adverſaries, and containing weak arguments, which he immediately overturns in his anſwer.—Doctor Johnſon tells us that, before the acting of PHILLIPS'S <hi>Diſtreſſed Mother,</hi> a whole Spectator was devoted to its praiſe, and on the firſt night a ſelect audience was called to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to applaud it. The Epilogue to this play was written by Addiſon, who inſerted a letter againſt it in the Spectator, for the ſake of giving it a trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant anſwer. But, Pope's famous puff is a caſe exactly in point. "He drew a compariſon," ſays Dr. Johnſon, <q>of Phillips's performance with his own, in which, with an unexampled and une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualled artifice of irony, though he has himſelf always the advantage, he gives the preference to Phillips. The deſign of aggrandizing himſelf he diſguiſed with ſuch dexterity, that, though Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon diſcovered it, Steele was deceived, and was afraid of diſpleaſing Pope by publiſhing his paper.</q> —Now, what cenſure does Lord Chief-Juſtice, Johnſon (who, God knows, was far from being over lenient) paſs on all this? None at all. He calls neither of theſe authors <hi>"an Impoſtor;"</hi> nor can I think he would have done ſo, had their puffs been written <hi>at his requeſt,</hi> and for <hi>his benefit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If a puff can ever be conſtrued as an act of mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, it muſt be, when its motive is ſelf-intereſt. This cannot be attributed to me, as I could get no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by promoting the ſale of the work. I had a note of hand for it in my poſſeſſion; which the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of copies ſold could not augment the value of.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="unknown:030204_0066_0FE5110513D51E30"/>What impudence muſt a man be bleſſed with, who can uſher to the world a puff, which he wiſhes ſhould be looked upon as ſomething horridly vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lainous, when he himſelf requeſted it to be written, tranſcribed it himſelf, and carried it himſelf for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication?—But here the Bradfords play a double game. "It was not I <hi>transcribed</hi> it," ſays old Gooſy Tom; and "a <hi>father's wiſh</hi> is a law with me," returns the young Goſling. But you hiſſing, web<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>footed animals, is it not between you?—The puffing for fame belongs to me; but the tranſcribing and carrying to the preſs; all the intereſted part of the buſineſs, all the dirty work, lies among yourſelves, and ſo I leave you to waddle and dabble about in it.</p>
               <p>Having diſmiſſed the <hi>Puff,</hi> we now come to the <hi>breach of confidence</hi> in publiſhing it. There are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tranſactions which we do not look upon as crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, which, nevertheleſs, we do not wiſh to have made public. A lady, in love with a handſome young fellow, may make indirect advances, by the aid of a third perſon. This is certainly no crime; but ſhould the confident preſerve one of her letters, and afterwards publiſh it, I preſume ſuch confident would meet with general deteſtation. This is a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel caſe ſo far; but when to this we add the aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating circumſtance of the confident being the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal adviſer of the correſpondence, we are at a loſs for words to expreſs our abhorrence. Yet we muſt go ſtill further with reſpect to Bradford. He has not only divulged what was communicated to him under his pledged ſecrecy, and at his preſſing requeſt, to ſerve him; but he has been guilty of this
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:030204_0067_0FE5113CD0825180"/>
ſcandalous breach of confidence towards a man, to whom he owes, perhaps, that he is not now in jail for debt.</p>
               <p>It is eaſy to perceive what drove him to this act of treachery. Revenge for the ſtatement I had publiſhed concerning the <hi>one ſhilling and seven-pence half-penny</hi> pamphlet. He could not help fearing that people would reſent this by avoiding his ſhop. He was right enough; for, though I am an Engliſhman, and of courſe, a ſort of lawful prey to the democrats, yet they, even they, cannot help ſaying that he is an abominable ſharper. To be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged on me for this, he publiſhed the letter, and has thus done what all impotent vindictive men do, injured himſelf without injuring his adverſary. I hinted that he had taken me in, and in return he betrays me to the reputation of a ſharper, he adds that of a villain.</p>
               <p>After this will any one ſay that I am to blame, if I expoſe this ſtupid, this mean, this ſhabby, this treacherous family? Do they deſerve any quarter from me?—Every one ſays—no, Peter, no.</p>
               <p>They ſay I lived in a garret when firſt they knew me. They found me ſole tenant and occupier of a very good houſe, No. 81, Callowhill. They ſay I was poor; and that lump of walking tallow ſtreaked with lampblack, that calls itſelf <hi>Samuel F. Bradford,</hi> has the impudence to ſay that my wardrobe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of my old regimentals, &amp;c.—At the time the Bradfords firſt knew me I earned about 140 dollars pr. month, and which I continued to do for about two years and a half. I taught Engliſh to the moſt
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:030204_0068_0FE511069C110F00"/>
reſpectable Frenchmen in the city, who did not ſhuffle me off with notes as Bradford did. With ſuch an income I leave the reader to gueſs whether I had any occaſion to go ſhabbily dreſſed.—It would look childiſh to retort here, but let the reader go and aſk the women in Callowhill ſtreet about the rent in old Bradford's yellow breeches.</p>
               <p>The Bradfords have ſeen others attack me upon my ſudden <hi>exaltation,</hi> as they call it: upon my having a book-ſhop, and all this without any viſible means of acquiring it; whence they wiſh to make people believe that I am paid by the Britiſh government. It is exceſſively baſe in the Bradfords to endeavour to ſtrengthen this opinion, becauſe they know that I came by my money fairly and honeſtly. They were never out of my debt, from the moment they publiſhed the firſt pamphlet, which was in Aug. 1794, till the latter end of May laſt.<note n="*" place="bottom">At this time they owed me 18 dollars, which had been due for near ſix months, and which I was at laſt obliged to <hi>take out in books.</hi>
                  </note> They uſed to put off the payment of their notes from time to time, and they always had at their tongues end; "we know you don't want money." And theſe raſcals have now the impudence to ſay that I was their needy hireling!—'Tis pity, as Tom Jones's Hoſt ſays, but there ſhould be a hell for ſuch fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>
               <p>It is hinted, and indeed ſaid, in this vile pamphlet, that I have been encouraged by the American go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment alſo.—I promiſed the reader I would tell him a ſtory about Bradford's patriotiſm, and I will now
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:030204_0069_0FE5969F2020EA20"/>
be as good as my word.—In order to induce me to continue the Congreſs Gallery, he informed me, that <hi>Mr. Wolcot</hi> had promiſed to procure him the printing of the Reports to Congreſs: "So," added he, <q>I will print off enough copies for the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and ſo many beſides as will be ſufficient to place at the end of each of your numbers, and <hi>Congreſs will pay for printing the whole!</hi>
                  </q> He told me he had aſked Mr. Wolcot for this job, which I looked upon as an indirect way of aſking for a bribe, being aſſured that he built his hopes of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, upon being the publiſher of my works.— Now, here's a dog for you, that goes and aſks for a government job, preſuming ſolely upon the merit of being the vender of what he, nine months after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, calls <hi>dirty water,</hi> and who adds to this an attempt to fix the character of government tool on another man. If I would have continued the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, it is probable he might have printed the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports; but this I would not do. I wanted no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports tacked on to the end of my pamphlets: that would have been renewing the puniſhment of coup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the living to the dead.</p>
               <p>Sooty Sam, the Goſling, tells the public that I uſed to call him a <hi>sans-culotte</hi> and his father a <hi>rebel.</hi> If this be true, I am ſure I can call them nothing worſe, and therefore I am by no means anxious to contradict him.—But, pray, wiſe Miſter Bradford of the "political [and <hi>bawdy</hi>] book-ſtore," is not this avowal of yours rather calculated to deſtroy what you ſay about my being <hi>an artful and subtle hypocrite?</hi> I take it, that my calling you <hi>rebels</hi> and <hi>sans-culottes</hi> to you faces is no proof of my hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy; nor will the public think it any proof of your
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:030204_0070_0FE511096BBDFB98"/>
                  <hi>putting a coat upon my back.</hi> Men are generally mean when they are dependent; they do not, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they do not, call their patrons <hi>sans-culottes</hi> and <hi>rebels;</hi> nor do people ſuffer themſelves to be ſo call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, unleſs ſome weighty motive induces them to put up with it.—This acknowledgment of Bradford's is concluſive; it ſhows at once on what footing we ſtood with relation to each other.</p>
               <p>He ſays that I abuſed many of the moſt <hi>respecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble characters,</hi> by calling them <hi>Speculators, Landjob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi> &amp;c. who were continually ſeeking to <hi>entrap and deceive foreigners.</hi>—If I did call thoſe men <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culators</hi> and <hi>Landjobbers,</hi> who are continually ſeeking to <hi>entrap foreigners;</hi> if I confined myſelf to ſuch mild terms, I muſt have been in an extremely good humour. But, young Miſter Lampblack, be can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did for once and allow me that your father is a ſharper. Oh! don't go to deny that now: what eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry body ſays muſt be true.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>How groſsly," ſays the ſon, "did you frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abuſe the <hi>People of America,</hi> by aſſerting that, for the greater part, they were <hi>Aristocrats</hi> and <hi>Royalists</hi> in their hearts, and only wore the maſk of hypocriſy to anſwer their own purpoſes.</q>—If young Urine will but agree to leave out <hi>People of America,</hi> and ſupply its place with, <hi>family of Goosy Tom,</hi> I will own the ſentence for mine; and I will tell the public into the bargain, how I came to make uſe of it.—I entered Bradford's one day, and found him poring over an old book on <hi>heraldry.</hi> I looked at it, and we made ſome remarks on the orthogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy. In a few minutes afterwards he aſked me if I knew any thing of <hi>the great Bradford family</hi> in
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:030204_0071_0FE5113FE0683BF0"/>
England. I replied, no. He then told me that he had juſt ſeen a liſt of new Peers (<hi>Engliſh</hi> Peers, reader!), among which was a <hi>Lord Bradford;</hi> and that he ſuſpected that he was of a branch of their family!— As the old women ſay, you might have knocked me down with a feather. I did not know which way to look. The bluſh that warmed my cheek for him then, renews itſelf as I write.—He did not drop it here. He dunned my ears about it half a dozen times; and even went ſo far as to requeſt me to make inquiries about it, when I wrote home.—It was on this moſt ludicrous occaſion, that I burſt out, <q>Ah, d—n you, I ſee you are all <hi>Aristocrats</hi> and <hi>Royalists</hi> in your hearts yet. Your republicaniſm is nothing but hypocriſy.</q> And I dare ſay the reader will think I was half right.—I wonder what are the armorial ſigns of Bradford's family. The creſt muſt be a <hi>Goose,</hi> of courſe. Inſtead of ſcol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lops and gueules, he may take a couple of printers balls, a keg of lampblack and a jordon. His two great bears of ſons (I except William) may ſerve as ſupporters, and his motto may be, <q>One shilling and seven-pence half-penny for a pamphlet.</q> All this will form a pretty good republican coat of arms.</p>
               <p>Let it be remembered here too, that my calling the Bradfords <hi>Aristocrats</hi> and hypocrites, does not prove me to be a <hi>hypocrite,</hi> a <hi>needy hireling,</hi> or a <hi>coward.</hi> As to this laſt term which young Lamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>black has conferred on me, it is the bluſtering noiſe of a poor timid trembling cock, crowing upon his own dunghil. I hurl his <hi>coward</hi> back to his teeth, with the addition of <hi>fool</hi> and <hi>ſcoundrel.</hi> I think that is intereſt enough for one fortnight. The father has ſerved the ſilly ſon, as the monkey ſerved the cat,

when he took her paw to rake the cheſnuts out of the fire with.</p>
               <p>They accuſe me of being given to <hi>scandal.</hi>—If I had publiſhed, or made uſe of, one hundredth part of the anecdotes they ſupplied me with. I ſhould have ſet the whole city together by the ears. The govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or's ſhare alone would fill a volume.—I'll juſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion one or two, which will prove, that I am not the firſt old acquaintance that Bradford has betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.—He told me of a judge, who, when he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented him an old account, refuſed to pay it, as it was <hi>setting a bad example.</hi>—<q>Ah, righteous judge? A Second Daniel!</q>—He told me, that he went once to breakfaſt with Mr. Dallas, now Secretary of the State of Pennſylvania, and that Dallas ſaid to him: <q>By G—d Tom we have <hi>no sugar,</hi> and I have not a farthing in the world.</q>—"So," ſays my Lord Bradford, <q>I put my hand in my pocket, and toſſed the girl a <hi>quarter of a dollar,</hi> and ſhe went out and got ſome.</q>—Another time, he ſaid, Mr. Dallas's hair-dreſſer was going to ſue him for a few ſhillings, when he, like a generous friend, ſtepped in and put a ſtop to further proceedings, by <hi>buying the debt</hi> at a <hi>great discount.</hi>—I forget whether he ſays he was repaid, or not.</p>
               <p>Theſe anecdotes he wanted me to make uſe of; but theſe, as well as all the others he furniſhed me with, appeared to me to be brought forth by private malice, and therefore I never made uſe of any of them. Though, I muſt confeſs, that, in one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in particular, this was a very great act of ſelf-denial.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="unknown:030204_0073_0FE5114B63FEB4D8"/>From Secretaries of State, Judges and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, let us come to Preſidents.—Don't ſtart read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, my bookſeller knew nothing againſt General Waſhington, or he would have told it.—No; we are now going to ſee a trait of Bradford's republicaniſm of another kind.—<hi>Marten's Law of Nations,</hi> a work that I tranſlated from the French for Bradford, is dedicated, <hi>by him,</hi> to the Preſident of the United States. The dedication was written by me, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Bradfords were obliged to <hi>amend</hi> my writings. When a proof of it was taken off, old Bradford propoſed a fulſome addition to it; "give the old boy <hi>a little more oil,</hi>" ſaid he. This greaſing I refuſed to have any hand in, and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding I did not <hi>know how to write,</hi> and was a <hi>needy hireling,</hi> my Lord and Maſter, Bradford, did not think proper to make any alteration, though I could have no reaſonable objection, as it was ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his name.</p>
               <p>While the old man was attempting to wheedle the Preſident and the officers of the Federal Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the ſon, <hi>Samuel,</hi> was wheedling the French Miniſter: the Bradfords love a double game dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. He ſpent whole evenings with him, or at leaſt he told me ſo. According to his account they were like two brothers. I cannot blame Mr. Adet, who undoubtedly muſt have a curioſity to know all the ſecrets of Bradford's preſs. For my part, as ſoon as I heard of this intimacy, I looked upon my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as being as well known to the French Miniſter as I was to Bradford.</p>
               <p>But, there is a tale connected with this, which muſt be told, becauſe it will give the lie to all that
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:030204_0074_0FE51115398C50A8"/>
young Lampblack has ſaid about correcting and altering my works. His deſign is to make peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple believe that I was obliged to ſubmit to his prun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. We ſhall ſee how this was in a moment.— In the New Year's Gift, ſpeaking of the French Miniſter, I make uſe of the following words: <q>not that I doubt his veracity, though his not being a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> might be a trifling objection, with ſome weak minded people.</q>—The old Gooſy want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me to change the word <hi>Chriſtian</hi> for <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> as he was a good friend, and might be uſeful to his ſon. He came himſelf with the proof ſheet, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail on me to do this; but if the reader looks into the New Year's Gift, he will ſee that I did not yield.</p>
               <p>Bradford never prevailed on me to leave out a ſingle word in his life, except a paſſage in the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs Gallery.</hi> 
                  <q>Remember" (ſays the ſon in a triumphant manner) "Remember what was eraſed from the <hi>Congreſs Gallery.</hi>
                  </q>—I do remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber it, thou compoſt of die-ſtuff, lampblack and urine, I do remember it well; and ſince you have not told all about it, I will.—The paſſage eraſed contained ſome remarks on the indecent and every way unbecoming expreſſion of Mr. Lewis, on the trial of Randall, when he ſaid, that gentlemen would have ſerved <hi>his client</hi> right, if they had <hi>kicked him out of the room.</hi> Bradford told me he had a <hi>very particular reason</hi> for wiſhing this left out, and as it was not a paſſage to which I attached much importance, left out it was: but, had I known that his <hi>very particular reason</hi> was, that he had engaged Mr. Lewis as his counſellor in a ſuit which he had juſt then commenced againſt his deceaſed brother's widow and his own ſiſters, the paſſage ſhould not

have been left out, for him nor for Mr. Lewis nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I fear no lawyers.—From this fact we may form a pretty correct idea of the <hi>independence</hi> of Bradford's preſs, when left to his own conducting.<note n="*" place="bottom">Bradford pretends to detect me in a lie about my having <hi>a preſs.</hi> I have two now at work for me, and the printers are always paid the inſtant their work is done. Can a Bradford ſay as much?—He tells me ſomething about my being <hi>obliged</hi> to pay my taxes. To be ſure I am; but did any tax-gatherer ever dare clap his hand on any of my goods or chattels? No; but the land of Thomas Bradford; back-land which he got out of the old ſoldiers, who were fighting laſt war while he was a ſort of jailer; this land was ſold laſt year <hi>by the Sheriff,</hi> and that to pay the <hi>taxes too.</hi>—You ſee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> My Lord Bradford, that you have refreſhed my memory to ſome purpoſe.</note>
               </p>
               <p>I think, the further we go the deeper My Lord Bradford gets in the mire. Let us ſtop the career, then. Let us diſmiſs him, his ſons, his preſs and his ſhop, with a remark or two on one more paſſage of his ſon's letter. <q>You, (meaning me) can declaim and <hi>scandalize</hi> with the greateſt hero of <hi>Bilingsgate,</hi> yet, in ſober argument and <hi>chaſtity</hi> of manner, you are a mere <hi>nincompoop.</hi>
                  </q>—The reader muſt have obſerved, that Boileau, Roſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and Pope, in their poëtical rules, always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey the precept in an example; ſo we ſee here, that young lampblack gives us an example of the very manner he decries.—But, a word more about <hi>chastity:</hi> not quite in the ſame ſenſe, though not ſo far from it as to render the tranſition very abrupt.— <hi>Chastity</hi> from the pen of a Bradford! <hi>Chastity,</hi> I ſay, from No. 8, South Front Street! <hi>Chastity</hi> from the <hi>bawdy-book-ſhop!</hi>—I have no pretenſion to an overſtock of modeſty or ſqueamiſhneſs. I have ſerved an apprenticeſhip in the army; yet have I
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:030204_0076_0FE51116C7C21968"/>
often been ſhocked to ſee what the Bradfords ſell. Not, perhaps, ſo much at the obſcenity of the books, as at the conduct of the venders. I do not know a traffic ſo completely infamous as this. In London it is confined to the very ſcum of the Jews. It is ten times worſe than the trade of a bawd: it is pimping for the eyes: it <hi>creates</hi> what the punk does but ſatisfy when created. Theſe <hi>literary panders</hi> are the purveyors for the bawdy-houſe.—However, as far as relates to the people in queſtion, the ſons are not to blame: <q>a <hi>father's wiſh</hi> is a law with them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall conclude with obſerving, that though Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford's publication was principally intended to do away the charge of having duped me in the one and ſeven pence half-penny job, he has left it juſt as it was. His ſon, has, indeed, attempted to bewilder the reader by a compariſon between the prices of the enſuing pamphlets; but what has this to do with the matter? His father took the <hi>Observations,</hi> was to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh them, and give me half the profits. Long after, many months after, every copy of the work was ſold, I aſked him for an account of it, which he brought me in <hi>writing,</hi> and in which my half of the profits was ſtated at <hi>one shilling and seven pence half-penny,</hi> or, about <hi>twenty-one cents.</hi>—Now, nothing poſterior to this could poſſibly diminiſh the barefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedneſs of the tranſaction. I did not actually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the <hi>twenty-one cents;</hi> I threw the paper from me with diſdain; nor did I ever receive a farthing for the publication in queſtion from that day to this.</p>
               <p>I now take leave of the Bradfords, and of all thoſe who have written againſt me. People's opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:030204_0077_0FE5114E97363ED8"/>
muſt now be made up concerning them and me. Thoſe who ſtill believe the lies that have been vomited forth againſt me are either too ſtupid or too perverſe to merit further attention. I will, therefore, never write another word in reply to any thing that is publiſhed about myſelf. Bark away, hell-hounds, till you are ſuffocated in your own foam. Your la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours are preſerved, bound up together in a piece of bear-ſkin, with the hair on, and nailed up to a poſt in my ſhop, where whoever pleaſes may read them gratis.</p>
