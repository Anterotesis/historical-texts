            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>PARTIES and diviſions among the profeſſors of Chriſtianity have hurt and wounded the cauſe of religion, more than <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll the external at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks of deiſts and inſidels, heathens and devils.— The Church of Chriſt, at this day, is bleeding, even unto death, by the wounds ſhe has received from this quarter. And what renders the caſe of the poor afflicted Church more pitiable and deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, is, that, while many are crying out againſt diviſions and their ſad effects, few conſider at whoſe door the diviſions lie, or who the perſons
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:047065_0003_10229F6320E45190"/>are, that cauſe and foment them: And it often happens that the principal authors of diviſions are the loudeſt againſt them.</p>
            <p>Bigots of all parties cry out againſt diviſions; but their ideas are very contracted;—for they care not how much the body of Chriſt is rent, or divided, if they can but keep one of his <hi>fingers,</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> I may be allowed the expreſſion, whole and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire to themſelves. Thus while many lament the want of <hi>unity,</hi> they mean unity in ſome <hi>favourite part</hi> only, and not in the <hi>whole.</hi> If <hi>this part</hi> be in a thriving way, they have no concern for other parts, but rather feel a ſecret ſatisfaction in hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they are crumbling to pieces,—and this often becomes a very agreeable topic of converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.—I wiſh profeſſors would impartially examine themſelves, and ſee if they do not find too much of <hi>this</hi> in their own breaſts, notwithſtanding all their pretended deſires of love and unity.</p>
            <p>And ſhould any man, being grieved at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractions of <hi>Zion,</hi> and poſſeſſed with a ſpirit of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration and peace, come forward, and, with a lenient hand, attempt to cloſe the breaches, and heal the wounds of the bleeding Church,—nothing can be more unpromiſing and unpopular. His prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered ſervices are very unacceptable, and he ſubjects himſelf to dreadful ſuſpicious from every ſide:— Suſpicious of his <hi>intention</hi>—and of his leaning more
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:047065_0004_10229F65A15FEA30"/>to <hi>this</hi> part than to <hi>that.</hi> Dreadful inſinuations are thrown out, as if he was inimical to this <hi>part</hi> or <hi>that,</hi>—and grave cautions are given againſt pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any regard to what he ſays, or even giving him a hearing:—his doctrine is poiſonous—it ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours too much of <hi>Calviniſin,</hi> ſays one,—and too much of <hi>Arminianiſin,</hi> ſays another:—and, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, the more effectually to counteract, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſalutary effects of the healing balm, his character is attacked, and the ſoundneſs of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion called greatly into queſtion.—And all this time the ſame cry is kept up againſt diviſions and their ſad effects.—Is not ſuch a conduct juſt as abſurd, as if a man ſhould ſet a houſe on fire, and furiouſly rail againſt any one, that would attempt to quench it, and yet execrate, and vehemently bawl out againſt all houſe-burners? But the truth is, that men of <hi>this</hi> bigoted and contracted caſt care not whoſe houſes are burnt, <hi>ſo their own eggs are roaſted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Contentions and diviſions had grievouſly infeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Church at <hi>Corinth,</hi> and St. Paul wrote this epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> for the purpoſe of putting an end to them. Therefore, after ſome introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he preſſes into the body of his deſign, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing the Church in theſe pathetic words:— <q>How I beſeech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that you all ſpeak the
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:047065_0005_10229F672CFE0548"/>ſame thing, and that there be no diviſions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the ſame mind and in the ſame judgment.</q> He ſolemnly charges them to cultivate a ſpirit of LOVE and UNITY in the Church, and to avoid all party diſtinctions and party names, which are pregnant with miſchief,—naturally tending to contract the mind, ſtir up ſtrife, and confine cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity within the narrow limits of a very ſmall circle, and thus defeat and deſtroy the very deſign of Chriſtianity in the world. Such baleful conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are ſure to take place, when one and auother are ſaying, <hi>I am of Paul,—and I of Apollos,—and I of Cophas,</hi> or Peter,—<hi>and I of Chriſt.</hi>—Thus it was at <hi>Corinth,</hi> and a partiality, in favor of this or that preacher, ſo much prevailed, and gave riſe to ſuch warm contentions and bitterneſs,—that, I dare ſay, they might wiſh to have their ſeparato aſſemblies,—and that ſome would not go to hear <hi>Paul,</hi> had he preached within 100 yards of their door. They might not like his cloſe, ſearching doctrine—and to hear human nature ſo degraded, and ſee it drawn in ſuch black lines, as <hi>Paul</hi> was wont to do;—nor to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ear ſo much about faith, and righteouſneſs imputed—and their own works <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> from all ſhare of merit in point of juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. Theſe, you know, were favourite topics with that great Apoſtle.—<hi>Apelles</hi> was their man—
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:047065_0006_10229F69AC1EAD80"/>they would go any diſtance to hear him. O, he was a ſweet preacher—his oratorial powers were ſo charming, that he might be unto them <hi>as a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry lovely ſong of one that had a pleaſant voice.</hi>—Some would hear neither Paul or Apollos but would turn out in all weathers, by night or by day—be the ſeaſon hot or cold, wet or dry, to hear <hi>Peter</hi>—they were pleaſed with his plain, blunt manner of addreſs—and beſides he ſeemed, at times, to countenance ceremonies and the works of the law more than Paul did.—Others again had no ear for any but <hi>Paul</hi>—for he had the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a firſt-rate ſcholar, and a maſterly rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner;—they were for none of your <hi>fiſherman</hi>—they muſt have one brought up at the ſeat of the <hi>Muſes,</hi> or at the feet of ſome <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> or he would not do for them.—And there were others who were for no preacher at all,—they ſaw no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of going to hear any body—they could <hi>ſtay at home, and ſay their prayers, and do as well. I am of Chriſt,</hi> was their language.</p>
            <p>Thus, or, perhaps, to the ſame purpoſe, they went on rapidly, to the great diſgrace of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, the diſtraction of the Church, and the hurt of their own ſouls.—Againſt ſuch proceedings the Apoſtle pungently remonſtrates, as a dangerous rook—the bane of charity, and the ruin of the Chriſtian Church.—<hi>Is Chriſt divided?</hi> ſays he.
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:047065_0007_10229F6B39387FA0"/>This is his firſt argument to ſhow the impropriety and abſurdity of church diviſions. The argument ſtands thus—<hi>Is Chriſt divided?</hi>—Every body will anſwer, no. Then the natural concluſion, from the premiſes, is, Therefore, "his members ſhould not be divided."—Chriſt is the head of the Church, and all his people are the members o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> that one head,—the conſtituent parts of Chriſt's body. And if there ſhould be no <hi>ſchiſm</hi> in the natural body— no contention among its members,—is it not equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unnatural and pernicious, that there ſhould be any <hi>ſchiſm,</hi> rent, or contention among the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of that <hi>myſtical body,</hi> the church, of which Chriſt is the univerſal head? The Apoſtle makes uſe of the ſame reaſoning, in the 12th chapter of this epiſtle, when he reproves the <hi>Corinthiant</hi> for the diviſions, which had ariſen among them, from the diverſity of their ſpiritual gifts. "For as the body is one," ſays he, "and hath members; and all the members of that one body, being ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, are one body; ſo alſo is Chriſt."</p>
            <p>In diſcourſing on the ſubject, I purpoſe,</p>

I. I am to ſhow who the members of Chriſt are, which conſtitute his body, the church.— That all chriſtians are members of the church of Chriſt, is, I believe, a matter of no controverſy at all.—New men are called chriſtians, becauſe they are the diſciples of Chriſt, and, by a living faith, are united to him, and have communion with him, both in his merit and ſpirit. This is the caſe of all real chriſtians, and in conſequence of which, "they have put o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="10" facs="unknown:047065_0009_10229F712D209CC0"/>of church members, the <hi>profeſſion</hi> and <hi>life</hi> muſt both be conſidered, becauſe no man is to be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a chriſtian, who does not profeſs all the <hi>eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials</hi> of chriſtianity. Such as profeſs ſome parts of chriſtianity, and leave out, and deny other eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential parts, are not, in fact profeſſors of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, and conſequently are not members of the church as <hi>viſible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſome might be willing to aſk, what are the eſſentials of Chriſtianity,—and what is neceſſary for a man to profeſs, and be, in order to his being a member of Chriſt's Church?—<hi>This</hi> queſtion may be anſwered in a few words.—Every man, who ſo believeth in God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghoſt, that his faith puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth his heart, and worketh by obedient love, is a true Chriſtian, and conſequently a member of the Church of Chriſt, as <hi>viſible</hi> and <hi>inviſible.</hi>—But to render this matter more plain, I ſhall expreſs myſelf a little more full on the <hi>eſſentials</hi> of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity and the characteriſtics of church members. Every man, then, is a church member, who ſo believes in God, as to take him for his Lord and God—his Creator, Ruler and Governor,—his portion, his happineſs and ultimate end:—that ſo believes in Jeſus Chriſt, as to receive and rely on him, as his only Redeemer and God-man Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, who has fulfilled all righteouſneſs for us men,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:047065_0010_10229F73ADB67FD8"/>and for our ſalvation—and was <hi>obedient unto death, even the death of the croſs</hi>—ſuffering the juſt for the unjuſt—and made himſelf a ſacriſice of attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the ſins of men—by which obedience and ſuffering he hath purchaſed pardon and grace, holineſs and heaven for poor, guilty and wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſinners, who had incurred the diſpleaſure of God—loſt the divine image, and forfeited all right and title to life eternal:—that, having fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the work he came to do, he roſe from the dead—aſcended into heaven, where he reigns as Lord of the Church, and intercedes with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in behalf of his people;—and hath given out laws, which we muſt obey;—and, at the laſt day, he will come again and raiſe the dead—cite all mankind to the bar of his judgment ſeat, and will then judge the world in righteouſneſs, and paſs ſentence on <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>ſinners</hi>—adjudging <hi>thoſe</hi> to everlaſting life, and <hi>theſe</hi> to everlaſting puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And moreover, that he believes in, and takes the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> for his ſanctifier—and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten, quicken and purify—and, in a word, he believes that the Scriptures were given by <hi>his</hi> holy inſpiration—ſealed by his works and mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles—and, conſequently, that they contain the true and faithful words of God."</p>
            <p>What I have juſt now enumerated comprize the eſſentials of the Chriſtian religion,—and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:047065_0011_10229F762F1E1688"/>profeſſeth theſe things, profeſſeth the eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials of Chriſtianity. And he that not only profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, but hath alſo known the transforming power of theſe truths his own heart, and his profeſſion is attended with ſeriouſneſs and ſobriety—holineſs of life and converſation—a diligent uſe of all the means of grace, and the performance of all the known duties of religion,—piery toward God, and juſtice and mercy toward men—and a deſire to know more of God and his holy will, that his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience may be more perfect, and himſelf more dead to the world and ſin—more alive to God, and more conformed to his holy image:—if he lives a life of ſelf-denial—takes up the croſs, and is daily endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to crucify the fleſh with its affections and luſts:—He, I ſay, that ſo believes, and walks, is a Chriſtian, both in faith and practice,—is a living member of Chriſt's body the Church, and in a ſtate of ſalvation.</p>
            <p>And he that profeſſeth all this, profeſſeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be a Chriſtian: And though he may not have that living faith, which ſavingly unites him to Chriſt—purifies the heart, and conſtitutes an <hi>inviſible</hi> member,—yet, if his life does not noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſfly contradict and nullify his profeſſion, he i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> a member of the Church as <hi>viſible,</hi> and muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived as ſuch, by the paſtors of the Church, who
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:047065_0012_10229F79B30C09F8"/>are to judge only by the profeſſion, life and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation.</p>
            <p>Particular <hi>modes</hi> and <hi>forms</hi> of religious worſhip, adopted by one or another, enter not at all into the <hi>eſſentials</hi> of Chriſtianity; nor ought <hi>theſe</hi> to be made a bone of contention. If a man has faith in God, as reconciled to him through Jeſus Chriſt—if he has repentance from dead works— believes in the Holy Ghoſt, and, by his ſacred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, is made a partaker of the divine nature, and evidences the ſame, as expreſſed above,—this man is <hi>fundamentally right,</hi> and ought by no means to be excluded from our charity.—In ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternals, let every man be fully perſuaded in his own mind—and make prayer and ſupplication to God, in that way, which he finds moſt profitable to himſelf.—If men will not endeavour to culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate love and unity with one another, becauſe one prays with a form, and another does not,—I think there is great reaſon to ſuppoſe, that their zeal ſavours more of the things of men, than the things of God.</p>
            <p>But among the members of the Catholic Church, there is a great variety, in ſeveral reſpects. Some are babes, ſome are young men, and ſome are fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Some are but lately converted—others have borne the burden and heat of the day. The <hi>former,</hi> being weak in grace and knowledge, muſt
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:047065_0013_10229F7C351F1F00"/>be fed with milk, and taught and grounded in the firſt principles of the doctrines of Chriſt;—the <hi>lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> having their ſenſes exerciſed by uſe, muſt be fed with ſtronger meat, and carried on to matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, or perfection.—They differ much in their complexion. Though all the members of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily reſemble their heavenly Father in holineſs, yet, by their complexion, they may be diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one from another.—Some are meek, mild and timorous;—others are more choleric and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine. The <hi>former</hi> often complain of doubt, fear and difficulty;—but the latter are wont to ſpeak in more poſitive ſtrains, and appear more warm, zealous and confident.—They differ much as to ſpiritual health. Some are ſo vigorous that they ſeem all alive in the duties of religion, and their reliſh and appetite for their ſpiritual food, are ſo quick and ſharp, that they go to the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ordinances of religion and means of grace, with chearfulneſs and pleaſure. Others have but weak ſtomachs, and are obliged to drag them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on, eſpecially to ſecret duties, and to ſtrive hard to get down the heavenly manna.—In a word, ſome live much in holy peace and joy,— while others are under frequent complaints of deadneſs, coldneſs and indiſpoſition, though they are truly tender and conſcientious in all they do and ſay, and would not offend God, on any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:047065_0014_10229F7DC3D6C5D8"/>—while others, not a jot more conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, and perhaps having a conſiderable ſhare of miſguided zeal, have few, or no complaints at all.</p>
            <p>The members alſo differ in this, that all are not equally uſeful, nor have they all the ſame of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. Some, like pillars in the houſe, are the ſupports of the ſpiritual building, in the places where they live. Others can ſcarcely ſtand on their own legs, or take one ſtep further than they are ſupported and guided by their brethren. Some lay out themſelves in adminiſtering food and phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic, counſel and advice to the poor and weak mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: while others have ſo many maladies, that they trouble the family with their complaints and grievances.—Some are apt to teach, and are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed paſtors over the flock, to go before them, tend them, and give their portion of food in due ſeaſon—rightly dividing the word, and ſorting the proviſion according to the ſeveral ages and circumſtances of all under their care. Upon the whole, God hath ſet the members in the body, every one as it hath pleaſed him, and in ſuch or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and ſubſerviency one to another, that <hi>the eye cannot ſay unto the hand, I have no nood of thee, nor the head to the feet, I have no need of you.</hi> —Having ſhown who the members of Chriſt are, which conſtitute his body, the Church, both <hi>

II. To ſhew that the Church of Chriſt, in all the world, is but one, which is commonly called the Holy Catholic Church.</p>
            <p>This point may be proved in few words. It is ſtrongly implied in the words of the text, and is pretty clearly aſſerted in the words already quoted, from 1 Cor. xii. 12. <q>For as the body is one and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many are one body; ſo alſo is Chriſt.</q>—If by the body here is meant the Church, as it is univerſally underſtood, then it clearly follows, that all chriſtians, profeſſing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving and acting according to the character drawn under the firſt head, being members of that one body, of which Chriſt is the one undivided head, are all conſtituent parts of one and the ſame church; and conſequently, in the ſtricteſt ſenſe of the word, there can be but one church. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch chriſtians live in <hi>Europe, Aſia, Africa,</hi> or <hi>America,</hi> they conſtitute one and the ſame bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. They have all one God, the fountain of their being and the ſource of their felicity—one Father, who has reconciled himſelf to them, by Jeſus Chriſt, and them to him, by the renovation of their nature, and ſhedding abroad his love in their heart, by the Holy Ghoſt.—<q>They are all the children of God, by faith in Jeſus Chriſt.</q> They have all one Redeemer, Saviour and Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:047065_0016_10229F83E66817A0"/>who is the head ſovereign and centre of them all;—they are all built on one foundation, and Jeſus Chriſt, the chief <hi>conner ſtone,</hi> binds and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nects all in one; and, by him, is the whole body fitly joined together, and compacted. Jeſus Chriſt is the <hi>chief corner ſtone</hi> laid in <hi>Zion,</hi> on which all true believers are built up into one <hi>ſpiritual houſe</hi> —By his righteouſneſs are they all freely juſtified —by his obedience are they all made righteous, and by his ſpirit are all governed and ſanctified.— They are actuated by the ſame divine Spirit,— and by this one Spirit are all baptized into one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,—they all drink into one Spirit, and by that one Spirit have all acceſs to the Father, through Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The church is <hi>one,</hi> as all the members have one and the ſame chief end, which is, to glorify God and enjoy him for ever.—They are one in affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and deſire. Sin is the object of their hatred— the diſpleaſure of God is the object of their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap>: while God and Chriſt, holineſs and heaven, are the objects of their love, hope and deſire. Thus they unite, with one heart and ſoul, in the ſame objects.—They all li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="18" facs="unknown:047065_0017_10229F86650D2350"/>unanimous in renouncing the devil, the world and the fleſh—in devoting themſelves to God, as their Father—to Jeſus Chriſt, as their Saviour —and to the Holy Ghoſt, as their ſanctifier,— and in living in obedience to all the known and eſſential duties of the goſpel.—They love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and pray for the proſperity of the whole body. Their converſation is in heaven, and the ſervice of God is their employ.—And, at laſt, when they have finiſhed their courſe, they ſhall obtain the ſame crown of glory, join in the ſame gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral aſſembly and church of Chriſt in heaven, and praiſe their common Lord and Saviour, with one heart and ſoul and voice for ever and ever.</p>

               </p>
               <p>But ſuch as profeſs and believe with that faith, which purifies the heart and works by love, and unites to Chriſt myſtically, and are thus made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of his blood and righteouſneſs, and the life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving and ſanctifying virtues of the Holy Ghoſt, derived from him, the head of vital influence, as the branches derive ſap from the vine;—ſuch are not only juſtified and pardoned, by faith in the Redeemer, but are inwardly renewed in the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of their mind,—are holy in heart and life, and

<pb n="23" facs="unknown:047065_0022_10229F9233C5E030"/>True, in this country, the Church of England, as the Proteſtant Epiſcopal Church was once called, was the eſtabliſhed religion; and, perhaps, ninety nine out of a hundred knew little of any other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination, and in this church their children were baptized, and, by cuſtom, they were called <hi>Churchmen.</hi> But the generality, when they grew up, joined themſelves, in reality, to no church at all; but followed, as they now do, the way of their own hearts, and walked in the ſight of their own eyes. And is this peculiar to any particular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination? Your own obſervation will inform you that it is not. The truth of the caſe is this, that no man ever was, nor ever will be a true member of Chriſt's church by <hi>natural generation;</hi> but he is made ſo by <hi>ſpiritual regeneration,</hi>—or being born of the Spirit of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Is it ſo that the church of Chriſt is <hi>one,</hi> and that all true Chriſtians are members of but <hi>one body,</hi> of which <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the head? What pity is it then, that there ſhould be ſo little love and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:047065_0023_10229F94FAE24F70"/>among the profeſſors of <hi>his</hi> name, and ſo much animoſity among his members?—What ſignifies all profeſſions without love?—<q>Ah! this is right, <hi>ſays one,</hi> and ſure I am, <hi>ſays he,</hi> I love all the people of God.</q>—But who are they? Here is the point, <q>O <hi>ſays one,</hi> if ever I was among the people of God in my life, they are the <hi>Baptiſts.</hi>
                  </q> And another, <q>If ever I was among the people of God, they are the <hi>Methodiſts;</hi>
                  </q>— and ſo on. Now, if you can ſearch to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, you would find the love of many great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors centring in <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that</hi> party, and confined within the contracted circle of ſuch as do as they do, ſay as they ſay, and think as they think; and that in ſome particular matters very uneſſential, and hardly countenanced by the word of God. Now, <hi>if you love them that love you, what reward have you? Do not even the publicans the ſame?</hi> This is no proof at all that you have any Chriſtian love. Where there is a combination, or a ſame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in principles and practices, the worſt of men, even horſe-thieves, are fond of one another.—</p>
               <p>
                  <q>This is the truth <hi>ſays one,</hi> and I am ſure, I love people of all profeſſions, who are Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</q> —But take care,—don't you find it hard to think any man a Chriſtian, who is not of your party?—Bigotry has a great tendency to make men <hi>hard of belief,</hi> in this reſpect. And while
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:047065_0024_10229F969F3D21A0"/>thoſe, poſſeſt of it, are blind to the failings of any of their own party, they have an eagle's eye to diſcover the flaws of others, and a microſcopic eye to magnify mole-hills into mountains.—Search and ſee how it ſtands with you, in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.</p>
               <p>From bigotry and a party ſpirit it comes to paſs, that we find ſome can give no credit to the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies and good qualities of any, who belong not to their own diviſion, nor to the miſcarriages of any who do.—Tell them what a laborious, pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, animated, uſeful preacher ſuch a man is, who belongs to a different party;—they don't ſeem to hear you,—they receive the account ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry coldly,—and, perhaps, they will hum a tune, while you are talking, to ſhew they have no ear for that diſcourſe.—And after you have done, perhaps the reply may be,—<q>But is he not a <hi>Calviniſt?</hi>
                  </q>—Or, "Is he not an <hi>Armenian?</hi>" This is intended to obliterate, or, at leaſt, to caſt a cloud over all good qualities whatever.—And it is not unlikely, but they will hint, "That they have heard a very different ſtory—and that one of their Brethren had <hi>mentioned ſomething</hi>— but he did not like <hi>to ſay much.</hi>—However they wiſh he may be <hi>a good man</hi>—though they fear he has got too much of <hi>the ſpirit of the world.</hi>"—But if inſtead of good qualities, you men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:047065_0025_10224B25DB52CBF8"/>ſome bad ones, or relate ſome fault, you catch their attention at once, and are heard with a ſmile of approbation.—Pauſe, my brethren, and ſee how much of this belongs to you.—I ſear ſome of you will find yourſelves very far from the Catholic love of <hi>that Chriſtian,</hi> who, in reality, loves all the children or people of God of every profeſſion.</p>
               <p>Chriſtian love is univerſal. And we may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to Chriſtianity as much as we pleaſe, yet we do but deceive ourſelves, if it does not open our hearts, in love, to all profeſſing chriſtians as ſuch, and all <hi>ſaints</hi> as <hi>ſaints,</hi> according to their various degrees of amiableneſs. And that love and deſire of unity, which is not <hi>univerſal,</hi> has, in it, a ſtrong tincture of <hi>wrath</hi> and <hi>ſchiſm.</hi> He, that loveth one party, and not the reſt, falls vaſtly ſhort of loving all mankind;—and he, that is united but to a part, muſt of conſequence be divided from the whole.</p>
               <p n="4">4. From what has been ſaid, we may learn how much it is the duty of all chriſtians to promote uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty among all profeſſors in general, and in their own neighbour hoods in particular; and to avoid all diſcord and diviſions, and whatever tends there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.—Unity, in the body of Chriſt, conſtitutes its <hi>health, eaſe, quiet</hi> and <hi>proſperity.</hi> But <hi>ſmart, pain, inquietude</hi> and <hi>wounds,</hi> are the native effects of
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:047065_0026_10229F9C99C8C0F8"/>impenitence;—his bowels of compaſſion yearn over you:—he expoſtulates with you, and aſks, <hi>why will ye die, O louſe of Iſrael?</hi>—He offers you pardon for all your ſins,—to help and guard you to eternal glory; and to inveſt you with that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, which was purchaſed with his own precious blood.—And, O will none of theſe things move you?—Are you determined like wicked So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, to hold on your courſe, and follow the way of your own hearts?—</p>
               <p>And is there no remedy?—Is it in vain to ſpeak to you—Then let me turn my voice to God. Lot found favor, and by his prayer ſaved one little ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And who can tell, but the ears of the Lord may be open to my prayer, while I am interce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for you.—"And now, O thou fountain of mercy, have compaſſion on this congregation, and their ſouls ſhall live.—Open the ears and ſoften the hearts of theſe poor obſtinate ſinners, with whom all our warnings and intreaties have been in vain.—O Lord Jeſus, thou Saviour of loſt men, have mercy on theſe ſouls, in the depth of their ſecurity, preſumption and miſery;—and may thy blood ſoften and melt their hearts.—O thou Spirit of the living God, apply the remedy to <hi>thoſe,</hi> ſo dearly bought; bring them to a deep ſenſe of their danger—ſeize their conſciences, and with a holy</p>

The true anſwer might be, that all men ſhould agree to his terms, and come over to that party to which he is joined.—Such pride and ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhneſs forbid all hope of peace. The papiſts, no doubt, would have peace with proteſtants, on theſe terms. <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>ſelfiſhneſs</hi> are among the greateſt enemies to the church's peace. <hi>Theſe</hi> the devil makes uſe of to break the unity of chriſtians; and he carefully watches all opportunities to throw in ſome bone of contention to ſeatter and divide the members of Chriſt. He will make uſe of the opinions and diſpoſitions even of the godly to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer this diabolical purpoſe. Some of theſe he will entangle in dangerous errors, and hereby he lays a train for blowing up animoſities and warm contentions in doctrinal points.

This is extremely dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, eſpecially to young perſons, and ſuch as are not well taught and grounded in the nature and doctrines of the goſpel. How many are now ſtiff bigots, and furious for ſome divided party, in oppoſition to all others, who dreamed of no ſuch thing, when they firſt became intimate with their preſent aſſociates. Had they been told that ſuch would be the effects, and that, in a little while, they would be led to forſake, and oppoſe even their fathers in the goſpel—probably, they would have replied, with <hi>Hazael,</hi> 
                  <q>Is thy ſervant a dog that he ſhould do this thing?</q> But after hearing and ſeeing thoſe men, whom they eſteem eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pious, make it their religion and frequent prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to vilify and traduce all others as enemies to Chriſt and the goſpel—and hearing their own ſide extolled as mere angels, and all others repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as of ſuſpicious characters, or reproached and ſpoken againſt as blind, lifeleſs and formal—ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the <hi>Church,</hi> or to <hi>them,</hi> as they generally call themſelves the church, by way of eminence and diſtinction;—when they hear the principle of one, or another loaded with hard <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

O that you, my dear brethren, would bear with my plainneſs, and hear without prejudice—for be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured I have no end to ſerve, but the good of your ſouls, and the peace and happineſs of the Catholic church.—Whenever you hear a man extolling his own party—and vilifying others, either in plain terms, or by hints and inſinuations—mark that man, and beware—take care how you catch that ſpirit,— for it is not the ſpirit of Chriſt, but the ſpirit of pride, bigotry and ſelfiſhneſs—yea, it is the ſpirit of him, who is <hi>the accuſer of the brethren,</hi> and the enemy of love and peace.</p>
               <p>How much better would it be, and how much mere of the ſpirit of Chriſtianity would it mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, if, inſtead of <hi>this,</hi> chriſtians of every denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation would be tender of the character of each other, and defend it, as long as it could be done with honor—and endeavour to cultivate a friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:047065_0030_10229FA6C81ACC70"/>correſpondence with each other;—and if there is a diverſity of ſentiment, in ſome particular ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, which are not <hi>eſſential,</hi>—why ſhould <hi>that</hi> which is not eſſential in itſelf, be ſuffered to do ſuch an <hi>eſſential injury,</hi> as that of tearing the body of Chriſt to pieces, wounding the cauſe of religion—and deſtroying the peace and happineſs of its profeſſors. What if there be a diverſity in ſome <hi>modes</hi> of external worſhip, or <hi>rules</hi> of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; —this is only the <hi>body</hi> and ought by no means to hinder our unity and agreement in the <hi>ſoul</hi> of religion.</p>
               <p>The eſſentials of religion, as briefly laid down under my firſt head, are embraced, I believe by all perſuaſions—and I ſhould think, they conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute a bottom broad enough, for all Chriſtians to ſtand on together—and afford a ſufficient baſis, for catholic unity.—Surely, thoſe, who will not unite here, muſt have ſome other ends to ſerve than the peace, harmony and welfare of the <hi>Church,</hi> and the good of precious ſouls.</p>
               <p>O could this bleſſed agreement, in the SOUL of religion once be permitted to take place, and prevail, its happy conſequences would ſoon be apparent. Religion would gain credit and eſteem in the earth, and force the world to ſay, "See how theſe Chriſtians love!"—And it would not only gain credit, but influence, when
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:047065_0031_10229FA982A70808"/>its genuine tendency ſhould manifeſt itſelf, and prevail in love and charity to all mankind.—We ſhould hear of no more jars and contentions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong its true profeſſors, nor proſcriptions of this or that preacher, who has nothing worſe to be laid to his charge, than that he does not join ſully to our particular party, and is not ſubject to our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate controul.—It would be ſufficient for an union of hearts, if he fears God, and orders his converſation agreeably to the <hi>rules</hi> of the goſpel of God, though he might not think proper to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject himſelf to every <hi>rule</hi> deviſed by man.</p>
               <p>I have ſpoke the more freely on this ſubject, becauſe it is well known, that during the long courſe of my miniſtry, I have never ſat up as a head, or violent abettor of any party. And though I am a miniſter and a member of what is called the Old Church, and ſuch I expect to live and die,—yet have I ſtrenuouſly endeavored to cultivate love, affection, harmony and friendſhip with <hi>all</hi>—I have vindicated the characters of <hi>all,</hi> which I believed to be unjuſtly aſperſed,—and, as far as opportunity has ſerved, I have heard <hi>all</hi> —preached to <hi>all,</hi> and gladly joined with <hi>all,</hi> in their places of worſhip, in every ordinance of Chriſt.—But I have ſeen ſo much miſchief done by bigotry and a party ſpirit, not only in that particular corner of the vineyard where I have
