            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>AS the Day of our Death, and the Day of Judgement, will quickly overtake us all; when we are to be eternally fixed in a State of conſumate Glory and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or of everlaſting Shame and Miſery: Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as we ſhall be found, to have conducted ourſelves here in the Body. It is of the laſt Importance to us all, that we live every one of our Days, ſo as to be in a continual Readineſs, for that great Day of ſolemn Accounts; when God will bring to Light every ſecret and hiden Work of Darkneſs; and Judge the Secrets of Men's Hearts According to the Goſpel. Leſt that Day coming upon us unawares; we be found unprepared and unready; and ſo periſh for ever without Remedy. Concerning which, we are called upon here in our Text, to take Heed to ourſelves.—Our Bleſſed Lord Jeſus who ſpake theſe Words; had been treating on the Deſtruction of Jeruſalem, of the fearful Signs and terrible Diſſolations of that Day; when the Son of Man ſhould come, to execute Vengeance upon that People, for their great Sin
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:006862_0003_102A7EA59FA30790"/>of Rejecting and Crucifying him, the Lord of Life and Glory. Which Deſtruction of the Jewiſh State; was a Sort of Emblem, of the coming of the Son of God, to judge the World. And ſo the Day of our Death and the Day of Judgment; will be as Important a Day to us, as that was to the Jews; and a Day for which we are equally concerned to be in a Readineſs. and therefore the Words of our Text, are as needful and applicable to us, in the View of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching Death and Judgment; as to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Hearers of Chriſt, with Regard to the threatned Deſtruction of Jeruſalem. For Death and Judgement, even as to them, were the main Things implyed in the coming of that Day. But here then, in the Words of our Text, you have the Call and Command of Chriſt, to <hi>take Heed to yourſelves,</hi> to look to it, with a ſtrict Guard and Watch over yourſelves, as in a Caſe of great Danger, in a Matter of the utmoſt Importance, <hi>leſt at any Time your Hearts be overcharged;</hi> leſt the Powers and Faculties of your Minds be Cloged in their Operations; <hi>with Surfeiting and Drunkenneſs,</hi> by eating or drinking to Exceſs, ſo as either to overload the Stomach or impair the Brain; or leſt the Heart be filled with carking and ſolicitous <hi>Cares</hi> and Concerns about the Things <hi>of this preſent Life; And ſo that Day,</hi> the Day of Death and
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:006862_0004_102A7EA781AC1DA8"/>Judgment, <hi>come upon you unawares.</hi> For ſuch Indulgences, will aſſuredly render you, utterly unfit and unready for that great Day; and ſo be your eternal Ruin. And therefore ye had Need, take Heed to yourſelves, leſt at any Time ye be overtaken therein. But it is the Surfeiting and Drunkenneſs here ſpoken of, that I chiefly deſign to treat of at this Time. And ſo the Doctrine to be noted from the Words may be this.</p>
            <p>Doc. <hi>That to eat or to drink to Exceſs, ſo as to have the Heart overcharged with Surfeiting and Drunkenneſs, is a very ruinous and deſtructive Sin, of which it concerns every one, to take Heed to themſelves, leſt at any Time, they be over taken therein.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In ſpeaking to which I ſhall conſider and ſhew.</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. <hi>What it is, to eat or to Drink to Exceſs, ſo as to have the Heart overcharged with Surfeiting and Drunkenneſs.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>II. <hi>Set forth the very ruinous and deſtractive Nature of this Sin.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>III. <hi>The great Need, that every one ſhould take Heed to themſelves, leſt at at any Time, they be overtaken therein.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>But,</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>To conſider and Shew, what it is, to eat or to drink to Exceſs, ſo as to have the Heart over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged with Surfeiting and Drunkenneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:006862_0005_102A7EA9D302A360"/>
Becauſe it is innocent and Lawful, and even a Duty, to eat and to drink; therefore Men are ready to flatter themſelves, that they are not cheargeable with Surfeiting and Drunkenneſs; except they run into ſuch very groſs Exceſs therein, as wholly to over power all their Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Senſes. But every Degree of Exceſs in Meats and in Drinks, is a Degree of Surfeiting and Drunkenneſs. But clearly to ſet forth, what it is, to eat or to drink to Exceſs, it is to be obſerved.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That the End and Deſign of Meats and of Drinks, is to ſatisfy the innocent Cravings of Nature; and ſo to fit for the Service of God and the Buſineſs of Life.</hi> As God has been pleaſed to frame our Bodies ſo, as that Meats and Drinks are abſolutely requiſite, to nouriſh and ſtrengthen our animal Nature. So he has been pleaſed, wiſely to implant in our Natures, thoſe Appetites called Hunger and Thirſt; which as the Body needs Refreſhment, naturally raiſe an uneaſy Senſation in us; thereby to excite us to take needful Suſtenance; without which, Men would ſome Times be in Danger of Neglecting Food, to the great Injury of their animal Nature. And as God for wiſe Ends, has implanted theſe Natural Appetites. So from the Openings of his bountiful Hand, he is wont in the common Courſe of his Providence; to grant a plentiful
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:006862_0006_102A7EAC0BC02208"/>Supply of Meats and Drinks; and that in a very great and pleaſing Variety, to ſatisfy all the innocent Cravings of Nature. But then theſe Cravings of Nature, and the Proviſion which God in his good Providence makes for the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply thereof; are for much higher and nobler Purpoſes, than meerly to gratify and pleaſe the Fleſh: Even that our Hearts might be filled, with Gratitude and Thankfulneſs to God; and that we might be ſtrengthened for his Service, and for all the neceſſary Duties and Buſineſs of Life. And therefore our Appetites of Hunger and Thirſt, are then only innocent, when they crave no more, than is good for our Nature; for our Nounſhment, Strengthening and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. And indeed, ſo far to gratify theſe Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites, as tends to fill our Hearts with Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to God for his Bounties; and alſo to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitate us for his Service, and the neceſſary Duties of Life; is not only innocent and lawful; but even a Duty, enjoyned in the ſixth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment. Which requires all lawful En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to preſerve our own Lives. And to ſuch a Degree, Men may truely eat and drink for the Glory of God, as we are required. 1 Cor. x. 31. <hi>Whether therefore ye eat or drink, or whatſoever ye do, do all to the Glory of God.</hi> All Things are and were created for God's Glory. And to this End, ſhould we live, and to
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:006862_0007_102A7EAEB38F0538"/>this End ſhould we improve all the good Creatures of God, even to his Glory. But then.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>To eat or to drink, ſo as to diſorder the Faculties of Body or of Mind, and render our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unfit for the Service of God, or the Duties of Life; is to overcharge the Heart with Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting and Drunkenneſs.</hi> While a moderate Portion of Meats and of Drinks, by the Good Providence of God, kindly nouriſhes and ſtrengthens our animal Nature; a greater Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure overloads the Stomach, blunts the Senſes, and renders Men dull and liſtleſs; or intoxicates the Brain, and ſtupifies the Mind. And ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſes Men, either for the Service of God, or the Duties of Life. And thus to eat or to drink, to ſuch a Degree, as to incapacitate our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in any Meaſure, for a due Diſcharge of the Duties which we owe, to God, to our Neighbour or ourſelves; is ſo far to fruſtrate the good End and Deſign of Meats, and of Drinks: And therefore is an exceſſive Uſe and Abuſe thereof. Every Degree of which, ſo far as it overcharges the Heart, intoxicates the Mind, or blunts the Senſes, and incapacitates for Duty, is a Meaſure of Surfeiting and Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. But in this Exceſs, there are various Degrees; though every Degree of Exceſs is Sin. But the more the Heart is overcharged, and the Powers and Faculties incapacitated for
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:006862_0008_102A7EB0F329DAC8"/>Duty; the more groſs and heinous is the Sin. To eat and drink ſo far only, as is truely for our Nouriſhment and Comfort, falls within the Laws of Chriſtian Temperance and Sobriety. But whatſoever is more than this, is Evil, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Tranſgreſſion of the Laws of Nature and of Chriſt: And is a Meaſure of Surfeiting and Drunkenneſs. But,</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>Of the ruinous and deſtructive Nature, of this Sin of Surfeiting and Drunkenneſs; or of eating and drinking to Exceſs, with the ſad and fatal Conſequences thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Exceſs in Meats and in Drinks, have in many Reſpects, the ſame Tendency and the ſame bad Conſequence. Tho' that of intemperate drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as it is commonly much the moſt Preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, ſo it is ordinarily attended, with much the moſt fatal Conſequences. And to this therefore I ſhall chiefly have my Eye, in conſidering the ruinous and deſtructive Nature of Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>It impairs the Conſtitution, and enfeebles the Powers and Faculties of Body and of Mind.</hi> It don't only incapacitate to Duty, while the Heart is overcharged. But it tends to impair the animal Frame; to bring on Diſeaſes; and ſo to ſhorten Men's Days, and haſten them down to the Grave, as it were before their Time. At leaſt it much enfeebles Men's Powers and
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:006862_0009_102A7EB3319B0150"/>Faculties, it conſumes their Strength, it fades their Beauty, it weakens their Reaſon, ſhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters their Judgment, and ſtupifies Conſcience. And ſo it tends to bring Men down, as to their Powers and Faculties, to be even as Children and Fools. Temperance is a great Friend to our natural Capacities, and tends to ſtrengthen them. But every Fit of Intemperance, tends to enfeeble all a Man's Powers; and ſo to bring him down to the Duſt, or to a Level even with the Beaſts.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>It is a great Moth to Men's temporal Eſtates; and tends to bring Poverty upon themſelves and their Families.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Surfeiting and Drunkenneſs, is an eating Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, a fatal Conſumption, to Men's Eſtates. Both, as it is attended with needleſs and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant Expences, and eſpecially, as it incapaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates Men for their Buſineſs; prevents their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Diligent and prudent, and occaſions much miſpence of Time; in drowſineſs, ſauntring and Idleneſs, or in fooliſh, vain and wicked Company. And ſo tends to bring on many bad Habits, which ſoon plunge Men and their Families into Poverty and Diſtreſs. For as the wiſe Man ſays, <hi>The Drunkard and the Glutton ſhall come to Poverty.</hi> And accordingly it is no uncommon Thing in the World, to ſee very likely and promiſing Men, with fair and handſome Eſtates,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:006862_0010_102A7EB56B69FF98"/>not only ruined, as to their own Uſefulneſs and Improvement in the World; but plunged into the very Depths of Poverty, Cloathed with Rags, their Wives and Children turned out of Houſe and Home, and themſelves become as Vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonds on the Earth: Only thro' Surfeiting and Drunkenneſs, as the Root of all this dreadful Calamity. A Spectacle, that might well make a Heart of Stone to relent and weep: That to gratify a filthy Luſt, Men ſhould bring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their Families, into ſuch deplorable Ruin; even as to the preſent Life. But,</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Surfeiting and Drunkenneſs unman's Men, and makes them even a Shame and Reproach among Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of all Sins, it makes Men appear the moſt deformed and ridiculous; ſo that it renders them, a Laughing Stock and Scorn, even to Children. While Men's Heads are intoxicated and Swim with Fumes, they are ready to count the World all their own; who, ſo happy ſo witty and wiſe as they! While at the ſame Time, all their Beholders look on them, with Pity and Grief, or with Scorn and Contempt, making them the Fool of their Play, their Laugh and Deriſion. So that one would think, a Man that has any Senſe of Honour; and any manly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to his own Reputation and good Name; would rather chuſe to Die, even a Thouſand
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:006862_0011_102A7EB80D2A50C8"/>Deaths; than to drink himſelf ſuch a Scorn and Deriſion among Men. <hi>A good Name is better than precious Ointment.</hi> But a Man's good Name is gone to all Intents, when once he has drank himſelf, into the Name of a Drunkard. And inſtead of being honoured and eſteemed, he can expect nothing, but to be the Scorn and Deriſion, even of the loweſt and moſt ignoble Part of his Species. <hi>Wine is a Mocker,</hi> and it makes Men a Mock and Reproach among Men. And.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Surfeiting and Drunkenneſs, is a Sin lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to many other Sins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It lays a Man open and renders him an eaſy Prey to every Temptation. It ſo takes away the Reaſon and Judgment, that it leaves Men without any Guard and Watch over themſelves; and ſo leads to a Thouſand Extravagances and Follies. It fills Men's Mouths with vain Bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blings, with unſeemly, ſilly and fooliſh Talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Yea it imboldens Men, to take God's Name in vain, to Curſe and Swear and Lie in Jeſt: And to make a Mock and Deriſion of Things Sacred and Divine. It prompts Men to ſpeak Evilly and Reproachfully of their Neighbours without Cauſe; and to ſlander and revile the Vertuous and Good; and is many Times the Occaſion of a Tumultuous Feud, of boiſterous, haughty and angry Paſſions. <hi>Strong
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:006862_0012_102A7EBAF0405F08"/>Drink is Raging.</hi> Prov. xx. 1. And ſo hurries Men into Quarrels and Contentions, to Spite and Revenge; and ſometimes even to Blows and Blood ſhed. As the Wiſe Man ſays, <hi>Who hath Wo? Who hath Sorrow? Who hath Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? Who hath Babbling? Who hath Wounds without Cauſe? Who hath Redneſs of Eyes? They that tarry long at the Wine, they that go to ſeek mixt Wine.</hi> Prov. xxiii. 29, 30. Yea it lays open and expoſes all a Man's Weakneſs, Frailties and Imperfections: What ever Follies, Luſt and Paſſions he is incident unto; an intoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated Brain throws off the Covering, and Expoſes all the Man's Nakedneſs. It betrays his moſt ſecret Betruſtments, to his own Shame, and the Shame of his Friend. Sometimes it makes Men very Talkative in Matters of Religion; full of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, and expreſſive of great Joys and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts; to their own great Shame, and the great Reproach and Scandal of the Religion which they profeſs: Which of all Thing is moſt grievous and ſhocking to behold. And it is alſo a great Incentive to fleſhly Luſts, and to wanton lacivious and unchaſt Words and Actions. And often occaſions Quarrels and Contentions in Families. Yea it is a leading Thing to all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Iniquity. Beſides, it utterly indiſpoſes to every Religious Duty; excludes all ſerious Thoughts out of the Mind; and ſhuts the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:006862_0013_102A7EBD271B0838"/>Reading of God's Word, and ſecret and Family Prayer, out of their Families and out of their Cloſets; or makes Men's Prayers, offered with the Fumes of an intoxicated Brain, a moſt hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Abomination indeed to the Lord. And verily there can be no true Fear of God; no Regard for his Glory; no true Devotion at Heart, no true Gratitude and Praiſe to God, no Watching and Striving againſt the World and the Fleſh, no Aſpiring after Heavenly Things, no true Mournings and Relentings for Sin, no perfecting Holineſs in the Fear of God and no Runing for Eternal Life, while the Heart is overcharged with Surfeiting and Drunkenneſs. But all Pretenſions to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in this Caſe, are a Reproach to Religion itſelf; and a moſt horrid Offence and Abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation both to God and to Men. And the Intereſt of the Soul inevitably runs back, and ſinks with an inconceivable Swiftneſs down into the Depths of Pollution and Guilt. And ſo,</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Surfeiting and Drunkenneſs do inevitably unfit the Soul for Death and Judgment; and expoſe it to certain and Everlaſting Ruin and Deſtruction.</hi> As it is a Sin that impairs Man's rational Powers, that inflames every Luſt, and leads on to a Flood of Inquity; ſo it is a Sin that doth vile Diſhonour to God, that abates his Mercies, that pollutes the Soul, that loads
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:006862_0014_102A7EBEB6A5AB78"/>it with Guilt, and that renders it utterly unmeet for the Kingdom of Heaven; and ſo expoſeth it to the avenging Strokes of Divine Juſtice. And ſuch God has aſſured us, ſhall not inherit his Heavenly Kingdom. 1 Cor. vi. 9. 10. <hi>Know ye not that the unrighteous ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God? Be not deceived, neither Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cators, nor Idolators, &amp;c. nor Drunkards, ſhall inherit the Kingdom of God.</hi> And again. Gal. v. 19. 20. <hi>Now the Works of the Fleſh are manifeſt, which are Theſe, Adultery, Fornication, &amp;c. and Drunkenneſs, of the which I tell you before, as I have told you in Time paſt, that they which do ſuch Things, ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God.</hi> And wo therefore, as it is written, Iſai. v. 22. <hi>Wo unto them that are mighty to drink Wine, and Men of Strength to mingle Strong Drink.</hi> And wo to ſuch indeed, for they are going in the high Road to Ruin and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; they are heaping up to themſelves Shame, Poverty and Reproach in this World, and treaſuring up to themſelves Wrath againſt the Day of Wrath. And when ever Death and Judgment over takes them, they muſt, without a deep and thorough Repentance, inevitably ly down in everlaſting Shame and Confuſion, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the eternal Wrath and Curſe of God. For He that can't lie has ſaid, they ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God. And therefore, when
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:006862_0015_102A7EC1475EDF10"/>that great Day which is haſtening, ſhall once over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the Sinner in his Surfeiting and Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, he can no more Delight himſelf in his inordinate Luſts: But muſt change his delicious Cups, for the Wine of God's Wrath, <hi>poured out without Mixture into the Cup of his Indignation:</hi> Without ſo much as one Drop of Water to cool a ſcorched Tongue. And then may it be ſaid with an Emphaſis, as in Joel, 1. 5. <hi>Awake ye Drunkards, and Weep, and Howl, all ye Drinkers of Wine, becauſe of the new Wine, for it is cut off from your Mouth.</hi> Oh how fearfully ruinous and deſtructive indeed, in Time and forever, is this Sin of Surfeiting and Drunkenneſs. But.</p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>To ſhew the great Need, that every one ſhould take Heed to themſelves, leſt at any Time, they be overtaken in this ruinous Sin.</hi> To take Heed leſt at any Time we be overtaken in this Sin; <hi>Implyes,</hi> that we keep a very ſtrict Guard and Watch over ourſelves: Leſt under a Pretence of ſatisfying the innocent Cravings of Nature; and of Eating and Drinking for the needful Refreſhment and Nouriſhment of our Bodies: We take more than is meet; overcharge our Hearts, and plunge ourſelves into a Degree of Surfeiting and Drunkenneſs. And that we Watch and Guard ourſelves, not only, againſt a prevailing Habit of Exceſs herein, but againſt
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:006862_0016_102A7EC429E4FDA8"/>taking to Exceſs at any Time, and in any Degree; leſt Exceſs at one Time, and in one Degree, enlarge our Appetite and inflame our Thirſt; ſo as to make Way for Exceſs at another Time, and in a greater Degree; till we be overborne, and carried headlong down the Precipice of this ruinous Sin. Again, this taking Heed to ourſelves, <hi>Implyes,</hi> that we carefully keep at a ſafe and ſecure Diſtance from this Sin. That we think not to dally with it; that we give not way to the Gratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of our Appetites, to the fartheſt Extent of what we imagine our Natures may poſſibly bear. <hi>Eſpecially</hi> if we find, that at any Time, we have been overtaken in any Degree of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, and have eat or drank more than was meet; or if we find that inordinate Cravings and Thirſtings begin ſecretly to grow in, and prevail upon us; that we do then awake, to a double Guard and Watch over ourſelves; to keep at the greateſt Diſtance from, and even wholly to deny ourſelves, any Uſe at all, of thoſe particular Meats, and Drinks, whereby we are in ſpecial Danger: Rather than to venture the fatal Hazard of Surfeiting and Drunkenneſs. To pretend to take Heed againſt any Evil, and yet tamper with the Temptations to it; as to pretend to take Heed againſt Surfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Drunkenneſs; and yet indulge ones ſelf
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:006862_0017_102A7EC69430ABB0"/>to the very Borders of Exceſs, and frequent drinking Places and drinking Company, is but a vain Pretence. For the intoxicating Cup is inſnaring, and ſoon alures to Exceſs. But he that would take due Heed to himſelf, muſt watchfully ſhun the Way, the Place, and Company, and even the very Appearance of Exceſs. And ſtand at the greateſt Diſtance from thoſe Evils, with which he finds himſelf moſt eaſily beſet. <hi>And now Men have all Need to watch moſt heedfully, againſt this Sin of Intemperance.</hi> Not only becauſe it is ſuch a Ruinous and deſtructive Evil, to themſelves and their Families, to their Bodies and to their Souls, to their Honour, Intereſt and Welfare, in Time and to all Eternity: All which ſhould be weighty and powerful Motives with us, to excite us, to utmoſt watchfulneſs againſt this Sin. But there are farther Reaſons alſo, why we had need take Heed leſt at any Time we be overtaken in this Sin. As</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Becauſe it is a Sin that we are all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally incident unto, and in Danger of.</hi> As we are fallen Creatures, the noble Powers of our Minds are wofully ruined, and the Fleſhly Appetites are prone to break out into great Exorbitancy, to exceed their proper Bounds and run into Exceſs. So that we are naturally inclined to exceed the Bounds of Temperance
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:006862_0018_102A7EC823F51018"/>and Sobriety; to let Reaſon and Judgment give way to Inclination and Luſt; and ſo to be governed by fleſhly Appetites and Deſires, more than by Reaſon and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. So that unleſs we take Heed to ourſelves, to mortify and keep under the Deeds of the Body; our craving Appetites will ſoon plunge us into Exceſs. And,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>It is a Sin which Men are very ready to palliate and excuſe themſelves in; at leaſt, as to ſome of the firſt and loweſt Degrees thereof.</hi> For as every Kind of Meat and Drink is given for the Uſe and Benefit of Man, and may lawfully be uſed for our good and Comfort. Therefore Men in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with their exorbitant Appetites and Deſires, are ready to perſwade themſelves, that more is for their Comfort, than is in any wiſe for their good. And ſo, under the Notion of taking for their Comfort, they excuſe themſelves in taking to Exceſs: So much as really to diſcompoſe their Minds, and render them fooliſh and ridiculous; though they drown not all their Senſes. So that it is an inſnaring Evil, that creeps upon
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:006862_0019_102A7ECA5D9F5020"/>Men unawares. And therefore had need to be heedfully watched againſt; as a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret undermining Enemy, that doth not make the firſt Onſet, by an open Aſſault, but by underhand Craft and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit. And,</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>It is a very growing Sin.</hi> Where it once begins to get Footing it often gains Ground apace, and is rarely expelled. As Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance at the firſt, commonly ſteals upon Men by inſenſible Degrees; ſo every Degree leaves vitiated Taint, and inflamed Thirſt behind, which lays the Foundation, for ſtill greater and greater Exceſs; as Time and Opportunity ſerves, or Temptation preſents: Till ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Surfeiting and Drunkenneſs, to a very great and ſhameful Degree, gets ſtrongly rooted, even into a prevailing Habit in Men; and they get deep in the Pit, and wofully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled in the Snare; ere they are aware of the Danger they are in. And then alas, exorbitant Cravings being grown into a Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, 'tis hard for Men thoroughly to reform. <hi>As for the Ethiopian to change his Skin or the Leopard his Spots.</hi> And thus it is in Fact
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:006862_0020_102A7ECC509967A8"/>too rarely ſeen in the World, that an habituated Drunkard, ever eſcapes the Snares, to lead a Life truely Sober and temperate. And therefore Men had need take Heed betimes, left at any Time, their Hearts be overcharged with Surfeiting and Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and ſo this Sin ſteal upon them, and get the Prevalency over them una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares; to the utter Ruin of their Name and Eſtate, Welfare and Happineſs, for Time and Eternity. And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Finally, It is a Sin that doth vile Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour to God.</hi> As it leads to many other Sins, expoſes all a Man's Frailties and Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and indiſpoſeth to a due Performance of any religious Duty; ſo it Leads to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable Provocations againſt Heaven; doth the vileſt Diſhonour to Religion; and gives even the Heathen Occaſion to ſcoff and Blaſpheme. So that if Men have any Regard to the Glory of God, any Fear to offend him, any Deſire to honour and pleaſe him, or any Regard for the Honour of that Religion which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, or deſire to ſhare the Bleſſings, or
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:006862_0021_102A7ED000E00790"/>Care to ſhun the Curſes of it: They had need take Heed to themſelves in Earneſt; leſt at any Time their Hearts be overcharged with Surfeiting and Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>But to come to the,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Improvement.</hi> Our firſt Uſe, may be of <hi>Solemn Warning, to all ſuch as are given to intemperate Indulgences.</hi> Would to God there were none ſuch amongſt us, For it is too ſhameful an Evil once to be mentioned, among thoſe that call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Chriſtians. But alas, it is greatly to be feared, that it is a very growing and prevailing Iniquity; both more publickly and privately; to the great Scandal and Reproach of the Chriſtian Name. May the Lord of his infinite Mercy, give an hearing Ear, and an underſtanding Heart, to all ſuch of you my Hearers, as are given to inordinate Appetites and Deſires; that you may awake to a Senſe of your Danger, and be roaſed up to take Diligent Heed to yourſelves. For is ſtrong Drink become your Maſter; are you fallen into
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:006862_0022_102A7ED18F9DDD20"/>the Habit of Being frequently overcome thereby; or of drinking to Exceſs, ſo as to diſcompoſe and intoxicate your Mind. Alas, it is a ſad, a pitiful, yea and moſt dangerous Caſe that you are in. For you are in very-deed, next Door to Ruin and Deſtruction; in the moſt ready way to be undone, Soul and Body for ever. There is utmoſt Danger, that this Sin will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail upon you, and that you will hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward wax worſe and worſe. Yea ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept you rouſe up, and take the moſt carneſt Heed to yourſelves; yours is a gone Caſe; a dreadful Pit that you are fallen into; an almoſt inextricable Snare that you are intangied in. O that you would yet come to yourſelves, look about you, and think in carneſt, what are the certain fearful and dreadful Conſequences of a Courſe of Intemperance, Surfeiting and Drunkenneſs. Thereby, your Powers are ſoon impaired, your good Name ruin'd your Honour loſt, your Follies expoſed, yourſelves made a Scorn and a Deriſion, your Eſtates im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poveriſhed, your Families injured and
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:006862_0023_102A7ED3CD176120"/>wronged, the Welfare of your Souls ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected God, diſhonoured and provoked, Wrath treaſured up againſt the Day of Wrath, and your Souls ripened in Guilt and Pollution, for an evelaſting Deſtruction. And alas, can one that has the Reaſon and Spirit of a Man, careleſly plunge himſelf into all theſe deplorable Calamities; for the ſake of gratifying, a worſe than beaſtly Guſt and Appetite? Can the intoxicating Draught, be dearer to you than your own Life and Health, dearer to you than your Manhood, than your Honour, than your good Name, and dearer to you than all the Comforts of Life, than your Eſtates, than your Wives, than your Huſbands, and than your Children? That all muſt be hazarded to Ruin, to gratify a filthy Luſt. Or can any of you, be ſo void of Humanity, ſo loſt to all Senſe of Honour, and to all Senſe of Shame, as to let none of theſe Things move you? Alas, alas, all that is worthily dear to you in the World; your Health, your good Name, your Eſtates, your Families, your Wives, your
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:006862_0024_102A7ED609E1F010"/>Children, and all your Dear Friends, lament after you, and bewail with bitter Sighs and Moans, the fatal Ruin, you are bringing upon yourſelves and upon them! And yet muſt they all be diſregarded and ſpurned from you with Diſdain? Alas, can you ſo diveſt yourſelf, of all the tendereſt Ties of Nature; as to rend from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate Embraces, and Heart melting En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties, of your dear Partener, diſſolved in Tears, and trample your weeping Friends, and ſmiling Babes, as under your Feet; to purſue the Way to Ruin with Greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? Or can you be ſo regardleſs, of the Honour and Glory of God; ſo Fearleſs of his Wrath and Diſpleaſure; ſo regardleſs of his Favour and Bleſſing, and of the Everlaſting Welfare of your own Souls? As to go on in Ways diſhonouring to God; to provoke him to Wrath, and to pull down everlaſting Deſtruction upon your own Heads; for the ſake of indulging your ſelves, in the filthy ſhort lived Pleaſures of Surfeiting and Drunkenneſs. Oh take Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing poor intemperate Soul! For not only
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:006862_0025_102A7ED8F11B6170"/>Diſeaſes, Poverty, Shame and Reproach, are purſuing cloſe at your Heels in this World: But the great and awful Day of Judgment will quickly overtake you. For which you are in the ſure Way to be utterly unprepared; to have a moſt fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Account to give, and dreadful Doom to receive, from the Mouth of your great Judge. Who now ſays it in his Word and will make it good in that Day, <hi>that Drunkards ſhall not inherit the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God.</hi> Wherefore for the Lord's Sake! And for your own precious Soul Sake! And for the Sake of all that is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and dear to you, for Time and Eternity! Rouíe up and take Heed to yourſelves that you keep at the greateſt Diſtance from this Sin, wherewith you are moſt eaſily beſet: Leſt at any Time your Hearts be overcharged with Surfeiting and Drunkenneſs, and ſwift Ruin and Deſtruction overtake you unawares. And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, Be perſwaded to break off your intemperate Indulgencies, and turn therefrom by unfeigned Repentance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:006862_0026_102A7EDA87DFCAF8"/>
Poiſon and Death are in your exceſſive Cups. And Judgement may ſoon overtake you; and then you are inevitably loſt and undone for ever. But yet there is Mercy and Forgiveneſs with God thro' Jeſus Chriſt, for all that repent and turn: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be entreated ſeriouſly to conſider the Folly and Evil of your Ways. Think what great Diſhonour you have done to God; how you have abuſed his good Creatures, and conſumed them upon your Luſts; and how greatly you have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked, your glorious Maker and Rightful Sovereign, to Wrath and Anger againſt you. Think how you have injured your own Sonk and what fearful Ruin you have laid yourſelves open and expoſed unto. And let the deepeſt Contrition, Bitterneſs and Sorrow fill your Hearts. Judge and Condemn yourſelves, and bewail and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment your paſt Exceſſes before God. And cry earneſtly to him with Tears of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned Repentance; to be merciful unto you, to waſh away your Guilt in the Blood of Jeſus; and to cleanſe you from all your
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:006862_0027_102A7EDD410DE5C0"/>woful Pollution, to mortify your Luſts, and to quicken and enable you by his Spirit and Grace, to keep under the Deeds of the Body, and to live in all Sobriety and Temperance. That if yet by his Grace you may be recovered out of the Snare in which you are taken, that your Souls may live and not die. And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly, Be ye all warned and exhorted to watch and take Heed againſt Surfeiting and Drunkenneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You have heard what an inſnaring, ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and deſtructive Sin this is, to Soul and to Body, for Time and for Eternity. Wherefore take Warning and watch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, againſt ever the leaſt Degree of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance And be excited and entreated, as you tender all that is dear to you in the World, as you regard the Glory of God, as you dread his Wrath and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, and as you would eſcape ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Deſtruction; moſt carefully to ſhun this Sin of Surfeiting and Drunkenneſs; and all the Temptations leading to it. Shun drinking Company, and avoid tipling Places,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:006862_0028_102A7EE02D96A780"/>as moſt dangerous Snares laid for your Ruin. And beware of Exceſſive Cups as you would of the moſt deadly Poiſon: For remember; that although the Taſte ſeem ſweet and pleaſant, the certain Effects are fatal Deſtruction. But put on Sobriety and Temperance at all Times. And make it your great Concern ſo to walk as may redown to God's Glory, your own preſent Peace and eternal Welfare. And as for yourſelves, ſo alſo beware, for the Lord's ſake and for the Soul ſake of your Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, that you be not the Occaſion, for filthy Lucre ſake, of adminiſtring to the Intemperance of others. For ſuch have a great Share in the Guilt of the intemperate and Drunken. <hi>Wo</hi> therefore is <hi>to him that giveth his Neighbour Drink: that putteth his Bottle to him, and maketh him Drunken alſo, that he may look on their Nakedneſs.</hi> Hab. 11.15. Wherefore take Heed and Warch over yourſelves, and one over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; leſt being overcharged with Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting and Drunkenneſs; the great Day of the Lord overtake you unawares and
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:006862_0029_102A7EE2F4707BF8"/>unprepared. <hi>For ye are not in Darkneſs, that that Day ſhall overtake you as a Thief. Therefore let us not Sleep as do others, but let us watch and be ſober.</hi> And to conclude.</p>
            <p>Receive that Exhortation of the Apoſtle. Rom. xiii. 12, 14. <hi>The Night is far ſpent, the Day is at Hand: let us therefore caſt off the Works of Darkneſs, and let us put on the Armour of Light. Let us walk honeſtly as in the Day; not in Rioting and Drunkenneſs, not in Chambering and Wantonneſs, not in Strife and Envying. But put on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and make not Proviſion for the Fleſh to fulfil the Luſt thereof.</hi> Amen.</p>
