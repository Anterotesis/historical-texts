            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THE Publick ſhould never have been trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with the following Treatiſe on the Lawfulneſs of Defenſive War, had it not been for a late unſeaſonable Pamphlet, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled, <hi>The Doctrine of Chriſtianity, as held by the People called Quakers, vindicated,</hi> in Anſwer to <hi>Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Tennent</hi>'s Sermon on the Lawfulneſs of War. This Divine having, at the Requeſt of ſome Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen engaged in the Aſſociation for Defence lately enter'd into for ſecuring the Province againſt a threatening Invaſion, printed a Sermon which he had preached upon the Lawfulneſs of Defenſive War, this Pamphlet was printed and publiſhed in Anſwer to it: And that it might have the more univerſal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence over the Province, was order'd to be given away <hi>gratis.</hi> In this Performance the Author has undertaken to prove, by fair and candid Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Scripture (as he tells us in the third Page) the very Reverſe of what the Sermon had proved. How well he hath ſucceeded, the Reader will ſee in the Peruſal of the ſecond Part of this Treatiſe.</p>
            <p>IT was undoubtedly undertaken with no other Intent but to defeat this generous Undertaking of thoſe worthy Men (who could not poſſibly have any
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:006120_0003_1027D930664EF9F0"/>other View in it but the general Good) by raiſing Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in Peoples Minds about the Lawfulneſs of what they were about to engage in. This was done at ſo unſeaſonable a Time, when every Body (but the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor and his Friends) was fully convinced, that there was an extraordinary Call for falling upon ſome Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures for our Security, that it gave no ſmall Alarm to every Wellwiſher to his Country; inſomuch that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny did not ſtick to ſay, it looked more like the Performance of One who was engaged in a foreign Intereſt, than of a true and loyal <hi>Engliſh</hi> Subject.</p>
            <p>WHEREFORE, as a Teſtimony of my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard for the Good of human Society in general, of my Duty to my King and Country in particular, and of true Benevolence for all my Fellow Subjects; I have ſuffered myſelf to be prevailed upon by ſome true Patriots, and Lovers of their Country, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe in the Behalf of that Doctrine, which, if once given up, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Dominions, as well as thoſe of all other Chriſtian States, would ſoon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Scene of Slavery and Oppreſſion. This I have done in the following Treatiſe, which I pray God may be an Antidote againſt that pernicious and groundleſs Principle this Vindicator endeavours to ſupport.</p>
            <p>IN this Work I have clearly proved the Lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Defenſive War under the Old Teſtament; and thence I have deduced, as an undeniable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, that it is therefore not unlawful under the New.</p>
            <p>IN Proſecution of the Argument I have followed this Method: 1. I have ſtated this Queſtion, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether in any Caſe it be lawful for Chriſtians to make War under the Goſpel?</p>
            <p n="2">2. I have taken the affirmative Side of the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion; and for the Reſolution thereof, I have proved, both from Reaſon and Revelation, that Defenſive War was lawful under the Old Teſtament. And,</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="v" facs="unknown:006120_0004_1027EB2F72A1FD88"/>
3. I HAVE made it appear (which is a plain Reſolution) that as there is nothing in Chriſtianity that can amount to a Law prohibiting Defenſive War under the Goſpel; therefore it cannot be unlawful for Chriſtians, under that Diſpenſation, to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt a foreign Enemy: All this is contain'd in the firſt Part.</p>
            <p>IN the ſecond Part, I have examined all the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages in the foreſaid Pamphlet, that ſeem to affect the general Doctrine I had eſtabliſhed in the firſt; which I deſire the Reader may peruſe with Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But there are two Paſſages eſpecially, which, tho' I have inſiſted upon pretty largely in the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, yet, for the farther Illuſtration of the Doctrines advanced in the Examination of them, I muſt beg Leave to add ſomething here, in order to prevent Miſtakes. The firſt is, where I examine what the <hi>V.</hi> advances againſt the Law and Light of Nature. The ſecond is, where I examine his Obſervation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Mens acting in moral Matters according to their Convictions.</p>
            <p>THAT there is ſuch a Thing as the Law of Nature exiſting in the Univerſe, I have briefly proved in the ſecond Part; and that notwithſtanding the Fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> Mankind were capable of diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the main Principles of the Law of Nature, and the neceſſary Duties incumbent upon them by Virtue of this Law. Now, for the farther Illuſtration of this curious Point, and preventing Miſtakes, let me add,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1ſt.</hi> WHEN I ſay there are natural eſſential Differences in the Natures of Things, from whence reſults a Fitneſs and Unfitneſs in Actions to certain Ends; I don't maintain that theſe Differences are any Thing abſtracted from the Will of God, this being a Speculation that has no Relation to my Subject. It is enough for my Purpoſe, if it be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that there are ſuch natural and eſſential Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in Things, whether thoſe Differences be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:006120_0005_1027EB31ED1BED88"/>as ariſing from the Things themſelves antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the Will of God, or from his Will conſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them ſuch, tho' before they were in their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures perfectly indifferent.</p>
            <p>A DEAL may be ſaid for both theſe Opinions; but I incline to the latter, as being moſt agreeable to holy Scripture.—And tho' we place the Spring and Fountain of the Law of Nature in the Divine Will, which is free in the moſt unlimited Senſe; it will not follow from hence, that the Law of Nature may therefore be changed by God, or the contrary be commanded; becauſe he has created Man (who is the Subject of this Law) a Being not poſſibly to be preſerv'd without the Obſervation of it. Now this being the Caſe, we cannot with any Colour of Reaſon ſuppoſe that God will either alter or reverſe the Law of Nature, ſo long as he brings no Change on human Nature itſelf; and ſo long as the Actions en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join'd by this Law do by a natural Conſequence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the Good of Society, in which is contain'd all the temporal Happineſs of Mankind, while the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Actions do by as ſtrong a Neceſſity deſtroy that Society: That is, ſo long as Beneficence, Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, good Faith, Juſtice, Gratitude, and the like Practices, ſhall have a Power of engaging and winning on Mens Minds, and <hi>vice verſa.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND therefore ſuppoſing human Nature and human Affairs to be fix'd and conſtant, the Law of Nature, tho' it owed its original Inſtitution to the free Pleaſure of God, remains firm and immutable.</p>
            <p>AND here we ought to diſtinguiſh carefully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Law of Nature as it reſpects God himſelf, who is the Author of it, and as it reſpects Men, who are the Subjects thereof. For tho' 'twould be Impiety to aſſert that the Law of Nature contains any Thing in it repugnant to the divine Holineſs and Juſtice; yet we are certain, that God does many Actions, which, were we to do, would be abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:006120_0006_1027EB33901E1940"/>Wickedneſs: And the Reaſon is, becauſe this Law is not common to God and Men. The Law of Nature, tho' it indiſpenſibly obliges us yet it can lay no Obligation upon him. So that when we ſay God cannot diſpenſe with the Law of Nature, we mean, that he cannot alter the Relations of Things with Regard to ſuch Duties as neceſſarily reſult from the Conſtitution of human Nature. He cannot alter the Natures of Virtue and Vice, without altering the Conſtitution of human Nature. Now from this Obſervation, 'tis eaſy to anſwer thoſe Inſtances which ſome give of God's diſpenſing with the Law of Nature; as when he commanded the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to deſtroy ſome Nations utterly, and to ſpoil others of their Poſſeſſions. Here was only an Alteration made in the Properties of Things, but the Obligation of the preceptive Law of Nature was not hereby diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved. Murder would have been an intrinſical E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil ſtill; but that which was done by the immediate and ſpecial Command of God, who is the ſupream Lord and Diſpoſer of all Things, and hath a fuller Right over his Creatures, than any Man can have over another, would have been no Murder. Robbery would have been Evil ſtill; but taking Things alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated from their Properties by God himſelf, who is the rightful Proprietor of all Things, was not Robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. It cannot therefore be properly called a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of the Law of Nature, when a Man by expreſs Command from Heaven executes God's Right upon other Men meerly as his Inſtrument. Circumſtances may be varied, and the Object changed, and yet the Law itſelf ſuffer no Alteration. Again, when I ſay that the general and moſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Precepts of the Law of Nature are diſcovera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by every Man poſſeſſed of the due Exerciſe of his Reaſon, I don't maintain that theſe general Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are innate, or imprinted, as it were, in Mens Minds, from their very Birth, in the Manner of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:006120_0007_1027EB3640F12278"/>and actual Propoſitions, ſo as to be readily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd and utter'd by them, as ſoon as they arrive at the Uſe of Speech without further Inſtruction or Meditation; becauſe this Doctrine to me ſeems not to have any Foundation in Nature. Tho' I vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the great Names of <hi>Stilling fleet</hi> and <hi>Sherlock,</hi> who are of the contrary Opinion; yet, what I take to be the Truth, I hope I ſhall always preſer before a blind Obedience to any human Authority. When I ſay therefore, that the Law of Nature is the Dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate of right Reaſon, my Meaning is this, That the human Underſtanding is endued with ſuch a Power, as to be able from the Contemplation of human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to diſcover a Neceſſity of living agreeably to this Law. On which Account St. <hi>Paul</hi> declares it to be written in Mens Hearts, <hi>Rom.</hi> ii. 15.</p>
            <p>AS the Underſtanding performs the Office of a Light to direct Men in their Actions, whereby when they are not guided aright, they muſt una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably loſe their Way; ſo it ought to be laid down as a certain Principle, that there ever was, both in the apprehending Faculty, and in the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſuch a Degree of natural Rectitude, as, upon due Attention given, will not ſuffer Men to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in Reference to the main Principles and moſt neceſſary Duties of moral Practice; and that neither of thoſe Powers are ſo corrupted and depraved, as to put them under a Neceſſity of being miſtaken there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. An ill-cut Mirror will preſent every Image in a diſtorted Confuſion; and the Tongue, when tinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd with a Jaundice, is not able to diſcern the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Taſtes: And yet it does not follow, that therefore the Senſes, to which thoſe Offices belong, are fallacious and uncertain. Neither could it have been charg'd on thoſe who never had the Benefit of a divine Revelation, as Guilt, that they had done a bad Action, if they had not been furniſhed with a clear Diſcernment of moral Good and Evil. And it
<pb n="ix" facs="unknown:006120_0008_1027EB3A922D5DB8"/>would be the higheſt Injuſtice to impute that Error as ſinful, which was beyond Mens Power to avoid or ſhake off. And therefore, unleſs we would ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly ſubvert all the Morality of Action in Men before the giving of the moral Law, we muſt by all Means maintain, that the human Underſtanding ever was, and ſtill is, ſo far right, as to be able to diſcern and practiſe the neceſſary Duties of Nature's Law, upon ſufficient Enquiry and Meditation. But to prevent Miſtakes, I beg Leave particularly to remark, that I am not here debating (as being foreign to the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in Hand) what Power the human Underſtanding hath about Things which depend upon divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, or what it can perform in ſuch extraordinary Caſes without the Aſſiſtance of divine Grace; but only about the Power it hath as 'tis employ'd in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulating Mens Actions according to the Dictates of the Law of Nature. And as to this Point, I have aſſerted, and I hope with no Offence to any conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Man, that there never was any Perſon of proper Years, and Maſter of his own Reaſon, that could not comprehend the moſt general and neceſſary Precepts of the Law of Nature, and thoſe which are of the greateſt Uſe in common Life; and diſcern the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement they bear to the rational and ſocial State of Mankind.</p>
            <p>IT muſt indeed be owned, that Intereſt, joined with the Prejudices of Infancy, Education, or Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, obſcure the cleareſt Dictates of Reaſon; of this we every Day ſee numberleſs Inſtances. Some are ſo blinded with Self-love, that all their fine Parts ſeem intirely to forſake them, as ſoon as any Matter comes in Debate, the Deciſion of which is attended with any Inconvenience to themſelves; and yet theſe very Perſons ſhall go through a great many other Things, infinitely more difficult, with the greateſt Facility, when they have no Tendency to their own Diſadvantage. One principal Criterion of right Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="x" facs="unknown:006120_0009_1027EB3C1D65D160"/>and that whereby we know aſſuredly that it is natural to Men, is, that the unjuſt Man, when he is acting in any Affair that does nowiſe affect his own Intereſt, judges exactly according to the Rules of Juſtice; and vicious Perſons, of every Sort, have juſt Sentiments of Things, where they do not ſuffer themſelves to be prepoſſeſſed by Paſſion. But there is another Cauſe of wrong Judgment beſides theſe; <hi>viz.</hi> Precipitation and Prepoſſeſſion, equally hurtful to Society with the other. A Man oftentimes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes tenaciouſly fond of falſe or doubtful Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, taken up without Examination or Reflection; and then 'tis no Wonder if he finds himſelf unable to reconcile theſe with the Truth of Things, or to draw from them juſt and regular Conſequences. How few do we find, who ſo much as think of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver calling in queſtion certain Principles which they have early imbibed, eſpecially if they ſee them au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized by the Opinions of thoſe whom they look upon to be their Superiors in Wiſdom and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; or eſtabliſhed by the Cuſtoms of the Society or Place where they have been bred? Hence we find, even Men of Parts, when puſhed on by Party Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſities, ſtrenuouſly endeavouring to find out, not what is moſt conformable to the invariable Rules of right Reaſon and Equity (the very Exiſtence of which they have the Aſſurance to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eny but only what to them ſeems moſt proper to juſtify the fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tica. Notions their Party hath embraced. But tho' ſome Perſons, thro' Indolence, may poſſibly never have thought of one or two Precepts; or thro' Rathneſs and Precipitation, may have fram'd wrong Opinions of acting; or by a Mind corrupted with vicious Habits, may have called their Truth and Neceſſity in queſtion; or may have embrac'd other Rules of Action contrary to natural Suggeſtions; yet this no more proves, that human Nature is univerſally corrupted, than it proves, that, becauſe
<pb n="xi" facs="unknown:006120_0010_1027EB3EE260B860"/>a Man who has put out his Eyes, cannot diſcern any Difference in Colours; therefore others cannot do ſo, who have not put out their Eyes. For theſe univerſal Edicts are ſo clearly publiſhed and explain'd, and ſo cloſely interwoven with our very Being, that no Man, with the Uſe of Reaſon, can be incapable of apprehending and diſcerning them; ſince to this End nothing more is required, than an ordinary Portion of natural Light, provided that the Mind be not vitiated and obſtructed by ſome Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>
            <p n="2">2. IN my Examination of what the <hi>V.</hi> hath ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd concerning People's acting in moral Duties according to their Convictions, I obſerved, That to make Men's Faith or Perſuaſion the Rule of moral Duties, ſeems to be a prepoſterous Way of arguing, as affecting the great Foundation of Morality, and producing very dangerous, yet neceſſary Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.

               </gap> 'Tis true, Caſuiſts allow, that 'tis a Sin for a Man to act againſt his Judgment, even ſuppoſing his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be falſe: But then they carefully diſtinguiſh between an Error in Theory, and an Error in Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. A Man errs in the Theory, when he fancies a Thing to be commanded, which is really forbidden, or left indifferent, <hi>i.e.</hi> neither commanded nor forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and <hi>vice verſa.</hi> But he errs in the Practice, when ſomething intervenes in the Exerciſe of Actions, which alters their Circumſtances. Now 'tis allow'd that the former Kind of Errors do not hinder their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation to an Agent: becauſe he is ſuppoſed not to have apply'd ſufficient Diligence in comparing his Actions with the Rule preſcrib'd him, which in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters concerning moral Duties, is ſo plain, both in the Law of Nature and Revelation, that he that runs may read it. And therefore he has no Reaſon to think, that ſuch Errors ſhall not be imputed. God has given Men a moral Law, plain and intelligible by every Body
<pb n="xii" facs="unknown:006120_0011_1027EB40772FE630"/>that has the exerciſe of Reaſon, whereby they are to guide their Actions: And let a Man's Perſuaſion be what it will as to certain Actions, it cannot alter the Nature of Things. 'Tis not his Opinion, but God's Law that makes Things Good or Evil, and therefore we ſhall be for ever oblig'd to do ſome Actions, and forbear others, whatever our Perſuaſion be, becauſe we cannot alter the Nature of Good and Evil. For if the moral Goodneſs or Badneſs of Actions were to be meaſur'd by Men's Opinions, then Duty and Sin would be the moſt uncertain Things in the World; and what is Good or Evil to Day, would be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary To-morrow as any Man's Opinion alters: But ſuch Conſequences are intolerable. And therefore tho' a Man be convinc'd that ſuch a Practice is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, he may be guilty of Sin, and damn'd for it too, if ſuch Conviction lead him, in other Caſes, to act againſt a plain Law of God.</p>
            <p>THERE are Men among us who are convinc'd that the Doctrines of Chriſt forbid all Sorts of War, for which Reaſon, they ſay, they cannot in Conſcience join, or have any Hand in defending their Country with carnal Weapons. Now in Anſwer to this I grant, that if a neceſſary Self-defence againſt a foreign Enemy be really forbidden by Chriſt, then they are not to be blam'd: For their refuſing to join in ſuch a Practice is, in this Caſe, undoubtedly their Duty, even tho' their Country ſhould be ruin'd without it, But then the Point we ſtand upon is this: That what the ſupream Magiſtrate (whom by the Laws of God they are bound to obey in all Things lawful) requires of them, in commanding them to defend their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, is forbidden by no Law of Chriſt (as will appear in the following Treatiſe) And therefore their being convinc'd that the Doctrines of Chriſtianity forbid a neceſſary Self-defence againſt a foreign Enemy, will not acquit them from the Guil of diſobeying the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, who is the Ordinance of God. They are
<pb n="xiii" facs="unknown:006120_0012_1027EB43E6AB17F8"/>expreſly commanded, both in the moral Law, and in the Goſpel, to obey Magiſtrates; and their falſe Perſuaſion will never juſtify their Breach of an expreſs Command of God. So that if God's Law commands me to obey the Magiſtrate in all Things lawful, my falſe Perſuaſion that what the Magiſtrate commands me is unlawful, will not acquit me from Sin before God, if I do diſobey him. To confirm this Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, let me aſk the following Queſtion.</p>
            <p>WHEN St. <hi>Paul</hi> thought himſelf bound in Duty to perſecute Chriſtians, was his Perſecution ſinful or no? Yes ſurely, for he calls himſelf the greateſt of Sinners for that very Reaſon, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> i. 13.15. And therefore a Man's thinking a Thing to be lawful, will not acquit him before God for doing that Thing, if it be againſt God's Law (as Perſecution for Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in religious Speculations undoubtedly is.) Nor will a Man's thinking a Thing to be unlawful acquit him before God for omitting that Thing, if by ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he violate a plain Law of God in another Caſe. Again, ſuppoſe a Roman Catholick, who believes Popery to be the only true Religion, does in Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to it worſhip Images and the Hoſt. This Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon would certainly abhor theſe Practices did he think them to be idolatrous, but he believes them to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Duties. And yet I preſume this <hi>V.</hi> will charge Roman Catholicks with Idolatry, tho' they diſclaim it, and profeſs they do no more than their Duty, when they give divine Worſhip to ſuch Objects. And indeed they are certainly charged rightly in this; for if it be really Idolatry by God's Word to do ſo, then it will be Idolatry in any Man to do ſo, let his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion be what it will. For a Man's falſe Perſuaſion doth not alter the Nature of Things. Now the Caſe is alike in the Matter before us. For Diſobedience to the higher Powers is as properly a Sin, as worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Creature is Idolatry; and he is as much a Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor, who thinks it his Duty to diſobey the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,
<pb n="xiv" facs="unknown:006120_0013_1027EB466110F740"/>as he is an Idolater, who thinks it his Duty to worſhip a Creature. A Man's Miſtake, according to the greater or leſſer Culpability of it, will more or leſs excuſe him before God in both Inſtances, but it cannot change the Nature either of Diſobedience or Idolatry.</p>
            <p>NOW to apply this to the Caſe under Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, That Protection is due from the Magiſtrate to the Subject, and that the Subject is bound to obey the Magiſtrate in all his lawful Commands, is undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably evident, both from the moral Law and the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. But that the Goſpel forbids a neceſſary Self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence againſt a foreign Enemy, can at moſt be but probable; the firſt is an undeniable Truth queſtioned by none; whereas the laſt is but a probable Opinion, believed by few. Here then is a Caſe where there is a plain Competition between two Duties; the one is Obedience to a doubtful Precept of Chriſt, the other is Obedience to an indiſputable Law of God, <hi>viz.</hi> Protection from the Magiſtrate, and Obedience from the Subject.</p>
            <p>NOW this Caſe is eaſily determined, for when a Man doubts only on one Side (which is the Caſe here) it is more reaſonable (if all other Conſiderations be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual) to chuſe that Side which he hath no Doubt of. But then (which I deſire may be attentively conſider'd) if there be other Circumſtances to overbalance that Conſideration of Uncertainty (which is plainly the Caſe with the <hi>V.</hi> and his Friends) it will be more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to chuſe that Side which I did before doubt of. Nay, it is my Duty ſo to do. For if I doubt, I do by doubting own that I cannot certainly tell whether the Action be lawful or unlawful; and ſurely then the Weight of preſſing Conſiderations (which in this Caſe are not wanting) ſuch as the Preſervation of my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try from Ruin, Obedience and Subjection to my Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors, and the like, ought to turn the Ballance; otherwiſe I cannot anſwer to God and the World for
<pb n="xv" facs="unknown:006120_0014_1027EB48D7EB90D0"/>the Conſequences that may enſue. Thus for Inſtance' If I have the ſole legiſlative Power of Government in my Hands, at a Juncture when the People are threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with a foreign Invaſion; I'm oblig'd, by Virtue of a former Obligation, notwithſtanding my Doubt as to the Lawfulneſs of bearing Arms, to make a legal Proviſion for the publick Security. And then as to the Caſe of Subjects, who are under an indiſpenſible Obligation, both by the moral Law and the Precepts of the Goſpel, to obey Magiſtrates in all their lawful Commands, and which Obligation they are fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd of too without any Doubt; and ſince (as I ſaid before) the Unlawfulneſs of bearing Arms in a neceſſary Self-defence can never be undeniably prov'd from Scripture, and muſt therefore be a doubtful Caſe; Their Duty, in Obedience to their Magiſtrate's Command, is heartily to join in the Defence of the Publick, againſt a lawleſs, foreign Invader, whenever there ſhall be Occaſion for their Aſſiſtance. Becauſe, as in all doubtful Caſes, the ſafeſt Side is to be choſen; ſo 'tis certain, it is ſafer for them, in this Caſe, to obey than diſobey. There is a plain Law of God that commands them to obey the Magiſtrate in all lawful Things; and if his Command be unlawful, the only Hazard they run is, of tranſgreſſing ſome Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of which they were not certain: But in a doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Caſe, it is very uncertain whether the Law of God forbid the Thing or no, and if the Command be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, then in diſobeying they run the Hazard of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſing a plain Law which they cannot but know, and which is of the greateſt Importance to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.</p>
            <p>'TIS true (as I have obſerv'd in the Treatiſe) St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, he that doubteth is damn'd if he eat, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he eateth not of Faith, for whatſoever is not of Faith is Sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> xiv. 23. But pray let it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, that there is a vaſt Difference between this Caſe, and that of thoſe I am arguing with. The
<pb n="xvi" facs="unknown:006120_0015_1027EB4B9EC05468"/>Man St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of, was at Liberty to forbear eating, and ſinned in chuſing to run ſuch a needleſs Hazard of tranſgreſſing the Law (of giving no Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to weak Brethren.) But when the Magiſtrate commands the Subject to aſſiſt in defending their Country, they are not at Liberty. In the former Caſe the Man might forbear without any Danger, but in the latter Caſe there is greater Danger in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing, than in acting, and therefore he is bound to act in the latter Caſe, tho' it might be Sin to act in the former.</p>
            <p>AS to my Method of examining this <hi>V</hi>'s Remarks on the aforeſaid Sermon, I have this Apology to make for myſelf, that I had no other View in any Thing I have there ſaid, but to vindicate Truth, and detect Error. If I have ſaid ſome Things that may ſeem to betray a Want of Temper for his abuſing his Adverſary, and impoſing on the World under a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Pretence of pleading for the Truth, I hope the Reader will be reconcil'd, when I aſſure him, that it was neither from any Prejudice in Favour of the Author of the Sermon (to whom I am ſo far a Stranger, that to my Knowledge I never exchang'd a Word with him) nor from any perſonal Prejudice againſt the <hi>V.</hi> or any of his Friends. But upon find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Principle, ſo neceſſary to the Support of civil Society (as a neceſſary Self-defence againſt a foreign Enemy is) attack'd by a Heap of Sophiſms and wretched Arguments, contriv'd on Purpoſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found and perplex what was not in his Power to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute, I thought it my Duty to lay them out in their true Colours, that the World may ſee wherein their boaſted Strength lies. For I know many have boaſted of this mighty Performance, as an unanſwerable Piece. But ſure I am if it be, it is not upon the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of ſolid Argument or ſound Reaſoning.</p>
            <p>FOR if either the Author or his Friends can ſhew me but half a Dozen of Arguments in the whole Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance,
<pb n="xvii" facs="unknown:006120_0016_1027EB4F1EE3D258"/>that will bear the Teſt of Syllogiſm (the Touchſtone of right Arguing) I will own all I have ſaid againſt him to be groundleſs.</p>
            <p>I SHOULD not have made ſo free with this <hi>V.</hi> upon any other Point of Controverſy we could poſſibly have hit upon. But this being a Point of ſuch vaſt Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to the whole Chriſtian World; the abuſive Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod he has made Uſe of in treating of it, cannot in my Opinion be too ſmartly reprehended.</p>
            <p>AND it ſeems not unneceſſary for the Good of the Publick, that he ſhould be told ſo; that the next Time he has a Mind to publiſh a Vindication of this Doctrine, he may chuſe a more ſeaſonable Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, than when we are alarm'd with a foreign Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Had not this been the Caſe, I do aſſure him, I ſhould have employ'd my Time much better, than in an Examination of his Vindication.</p>
            <p>AND as to his Friends, I know many of them to be Men of too much good Senſe to give into his ſenſeleſs Sentiments on this Point. And as to thoſe who do, if they think I have done him any Wrong, I cannot hope they ſhould ſpare me. Only I beg Leave to give this friendly Caution to whomſoever ſhall be appointed to anſwer this Piece (if they ſhall think it worth anſwering) that they would lay aſide that mean Trick of dealing in general evaſive An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, and uſing equivocal Terms in ſuch a Manner as to make them look two direct contrary Ways, together with ſome dark out-of-the-way Expreſſions in their own Language, which have not ſo much as the Face of an Argument, only that they may have it to ſay, there is an Anſwer to ſuch a Book. And if any one concern'd really for Truth, ſhall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the Confutation of what I have here advanc'd, I ſincerely promiſe him, either to recant my Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, upon fair Conviction, or uſe my beſt Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> anſwer his Difficulties.</p>
            <p>THIS Cauſe in Debate between us is of very great Conſequence; it concerns the whole Chriſtian
<pb n="xviii" facs="unknown:006120_0017_1027EB50A8102A20"/>World in general, and this unhappy Province in particular. That any Evidence in the Propoſal or Defence of it, can be ſufficient to conquer the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy and Prejudices of a great many among us. I have not the Vanity to imagine. But this I think I may juſtly demand of every Reader, that ſince there are great and viſible Falſhoods on one Side or other, he would impartially examine on which Side they lie; and upon that I will venture the Cauſe in any Readers Judgment, who will but lay aſide all Prejudice and Partiality, and come with a ſincere Reſolution to embrace what, upon the greateſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence appears to be the Truth: And as for him that will not do that, I care not much either what he ſays or thinks.</p>
            <p>AS to the Goodneſs of the Performance, I can ſay but little in its Favour. But if I have not ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it according to my Wiſhes, I may plead that it was drawn up under a bad State of Health, amidſt a Variety of Interruptions, and a Famine both of Men and Books. This will in ſome Sort excuſe the Author, tho' it may detract from the Performance.</p>
            <p>I SHALL make no other Apology for becoming an Author, than that it was partly to gratify the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of my Friends, and partly to ſatisfy every Man who has any ſincere Affection for his Country, that it is not only lawful for him, but laudable and glorious to exert himſelf in its Defence, whenever he has a lawful Call thereto.</p>
            <p>AS to whatever Cenſures the Criticks may paſs upon my Performance, this ſhall give me no Manner of Concern; becauſe as Vermin are led by Inſtinct to the beſt Fruits, ſo (ſaith a learned Writer) theſe Kind of Inſects ſwarm about the beſt Writers; ſo that ſhould they vouchſafe to allow me a Place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong theſe, they would do me an Honour, which I have not the Vanity to think I deſerve.</p>
            <p>I HAVE no more to add, but that V. ſtands for Vindicator.</p>

            <p>AS the beſt Things are moſt apt to be abuſed, ſo the Abuſe of them generally produces very ill Conſequences. There is no Principle ſo good, nor Practice ſo beneficial, but what may be perverted to an ill Uſe, by the Wickedneſs or Folly of Men. And this I take to be the Caſe with relation to the Point now to be debated.</p>
            <p>FOR tho' Self-preſervation be a noble Principle, ingrafted in our Nature by the all-wiſe Author of our Being, for the Security of our Lives, and the Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Species; yet wicked Men do often abuſe it to very ill Purpoſes. Whenever their Prejudices, Paſſions, or Intereſt, prompt them to fall foul on their innocent Neighbours, they always pretend that it is, ſomehow or other, in Conſequence of the great Law of Self-preſervation.</p>
            <p>HENCE it comes to paſs, that one of the nobleſt, and moſt uſeful Principles in Nature, and ſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the Good of the whole Animal Creation, that the World could not ſubſiſt without it, is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted

By the Law of Nature, I mean the Dictate of right Reaſon, ſhewing the moral Good or Evil of any Action, by the Repugnancy or Congruity it hath to rational Nature itſelf; and conſequently that ſuch an Action is agreeable or diſagreeable to the Will of God, who is the very Author of Nature <note n="*" place="bottom">See Preface, Page 5.</note>.</p>
            <p>THE State of the Caſe, therefore, is plainly this, A Defenſive War, undertaken by lawful Authority, with no other View but to defend the innocent Lives and Liberties of the whole Community, when this cannot be done by any other Means, was ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant to the Law of Nature, and repugnant to no poſitive Law of God, under the Old Teſtament; and therefore it cannot be unlawful under the New, unleſs an expreſs poſitive Law of Chriſt can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd, prohibiting all Sorts of War under the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. And if it be prov'd, that ſuch a War is not unlawful, it will be enough for my Purpoſe; for if it be not unlawful, it will be no Violation of any Law, and conſequently can be no Sin.</p>
            <p>I SHALL now proceed to prove in the firſt Place, That Defenſive War was conſonant, or agreeable, to the Law of Nature, and not repugnant to any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Law of God under the Old Teſtament: And this I ſhall do, by Arguments drawn, both from Reaſon and Revelation. Whence it will evidently follow, as a Reſolution of the Queſtion, that it is lawful, in ſome Caſes, for Chriſtians to make War under the Goſpel; becauſe what was once lawful, by Virtue of the Law of Nature, muſt forever be ſo
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:006120_0022_1027EB5CF57B5478"/>(the Grounds and Reaſons continuing the ſame) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs made otherwiſe by a poſitive Law of God.</p>
            <p>AND, <hi>Firſt,</hi> That Defenſive War was conſonant to the Law of Nature, and not repugnant to any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Law of God, under the Old Teſtament, will appear from the following Arguments:</p>
            <p n="1">1. THERE are ſome Things to which every Man (at leaſt before the Caſe is altered by voluntary Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact) has ſuch a natural and immediate Relation, that he only, of all Mankind, can juſtly call them his; ſuch as his Life, his Limbs, his Liberty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Hence it follows, that no other Man can have a Right to begin an Attempt upon this Man's Life, or in any Manner to diſturb his Happineſs, becauſe he is ſuppos'd to be in a State intirely independent, and that other to have no Right of Dominion over him.</p>
            <p>BUT, <hi>Secondly,</hi> Tho' no Man can have a Right to begin to hurt another, yet every Man has a Right to defend himſelf, and his, againſt Violence, when offered (always ſuppoſing the Caſe not to be altered by voluntary Compact) for I do not ſay that a Man who is become a Member of Society, has, in all Caſes, a Right to defend himſelf againſt even lawleſs Violence, for Reaſons that are obvious almoſt to every Body; and far leſs to defend himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt lawful Violence, when he has incurred it, by violating the Laws of the Community to which he belongs. I ſay then (excepting this Caſe) every Man, and conſequently every independent Society of Men, have a Right to defend themſelves, and what is theirs, againſt lawleſs Violence. Now who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever denies a Man (thus circumſtanc'd) this Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, aſſerts, contrary to Truth, either that he hath not the Faculties and Powers which he has, or that his Maker has given them to him in vain; for to what End has he them, if he may not uſe them? And how may he uſe them, if not for his own Preſervation,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:006120_0023_1027EB5FC4399E88"/>when he is attack'd, and in Danger of being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd? At this Rate, what becomes of the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal invariable Principle of Self-preſervation, implant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Author of Nature in the whole Animal Creation, which ſerves for no Purpoſe that we know of, but to preſerve Individuals, by prompting them to provide for, and defend themſelves?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To deny Men a Right to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt Violence and Ruin, muſt be inconſiſtent with the Laws of human Nature, becauſe inconſiſtent with the general Good of Mankind; for whatever is inconſiſtent with the general Peace and Welfare of Mankind, is inconſiſtent with the Laws of human Nature, and therefore wrong.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> IF a Man has no Right to defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he can have no Right to any Thing; but 'tis allowed on all Hands, that every Man has ſuch a natural Right to his Life, his Limbs, his Liberty, &amp;c. that he only, of all Mankind, can juſtly call them his: If therefore a Man has a Right, he may juſtly maintain that Right. It implies a great Abſurdity then, to deny a Man a Right to defend himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt lawleſs Violence; becauſe it is ſaying, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to what is granted by all, that the Aggreſſor has a Right to aſſault the other, and uſurp what is his. And more than that, to begin the Violence, being in Nature more than to repel it, he who begins, is the true Cauſe of all that follows, and whatever falls upon him by the Oppoſition made from the defending Party, is but the Effect of his own Act, or it is that Violence of which he is the Author, reflected back upon himſelf. If then he who begins to violate the Life and Happineſs of another, evidently does what is wrong, he who endeavours to put a Stop to that Violence, does in that Reſpect what is right by the Terms.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> IF every Man, before all voluntary Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact, has ſuch a Right to his Life, his Limbs, his
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:006120_0024_1027EB63860EE740"/>Liberty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that he only of all Mankind can juſtly call them his; he certainly acts agreeable to Right in uſing them as his; but that Man who oppoſes him in this, and conſequently lays a claim to that which is not his, acts contrary to Right.</p>
            <p>IN fine: As every Man is oblig'd to conſult his own Happineſs, there can be no Doubt, but that he not only may, but even ought to defend it; becauſe as I am oblig'd to purſue Happineſs, I'm oblig'd, at the ſame time, to recede as far as I can from its Contrary.</p>
            <p>I OWN in ſo doing, I ought not to act raſhly, or do more than the End propos'd requires; I ought to uſe all prudent Methods to ſtop the Violence; but when all other Meaſures prove ineffectual, or impracticable, I muſt take ſuch other as I can, and oppoſe Force to Force; otherwiſe I will fail in my Duty to myſelf, and deny Happineſs to be what it is.</p>
            <p>NOW to apply this Reaſoning to Societies, let it be obſerv'd, that the Condition of an incorporated na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Society or Kingdom, ſeems to be much the ſame with a ſingle Perſon, as conſider'd exiſting where there is no Benefit of Law to be had; and what one Man may juſtly do to another in that Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, may be done by one Nation or politick Body, with Reſpect to another. If one Man therefore may in ſuch a Poſition have a Right to defend himſelf, which that he hath, is evident from the Nature and Reaſon of Things; then a Number of Men muſt have an equal Right at leaſt, if not a greater; for there is more Reaſon that a Number of innocent Men ſhould be ſaved, than only one of that Number, and therefore that a Number ſhould defend themſelves, than that one ſhould. And if this may be done by every ſingle Perſon in a State of Nature, before the Caſe is alter'd by voluntary Compact, it may be done by them in a ſocial State, when confederated
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:006120_0025_1027EB66283A08E0"/>among themſelves; becauſe with reſpect to other Nations they are ſtill in that State, ſo far as they have not limited themſelves by Leagues and Alliances.</p>
            <p>UPON the whole therefore, mutual Defence being one great End of civil Society, if not the greateſt, it muſt in a particular and eminent Manner, involve in it Defence againſt foreign Enemies: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as I ſaid before, whoever from a Principle of Generoſity and Love to his Country, and not in Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance of private Views, ſignalizes himſelf in its Defence when there is Occaſion for it, does what is agreeable to the eternal Law of Truth and Right, and juſtly deſerves the grateful Acknowledgments of every good Subject, and Lover of his King and Country.</p>
            <p>NOW theſe Truths, as they are built upon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſputable Principles of right Reaſon, and in a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſelf-evident, will, I think, readily be granted by all Men of ſound Judgment, without any farther Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtration.</p>
            <p>I SHALL proceed therefore in the</p>
            <p>2d. PLACE, to prove from Revelation, that Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive War was conſonant to the Law of Nature under the Old Teſtament, whence it will appear at the ſame Time, that it was not repugnant to any poſitive Law of God under that Diſpenſation.</p>
            <p>NOW that War commenc'd upon juſt Grounds, was conſonant to the Law of Nature, and not repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the reveal'd Will of God under the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, will appear from the following Inſtances.</p>
            <p>WE find, <hi>Gen.</hi> xiv. that the Almighty, by his high Prieſt <hi>Melchiſedeck,</hi> did approve of a War made by his Servant <hi>Abraham</hi> upon the four Kings; who in plundering <hi>Sodom,</hi> had taken <hi>Lot</hi> and his Family Captives, who was <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Brother's Son, and as it were, a Part of his own Family. The Text ſays, <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi> bleſſed <hi>Abraham,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>Bleſſed be Abraham of the moſt high God Poſſeſſor of Heaven
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:006120_0026_1027EB68E1085450"/>and Earth:</hi> v. 20. <hi>And bleſſed be the moſt high God, who bath deliver'd thine Enemies into thine Hand.</hi> Now here was a War made by this eminent Servant of God, without any ſpecial Commiſſion from the Almighty for it; but he was excited thereto by the meer Law of Nature; preſuming upon that Principle of Nature, that to reſiſt, and recompence lawleſs In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, was not diſpleaſing to the God of Nature. <hi>Whoſo ſheddeth Man's Blood, by Man ſhall his Blood be ſhed,</hi> ſeems to have been deeply engraven in Mens Hearts from the Beginning; which made <hi>Cain,</hi> after the Murder of his Brother, cry out, <hi>Every one that findeth me ſhall ſlay me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AS to the War made by the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> upon the Seven Nations, I ſhall wholly omit any Conſideration of it here, as having no Relation to this Argument: In this Caſe they were not excited by the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but acted by Virtue of an expreſs Command of God. This Action therefore comes intirely within the Verge of the judicial Law, which being long ſince expir'd, is therefore quite out of this Queſtion. Thoſe Actions therefore that were lawful for the <hi>Jews,</hi> may not be drawn into Example by us Chriſtians, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Reaſon of them ceas'd when their Law ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pir'd. I ſay there were many Things lawful for the <hi>Jews</hi> as a Body Politick, under a Theocratical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which cannot be lawfully practiſed under the Goſpel, becauſe the Reaſon of thoſe Things do not deſcend to Chriſtians. But all thoſe Practices among the Jews, which are founded upon common Equity, of which Number was that of Defenſive War, may lawfully be practis'd by Chriſtians, not by Virtue of their having been practiſed by them, but by Virtue of common Principles of Equity founded in the Law of Nature, and diſcoverable by our rational Faculties.</p>
            <p>BUT ſuch a War as was carried on by good Men, without any expreſs Command of God, and yet was manifeſtly approv'd of by the Almighty, muſt
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:006120_0027_1027EB6B84CAEDC0"/>have been undertaken upon ſuch Principles, as were not repugnant to his Nature, elſe he would never have approv'd of it; and what could thoſe be but the Principles of the Law of Nature, which were written in their Hearts; ſince they had no Syſtem of moral Practice at that Time by Revelation?</p>
            <p n="2">2. IN the 17th of <hi>Exodus,</hi> we find, that a War was commenc'd by the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Joſhua</hi> againſt the <hi>Amalekites,</hi> who had oppoſed them in their Paſſage towards the promis'd Land; which, tho' it was not command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be done, yet being done, had the divine Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, <hi>v.</hi> 14. which certainly would not have been, if it had been repugnant to the Law of Nature.</p>
            <p n="3">3. AND <hi>Deut.</hi> xx. we find God himſelf preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing certain general Rules, or ſtanding Ordinances, how his own People ſhould make War; which is a ſufficient Teſtimony that War might ſometimes be juſt, tho' Men have no ſpecial Commiſſion from God to make this or that War.</p>
            <p>FOR there <hi>Moſes</hi> makes a manifeſt Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Caſe of the Seven Nations, and the Caſe of other People, as appears from the 10th and 15th Verſes. For other People they might receive to Mercy, but they were to cut off the ſeven Nations utterly.</p>
            <p>NOW what I would obſerve from hence, is this, That ſeeing the Almighty did not preſcribe for what particular Cauſes they might make a juſt War, how could the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> judge of thoſe Cauſes, or diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver when the Grounds of ſuch a War were juſt, but by the Law of Nature? Of this Nature, was that of <hi>Jephthah</hi> with the <hi>Ammonites;</hi> and that of King <hi>David,</hi> for the Abuſe done to his Ambaſſadors; and, as ſome think, that of <hi>Sampſon</hi> againſt the <hi>Philiſtines.</hi> And forasmuch as thoſe Wars, which they carried on without any ſpecial Command, as to the Objects and Circumſtances of them, were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by God, they certainly were agreeable to the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:006120_0028_1027EB6E2924D640"/>Law of Nature; becauſe he can approve of nothing done by his Creatures, that is not agreeable either to that, or to his expreſs Command.</p>
            <p>
               <q>ADD to this the univerſal Conſent of all Nations. And it is, at leaſt, highly probable, that what all Nations in the World unanimouſly agree in, is a Dictate of the Law of Nature: For if the Effect be univerſal, the Cauſe muſt be ſo too. But of ſo univerſal a Perſuaſion as the Lawfulneſs of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive War, no other probable Cauſe can be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd, than that it is a Dictate of that Law, that is as univerſal as Nature itſelf. Hence we commonly ſay, and I think with a great deal of Reaſon, that whatſoever all Nations do grant, muſt needs be the Voice of Nature. What appears the ſame to all Men, muſt undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly be true.</q> And tho' there may be a few that diſbelieve the Juſtice of Defenſive War, yet that doth not invalidate the Force of this Argument; forasmuch as there is no general Rule without Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions. When I ſay, That muſt be a Dictate of Nature, that is acknowledged by all; I mean, all who have ſound Judgments: But if it appear other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to Men of diſtemper'd and perverſe Minds, who have been corrupted thro' an evil Education, imparted to them by Men of viſionary, enthuſiaſtick Tempers, it doth not in the leaſt weaken the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Law of Nature, no more than it will prove Honey not to be ſweet, becauſe a diſtemper'd Palate cannot perceive it. From all which, I hope, it evidently appears, to Men of ſound and unpreju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dic'd Minds, that Defenſive War was lawful under the Old Teſtament Diſpenſation. We ſee it was commenc'd and carried on by good Men, without any expreſs Command of God authorizing them; and therefore they muſt have been prompted to it by the Law of Nature, as they had no Syſtem of moral Duties by Revelation; and the Practice muſt
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:006120_0029_1027EB70CC9C1A88"/>have been agreeable thereto, otherwiſe Almighty God, who cannot but hate every Thing that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his Will, would never have ſhewn his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of it.</p>
            <p>HAVING therefore undeniably prov'd, that Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive War was lawful under the Old Teſtament, it evidently follows as a Reſolution of the Queſtion to be diſcuſs'd, that it is lawful for Chriſtians in ſome Caſes, to make War under the New, becauſe what was once lawful by Virtue of the Law of Nature, muſt for ever be ſo (the Grounds and Reaſons conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing the ſame) unleſs made otherwiſe by a poſitive Law of God. It being the Nature of Laws to bound up Men's Rights, what is not expreſly forbidden in the Goſpel, which was agreeable to the Will of God under the Law, by Virtue of the Law of Nature, that muſt be lawful for Chriſtians to practiſe ſtill (the Grounds and Reaſons of ſuch a Practice continuing the ſame.) My Meaning is this; Defenſive War being neceſſary under the Old Teſtament for the Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of civil Society, was lawfully practis'd by good Men; but Defenſive War being as neceſſary under the Goſpel for the like Purpoſe, may be lawfully prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis'd now, as well as then; unleſs it can be made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that the Author of the Goſpel has made an expreſs poſitive Law againſt all War whatſoever.</p>
            <p>AND here I might reſt the Cauſe, without giving myſelf any further Trouble; becauſe as my Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents, if they will ſupport their Argument, muſt hold the Affirmative, <hi>viz.</hi> That there is ſuch a Law in the New Teſtament (which I deny) 'tis indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly incumbent upon them to prove it. For by the ſtricteſt Laws of Reaſoning, he that maintains the Negative of a Queſtion, may perſiſt to deny the Affirmative, 'till ſuch Times as the Affirmant ſhall prove what he affirms.</p>
            <p>WHOEVER therefore ſhall affirm, that Chriſt hath by an expreſs Law forbidden all Defenſive War under
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:006120_0030_1027D91ECD3E9060"/>the New Teſtament, ought by all Means to prove it; it being a Matter of ſuch reſt Importance to human Society other Way. For if he hath not, how will they anſwer for it who act as if he had? And if he hath, how will they anſwer for it who act as if he had not? To aſſert ſuch a Thing therefore without Proof, and in Conſequence thereof, to act as if it were prov'd, certainly merits a ſevere Reprehenſion. For if there be ſuch a Law in the New Teſtament, it muſt be an eaſy Matter for theſe Men to produce it, which if they do, and can prove that our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our intended it as ſuch, I think every true Chriſtian is bound to thank them for the Diſcovery, and never to appear in Arms any more. But if they ſail in this, as I'm confident they will, they are bound in Duty, not only to acknowledge their Fault, in condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Men for a Practice ſo neceſſary for the Protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of civil Societies, when they can ſhew no Law they tranſgreſs thereby, but to lay aſide their groundleſs Prejudices themſelves, that ſo they may be able to anſwer o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> of the greateſt Ends for which they entered into Society, <hi>viz.</hi> Mutual Defence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Injuries.</p>
            <p>I no therefore in the Name and on the Behalf of the whole Chriſtian World, who are in the Practice of Self-defence againſt lawleſs Violence, call upon them to produce any Paſſage or Paſſages in the New Teſtament, which will amount to a Law pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting Defenſive War in all Caſes without Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I ſay, which will amount to a Law (for any Thing that comes ſhort of this, will not ſerve the Turn) becauſe, as I have already prov'd, ſome Wars having been lawful under the Old Teſtament by Virtue of the Law of Nature, and the divine Approbation, nothing can make all War unlawful under the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, but an expreſs Law enacted by the Author of the Goſpel prohibiting it; for an expreſs poſitive Command, as I obſerved above, is not neceſſary to
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:006120_0031_1027EB7256C64AB0"/>make a Thing lawful under the Goſpel, which was always agreeable to the Dictates of the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; it is ſufficient for that, if there be no Law made againſt it.</p>
            <p>BUT that I may not be thought to evade the Force of what they have to offer from the New Teſtament, in Oppoſition to what I have advanc'd, I will condeſcend to examine two or three of the principal Texts, upon which they lay the greateſt Streſs for Proof of the Unlawfulneſs of bearing Arms. The Firſt is written in the 33d Verſe of the 5th Chapter of St. <hi>Matthew;</hi> the Words are theſe; <hi>But I ſay unto you, that ye reſiſt not Evil.</hi> The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is in the 44th Verſe of the ſame Chapter, in theſe Words; <hi>But I ſay unto you, Love your Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>NOW granting that theſe Words will amount to an evangelical Precept or Law, prohibiting ſome Things, which the <hi>Jews,</hi> thro' the corrupt Gloſſes of the Scribes and Phariſees, look'd upon as indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Actions, tho' really contrary to the Law of Nature; ſuch as Revenge, Impatience under Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, returning Injuries, and the like; which, in certain Circumſtances, have ever been, and ever will be Evil: Yet we can find no Colour of Reaſon to allow, that they amount to a Precept or Law prohibiting Chriſtian States to defend themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the lawleſs Violence of a foreign Enemy; or that the great evangelical Lawgiver had any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention they ſhould, for theſe Reaſons:—</p>
            <p n="1">1. BECAUSE in delivering theſe Words, he doth not addreſs his Diſcourſe to the Magiſtrate, who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone hath a Right to declare War, but to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon injured. A Man may without any Breach of the Law of Nature, for ſome valuable Ends, remit ſomewhat of his own private Right; but the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate who ſuſtains a publick Character, and is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with the Care of a whole Community, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:006120_0032_1027EB73E39B0D20"/>give up the Rights of his Subjects, without a manifeſt Violation of this Law.</p>
            <p n="2">2. WHERE the Law of Nature doth determine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Thing by Way of Duty, as flowing from the Principles of it, which we take to be the Caſe with relation to Self-defence againſt a foreign Enemy, there no poſitive Law can be ſuppos'd to take off the Obligation of it. For the Things commanded by the Law of Nature being juſt and righteous in themſelves, there can be no obligatory Law made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch Things. A Man may be as well bound not to be a Man, as not to act according to Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Reaſon. For the Law of Nature is nothing but the Dictate of right Reaſon, diſcovering the Good or Evil of particular Actions, from their Conformity or Repugnancy to the Nature and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Things. Whatever poſitive Law is then made directly infringing and violating natural Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, is thereby of no Force at all; and that which hath no Obligation in itſelf, cannot diſſolve a former Obligation <note n="*" place="bottom">See Preface.</note>.</p>
            <p>'TIS a Dictate of the Law of Nature that Men ſhould enter into Society by mutual Compacts, in order the better to preſerve themſelves in their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Rights and Privileges by ſuch Means as are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for that End.</p>
            <p>NOW the greateſt Rights of Men are ſuch as flow from Nature itſelf; and therefore, as no Law binds againſt the Reaſon of it, ſo neither can it againſt the common End of Laws. Therefore, if a poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Law ſhould be made, that Men ſhould not protect and defend themſelves againſt lawleſs Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, it cannot bind, being againſt the main End of Laws, which is, that every civil Society be protected and preſerved; which, in many Caſes, cannot be done, without doing what Nature requires; and
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:006120_0033_1027EB7B8B951680"/>that is to defend themſelves from unjuſt Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>
            <p>AND therefore we conclude, that Self-defence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt lawleſs Violence, being a Dictate of the Law of Nature, no poſitive Law can be made to diſannul our Obligation to it, and conſequently that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour did not intend by theſe Precepts to prohibit it in all Caſes.</p>
            <p n="3">3. WHATSOEVER binds Chriſtians as an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, ſtanding Law, muſt be clearly revealed as ſuch, and laid down in Scripture in ſuch evident Terms, as all who have their Senſes exerciſed therein, may diſcern it to have been the Will of Chriſt that it ſhould perpetually oblige all Chriſtians. And this is neceſſary more eſpecially in eſtabliſhing a new Law, in order to prohibit a Practice which had been lawful before. If therefore our Saviour had intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed theſe Words as a ſtanding, univerſal Law, binding all Chriſtians in no Caſe to take Arms in their own Defence againſt lawleſs Violence, he would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly have declar'd himſelf in ſuch diſtinct Terms, and in ſuch a plain Dreſs of Words, as ſhould have been liable to no Miſapprehenſion; it being highly neceſſary in ſuch a Caſe, where the Matter of the Law was ſo weighty, and ſo new.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Jews,</hi> as well as all other Nations, had been bred in the full Conviction of the Lawfulneſs of Self-defence againſt unjuſt Violence, it having been practiſed all along from the Beginning of the World to that Time. If our Saviour therefore had intended by an expreſs poſitive Law to prohibit it under the Goſpel, he would undoubtedly have expreſs'd himſelf in ſo plain and intelligible a Manner, as every Man of ſound Judgment might have readily underſtood: As, <hi>Let no Man from henceforth take up Arms to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend himſelf in any Caſe whatſoever;</hi> or in Words as eaſy to be underſtood. This I ſay was abſolutely neceſſary in publiſhing a new Law of ſuch mighty
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:006120_0034_1027EB7D164D26F8"/>Conſequence; eſpecially when we conſider that the Words were addreſs'd to the <hi>Jews,</hi> who could not conceive nor imagine but that they were obliged by the judicial Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſo long as their Common-Wealth ſhould ſtand.</p>
            <p>BUT this I apprehend to be very far from the Caſe with the Words in Queſtion: For in order, with any Colour of Reaſon, to make them amount to a Law prohibiting Self-defence in all Caſes, they muſt neceſſarily be underſtood without any Reſtricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Limitation; but if they muſt be underſtood without any Reſtriction or Limitation, they will prove more than my Opponents want them to prove, <hi>viz.</hi> That we muſt reſiſt neither moral nor natural Evil. At this Rate, it will be unlawful to reſiſt a Robber or Cut-Throat; it will be unlawful for the moſt virtuous Matron to reſiſt a Raviſher; for a Father to reſiſt the Violence of an unnatural Child; or for a Maſter to reſiſt the violent Inſults of undutiful Servants: Nay, it will be unlawful to reſiſt even the Devil and the ſtrongeſt Temptations to Sin, contrary to the whole Tenor of the Goſpel. It will likewiſe be unlawful to reſiſt natural Evil, ſuch as a raging Conflagration, an overflowing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undation, a mad Dog, or any wild Beaſt, that is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to devour us. By Virtue of this Precept, if ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in an unlimited Senſe, it will be unlawful for the Magiſtrate to puniſh Malefactors with Death, and to put a Stop to other Enormities committed by his evil Subjects againſt the publick Peace of the Community; and ſo by this Means he will bear the Sword in vain, and neither be a Terror to Evil-do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, nor a Praiſe to them that do well, contrary to the expreſs Words of the great Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHEREFORE I conclude, that our Saviour never intended by theſe Words, <hi>Reſiſt not Evil,</hi> to bind all Chriſtians, in all Ages, never to take up Arms in their own Defence, in any Caſe whatſoever; more
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:006120_0035_1027EB7EA8E67198"/>than he intended thereby to bind them never to reſiſt either moral or natural Evil, or to bind the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Magiſtrate never to puniſh the Crimes of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Subjects.</p>
            <p>THUS we ſee how improper theſe Words are to prove the Point in Queſtion: For if they be taken in an unlimited Senſe, they will prove a great deal too much; and if we take them in a limited Senſe, they will not come up to the End deſign'd, <hi>viz.</hi> To prove the Unlawfulneſs of Defenſive War in all Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
            <p>AND as for thoſe Words, <hi>v.</hi> 44th, <hi>Love your E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,</hi> &amp;c. neither will theſe prove any ſuch Law as is here demanded; becauſe the Term, <hi>Enemies,</hi> being applicable either to private or publick Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, we cannot be certain which our Saviour meant; whether he meant only thoſe who may be at Enmity with us in the Society where we live, or foreign E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, to whom we ſtand in no other Relation than as we are Men; or laſtly, whether he meant all Sorts of Enemies, whether foreign or domeſtick. What Reaſon any Man hath to underſtand the Words in either the ſecond or third Senſe, I cannot conceive; but that they ought to be underſtood in the firſt, ſeems evident from hence, that the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Law, which the Scribes and Phariſees had perverted and obſcured by their falſe Gloſſes, commanded the <hi>Jews</hi> to love their Neighbburs; by whom they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood <hi>Jews</hi> and their Proſelytes: But thoſe Laws which forbad them to do Hurt, reach'd even to thoſe uncircumciſed Strangers that liv'd among them, as appears from <hi>Lev.</hi> xix. 18. <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour as thyſelf.</hi> And v. 34. <hi>The Stranger that ſojourneth with you, ſhall be as one Home-born a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you, and thou ſhalt love him as thyſelf; for ye were Strangers in the Land of Egypt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>YE <hi>have heard,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>that it hath been ſaid, Thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour, and hate thine
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:006120_0036_1027EB804BF8AAB0"/>Enemy. Hate thine Enemy</hi> was a falſe Gloſs, added by the Scribes and Phariſees; for theſe Words are not to be found in the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> This Law, I ſay, commanded the <hi>Jews</hi> to love their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, uncircumciſed Strangers among them, as well as thoſe of their own Nation.</p>
            <p>NOW what I would obſerve from hence is this, That notwithſtanding this Precept of loving their Neighbours, the eleven Tribes did juſtly make War againſt the Tribe of <hi>Benjamin,</hi> for a moſt bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Piece of Villainy committed by them, of which we read, <hi>Judges</hi> xix.</p>
            <p>SO, notwithſtanding this Precept, did holy <hi>David,</hi> who is ſaid in Scripture to fight the Lord's Battles, recover by Force of Arms the Kingdom that was promis'd to him; and yet we do not find that he was ever blam'd for it.</p>
            <p>WHY then might not our bleſſed Saviour enjoin Chriſtians to love Enemies, and yet not thereby o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blige them to ſuffer all Sorts of unlawful Violence from them, as well as the God of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join'd them to love their Neighbours, and yet did not make it unlawful for them to make War upon thoſe very Neighbours, when there was juſt Ground for it? If it was not unlawful for the <hi>Jews,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding God's Precept to them, <hi>Ye ſhall love your Neighbours as yourſelves,</hi> to make War upon their Brethren and Neighbours, when there was juſt Ground for it; it can with no Colour of Reaſon be ſuppoſed to be unlawful for Chriſtians to make War upon a foreign Enemy, when there is juſt Grounds for it, from Chriſt's Words, <hi>Love your Enemies.</hi> Becauſe as the <hi>Jews</hi> did love their Neighbours, and yet ſometimes did lawfully make War upon them; ſo may Chriſtians love Enemies, and yet ſometimes lawfully make War againſt them, to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from unjuſt Violence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:006120_0037_1027EB8449649250"/>
BUT I expect it will be ſaid, that the Goſpel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires an higher Degree of Love than what was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Law: All which I readily grant; but even then it will not follow, that we muſt love all with an equal Degree of Love; our Parents and Children, I hope, are to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before Strangers; and our Neighbours before our Enemies. If this be granted, it will follow, <hi>a fortiori,</hi> that I ought to prefer my own Life before the Life of my Enemy; then of Conſequence I ought to deſtroy the Life of my Enemy, if I can by no other Means poſſibly ſave my own.</p>
            <p>AS 'tis out of Love to the Righteous, that the Chriſtian Magiſtrate puts the Wicked to Death; ſo it is out of Regard for the publick Good, that he makes War in Defence of his innocent Subjects. In order to preſerve the publick Peace, he makes War againſt thoſe that diſturb it.</p>
            <p>IF it be reaſonable that the greater Obligation ſhould bind us to the ſtricter Duty (and that it is ſo, no reaſonable Man will deny) then it will follow, that we cannot in Reaſon be bound to preſerve the Guilty, when in ſo doing we deſtroy the Innocent. Let it be ſuppos'd, that by Virtue of this Precept, <hi>Love your Enemies,</hi> we are bound to love them as ourſelves, which yet I preſume is more than can with any Shew of Reaſon be inferred from the Words; yet we are not to love them above our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Now ſuppoſing us both to be involv'd in the ſame Danger, I would ſeriouſly aſk thoſe who are againſt all Defence by Force of Arms, whoſe Safety we are to prefer? For my own Part, I am clearly of Opinion, that we ought to prefer our own to that of our Enemy; for this Reaſon, becauſe we are no where, that I know of, forbid to do ſo.</p>
            <p n="4">4. THAT our bleſſed Saviour never intended that theſe Texts ſhould be underſtood without any Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, without which they will not ſerve our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary's
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:006120_0038_1027EB86F61FDD90"/>Purpoſe, will appear from a Conſideration of ſome other Texts in the New-Teſtament, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd in Terms more unlimited than theſe, which yet are allow'd on all Hands to require a limited In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation. St. <hi>Matthew</hi> v. 42. our Saviour ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſays, <hi>Give to him that aſketh.</hi> And in St. <hi>Luke</hi> the Words are, <hi>Give to every Man that aſketh of thee, and of him that taketh away thy Goods, aſk them not again.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NOW if this general Precept to Chriſtians, ought to be underſtood with a Limitation, why not thoſe which are brought to prove the Unlawfulneſs of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance in all Caſes? Nay, there is more Reaſon to reſtrain theſe latter than the former, not only from the Nature of the Thing, but from our Saviour's own following Words. For when he ſays, <hi>Reſiſt not Evil,</hi> the Precept following ſeems to reſtrain the Words preceding, as if they were too general. <hi>But if any Man ſtrike thee on one Cheek,</hi> ſays he, <hi>turn to him the other.</hi> Which Words plainly intimate, that our Saviour meant only ſuch Injuries as were ſlight, and therefore eaſy to be borne. For otherwiſe it had been neceſſary, in order to make the Precept binding, to have ſaid, Reſiſt not him that injures thee, even tho' he ſhould attempt to take away thy Life. But when he ſays, <hi>Give to every one that aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thee,</hi> he adds no Words to reſtrain his Meaning, but leaves it to the Judgment of common Equity and Diſcretion. And yet I think no Man of a ſound Mind will ſay, that theſe Words ought to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in an unlimited Senſe. Whoever does, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts St. <hi>Paul,</hi> whom yet all allow to be the beſt Interpreter of his Maſter's Will. This great Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle declares, that he who takes no Care for his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily (which how well he could do, that ſhould give to every one that would aſk from him, I leave the World to judge) is worſe than an Infidel: And who, exhorting the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to extend their Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality

We are likewiſe enjoin'd to take no Thought for the Marrow; to take no Thought for Food and Raiment; not to fear them that can kill the Body; not to ſeek earthly Things; Children are commanded to obey their Parents, and Servants their Maſters, in all Things; Chriſtians are commanded to be ſubject to the higher Powers, without any Limitation; to pray without ceaſing, and the like; and all in Terms as general and unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited as thoſe in the Text under Debate: And yet I preſume no Man in his Senſes will ſay, that theſe Precepts are to be underſtood without any Limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: So as that by Virtue thereof, it is unlawful for Chriſtians to uſe a provident Care for the Good of Society; or to endeavour to prevent Murder and Bloodſhed: or that Subjects, Children, and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, are thereby oblig'd to obey Magiſtrates, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, or Maſters, if their Commands be ſinful; <hi>i.e.</hi> if they command them to do what is repugnant to the Laws of God; becauſe in ſuch Caſes they are bound by the Law of Nature, to obey God rather than Man. And if theſe are not to be underſtood in an unlimited Senſe, becauſe of the abſurd Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences that would reſult from ſuch an Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, why thoſe?

               </gap>ing Injury and Revenge among Chriſtians, it will not follow, that a neceſſary Self-defence againſt unjuſt Violence is thereby prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited, becauſe it may be reaſonably ſuppos'd to be an Exception from the general Rule, as being, in ſome Caſes, the only Means in our Power, under God, to protect and proſerve civil Societies.</p>
            <p>IN interpreting Scripture, it ought always to be a Rule with us, to endeavour to explain it ſo, as to free it from all Abſurdities; but ſurely thoſe who interpret it ſo, as to make Chriſtianity an Enemy to the Happineſs of human Society, which it muſt be, if reſiſting an Enemy be unlawful in all Caſes, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they can prove that God has promis'd to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in ordinary Caſes by a miraculous Providence, do not well conſider this. For it not only implies a groſs Abſurdity, but reflects a palpable Calumny on the beſt Religion in the World, by repreſenting it as
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:006120_0041_1027EB8E6887F618"/>neceſſarily laying Men open and unguarded to all the Outrages the vileſt Part of the World think fit to offer them. Our Saviour therefore cannot be ſuppos'd in theſe Words to put the Caſe of a foreign Invaſion, or that we ſhould love Ruffians, and Cut-throats, which is impoſſible.</p>
            <p>BUT 'tis ſaid, <q>If the glorious Doctrines of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> were univerſally embrac'd, there would be no Need of Self-defence:</q>—Which I readily grant; but this can be no Argument againſt the Lawfulneſs thereof in ſome Caſes, while there is Need of it. The Goſpel hath never yet been uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally embrac'd, nor is it the Caſe at preſent; and therefore the Objection implies, that Self-defence is ſtill neceſſary; and if neceſſary, it muſt be as law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful now as formerly, ſince no Law can be produc'd prohibiting it.</p>
            <p>WHEN the Doctrines of Chriſtianity ſhall be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally embrac'd among the Nations, which we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve will be the Caſe before the End of the World; when the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhall be converted, and all Nations ſincerely embrace Chriſtianity; then there will be an univerſal Peace: <hi>Nation ſhall not lift up Sword a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Nation, nor Kingdom againſt Kingdom, neither ſhall they learn War any more:</hi> Then they may beat their Swords into Plowſhares, and their Spears into Pruning-hooks, becauſe there will be no Uſe for them: But it does not follow from hence, that 'tis unlawful to uſe them before that Time come. Then indeed it would be unlawful to uſe them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there will be no unjuſt Violence to reſiſt: But that does not prove, that it is unlawful to uſe them now, when Circumſtances are ſuch, that they are the only human Means, under God, to protect Chriſtian Societies from unjuſt Violence. Theſe Prophecies only foretel what ſhall be the Effects of their Accompliſhment, and therefore can be no Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument that Chriſtians may not lawfully defend
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:006120_0042_1027EB91152F4760"/>themſelves and their Country, till ſuch times as they ſhall be fulfill'd, when all Wars ſhall ceaſe, and then there will be no Occaſion for Self-defence; there will be no Violence, and conſequently no need of Reſiſtance.</p>
            <p>BUT it is aſk'd, <q>Is Defenſive War then our only Barrier againſt Injuſtice and Violence?</q> To which I Anſwer, By no means; God forbid we ſhould think ſo. For as the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>Of ourſelves we can do nothing,</hi> even in this Caſe, <hi>but all our Suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency is of God.</hi> And the Pſalmiſt ſays, <hi>Except the Lord keep the City, the Watchman waketh but in vain,</hi> Pſal. cxxvii. 1. All we contend for is, that it is the only Means under God, as far as we have any reaſonable Grounds to believe, for this Purpoſe. 'Tis further ſaid, <q>That there are many who depend upon, and confide ſolely in another Barrier, <hi>viz.</hi> the eternal and benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Providence of God.</q> That it is the Duty of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Chriſtian to depend upon, and confide in the Providence of Almighty God, I readily grant; but that it is our Duty to confide <hi>ſolely</hi> (if by this Term be intended a Diſuſe of Means, in the Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, I deny; and whoever aſſerts it, 'tis incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent upon him to prove it; without which, the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion is raſh, and the Practice built upon it groundleſs and dangerous. 'Tis true God can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect us from the greateſt Violence, without any of our Endeavours; but it is one Thing what God can do, and another what he will or does do, in the general Courſe of his Providence. He can protect us from the Devil, and all his Temptations, and yet we are expreſly commanded to reſiſt him, and to ſtrive againſt his Temptations. He could have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected and defended his choſen People the <hi>Jews</hi> from all their Enemies, and brought them into the promiſed Land, without the Effuſion of ſo much Blood; and yet we find he gave them ſpecial Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in what Method they ſhould protect and defend
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:006120_0043_1027EB93B643C110"/>themſelves, and drive out their Enemies from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, as the Scripture expreſſes it. He could, by his Almighty Providence, have ſaved St. <hi>Paul</hi> and the Ship without the Help of Mariners; and yet when they were about to leave it, St. <hi>Paul</hi> cried out, <hi>Except theſe abide in the Slip, ye cannot be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi> Acts xxvii. 31. notwithſtanding he had ſaid, <hi>v.</hi> 22. that there ſhould be no Loſs of any Man's Life, but of the Ship; which is a plain Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that it is preſumptuous for Men, in the ordinary Courſe of God's Providence, to expect Protection and Deliverance from Injuries, without uſing their own Endeavours, at the ſame time that they confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rely on the Divine Providence for Succeſs.</p>
            <p>HE could have recovered <hi>Hezckiah,</hi> when he was ſick unto Death; and yet, we find, he was ordered by a Prophet, to take a Lump of Figs, and to lay it upon the Boil, upon which he recovered, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> xx. 7.</p>
            <p>GOD Almighty, if he pleaſed, could not only keep us from, but cure us of, all Diſeaſes, by his all-powerful Providence; and yet he not only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, but requires us in Holy Scripture, to uſe all pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Methods of reſiſting and ſtopping their Fury; and is far from expecting that we ſhould lie down and do nothing to ſave our ſelves from periſhing in ſuch Calamities.</p>
            <p>AND as God, in the general Courſe of his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, protected and defended his own peculiar People from the Violence of their Enemies, not without, but always by the Uſe of ſecond Means (except when he was pleaſed to work a Miracle in their Favour, which yet was very ſeldom notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they were under a Theocratical Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whereby God himſelf was their King; this I ſay being the Caſe with God's peculiar People under an extraordinary Providence, we who lie under a common Providence, as to our civil Policy, can
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:006120_0044_1027EB9565C5A5B0"/>have no Ground to expect any miraculous Interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition for our Protection and Defence from Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; nor can any good Reaſons be aſſign'd why we ſhould. Nothing can be a ſufficient Ground for ſuch an Expectation, but an expreſs Promiſe in the New-Teſtament; without this, a Belief that God's Providence will protect us, without uſing our own Endeavours, would be Preſumption, and not Faith <note n="*" place="bottom">By Faith in this Place we are to underſtand what the L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

If God has given Chriſtians any ſuch Promiſe, let it be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd; but till this is done, let no Man blame them for uſing thoſe Means for the Preſervation and Protection of the publick Safety, with a pious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance on the Divine Providence for Succeſs, which good Men in all Ages have made uſe of with his Approbation.</p>
            <p>AND thus I have endeavoured to make it appear, that thoſe Texts, which are the ſtrongeſt Bulwark for ſupporting the Doctrine of the Unlawfulneſs of War in all Caſes under the Goſpel, cannot amount to a Law prohibiting Chriſtians to defend themſelves againſt the lawleſs Violence of a foreign Enemy.</p>
            <p>THERE are ſome other Texts alledged by our Adverſaries, in favour of this Doctrine; but none of them I think can even be pretended to amount to a Law; but are only to be adduced as collateral Proofs; the two I have already confider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, being the chief Baſis upon which the whole of their Doctrine is built.</p>
            <p>I SHALL examine one other Text, which, next to theſe, ſeems moſt to favour their Doctrine; and that is written, Rom. xii. 17. <hi>Recompence to no Max Evil for Evil: Dearly beloved, avenge not your ſelves,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:006120_0045_1027EB9C43D0CA98"/>but rather give place unto Wrath; for it is written, Vengeance is mine, I will repay, ſaith the Lord; therefore if thine Enemy bunger, feed him; if he thirſt, give him Drink,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As to theſe Words, <hi>Recompence to no Man E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil for Evil,</hi> they being our Saviour's Words, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> with ſome little Variation in the Phraſe, tho' not in the Senſe; what hath been advanc'd in Anſwer to thoſe, will be a ſufficient Anſwer to theſe. They are not addreſs'd to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, who hath the ſole Right of making War. but to the injured Party; and therefore it cannot reaſonably be inferr'd from them, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended hereby to forbid all War under the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</p>
            <p n="2">2. AND as to thoſe, <hi>v.</hi> 19, neither can any good Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument be drawn from them againſt all Sorts of War; foraſmuch as ſome Sorts of War may be commenc'd without any Deſire of Revenge, but meerly from the Principle of Self-preſervation.</p>
            <p n="3">3. BUT that no concluſive Argument can be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd from theſe Words againſt all War under the Goſpel, will farther appear from hence; that at the very Time when God appropriated to himſelf the Sword of Vengeance, ſaying, Deut. xxxii. 35 <hi>Vengeance is mine, I will recompence,</hi> Laws were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually in being for regulating and making War. And the <hi>Jews</hi> at the ſame Time that they were bound by the Law of God not to revenge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon their Enemies, if Countrymen or Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, admitted to live among them becauſe Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance belonged to God, and he had promis'd to recompence it might yet lawfully make War in ſome Caſes, without a poſitive Command of God, as to this or that particular War; as is evident from the many Directions he had given them concerning this Matter, in the 20th Chapter of this ſame Book.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:006120_0046_1027EB9DCD2BBFF8"/>
St. PAUL therefore might enjoin Chriſtians not to revenge themſelves upon their Enerries (becauſe Vengeance belonged to God, and he would recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence it) as well as God had enjoin'd the <hi>Jews</hi> not to do ſo, for the ſame Reaſon, and yet not thereby intend to prohibit all Sorts of War under the Goſpel. For as God in ſpeaking theſe Words to the <hi>Jews,</hi> did not deſign they ſhould prohibit all Sorts of War among them, as appears by what has been ſaid al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and which St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and thoſe Chriſtians to whom he wrote, could not but know; ſo if St. <hi>Paul</hi> had intended that this Precept ſhould oblige them to any Thing farther than what he had oblig'd the <hi>Jews</hi> to, he ſhould certainly have mentioned it. As the Words when ſpoken to the <hi>Jews,</hi> imply'd no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a Prohibition of private Revenge, how could the Apoſtle imagine that the <hi>Romans</hi> could underſtand them as pror hiting all Sorts of War un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel, unleſs he had told them ſo in expreſs Words? For what had been com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>tly practiſed by God's own People from the Beginning to that Time, and univerſally received as juſt and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, could not be reputed otherwiſe by any Thing the Apoſtle could ſay, leſs than an expreſs Prohibition of all Sorts of War in plain Terms.</p>
            <p>IF therefore he had intended that this Precept ſhould oblige all Chriſtians, or even thoſe Chriſtians to whom he wrote this Epiſtle, not to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt the unjuſt Attempts of a foreign Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, he would undoubtedly have ſaid ſo in expreſs Words; ſince otherwiſe it was not to be expected they could underſtand the Words, <hi>Revenge not your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> to import any ſuch Thing: But as he did not, we may reaſonably conclude, that he did not intend thereby to prohibit all Sorts of War under the Goſpel.</p>
            <p n="4">4. But that no concluſive Argument can be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd from theſe Words, againſt all Sorts of War
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:006120_0047_1027EBA06F3A8BB0"/>under the Goſpel, will ſtill further appear from this Conſideration: The Apoſtle, Chap. 13th of this Epiſtle, ſays, <hi>Let every Soul be ſubject to the higher Powers;</hi> i. e. the Magiſtrate: And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. 4. he tells them, <hi>That be beareth not the Sword in vain;</hi> that as he is the Miniſter of God for Good, ſo is he the Miniſter of God for Vengeance; <hi>a Revenger to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute Wrath on him that doth Evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NOW in telling them that thoſe higher Powers are the Executioners of God's Wrath in puniſhing Evil-doers, he clearly diſtinguiſhes between Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge in the Magiſtrate, and Revenge in private Perſons. The Magiſtrate he owns is to be a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venger, that is, he is to execute Wrath, or inflict Puniſhment on them that do Evil, and that by Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his Office, as he is Gold's Miniſter, whoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone Prerogative it is to recompence Vengeance on the Guilty; when at the ſame time he had expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prohibited it before, in the general Precept, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge not yourſelves.</hi> Whence it plainly appears, that he did not intend by this Precept to prohibit Chriſtian Magiſtrates the Uſe of the Sword to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend their Subjects from lawleſs Violence.</p>
            <p>TO ſuppoſe the contrary, would make the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle guilty of an Abſurdity. <q>For if we include in that negative Precept, that Revenge which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted by the Magiſtrate for the publick Peace, what can be more abſurd, than after he had charg'd all Chriſtians never to take Arms in their own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, as our Adverſaries contend he did, to have immediately ſubjoin'd in the ſame Epiſtle, that to this very End God had ordained Magiſtrates, that they, as his Miniſters, ſhould defend Chriſtians by Force of Arms, for ſo the Power of the Sword muſt needs ſignify, if any Thing.</q> To ſay, as ſome do, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> by the Sword here means an inward and ſpiritual Sword, is ſomething ſo idle and impertinent, that it doth not deſerve an Anſwer.

               </gap>, They and I ſhall be Adverſaries on this Point no longer: For I
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:006120_0049_1027EBA407E2A188"/>perfectly agree with them, not only that all War is to be avoided under the Goſpel, when this can be done without incurring a greater Evil; but that 'tis the ſole Right of the Magiſtrate to commence even a lawful War: Nay, I will agree with them farther, that 'tis unlawful even for the Chriſtian Magiſtrate himſelf to commence and proſecute any ſort of War but what is juſtly grounded; which I think no War can be, even the Defenſive, that is undertaken purely from a Principle of Revenge, when the Good of the Publick does not neceſſarily require it.</p>
            <p>BUT, after all, I muſt own myſelf at a Loſs how to reconcile this ſpecious Pretence with the general Doctrine theſe Men have delivered on this Point: For they have expreſly aſſerted in all their Writings on that Subject, that all bearing of Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt an Enemy, is inconſiſtent with the true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Chriſtianity <note n="*" place="bottom">See Declaration to the King, <hi>Anno</hi> 1660.</note>; nay, that all Uſe of the Sword by Chriſtians, tho' to ſave themſelves from Thieves, Robbers or Cut-throats, is not only incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the Profeſſion of Chriſtianity, but as bad as Atheiſm, as being a diſtruſting of Providence in reſtraining evil Men. Now, this being the Caſe, I cannot ſee, and indeed he muſt have good Eyes that can, how that can be lawful in the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Magiſtrate, which, by virtue of Chriſtianity, is not only unlawful in itſelf, but as bad as A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm?</p>
            <p>IF all War be unlawful under the Goſpel, by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Chriſt's Command, as they ſay it is, it muſt, in my humble Opinion, be a Sin in any Chriſtian, whether Magiſtrate or Subject, to engage even in a Defenſive War againſt a lawleſs Invader, unleſs it can be made appear that the Magiſtrate is an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:006120_0050_1027EBA8F2CF2FD8"/>from the general Rule. And beſides, if it be not unlawful for the Chriſtian Magiſtrate to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend his Subjects from lawleſs Violence, how can it be unlawful for thoſe Subjects to help to defend themſelves at their Magiſtrate's Command? If the End be lawful, the ordinary Means for obtaining it muſt be ſo likewiſe. Now, the ordinary Means whereby the Chriſtian Magiſtrate can defend the Publick from Ruin againſt a foreign Enemy, is the mutual Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his Subjects; it cannot therefore be unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for Chriſtian Subjects to aſſiſt the Magiſtrate in Defence of the Publick againſt a foreign Enemy <note n="*" place="bottom">See Preface, p. 10, 11.</note>: Nay, ſo far is it from being unlawful, that it is their indiſpenſible Duty, foraſmuch as they are obliged, by the Laws of Chriſtianity, to be ſubject to the higher Powers, and obey the Magiſtrate, in all Things lawful; and what is lawful for him to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, cannot be unlawful for the Subject to obey; ſo that car Adverſaries, on this Point, muſt either ſhew where Chriſtianity has made War lawful for Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Magiſtrates, while at the ſame time it has made War unlawful for Chriſtians; or elſe it will follow, from the whole Tenor of their Doctrine on this Point, that it is as unlawful for Magiſtrates as for Subjects: But how this can be reconciled with their thinking it probable that God will bleſs their Arms with Succeſs, I own is more than I can ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for, with any Advantage to their Character.</p>
            <p>AWAY then with that idle Diſtinction (to call it no worſe) That tho' Chriſtians may not make uſe of carnal Weapons in their own neceſſary Defence as Chriſtians, yet they may as Magiſtrates. By this very Argument the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Antichriſt defends the Lawfulneſs of uſing the temporal Sword to cut off Hereticks; which, whatever Weight it may have
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:006120_0051_1027EBAA818D3F50"/>with ſome People, it is ſo far from having any with us, that we heartily abominate it.</p>
            <p>AGAIN, If it be not unlawful for the Chriſtian Magiſtrate to defend the Publick from the Violence of foreign Enemies, why do <hi>Quaker Magiſtrates</hi> among us ſo peremptorily refuſe to lend the leaſt As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siſtance towards it, when we apprehend ourſelves in ſo great Danger? They cannot be ignorant, that it is the Magiſtrate's Duty to uſe his utmoſt Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours for the Protection of the Subject from all lawleſs Violence and Oppreſſion, which in many Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes cannot be done, without oppoſing Force to Force by the carnal Sword. Now what can make them ſo backward to aſſiſt thoſe who are willing to exert themſelves to the utmoſt of their Power in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending of their Country, but that they think the Practice is unlawful? How then can any one of that Perſuaſion think it probable, that God will bleſs the Arms of their Sovereign, if it be inconſiſtent with the Principles of the Chriſtian Religion to uſe them at all? And if it be not, how can they anſwer it to God and their own Conſciences, who abſolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to do that which is their Duty to do, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which, this Part of his Majeſty's Dominions, for any Thing they know to the contrary, may be quite ruined?</p>
            <p>BUT here we ſhall be told, that the Friends, tho' principled againſt bearing Arms themſelves, yet have never condemned ſuch in the Uſe of them, who are not convinc'd that the Diſpenſation of the Goſpel forbid them. Theſe ſmooth Words, in my Opinion, mean nothing at all. For if being charged with a Practice that is inconſiſtent with the true Profeſſion of Chriſtianity, nay with Atheiſm, and a total Diſbelief of Divine Providence, be not a very ſevere Condemnation, I ſubmit to the unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judic'd Reader to judge. And that they have
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:006120_0052_1027EBAE71D391C8"/>done ſo oftner than once, appears from the moſt authentick of their own Writings <note n="*" place="bottom">Coll. of <hi>Barclay</hi>'s Works, Page 870. Declaration to the King, 1660. Tryals of <hi>George Keith.</hi>
               </note>.</p>
            <p>OUR Principle is, that it is a Duty indiſpenſibly incumbent, both on us and them, to defend our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and Country from the lawleſs Attempts of a foreign Enemy by outward Means, at the ſame Time that we rely on Divine Providence for Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection: And till they can prove the contrary from the New Teſtament, which I am confident they cannot, we cannot help thinking, that in condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this Practice as inconſiſtent with the Chriſtian Religion, they condemn all who are in the Uſe of it, notwithſtanding this ſpecious Declaration to the contrary. We are not convinc'd that the Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Goſpel forbids any Chriſtian Community to defend themſelves from the Violence of a foreign Enemy; becauſe, as I have already ſhewn, it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent almoſt to a Demonſtration, that there is no Ground for ſuch a Conviction in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and therefore if our Adverſaries, on this Point, be ſo convinced, it muſt be by other Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments than any that can be drawn from thence; which we looking upon as the only Rule of our Faith and Practice, think ourſelves bound in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to abide by it, and to be determined thereby, as to every Point of Duty. What it hath enjoin'd, we willingly obſerve; and ſuch Practices as were lawful before, and not made unlawful by it (there being an equal Neceſſity for them now as before) we think we may lawfully, and with a good Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, embrace. This is our Rule, and our Practice in this Particular, we hope, is not contrary thereto. We are therefore determined to regard no private Spirit, under whatever ſpecious Colours of Sanctity and Perfection it may appear; becauſe many lying Spirits are gone out into the World, and ſuch we
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:006120_0053_1027EBB285AC9748"/>believe every Spirit to be, that attempts to make void the Law of Nature, introduce Principles as Doctrines of Chriſtianity, which, in the preſent Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of the World, would ſoon deſtroy Chriſtianity, and bring all the Chriſtian States on Earth, into the moſt abſolute Slavery and Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
            <p>AND thus I hope I have made it appear, to the Satisfaction of every unprejudic'd, intelligent Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that it is not unlawful in all Caſes for Chriſtians to make War under the Goſpel.</p>

            <p>I SHOULD now conclude, were it not that a certain Author, in a late Pamphlet, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled, <hi>The Doctrine of Chriſtianity, as held by the People colled</hi> Quakers, <hi>vindicated; in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to</hi> Gilbert Tennent<hi>'s Sermon on the Lawfulneſs of Defenſive War;</hi> hath undertaken to prove, by fair and candid Interpretations of Scripture, as himſelf expreſſes it, that War in any Shape (for ſo he muſt be underſtood to mean, if he means any thing) is inconſiſtent with the Chriſtian Religion. And becauſe ſome of his Remarks may ſeem to affect the general Doctrine I have endeavoured to eſtabliſh in the Firſt Part of this Treatiſe, I think it my Duty, for the better Support thereof, to examine all ſuch Paſſages as have the leaſt Tendency that Way.</p>
            <p>THE firſt of his Remarks that ſeems to affect my Doctrine, is Page 3. in theſe Words, <q>God created Man good, upright, and holy; and had he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in this State, there never would have been

                  </gap>s deprav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the whole intellectual Syſtem diſordered. Thus began ſhedding of Blood, and the Earth was early filled with Violence. This was the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Conſequence of Sin. Nobody, ſays he, I hope, will ſay that God was the Author of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thus corrupted. The Nature, and the Light of Nature, that he was the Author of, was holy, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, and perfect, but the Corruption of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, from whence proceeded Violence and Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, was occaſioned by adhering to the Voice of Satan.</q> Anſwer,</p>
            <p>THAT if Man had not fallen from his State of Innocence, there would have been no War, and conſequently no Need of Defence, every One will readily grant: But that immediately upon the Fall, Man's Nature was as highly corrupted, as this Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicator repreſents it, in my humble Opinion, wants Proof. For tho' it pleaſed God, for wiſe Ends, beſt known to himſelf, to permit Man to fall, yet he was ſo far from abandoning him hereupon, that he takes Care to provide for his Happineſs, by entering into another Covenant with him, in theſe Words; <hi>The Seed of the Woman ſhall bruiſe the Head of the Serpent.</hi> 'Tis true Men being left to the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of their own Wills, ſome of them, no Doubt, made a bad Uſe of their Liberty, and abandon'd themſelves to great Enormities; but it does not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that this was the Caſe with all of them, or that it was a neceſſary Conſequence of the Fall, becauſe there were good Men notwithſtanding this, who did many Things agreeable to the Dictates of the Law of Nature; as <hi>Adam, Seth, Enos, Methuſalem, Noah;</hi> and it doth no where appear that thoſe Patriarchs had any other Rule whereby to guide their Practice, but this eternal Law of Righteouſneſs; which is nothing
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:006120_0056_1027EBB98CF31810"/>elſe but the unchangeable Will of God, conſtantly acting according to the eternal Rules of infinite Goodneſs, Juſtice, and Truth: Which Will of God, is engraven upon the Natures of Things, and to be diſcovered by the due Uſe of Mens rational Faculties. This Law hath God for its Author, was to have been the Rule of Duty in Paradiſe, and was ſo to the Patriarchs till <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Time, when God was pleaſed to make a particular Revelation of it to his choſen People in the Decalogue; which is only a Tranſcript of this Law.</p>
            <p>BUT to clear this Subject from the Rubbiſh of Words, under which this <hi>V.</hi> hath buried it, I will prove,</p>
            <p n="1">1. THE Exiſtence of the Law of Nature; and that it was the Rule of Duty, in ordinary Caſes, to Mankind before the giving of the Law to <hi>Moſes.</hi> And ſecondly, That Man's Nature by the Fall was not ſo corrupted, but that he could diſcern it to be ſo, tho' he had not Power ſufficient to perform it in all Caſes.</p>
            <p n="1">1. THAT there are natural, eſſential Differences, in the Natures of Things, as between Truth and Falſhood, Good-faith and Perfidiouſneſs, Gratitude and Ingratitude, Love and Hatred, Juſt and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, Right and Wrong, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And hence a Fitneſs and Unfitneſs in Actions to certain Ends, has ever been evident to the common Reaſon of Mankind <note n="*" place="bottom">See Preface, Page 5.</note>.</p>
            <p>THESE, and the like eternal Truths, conſidered as a Syſtem of moral Principles, which have their Foundation in the Nature and Reaſon of Things, are what we call the Law of Nature, Right Reaſon, the eternal Rule of Righteouſneſs, or the unchangea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Will of God, written in the Books of Nature. This is the immutable Sta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="5 letters">
                  <desc>•••••</desc>
               </gap>d of moral Duty; whatever is agreeable to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="40" facs="unknown:006120_0057_1027EBBD555209D0"/>Things; what is morally fit and proper is virtuous; what is morally unfit and improper is vicious. And the ſame wiſe and good Being, who conſtituted Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in ſuch a Manner, that this Fitneſs or Unfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhould immediately reſult from it, muſt intend that every intelligent Being, ſo far as he is capable of diſcerning theſe Things, ſhould act agreeably thereto. This Law, we ſay, God is the Author of, becauſe thoſe moral Principles, which are founded in the Nature and Reaſon of Things, were originally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted ſuch by him, who is the Supream Author of Nature. This was <hi>Adam</hi>'s Law in Paradiſe, and continued to be a Law to Mankind, as far as we know, till the Time of <hi>Moſes,</hi> when a Tranſcript of it was delivered to him in the Mount. For tho' God made ſome ſpecial Revelations to the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs, he never gave them any Syſtem of Laws to be a Rule of Practice before this. And thus it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that there exiſts in Nature ſuch a Law as we plead for</p>
            <p>BUT by the Account the <hi>V.</hi> gives us of human Nature after the Fall, this Law was of no Uſe to Mankind, becauſe they were uncapable of diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what Duties were incumbent by virtue of it.</p>
            <p>HE gives ſuch a ſtrange Deſcription of the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of Man's Nature, and the Depravation of his Faculties, as if he thought the Patriarchs neither had any Law to guide their Practice, nor were ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of obeying it if they had. But how he came to diſcover ſuch a total Depravation immediately up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Fall I know not. Certainly he never learnt it from the Hiſtory of <hi>Moſes.</hi> For ſo far as I can find there, what <hi>Adam</hi> loſt by the Fall was Paradiſe, and the Tree of Life; <hi>i. e.</hi> in other Words, he loſt Bliſs and Immortality. The Penalty annex'd to the Breach of the Law, with the Sentence pronounced by God upon it, ſhews this. The Penalty ſtands thus, <hi>Gen.</hi> ii. 17. <hi>In the Day that thou eateſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:006120_0058_1027EBBEDF9933F0"/>of, thou ſhalt ſurely die.</hi> How was this executed? He did eat, but in the Day he did eat, he did not actually die, but was turned out of Paradiſe from the Tree of Life, and ſhut out forever from it, leaſt he ſhould take thereof, and live forever. This ſhews that Paradiſe was a State of Immortality, which he loſt that very Day that he eat: His Life began from thence to ſhorten, and waſte, and to have an End.</p>
            <p>NOW is it at all likely, that as ſoon as <hi>Adam</hi> was turn'd out of Paradiſe, his Faculties became ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved, that he loſt all Knowledge of that immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Rule of Duty, with which he muſt have been perfectly well acquainted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n Paradiſe? 'Tis true his Poſterity, thro' Length of Time, became very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch'd, both in Principle and Practice; but ſtill as there were many good Men, both before the Flood, and from thence to <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Time, they muſt have had ſome Law to be a Rule of Practice, and this Law they muſt have been capable of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, otherwiſe it could be no Rule to them, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently they could have been guilty of no Sin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe where there is no Law, there can be no Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion; and Sin is only a Tranſgreſſion of a divine Law. And tho' a Law exiſts, yet if it be impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for Men to come at the Knowledge of ſuch a Law, 'tis all one, in regard to them, as if there were none; it being impoſſible for them to obey a Law, the Knowledge of which 'tis impoſſible for them to come at.</p>
            <p>BUT that Mankind, notwithſtanding the Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Nature this <hi>V.</hi> talks of, were not ignorant of the Law of Nature, nor altogether incapable of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying its Dictates, will farther appear from what follows.</p>
            <p>THO' <hi>Moſes</hi> was the firſt Man that had a written Law for a Rule of Practice, whence it is called, <hi>Lex Moralis,</hi> or the Law of Morals, yet they who
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:006120_0059_1027EBC18704F770"/>liv'd before <hi>Meſes</hi> were not without a Law, becauſe they had this moral Law written in their Hearts; <hi>i. e.</hi> by the due Uſe of their rational Powers, they diſcovered the Will of God concerning their moral Duty to be founded in the Natures and Reaſon of Things.

Thus it appears that there is ſuch a Law as that of Nature, which exiſted long before any po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Law was given: That it is the univerſal Law of all reaſonable Creatures, and that it was the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Rule of moral Practice before that Tranſcript of it was given to <hi>Moſes,</hi> which we call the Decalogue.

Why, ſays he, theſe Rules are right and good, and they cannot but ſee them to be ſo, tho' their Minds be not ſo; the Rules are unchangeable, tho' their Minds be mutable.</q> But further, that Mankind had not only the Knowledge of the Law of Nature, but that in the great Branches of Morality, they regulated their Practice thereby, will appear from a particular Conſideration of the Decalogue itſelf, which is the great Pandect of this Law; which, when Men by the Abuſe of their Faculties had in a great Meaſure crazed out of their Hearts, Almighty God was gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly pleaſed to commit it to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p n="1">1. To begin with the firſt Precept, we find <hi>Gen.</hi> xxxv. 2. That <hi>Jacob</hi> commanded his Houſhold to put away their ſtrange Gods. <hi>Pythagoras</hi> ſays, <q>If any one ſhall ſay that he is a God, but he that made all Things, let him prove it, by making a new World.</q> 
               <hi>Sophocles, Varro, Orphous, Plato,</hi> &amp;c. all maintain'd the Unity of the Dairy.</p>
            <p n="2">2. FOR the Second, we find that <hi>Jacob</hi> buried the Idols under an Oak, Chap. xxxv. 4. And the <hi>Gentiles</hi> agreed, that every God ſhould be worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped according to the Manner that himſelf ſhould think beſt; and <hi>Varro</hi> did much approve of the <hi>Jews</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> informs us, becauſe it exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Images, holding it the beſt Way to keep Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion undefiled by excluding them; and that if all People elſe had taken that Courſe, it had been a Means to take away much trifling.</p>
            <p n="3">3. For the Third, we find <hi>Abraham</hi> cauſed his Steward to put his Hand under his Thigh, and ſwear by the Lord of Heaven and Earth; and we

And even as to the particular Day mentioned in this Commandment, I muſt confeſs, that the general Conſent of Nations, as to the ſeventh Part, if it were fully clear'd, would ſpeak fair to be the Voice of Nature, or at leaſt a Tradition received from the Sons of <hi>Noah.</hi>

            <p>AND <hi>Homer</hi> ſaith of one that had a Misfortune, that it came becauſe he honoured not his Parents. He would not render the Duty of a Child to his Father, therefore his Days were not prolonged. And <hi>Menander</hi> ſaith, That he who honoureth his Parents, ſhall live long and happily. And <hi>Charon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi> in his Laws, ſaith, The Neglect of our aged Parents, is Extremity of Wrong.</p>

And <hi>Menander</hi> hath this Saying, <q>Do not <hi>concupiſcere,</hi> or deſire ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Man's Pin or Button.</q> And indeed tho' the Laws of <hi>Gentile</hi> Nations do not expreſs this, yet the Scope of them all did tend to this End, <hi>Non concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcere,</hi> not to covet other Men's Properties. Whence we may conclude with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> That the

               <hi>Gentiles</hi> having the Law written in their Hearts, were inexcuſable.</p>
            <p>FROM all which it appears, that notwithſtanding the Corruption of Nature (this <hi>V.</hi> talks of) by the Fall, Mankind were not only ſenſible of the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Law of Nature, but, in all the principal Duties of Morality, were able to comply with it. And as all good Men were directed to their moral Duties by the Dictates of this Law, ſo were they to that of a neceſſary Self-defence: For conſidering that the Preſervation of themſelves, and thoſe under their Care is a Dictate of the Law of Nature, they could not but conclude that Self-defence, when this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly be done otherwiſe, muſt be a Duty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting from this Law; it being an indiſputable Truth, that whenever it is our Duty to proſecute an End, it muſt likewiſe be our Duty to make Uſe of thoſe Means, without which that End cannot be obtained. Hence all thoſe Wars which good Men undertook without any ſpecial Command from God, were agreeable to this Law, as appears from their having been approved of by him after they were commenc'd. But having fully diſcours'd this Point in the firſt Part of this Treatiſe, I ſhall now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to an Examination of the <hi>V</hi>'s Reaſoning here, where perhaps we may diſcover ſomething not much to the Credit of his Cauſe.</p>
            <p>HAVING firſt repreſented human Nature as fit for nothing but to be Fuel for the Fire of Hell, he adds, <q>I hope Nobody will ſay, that God is the Author of Nature thus corrupted.</q> In which Words he endeavours to delude his ignorant Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, by including a General in a Particular. He firſt deſcribes Man's Nature as a meer Maſs of Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and then, hoping his Reader would look no farther, he exults as if he had gain'd his Point; for he hopes no Body will ſay that God is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of Nature thus corrupted. And tho' they do
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:006120_0064_1027EBCE8C7FF768"/>hot, his Argument will be never a Whit the more concluſive. Here then we have a Specimen of his Candour: For can it be ſuppoſed that he is ſo ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant as not to diſcern the Fallacy of his own Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning? I think not. Was all Nature comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the human Nature? The Nature of Man is, I hope, but a Part, a ſmall inconſiderable Part of Nature; but can a Part contain the whole? Grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing human Nature was corrupted, doth it therefore follow, that all Nature muſt be corrupted? Muſt the Corruption of Man's Nature alter the Nature of Things, confound Right and Wrong, and take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all Diſtinction between moral Good and Evil? If not, then a Man may juſtly ſay, that God is the Author of that Part of Nature which never was corrupted, and this is all we contend for. But we cannot help thinking, that God is the Author of that Part of Nature too which is thus corrupted, tho' not of the Corruption itſelf; which to deny, would incur ſuch a Cenſure as this <hi>V.</hi> I preſume, would not like. <q>The Nature, ſays he, and the Light of Nature he was the Author of, was holy, innocent and perfect.</q> Is not this an evident In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuation, that the Law or Light of Nature was corrupted by the Fall, as well as Man's Nature? That the eternal Law of Righteouſneſs, which would have been the Rule of Man's Practice; had he kept his Innocency, was by the Fall deſtroyed? His Words can be conſtrued no otherwiſe than to import, that that Nature, and the Light of Nature, which was holy, innocent, and perfect, and of which God was the Author, was now no where exiſting; whence he concludes, that Nature being univerſally corrupted by the Fall, 'twas abſurd in his Adverſary to ſpeak of a Law or Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. If this be a wrong Conſtruction of his Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he muſt blame himſelf, for his Words will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of no other.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="unknown:006120_0065_1027EBD16219C068"/>
BUT that Nature was univerſally corrupted by the Fall, is an impious Falſhood. For the natural and eternal Relations of Things, as Goodneſs, Juſtice, Righteouſneſs, Love, Gratitude, good Faith, and the whole Syſtem of moral Principles, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute that eternal Law of Righteouſneſs, whereby every rational Being is bound by the very Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Nature to regulate his moral Actions (as I have ſhewn already) is as holy, innocent, and perfect, ſince the Fall, as before. The Fallacy lies in the Word <hi>Nature,</hi> which he ſhould have limited to the particular Nature he had been deſcribing; but this would not have ſerv'd his Turn, <hi>viz.</hi> To prove there was no ſuch Thing as the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: And therefore like a true Sophiſt, he lays hold of the equivocal Term <hi>Nature,</hi> and after hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſcrib'd one particular Species of Nature, and made it as black as Hell, he attributes to univerſal Nature, what he had deſcribed as peculiar to that particular Species; and ſo thinks he has overſet his Adverſary's Doctrine taken from the Law or Light of Nature.</p>
            <p>THIS is juſt ſuch wretched Reaſoning, as if one ſhould ſay, in Oppoſition to another, maintaining, that Chriſt is the Author of the Catholick Church; <q>The Catholick Church is ſo monſtruouſly corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that ſhe is become a meer Chaos of Anti-Chriſtian Darkneſs (meaning the Church of <hi>Rome)</hi> will any one venture to ſay, that Chriſt is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Catholick Church thus corrupted? The Catholick Church that Chriſt was the Author of, was holy, innocent, and pure.</q> Now will any Man ſay, that this would be a good Argument againſt the Exiſtence of the Church of Chriſt? Becauſe a Part of the Catholick Church is degenerat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, doth it therefore follow, that the whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of the Faithful are ſo far degenerated, as that Chriſt hath now no Church upon Earth? And yet
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:006120_0066_1027EBD62B82DAE0"/>the Opponent by the equivocal Terms, <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> which, as apply'd by the Papiſts, are ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, but as apply'd by other Chriſtians, are general, impoſes upon his Reader's Aſſent; that Chriſt can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be the Author of the Catholick Church, and ſo impoſes a Falſhood upon them: Will any Man ſay, ſays the Opponent, that Chriſt is the Author of the Catholick Church thus corrupted? No; I believe no Man will ſay that Chriſt is the Author of the Corruption: But doth it therefore follow, that he is not the Author of the Catholick Church, which conſiſts of the whole Company of the Faithful?</p>
            <p>JUST ſo is it, as to the Point in Debate; becauſe Man by the Fall corrupted his own Nature, doth it therefore follow, that the Law of Nature was cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted? And becauſe God cannot be ſaid to be the Author of the Corruption of Man's Nature, doth it therefore follow, that he cannot be ſaid to be the Author of human Nature, and the Law of Nature? <q>The Nature, and the Light of Nature, he was the Author of, was holy, innocent, and perfect; but the Corruption in Nature, from whence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded Violence and Bloodſhed, was occaſioned by adhering to the Voice of Satan,</q> ſays the <hi>V.</hi> If by the Light of Nature he means the Law of Nature, as his Words neceſſarily import, I have made it appear to every unprejudiced Reader, that this Law is as holy, innocent, and perfect, as ever it was; as being nothing but the immutable Will of God himſelf, written in the great Books of Nature. And if by the Light of Nature he means thoſe ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Powers, whereby we diſcover this Will of God, and our Duty therein contained, I have ſhewn likewiſe on this Head, that human Nature was not ſo much depraved by the Fall, as thereby to render Men wholly uncapable to diſcover this Will of God concerning their Duty. And what follows doth not in the leaſt affect our Argument, becauſe we are not
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:006120_0067_1027EBD8D52B8E40"/>pleading for Violence and Bloodſhed, but for a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Self-defence; and tho' it be true, that Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and Bloodſhed proceeded from that Corruption of Nature which was occaſioned by adhering to the Voice of Satan, yet it will not follow, that neceſſary Self-defence is ſinful, more than it will follow, that becauſe the Neceſſity of earning our Livelihood with the Sweat of our Brows, was occaſioned by adher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Voice of Satan, therefore 'tis ſinful to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour with our Hands the Things that are good, for the neceſſary Support of ourſelves and Families. If Violence and Bloodſhed happen to enſue upon a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Self-defence, this indeed proceeds from the Corruption of Nature occaſionally, but not as a Cauſe: That the Corruption of Nature which was occaſioned by adhering to the Voice of Satan, was the Occaſion of what Bloodſhed and Violence might enſue from a neceſſary Self-defence, I grant; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe if there had been no Corruption, there would have been no lawleſs Violence; and had there been no lawleſs Violence, there would have been no Need of Reſiſtance; and conſequently no Bloodſhed and Violence enſuing from thence: But there is a wide Difference between a neceſſary Effect, and an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental Conſequence; between a Cauſe and an Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Sin is the Cauſe of our greateſt Sorrow, but it is only the Occaſion of that godly Sorrow that worketh Repentance. The Fall of <hi>Adam</hi> was the Occaſion of Chriſt's Sufferings; but it would be very abſurd to ſay that this was the Cauſe of his Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, whether efficient, inſtrumental, or final. As abſurd is it in this <hi>V.</hi> to inſinuate, that that Bloodſhed and Violence which may accidentally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue from a neceſſary Self-defence againſt lawleſs Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, hath that Corruption for its productive Cauſe, which was occaſioned by adhering to the Voice of Satan. He may as well ſay, that tilling the Ground, and labouring for the Support of ourſelves
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:006120_0068_1027EBDA77A796D0"/>and Families, proceeds from that Corruption which was occaſion'd by adhering to the Voice of Satan as its productive Cauſe; for as the latter is only a Conſequence of that Corruption, ſo is the former.</p>
            <p>BUT, further, if all Bloodſhed and Violence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from that Corruption which was occaſioned by adhering to the Voice of Satan, as a productive Cauſe, and is therefore unlawful; what will this <hi>V.</hi> ſay to all the Bloodſhed and Violence committed by the Chriſtian Magiſtrate in the legal Puniſhment of Malefactors? Will he ſay that all this is unlawful, becauſe it proceeds from that Corruption of Nature which was occaſioned by adhering to the Voice of Satan? And if he reply that this cannot be ſaid, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Objects of ſuch Violence have forfeited their Lives, by becoming Peſts to the Community where they live, and therefore may juſtly be put to Death; ſo ſay I with regard to that Violence that may enſue upon a Community's defending them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt a foreign Invader: The Aſſailants ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving violated the Laws of God and Nature, and put themſelves into a State of War with the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, by attempting to deſtroy them without any juſt Provocation, have thereby forfeited their Lives to all Intents and Purpoſes, as much as a Robber or Murdere<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>; and therefore, by the Law of Nature, may be as juſtly put to Death as the other, when the Defendants can by no other Means eſcape their Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. If the Violence practis'd by the Magiſtrate then, upon notorious Offenders, be not unlawful, tho' it proceed from that Corruption of Nature which was occaſioned by adhering to the Voice of Satan; neither is that which may enſue upon a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on's defending themſelves againſt thoſe who have turn'd Rebels to God and Nature, unlawful, tho' it occaſionally proceed from that Corruption of Nature which was occaſioned by adhering to the Voice of Satan, when they cannot eſcape their Violence by
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:006120_0069_1027EBDE8AB7A318"/>any other Methods. Whoever aſſerts the latter, muſt by a Parity of Reaſon maintain the former.</p>
            <p>WHEN the <hi>V.</hi> ſays, <q>It is not from the degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate fallen Light of Nature that Arguments are to be drawn for the Formation and Eſtabliſhment of Chriſtian Principles;</q> he ſays juſt nothing at all to the Purpoſe. For we draw our Arguments for eſtabliſhing our Doctrine, not from the degenerate, fallen Light of Nature, but from that eternal Law of Righteouſneſs, which is as immutable as God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and conſequently he is neither fallen nor degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, as I have ſhewn above. Nor moreover do we allow the Point in Queſtion to be a Chriſtian Principle; ſo far from it, that we have prov'd it to be a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of the Law of Nature; and that not from the degenerate fallen Light of Nature, as the <hi>V.</hi> loves to ſpeak, but from ſelf-evident Propoſitions, and Facts recorded in Holy Writ <note n="*" place="bottom">See firſt Part.</note>.</p>
            <p>BUT, which makes worſe for him ſtill, this is not the <hi>V</hi>'s Meaning. By Chriſtian Principles, for the Formation and Eſtabliſhment of which, he ſays Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments are not to be drawn from the degenerate, fallen Light of Nature, we are to underſtand the Principle he is pleading for, <hi>viz.</hi> the Unlawfulneſs of Defenſive War; that this is his Meaning appears from the Words immediately following; <q>Neither are any from it of any Weight in Oppoſition thereto.</q> Now this is a ſhameleſs begging the Queſtion; for we are ſo far from allowing him his Principle, or granting it to have any Foundation in the Chriſtian Religion, that we deny it to have any Foundation in Nature; and till he produces better Arguments in ſupport of it, than any we have ſeen yet, we think we ſhould wrong the Truth were we to do otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>THE next Paſſage of this <hi>V.</hi> that ſeems to affect my general Doctrine, is Page 15. of his Anſwer;
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:006120_0070_1027EBE0180F2248"/>where, after having repeated theſe Words of his Adverſary, <q>War was lawful under the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Diſpenſation, and therefore it is lawful under the New,</q> he ſays, <q>Let us ſee how this extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Inference will hold in other Caſes; Burnt-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, Sacrifices, and Circumciſion, were lawful under the Old Teſtament Diſpenſation, are they therefore ſo now?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> But the <hi>V.</hi> ſhould conſider theſe Caſes are nowiſe parallel. Burnt-offerings, Sacrifices and Circumciſion, were typical of the Goſpel Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and were to ceaſe of courſe when that was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtablished. They were Parts of the Ceremonial Law, which was to continue only till the coming of Chriſt, who was to eſtablish a new Law in its Room. This whole Diſpenſation was made up of Types and Shadows, whereof Chriſt was the Subſtance; but when Chriſt came, theſe all neceſſarily vaniſhed: <q>The Nature being finiſhed, there was no farther Need of the rough Draught.</q> But with relation to a neceſſary Self-defence, the Caſe is very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent; if this was lawful under the Old Teſtament, by virtue of the Law of Nature (as I have proved it was) it muſt likewiſe be lawful under the New; not only becauſe there is no Precept there prohibiting it, but becauſe the Grounds and Reaſons thereof are the very ſame now they were then. Sacrifices and Circumciſion are not to be uſed now, becauſe there is no Occaſion for them; but there is as great Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for Defenſive War as ever there was; ſo that <q>tis evident the Caſes are not parallel. The <hi>V.</hi> adds, ut we are farther told, it is certain that God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of, and appointed his People to make War under the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and by the moral Law. The ſixth Commandment doth undoubtedly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a lawful War; for if we muſt not kill others, much leſs ourſelves; and if we muſt have no Hand in our own Death, we muſt defend our
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:006120_0071_1027EBE1A2DB5AE8"/>Life againſt unjuſt Violence, which ſometimes can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be done without War. Now the bleſſed Jeſus never came to deſtroy the moral Law of Nature, but to fulfil it.</q> To which he replies, <q>A poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Precept is made to imply its direct Reverſe; A Command not to kill, is implied to authorize killing.</q> Here we have another Specimen of his Learning and Candour. In the firſt Place he ſpeaks Nonſenſe in Grammar; and in the ſecond he groſly miſrepreſents his Adverſary, and abuſes his Reader, by putting ſuch a Conſtruction on his Words, as they will by no Means admit of. He has no where ſaid, that a Command not to kill, is implied to au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorize Killing; nor can any Thing like it be fairly inferred from his Words. This is a forced and falſe Conſtruction, of the <hi>V</hi>'s own framing; and if it is an Abſurdity, he muſt anſwer for it.</p>
            <p>HIS Adverſary, I dare ſay, never imagined that the ſixth Commandment forbids all Killing, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all Killing that is Murder. And if he thinks ſo, what Opinion muſt he have of Magiſtrates, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally thoſe of his own Friends, who make no more Scruple to kill in their Way than others do? In or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der therefore to do Juſtice to his Adverſary, he ought to have put his Words in their true Light, and then they would have run thus; As the Sixth Commandment forbids Murder, it neceſſarily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies an Authority or Right to kill in a lawful War. And this is ſo far from being an Abſurdity, that I hope it will appear to be an evident Truth. That the Sixth Commandment implies a Defenſive War (and the Author of the Sermon meant no other) I prove thus;</p>
            <p>IF by Virtue of this Command it be a Sin to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy myſelf, it muſt by the Terms be a Duty to preſerve myſelf; and if it be my Duty to preſerve myſelf, it muſt likewiſe be my Duty to defend my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf againſt lawleſs Violence, when I cannot ſecure
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:006120_0072_1027EBE46D67A070"/>my own Preſervation otherwiſe; and if it be my Duty to defend myſelf againſt lawleſs Violence, when I cannot ſecure my own Preſervation other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, it muſt be my Duty to do it by ſuch Means, and in ſuch a Manner, as without which I cannot poſſibly effect it; and if I cannot poſſibly effect it without Defenſive War, it cannot be unlawful to engage in it. But to bring the Argument cloſer ſtill; If by Virtue of this Command, it be a Sin for the Magiſtrate to deſtroy his Subjects, it muſt by the Terms, as well as by Virtue of his Office, be his Duty to protect them; and if it be his Duty to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect them, it muſt be his Duty to defend them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all Injuſtice and Wrong; and if it be his Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to defend them againſt all Injuſtice and Wrong, it muſt be his Duty to do it by ſuch Means, and in ſuch a Manner, as without which it cannot poſſibly be done; and if it cannot poſſibly be done without oppoſing Force to Force, in the Uſe of carnal Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, it cannot be unlawful in him to uſe theſe Means. Nay ſo far is it from being unlawful, that by Virtue of this Command, it muſt be his indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Duty to uſe ſuch Means, when the Preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his innocent Subjects cannot be ſecured with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them. Every Magiſtrate then being bound by virtue of this Command, not only to abſtain from murdering his Subjects, but to uſe all poſſible Means for preſerving their Lives, Liberties, and Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; he is likewiſe bound by virtue of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to engage in a Defenſive War, when this is the only Mean left in his Power for effecting theſe valuable Purpoſes; unleſs it can be made appear that ſuch a War is expreſly prohibited by a Goſpel Precept; which, as I have ſhewn above, cannot be done. From all which we conclude that the Sixth Commandment doth undoubtedly imply Defenſive War.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="56" facs="unknown:006120_0073_1027EBE641555EA0"/>
THE <hi>V.</hi> further adds, <q>I would now aſk, is the moral Command, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill,</hi> beſt fulfill'd or kept by underſtanding the Goſpel to forbid War, or to allow of it?</q> To which I anſwer, by aſking another Queſtion, Is the moral Command, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill,</hi> beſt fulfill'd or kept by under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Goſpel to forbid all capital Puniſhments, or to allow of them? to forbid Magiſtracy, or to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of it? Is the moral Command, <hi>Thou ſhalt not covet,</hi> beſt fulfill'd or kept by thoſe who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Goſpel to forbid Chriſtians to labour for the Meat that periſheth, to take no Thought for Food and Raiment, not to lay up Treaſures upon Earth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or to allow of theſe Things? But the <hi>V.</hi> before we can give a direct Anſwer to his Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, muſt explain his Terms, and tell us what he means by <hi>War;</hi> if he means by this Term, a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Attack upon innocent Men, we anſwer, The moral Precept, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill,</hi> is beſt fulfilled by underſtanding the Goſpel to forbid it; but if by this Term he means a neceſſary Self-defence againſt lawleſs Violence, we anſwer, It is beſt fulfilled by underſtanding the Goſpel to allow it. Nay, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Goſpel to forbid War in the latter Senſe, and act accordingly, when there is a Neceſſity for ſuch a War, is ſo far from being the beſt Way to fulfil this Command, that in the Magiſtrate it muſt be a groſs Violation of it. The beſt Way to fulfil the moral Command, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill,</hi> would be for all Men to underſtand the Goſpel to forbid all Kinds of Injuſtice and Wrong, and to act according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and yet it doth not follow that the Magiſtrate acts contrary to the Goſpel in puniſhing Evil-doers, who do not conform to Goſpel Rules; ſo far from it, that he is bound by virtue of the Goſpel ſo to do, this being one main End of his Office: So that were he to refuſe or neglect it, he would act contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:006120_0074_1027EBEB1EE46E98"/>to this moral Law, which Chriſt came not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy, but to fulfil.</p>
            <p>AS to the <hi>V</hi>'s following Words, <q>Where there is one of thoſe who take it in its firſt Senſe ſlain, are there not many Thouſands of the latter kill'd in the Practice of Fighting?</q> I reply by aſking another Queſtion, Where one of thoſe that look'd upon Chriſtianity as a cunningly devis'd Fable have ſuffer'd, have not many Thouſands been ſlain in maintaining it to be the Power of God unto Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Where there is one of thoſe who take it in its firſt Senſe, ſuffers, are there not many Thouſands of the latter martyr'd in the Profeſſion of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel? Is it therefore wrong to take Chriſtianity in the latter Senſe? And beſides, that ſo few of thoſe who take it in the firſt Senſe, are ſlain, may eaſily be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for; they are like <hi>Solomon</hi>'s prudent Man, who foreſeeing the Evil, hides himſelf. Let the Publick ſink or ſwim, they take Care to keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves out of Harm's Way; they have learnt ſo much of the Wiſdom of the Serpent, as not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe themſelves to Violence and Slaughter, ſo long as there are other heave Men enough to ſcreen them from the Danger; who, like ſome among the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Chriſtians, ſeem to invite Danger as boldly as others ſneakingly ſhun it; being as zealous for their Country, as they were for their Religion: So that a Man muit have a good Command of his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, that can keep his Countenance in reading theſe Words, inſtead of being convinc'd by them, that the Sixth Commandment is beſt fulfill'd by thoſe who underſtand the Goſpel to forbid Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive War.</p>
            <p>
               <q>MORAL Precepts (ſaith the Author of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon) are grounded upon invariable Equity, upon the Nature and Reaſon of Things, and therefore cannot be altered.</q> To which the <hi>V.</hi> replies, <q>Can any Man poſſibly think that War is Part of
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:006120_0075_1027EBEDC1F70570"/>the moral Law?</q> Upon which I remark: I know Nobody that ever ſaid ſo, <hi>viz.</hi> that War is a Part of the moral Law. I have prov'd in the firſt Part of this Treatiſe, that a neceſſary Self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence againſt lawleſs Violence is a Dictate of the Law of Nature, of which the moral Law is a Tranſcript; but neither I not the <hi>A.</hi> of the <hi>S.</hi> have ſo much as inſinuated that it was a Part of that Law, but only a Duty reſulting from it, and imply'd in the Precept, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill.</hi> I have prov'd like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, that as a neceſſary Self-defence againſt a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Enemy, was undoubtedly lawful under the Old Teſtament, it muſt be equally ſo under the New, becauſe the Grounds and Reaſons are the ſame, unleſs it can be made appear, that Chriſt hath by an expreſs Law prohibited it. And I affirm, in anſwer to the Queſtion, that tho' it be no Part of the moral Law, yet it is a Dictate of it, and a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Duty reſulting from it, and therefore will e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be lawful while there is a Neceſſity for it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we can ſuppoſe that God will reverſe the Law of Nature, which is as immutable as his own Being.</p>
            <p>The <hi>V.</hi> farther adds, <q>Now (ſaith the Sermon) if the Almighty has approved of War formerly, and there is ſtill the ſame Neceſſity of it under the Goſpel Diſpenſation as before, it will follow that it is equally lawful now. It is abſurd to ſuppoſe that the bleſſed God, who is infinite in Wiſdom, and unalterable in his Nature, would determine contrarily at different Periods of Time, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Caſe that is ſubſtantially the ſame.</q>
            </p>
            <p>TO which he replies, <q>If this Manner of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proves any Thing, it proves Offenſive War as lawful as Defenſive. God approv'd of the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> taking away the Poſſeſſions of many Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he commanded them to deſtroy ſome utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; is it therefore equally lawful to do ſo now, whether we have his Command or not? The
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:006120_0076_1027EBF080B4D110"/>War that he approv'd of formerly, was underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by his Counſel and Direction.</q> Upon which I remark, That the <hi>V.</hi> miſrepreſents his Adverſary here again, when he ſays, <q>He commanded them to deſtroy ſome utterly;</q> whereas his Adverſary doth not ſo much as inſinuate, thro' the whole Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph, that God commanded War, but only that he approv'd of it: So that the War the <hi>V.</hi> inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth in, is not a ſimilar Caſe. God's approving of ſome War formerly, which he did not command, is the Author's Argument, and is all that was neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to infer his Concluſion, <hi>viz.</hi> that Defenſive War is lawful under the Goſpel. But to gain the Aſſent of his ignorant Readers, the <hi>V.</hi> puts ſuch Words in his Adverſary's Mouth, as will beſt ſuit his own Turn, and then exults as if he had the better of the Argument. <q>God commanded the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> ſays he, to deſtroy ſome utterly, is it therefore equally lawful to do ſo now?</q> Which Queſtion is quite impertinent, as being grounded on a falſe Suppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as if his Adverſary had ſaid, 'If the Almighty has commanded War formerly, <hi>&amp;c.'</hi> whereas he ſays no ſuch Thing: His Words are, <q>If the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty has approv'd of War formerly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> He likewiſe repreſents him as arguing in Defence of War without Diſtinction, which is another Specimen of his Candour: Whereas he is arguing only for the Lawfulneſs of Defenſive War, as is evident from the Title and whole Tenor of the Sermon, and which this <hi>V.</hi> could not be ignorant of. How then he could ſay, <q>That his Manner of arguing, if it prov'd any Thing, would prove Offenſive War as lawful as Defenſive,</q> can never be accounted for to his Credit: For 'tis evident to every Body that can diſcover a true Syllogiſm from a bare-fac'd Sophiſm, that it is otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>THE Author's Words reduc'd into Form (the beſt Way to detect falſe Reaſoning) will ſtand thus,
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:006120_0077_1027EBF43AD47490"/>If the Almighty has approved of Defenſive War formerly, becauſe it was a neceſſary Means under Divine Providence to protect innocent Men from the lawleſs Attacks of foreign Enemies; Defenſive War was undoubtedly lawful, becauſe he can ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of nothing that is not ſo: But Defenſive War is as neceſſary, in the Hand of Divine Providence, to protect innocent Men from the lawleſs Attacks of foreign Enemies, under the Goſpel Diſpenſation, as it was formerly, <hi>ergo</hi> Defenſive War is lawful un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel. But if what the <hi>V.</hi> ſays be true, <hi>viz.</hi> 'That the <hi>A</hi>'s Manner of arguing proves Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive War as lawful as Defenſive,' his Argument re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd into Form, will ſtand thus; If the Almighty has approv'd of Defenſive War formerly, becauſe it was neceſſary, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Defenſive War was then law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; but Defenſive War is as neceſſary under the Goſpel as formerly, therefore Offenſive War is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful under the Goſpel. Here is a Concluſion inferr'd that is not to be found in the Premiſes. The Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the Premiſes is, <hi>War Defenſive,</hi> the Subject of the Concluſion is, <hi>War Offenſive.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Suppoſe the Vindicator were to argue in Defence of Divine Revelation, thus; If God Almighty ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd of Revelation formerly, and there is ſtill the ſame Neceſſity of it now, it will follow, that it is equally lawful now. And ſuppoſe ſome one ſhould reply, this Manner of arguing proves <hi>Judaiſm</hi> as lawful as Chriſtianity: God commanded the <hi>Jews</hi> to keep Faſts, and obſerve Holy-days, to offer Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, and worſhip in the Temple; is it therefore equally lawful to do ſo now, whether we have God's Command or not? How would the <hi>V.</hi> like this Manner of arguing? Would he allow that the Argument (proving Divine Revelation to be lawful now, from the Divine Approbation of it formerly) proves <hi>Judaiſm</hi> as lawful as Chriſtianity? Or the Temple Service, as the ſpiritual Worſhip of the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi>
               <pb n="61" facs="unknown:006120_0078_1027EBF5CA0195A0"/>Meetings? Would he not think it his Duty to wipe off ſo foul an Aſperſion, by detecting and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the Sophiſtry and Falſhood of his Adverſary's Reaſoning, and proving his own to be right, if not miſrepreſented? which he might do, thus; If the Almighty has approv'd of Revelation formerly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was neceſſary to teach Men their Duty more clearly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it follows, that it was lawful; but there is the ſame Neceſſity now for Revelation there was formerly; <hi>ergo</hi> Revelation is now lawful. This would be a fair Concluſion from the Premiſes, and the only one which in Truth could be inferr'd from them. How would he then like to be told; No, this is not the true Inference from your Argument; the true Inference from your Argument is, <hi>Erga Judaiſm,</hi> and the whole <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Ritual is now law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. Now this would be juſt ſuch Meaſure as he metes to his Adverſary on this Point. The native Inference from his Adverſary's Premiſes, as I have ſhewn, is this; <hi>Ergo</hi> Defenſive War is lawful un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel. But the <hi>V.</hi> tells him no, the Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence from his Argument is this; <hi>Ergo</hi> not only Offenſive War, but ſuch as was that againſt the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Nations, is now lawful. For your Manner of arguing, ſays he, not only proves Offenſive War, but ſuch a War as that which the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> made upon the Seven Nations at God's Command, as lawful as Defenſive.</p>
            <p>THE Author's Argument being thus clear'd from the <hi>V</hi>'s falſe Repreſentation, the inſulting Queſtion, <hi>Is it therefore equally lawful to do ſo now, whether we have his Command or not?</hi> which he propoſes with ſuch an Air of Victory, ſhamefully recoils upon himſelf, as being no ways inferrable from the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Adverſary, but is the meer Creature of his own Invention.</p>
            <p>
               <q>THE War, ſays the <hi>V.</hi> that he approved of formerly, was undertaken by his Counſel and
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:006120_0079_1027EBF8784263B8"/>Direction.</q> Here we have another Specimen of his Sophiſtry. What doth he mean by <hi>the War?</hi> This Propoſition, tho' literally true, yet is nothing to his Purpoſe; which is to prove that God never approv'd of any War but what was undertaken by his Counſel and Direction. <hi>The War,</hi> if it can mean any Thing, muſt mean the War with the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Nations; and this no doubt God approv'd of, becauſe he commanded it; but what is this to the Purpoſe of confuting his Adverſary, or proving that his Manner of arguing proves Offenſive War as lawful as Defenſive? Doth it follow, that becauſe God approv'd of this particular War which was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken by his Command, that he never approv'd of any that was undertaken without his Command? By no Means. If the <hi>V.</hi> had intended to prove by theſe Words, that his Adverſary's Manner of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prov'd ſuch a War as that againſt the Seven Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as lawful as a Defenſive which he would fain do if poſſible) he ſhould have form'd them thus; Whatever War God approv'd of formerly, was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken by his Command, or in his own equivoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Words, <hi>by his Counſel and Direction.</hi> Then he would have ſaid ſomething to his Purpoſe, could he have prov'd it, and might have told the World with a much better Grace, that his Adverſary's Manner of arguing proves Offenſive War as lawful as Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive. But if he cannot do this, the leaſt Attonement he can make, for abuſing his Author, and impoſing upon the World evident Falſhoods inſtead of Truths, is to beg God's Pardon, and confeſs his Ignorance; or elſe frankly own the true Reaſon of ſuch wretched Quibbling and Prevarication.</p>
            <p>BUT to clear this Matter further ſtill, I will now prove, for this <hi>V</hi>'s Conviction, or Confutation, from two Inſtances, that the Almighty approv'd of ſome Wars formerly, which were not undertaken by his
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:006120_0080_1027EBFA1A9B5338"/>Command, or, as the <hi>V.</hi> himſelf expreſſes it, by his Counſel and Direction.</p>
            <p n="1">1. THE Patriarch <hi>Abraham,</hi> as we read, <hi>Gen.</hi> xiv. 15. made War upon the four Kings for recovering his beloved Friend and Kinſman <hi>Lot;</hi> which tho' not directly in his own Defence, yet it was <hi>Tantamount,</hi> as being grounded on the ſame Principles of Reaſon and Equity; which I prove thus; <q>If a Man has a Right to defend himſelf, and what is his, againſt the Violence of a lawleſs Invader, he may certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly endeavour to recover what has been by any kind of Violence or Villainy taken from him; for as the Power to take any thing from another, gives no Right to it, it follows, that the Right to that which has been taken from its Owner, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Will, remains ſtill where it was; he may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Now <hi>Abraham</hi> had no ſpecial Commiſſion from God to undertake this War: Here was no Divine Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel nor Direction out of the ordinary Courſe of Providence; and yet it was approv'd of by God, as appears from Verſe 19. <hi>Melchiſedeck,</hi> who was Prieſt of the moſt High God, bloſſed God for the Victory; which, had the Undertaking been unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, he certainly would not have done.</p>

2. ANOTHER Inſtance of the like Nature we have in <hi>Exodus</hi> xvii. 9. There we find how <hi>Moſes</hi> commanded the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to fight the <hi>Amalekites</hi> in their own Defence, who with armed Violence op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd their Paſſage into the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> and it doth not appear that in this he conſulted God at all. Now here is another Inſtance of a War that was not undertaken by God's Counſel and Direction, and yet was approved of by him, as we learn from Verſe 14. <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto Moſes, write this for a Memorial in a Book, and rehearſe it in the Ears of Joſhua.</hi> That theſe Wars were agreeable to the Law of Nature, is evident from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>nce, that God approved of them, tho' undertaken with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his ſpecial Command; for he can no more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of any thing contrary to this, than he can change his own Being, or take away all Diſtinction between moral Good and Evil. Things which are morally Evil (and ſuch are all Things contrary to the Law of Nature) can never be an Object of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Approbation, but muſt neceſſarily be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by him; the eternal and neceſſary Rectitude of his Nature requires it. Theſe Wars were Defenſive, or <hi>Tantamount,</hi> as I obſerved above; the latter was undertaken by the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to defend themſelves from the Violence of an Enemy, that by Force of Arms oppos'd their Paſſage into their own Land; the former was undertaken by <hi>Abraham,</hi> to recover his diſtreſs'd Friend and Kinſman, and his miſerable Family, from a lawleſs Enemy, that had taken them Captives. Now if ſuch a War was lawful then (as appears it was) there being the ſame Neceſſity ſtill for Self-defence, it will follow, that Self-defence is equally lawful now, unleſs a Law of the Goſpel can be produc'd which expreſly forbids it.</p>
            <p>THERE IS a manifeſt Difference between God's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving thoſe Wars that were undertaken by good Men, having no other Warrant for ſo doing than
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:006120_0082_1027EC0079FCFC68"/>the bare Law of Nature; and thoſe that were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken by his ſpecial Command. The firſt were undertaken becauſe they were agreeable to the Law of Nature, antecedent to all poſitive Precepts whatſoever, and therefore were approved of by God; but the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>tter were only lawful becauſe God commanded them. He being the abſolute Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign of the Univerſe, and the rightful Proprietor of all his Creatures, may juſtly diſpoſe of them to whom, and in what Manner, he pleaſes. 'Tis true God cannot diſſolve the Obligation of the preceptive Law of Nature, or change the Natures of Good and Evil. For altho' he be omnipotent, yet we muſt always ſuppoſe his infinite Power to be conjoin'd with infinite Goodneſs, elſe it is no Divine Power; and therefore, <hi>Poſſe malum, non eſt poſſe; i. e.</hi> It is no Power but Weakneſs to do Evil <note n="*" place="bottom">See Preface, Page 7.</note>. Nevertheleſs, God may alter the Properties of thoſe Things from whence the Reſpects of Good and Evil do reſult, as in the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> deſtroying ſome Nations utterly, and taking away their Poſſeſſions, which God may juſtly do, by virtue of his abſolute Dominion; but the Change here is not in the Obligation of the Law, but in the Things themſelves. Murder would be an intrinſical Evil ſtill, but that which was done by an immediate and explicit Command from God, was no Murder. Robbery had been a Sin ſtill, but taking Things alienated from their Properties by God himſelf, was not Robbery. And moreover, the Nations upon whom he commanded the <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites</hi> to make War, and deſtroy ſome of them utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſpoil them of their Poſſeſſions, had by their Wickedneſs forfeited all to the Sovereign Proprietor of the whole World; who might therefore juſtly take them away by whatever Inſtruments he pleaſed; and as he thought proper to make Uſe of the <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites</hi> for that Purpoſe, they did no Wrong in taking away their Poſſeſſions, and deſtroying many of them
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:006120_0083_1027EC031DBC9068"/>utterly, becauſe they did only what God commanded them, which, to have refa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>, it would never have been approved of by him, becauſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were under a <hi>Theocracy;</hi> God himſelf was their King and Sovereign in a more peculiar Manner than to any other People.

            <p>He further adds, <q>The latter Part of the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph does not belong to the Argument, unleſs it is firſt prov'd, either that People Now-a-days have the expreſs Command of God to go to War:— Or that he hath determined Man to be a ſufficient Judge when it is ſuitable, and when not.</q>

            <p>TO which I reply: The firſt Part of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark is falſe, as ſufficiently appears from what I have ſaid above; and the latter Part is already anſwered. For I have prov'd, to the Conviction of every un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudic'd Reader, that Defenſive War is agreeable to the Law of Nature, and not contrary to the Goſpel, notwithſtanding the want of an expreſs Command of God. From whence it will follow, that while Man, by the Exerciſe of his rational Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, can diſtinguiſh between Right and Wrong, Happineſs and Miſery, he will be a ſufficient Judge when ſuch a War is ſuitable, and when not.</p>
            <p>THE Author of the Sermon ſays farther; <q>Can we think that God would approve of any Practice formerly, that was contrary to the moral Law? Well, if a juſt War was not contrary to the moral Law under the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Diſpenſation, and before it, why ſhould it be ſo now in the like Circumſtances of Neceſſity?</q> To which the <hi>V.</hi> replies, <q>I have already obſerved, that the Almighty's enjoining and approving of ſome Wars formerly, does not authorize any Wars begun and carried on at the meer Will and Pleaſure of Men. The like Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Neceſſity muſt be when we have the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine

               </gap>biting it. That the Goſpel prohibits all unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Wars, as it does all other unlawful Actions, we readily grant; but it no more follows from hence, that all Manner of War is unlawful under the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, than that all Manner of Actions are ſo; for as ſome Actions are lawful, notwithſtanding there are a great many unlawful; ſo ſome Wars may be juſt, not withſtanding the many unjuſt Wars that are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on in the World; and tho' theſe be prohibited by the Goſpel, as all other unjuſt Actions are, yet it does not appear that thoſe are prohibited any farther, than as they exceed the Bounds of Juſtice and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity; and then 'tis only the Abuſe that is prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited, but not the Uſe. <q>The bleſſed Jeſus (ſaith the <hi>V.</hi>) hath taught ſome Chriſtians, both by the immediate Dictates of his Spirit, and Expreſſion of his Will, when perſonally upon Earth, that the beſt Way to keep the Commandments, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill,</hi> and, <hi>Thou ſhall love thy Neighbour,</hi> is not to harbour any Ill-will or Revenge againſt any, but to love Enemies.</q> I will add, by way of Remark, That the bleſſed Jeſus hath taught, not ſome, but all Chriſtians, I ſhall not ſay, by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:006120_0087_1027EC0D79779028"/>Dictates of his Spirit (becauſe they who ſay ſo, aſſert more than they can prove, unleſs by the immediate Dictates of his Spirit they mean the holy Scriptures) but by the Expreſſion of his Will in the Goſpel, that the beſt Way to keep theſe Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, is not to harbour any Ill-will or Revenge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any, but to love Enemies. And, without Doubt, all who deſerve the Name of Chriſtians, will acknowledge this, as well as this <hi>V.</hi> and, I doubt not, are as ready to practiſe it in its true and proper Senſe. But how does this Argument prove the Unlawfulneſs of Self-defence againſt the lawleſs Violence of a foreign Enemy? Becauſe it is every Chriſtian's Duty to harbour no Ill-will or Revenge againſt any, doth it therefore follow, that it is the Duty of the Magiſtrate to ſuffer a foreign Invader to deſtroy himſelf and his Subjects, without any Reſiſtance? Or, in other Words, That 'tis unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for the Magiſtrate to defend himſelf, and his Subjects, againſt the lawleſs Violence of a foreign Enemy? By the ſame Argument, he ought to bear with the moſt villainous Outrages of Cut-throats and Rebels among his own Subjects, becauſe this will be the beſt Way to keep the Commandments, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill,</hi> and, <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,</hi> by not harbouring any Ill-will or Revenge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any, but loving of Enemies. But may not the Chriſtian Magiſtrate defend himſelf and his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects againſt a foreign Enemy, without harbouring Ill-will and Revenge againſt any, as well as put to Death a notorious Criminal, who cannot be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd without manifeſt Danger to the Community? And if ſo, why ſuch a mighty Out cry againſt a Defenſive War, as if it could not be undertaken without the manifeſt Violation of the Sixth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, and the Precept of Chriſt, to harbour no Ill-will or Revenge againſt any, but to love E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, when 'tis evident the Caſe is quite other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe?
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:006120_0088_1027EC105010E658"/>For if the Magiſtrate may put to Death a notorious Malefactor, who cannot be preſerv'd without manifeſt Danger to the Publick, and yet not be chargeable with any Violation of theſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, he may likewiſe, without being guilty of any Violation of theſe Commandments, ſtrenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly defend himſelf and his innocent Subjects a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the lawleſs Violence of a foreign Invader, when the Ruin of the Publick cannot be prevented without it. This <hi>V.</hi> ſhould diſtinguiſh between War Offenſive and Defenſive (but this would have diſſerv'd his Purpoſe) and even between the Uſe and the Abuſe of the latter. I acknowledge that even a Defenſive War may be abus'd, when Men, in the Management of it, exceed the Bounds of Juſtice and Humanity; but this is no Argument againſt the Lawfulneſs of it, but only of the Perverſeneſs of Mankind, who are too apt to abuſe the beſt Things of Providence. Chriſtianity has been abus'd by bad Men to very ill Purpoſes, and yet I hope Nobody will ſay, that therefore the Profeſſion of Chriſtianity is unlawful. Chriſtianity forbids Injury and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, and enjoins the Love of Enemies (ſays the <hi>V.</hi>) and therefore 'tis unlawful for Chriſtians to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themſelves againſt a foreign Enemy. Now the ſame Argument will prove it unlawful for the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Magiſtrate to reſiſt a domeſtick Traitor, or the moſt outrageous Villain whatſoever; for if Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to them can be managed wholly without theſe Crimes, and conſiſtent with Chriſt's Precept of lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Enemies, ſo may likewiſe Reſiſtance to a foreign Enemy. If it cannot, and yet Reſiſtance to them be acknowledged lawful, ſo likewiſe may Reſiſtance to foreign Invaders, notwithſtanding the ſame Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs. Let them look to it who are guilty of theſe Crimes. This can no more hinder honeſt Men from defending themſelves, or from making their Advantages of the Crimes of others in their
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:006120_0089_1027EC120A69C198"/>own Self-defence in one Caſe, than it is allowed to do in another.</p>
            <p>BUT it is a very unaccountable Thing, in my Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to ſuppoſe that a People cannot join together, with the Conſent, and by the Authority of the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Magiſtrate, in defending themſelves againſt a foreign Enemy, without any ſuch Crimes. For there is nothing neceſſary to this, that I know of, that requires either Revenge, Hatred, or Injury, in the true Senſe of theſe Terms, or any Thing but an inoffenſive and juſtifiable Way of proceeding. If any other Methods have been uſed in carrying on ſuch Wars, this will only reflect upon the Perſons who have made Uſe of them, not upon the Juſtice of the Wars themſelves. Hence will appear the Impertinency of this <hi>V</hi>'s elaborate Harangue, Page 39. where he ſays, <q>If every particular Member of the Church be forbidden Revenge, it is becauſe allowing of it would manifeſt a want of Patience and Fortitude to endure, and encourage Envy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſurely then this Reaſon is much ſtronger for forbidding national and publick Revenge.</q> All which is <hi>gratis dictum</hi> ſtill, becauſe the Practice, for the Lawfulneſs of which we are contending, implies no ſuch Idea. We grant that the Goſpel forbids Revenge, both private and publick; Doth it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore follow, that it forbids Self-defence? Or, in other Words, doth it therefore follow, that a neceſſary Self-defence is unlawful, when this can be done without Revenge? Let this <hi>V.</hi> prove, that an affectionate Father cannot defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf againſt an unnatural Child attempting to cut his Throat, without Revenge; or that a pious Prince cannot defend his innocent Subjects from a foreign Invader, without a malicious Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Revenge and Injury in the proper Senſe of theſe Terms; and then his Argument will ſignify ſomething, otherwiſe 'tis quite impertinent, and wholly
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:006120_0090_1027EC16D53B9F88"/>foreign to the Point in debate. But then he tells us further: <q>A Prohibition of Injuries, and a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to endure them, muſt be conſider'd as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative to the Conſequence if allow'd: A ſmall In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury is attended with a Degree of Injuſtice, and the enduring it rather than returning it, ſhews, in ſome Degree, a Chriſtian Diſpoſition. Now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that Conſequence with reſpect to greater, the enduring of them, rather than returning Evil for Evil, doth certainly ſhew a greater Degree of that Meekneſs and Lowlineſs of Heart, which Chriſt taught his Diſciples to learn of him.</q> Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which I muſt remark, in the firſt Place, That this ſophiſtical Argument reflects a moſt egregious Calumny on the Chriſtian Religion, repreſenting it as neceſſarily laying Chriſtians open to all the villain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Outrages the vileſt Part of Mankind think fit to offer them. For by the ſame Argument it may be prov'd unlawful to reſiſt a Robber or a Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throat, becauſe the enduring of their injurious Treatment, rather than returning Evil for Evil, ſhews a Chriſtian Diſpoſition, and a very great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of that Meekneſs and Lowlineſs of Heart, which Chriſt taught his Diſciples to learn of him. By the ſame Argument it may be prov'd unlawful for a Chriſtian Prince to quell a dangerous Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, or to reſiſt a Cabal of rebellious Subjects, who have ſworn Deſtruction to him and the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, becauſe the enduring ſuch Injury and Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, rather than returning Evil for Evil, ſhews a Chriſtian Diſpoſition in him, and a great Degree of that Meekneſs and Lowlineſs of Heart, which Chriſt taught his Diſciples to learn of him. And if it be ſaid that the Chriſtian Religion allows the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate to regard the publick Good, then it muſt conſequently be allowed lawful for him to defend the Publick from lawleſs Violence; unleſs a Regard for the publick Good can be conſiſtent with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:006120_0091_1027D91B9E4592A0"/>of the Publick. But the true State of this Caſe, in ſhort, can amount to no more than this, that Chriſtianity obliges Men to ſuffer pat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>ly, when they cannot by any lawful M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ans prevent it. The Point therefore this <hi>V.</hi> muſt prove, is this; That Self-defence againſt a foreign Invader, when other Methods fail, is an unlawful Method for People to take in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to prevent their own Ruin. Or, that tho' the Chriſtian Religion hath allowed the Chriſtian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate to defend himſelf and his innocent Subjects from Robbers and Cut-throats in private Caſes, it hath abſolutely condemned it in all Caſes againſt a foreign Invader, tho' this be much more neceſſary for the ſame good End. To prove this, would do Service to a Cauſe which I hope the <hi>V.</hi> hath not much at Heart, but would by no Means be for the Honour of the Chriſtian Rengion. But to tell us that Chriſtianity obliges us to bear Injuries, can be no Argument at all againſt our Doctrine; we are as ready to acknowledge this as this <hi>V.</hi> The Queſtion is, how far it obliges us to do ſo? And that every Man, who hath not renounced his Reaſon, or maſk'd it with a Vizor of Hypocriſy, will own, is no farther than they cannot prevent it by lawful and honourable Means. And if it can be ſhewn, that Self-defence in all Caſes is condemn'd in the Goſpel, this muſt be the Argument againſt it taken from Chriſtianity, and not that it obliges us to bear Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; for this it may do, and yet allow of Self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, in Caſes of publick Concern, as well as in ſome Caſes of private Concern.</p>
            <p>AS to the Paſſages of Scripture from whence the <hi>V.</hi> infers his Argument, I have ſufficiently examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them in the firſt Part of this Treatiſe, and ſhewn, that they neceſſarily require a Limitation, and that it can be no more ſhewn from thoſe Expreſſions, that no Caſes are to be excepted in the interpreting theſe Texts, than it can be from the like general
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:006120_0092_1027EC1D45A140F0"/>Expreſſions us'd in other Places, that other Texts can admit of no Reſtrictions, which yet are allowed on all Hands to require a limited Interpretation.</p>
            <p>We are forbid in unlimited Terms to reſiſt Evil, but no where forbid to defend ourſelves; we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined in unlimited Terms to love our Enemies, but this cannot imply a total Neglect of ourſelves; we are required likewiſe in unlimited Terms to pray for our Enemies, but this doth not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply that we are to pray in an unlimited Manner for them, any more than our Obligation to return them Bleſſing for Curſing implies in it a Neceſſity of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for their worldly Proſperity to our own Deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. We are required in general Terms to pray for all Men, but we are left to common Senſe to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us that Charity begins at Home, and that we are not obliged to pray for their Succeſs or Life, if it be inconſiſtent with our own, or to prefer the temporal Good of any Perſon, before the Happineſs of others in whom we are more nearly concerned.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>V.</hi> further obſerves; <q>That according to the Reaſon given by Chriſt himſelf, immediately after theſe Precepts, they muſt certainly intend a Prohibition of all Injury and Revenge, or elſe the Compariſon is not very proper; <hi>That ye may be the Children of your Father in Heaven,</hi> &amp;c.</q> Which Obſervation is equally impertinent with his former; becauſe the Practice we plead for, implies neither Injury nor Revenge, ſtrictly ſo called. And further; If it be unlawful for a Chriſtian Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to defend themſelves againſt a foreign Enemy, becauſe we are to imitate our heavenly Father, who diſpenſes his temporal Bleſſings upon the moſt pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly prophane <note n="*" place="bottom">I pray the <hi>V.</hi> to put theſe Words into the Mouth of a Criminal, and then conſider the Conſequence of them.

But it is a ſad Thing to find Men endeavouring to repreſent the Chriſtian Religion, as throwing off all Care for the Happineſs of human Society, and to look upon themſelves, becauſe Chriſtians, as uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd for their Families, Neighbours, and Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, at a Time when there is the greateſt Call for ſuch a Concern: This muſt make Strangers to it, apt to believe it an Enemy, and not a Friend, to human Society.</p>
            <p>BUT further, the Argument againſt Self-defence taken from theſe Words, <hi>That ye may be the Children of your Father which is in Heaven,</hi> is not only inconclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, but ill grounded; and is ſo far from being in ſavour of the <hi>V.</hi> that it makes directly againſt him. We are commanded to love our Enemies by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of God himſelf, who maketh his Sun to riſe on the Evil, and on the Good, and ſendeth Rain on the Juſt, and on the Unjuſt, and yet the ſame God puts a manifeſt Difference between them; ſome he

               </gap> in Store much heavier Judgments in the next. Tho' God be full of Patience and Long-ſuffering, yet the Scripture every where declares his Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Wrath againſt obſtinate Sinners, of which the Magiſtrate is declared by St. <hi>Paul</hi> to be the Miniſter, <hi>Rom.</hi> xiii. 4. And Chriſt himſelf being provok'd by the Obſtinacy of the <hi>Jews,</hi> is ſaid by a Parable, to ſend out his Army, and to burn up their City, which was accordingly fulfilled in Fact. So that tho' it be the Duty of Chriſtians not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taliate Injury and Revenge, that they may be the Children of their heavenly Father, who is good to the Unthankful and the Wicked, it will not follow that 'tis unlawful for the Magiſtrate (who is God's Miniſter to execute Vengeance, or inflict Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on them that do Evil) to defend with the Sword of Juſtice his Innocent Subjects againſt the lawleſs Violence of wicked Men; becauſe at the ſame Time that he doth this, he may imitate his heavenly Father, who tho' he be kind to the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankful and Wicked, yet declares his Indignation and Wrath againſt obſtinate Sinners, both in this Life and the next. Now from what hath been ſaid on theſe Remarks, let any reaſonable Man judge, whether our Saviour can be ſuppos'd in theſe Paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, wherein he prohibits all Injury and Revenge, to put the Caſe of a foreign Invaſion, or that we ſhould love Ruſſians and Cut-throats in ſuch a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as not to defend the Publick from their Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, left in this Attempt they ſhould chance to loſe their Lives. And I muſt likewiſe ſubmit it to the Judgment of every intelligent Reader, whether what the <hi>V.</hi> ſays in the latter Part of his Paragraph, Page 40. be not partly impertinent, and partly falſe.

And as for the Evils that may accidentally happen to the Aggreſſor, we cannot properly be ſaid to be the Authors of them; becauſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> who begins the Violence, is the true Cauſe of all that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows; and whatever falls upon him, by the Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:006120_0096_1027EC28890D5260"/>made by the defending Party, is but the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of his own Act; or, as I ſaid above, it is that Violence, of which he is the Author, reflected back upon himſelf.</p>
            <p>THE Practice therefore we plead for, being the Act of the ſupreme Magiſtrate, comes up to the Almighty's univerſal Beneficence as a Compariſon; who, notwithſtanding this, doth by no Means clear the Guilty: And thus it appears that the <hi>V</hi>'s Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion is as falſe, as his Premiſes are impertinent.</p>
            <p>Again: The Author of the Sermon endeavours to prove, that the Office of the Magiſtrate neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily evinces the Lawfulneſs of Defenſive War; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the <hi>V.</hi> makes this Remark; <q>Whenever the Magiſtrate is convinced that the Doctrines of Chriſtianity forbid War, it will be as much his Duty, as any other Man's, to render Obedience to thoſe Doctrines;</q> 
               <hi>i. e.</hi> in other Words, to act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Convictions. To which I reply: I ſeems very unaccountable how any Man can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that 'tis lawful to be a Magiſtrate, who is the ſame time convinced of the Unlawfulneſs of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive War. For if it be the indiſpenſible Duty of the Magiſtrate to protect the Lives and Liberties of the Subjects, and if this cannot, at ſome times, be done, without oppoſing Force to Force, I would aſk this <hi>V.</hi> How that Man can be ſaid to do his Duty, or act a conſiſtent Part, who, undertaking the Office of a Magiſtrate, is bound in Conſcience to deny that to the Publick, which at Times is the moſt valuable and neceſſary End of his Office? He muſt either allow, that it is not the Magiſtrate's Duty to protect the Lives and Liberties of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects from unjuſt Violence, which I believe he will hardly venture to do; or elſe, that every Man, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipled againſt Self-defence, undertaking the Office of a Magiſtrate, acts ſuch a Part as no honeſt Man can juſtify. The <hi>V.</hi> ſhould have ſaid, which would
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:006120_0097_1027EC2A11E78EA0"/>have been much more for his Credit, Whenever a Man is convinced that the Doctrines of Chriſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid Defenſive War, it will be his indiſpenſible Duty to refuſe the Office of a Magiſtrate (at leaſt to act in the legiſlative Part of Government, whoſe Province it is to concert proper Meaſures for the Defence of the Publick; leaving this Office to thoſe, who can comply with all the Ends of it with a ſafe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
            <p>But further: <note n="*" place="bottom">See Preface, Page 11.</note> I look upon it to be a prepoſterous Way of arguing, that becauſe a Man is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the Lawfulneſs of any Practice evidently requiſite for the Good of human Society, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is his Duty to omit it; this is making a Man's Faith or Perſwa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

'Tis true the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Whatſoever is not of Faith is Sin;</hi> but he doth not mean thoſe moral Duties which are diſcoverable by the meaneſt Mortal, that has the Exerciſe of Reaſon; but ſuch as ariſe from doubtful Speculations, the Practice or Omiſſion whereof, hath no other Evil in them, than as they give Scandal or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ſſence to weak Brethren. But to maintain, that every Man's Perſwaſion or Opinion is to be the Rule of his moral Duty, as this <hi>V.</hi> doth, both here, and where he ſays, <q>If any ſincere Chriſtian under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands it to be his Duty not to make any Defence at all, his refuſing to uſe any, will never incur Guilt,</q> is, in my Opinion, of dangerous Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. One of the great Ends of Society is mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Defence againſt Injuries; every Member there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is obliged by the Law of Nature, whereby he is bound to obſerve Compacts, and fulfil Promiſes, to contribute his Share in Defence of the Publick; this is as indiſpenſible a Duty on every Member of civil Society, as Obedience to Parents, or Subjection to Magiſtrates. 'Tis a Duty, the Obligation to which no Law can diſpenſe with, nor can any Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:006120_0098_1027EC2B9AC2E808"/>whatſoever excuſe the Neglect of it. Let a Man pretend to what Spirit he will, his underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to be his Duty to omit what both Reaſon and Revelation demonſtrate to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Sin for him to omit, <hi>viz.</hi> Protection, if he be a Magiſtrate, and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, if a Subject (beſides the Obligation he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, by the Law of Nature, to keep lawful Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacts, and fulfil lawful Promiſes) will undoubtedly incur Guilt, whatever this <hi>V.</hi> may fondly imagine to the contrary. By this Manner of arguing, Men may plead for the greateſt Villainies. <hi>Ravillac</hi> underſtood it to be his Duty, and a very meritorious Act, to kill <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, becauſe he favoured Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks; Did he therefore by this villainous Aſſaſſina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion incur no Guilt? The Enthuſiaſts and Fanaticks of <hi>Munſter</hi> underſtood it to be their Duty to deſtroy their Magiſtrates, in order to make way for Chriſt's Kingdom, he Eſtabliſhment whereof, they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd, would be obſtructed by theſe earthly Powers; Did therefore their actual riſing in Arms againſt their lawful Magiſtrates incur no Guilt? And even as to Caſes of Omiſſion, if a Subject underſtands it to be his Duty not to obey the lawful Commands of the ſupream or ſovereign Power of the Commonwealth, will he therefore incur no Guilt, when the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>That he ſhall thereby receive to himſelf Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi> If a Chriſtian underſtands it to be his Duty, from ſome miſtaken Paſſages of Scripture, not to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for the Meat that periſheth, and thereby ſtarve himſelf and his Family, will he therefore incur no Guilt? If a Man ſhould underſtand it to be his Duty to betake himſelf to a monaſtick Life, and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on abandon his Family, and retire to a Convent, will he therefore incur no Guilt?</p>
            <p>IF the Magiſtrate, the very End of whoſe Office it is to preſerve and protect Mens Lives and Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, underſtands it to be his Duty not to inflict Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment on Evil-doers, notwithſtanding this be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſibly
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:006120_0099_1027EC54410AD880"/>neceſſary for the publick Security, will he therefore incur no Guilt? And finally, If all the Subjects of a Commonwealth, who are bound, by the Laws of God and Nature, to do every Thing that is lawful, and in their Power, for preſerving and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting the Good of the Community, underſtand it to be their Duty to omit a Practice, which at a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Time is the only Means under God to preſerve the Community from Ruin, will they therefore incur no Guilt? Whence I think it plainly appears, that this Way of arguing is not only groundleſs and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, as deſtroying the true Foundation of all moral Duties, but a moſt dangerous Error, and would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer moſt dreadful, yet neceſſary, Conſequences <note n="*" place="bottom">This farther explained, Preface, Pages 11, 12, &amp;c.</note>.</p>
            <p>THE next Paſſage in this Vindicator's Anſwer to the Sermon, which ſeores to affect the general Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine I have eſtabliſhed, is, Page 33. where he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks on that Propheſy of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ii. 4. which ſays, <hi>And be ſhall judge among the Nations, and ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke many People, and they ſhall beat their Swords into Plowſhares, and their Spears into Pruning-books,</hi> &amp;c. Which Propheſy can no more prove the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulneſs of Defenſive War, ſo long as there ſhall be Occaſion for it, than it will prove the Non-obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of keeping a ſucking Child from playing with a Viper, or the Non-neceſſity of keeping a Lamb from a Lion, becauſe the ſame Propheſy tells us, that at the very Time when Men ſhall beat their Swords into Plowſhares, and their Spears into Pruning-hooks, <hi>The Lamb and the Lion ſhall lie down together, and the ſucking Child ſhall play with the Baſiliſk.</hi> It can prove nothing but this, That whenever that Propheſy ſhall be fulfilled, which we believe will be at the Converſion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> then all War will ceaſe, an univerſal Peace being ſpread over the Nations.

This is not a Propheſy of the Goſpel-Diſpenſation in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, but only of ſomething that ſhall come to paſs in a certain Period of that Diſpenſation. It only tells us what the State of Chriſtians will be, as to this Point, when it ſhall be fulfilled; but not what their Duty is, with regard to it before; Only what ſhall be done in a certain Period of the Goſpel Oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, but not what muſt be done before that Period comes.

               </gap> to in the Text under Conſideration, hath never been yet, but is ſtill future, is as evident to all rational Men, who are well acquainted with Church-Hiſtory. The Time hath never yet been when the Lion and the Lamb could lie ſafely toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (taking theſe Words even in a figurative Senſe) and the ſucking Child play with the Baſiliſk without Danger of being hurt; and when there was none to
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:006120_0101_1027EC5D80BC9170"/>hurt in all God's holy Mountain; when Nation hath ceas'd to lift up Sword againſt Nation, and wholly left off to learn the Diſcipline of War. And if the <hi>V.</hi> can prove the preſent Age to be the Time propheſied of in theſe Words, I will give up the Point I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for; but if he cannot, I muſt beg Leave to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt upon it, that his Argument drawn from hence to the contrary, proves nothing. When Nation ſhall ceaſe to lift up Sword againſt Nation, and not learn War any more; then I own Chriſtians may convert their Weapons of War into Implements of Huſban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry; but till then it doth not appear, from any thing in this Propheſy, that they may not lawfully keep them, and uſe them too, provided it be pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in their own Defence. Nothing from thence can be concluded againſt the Lawfulneſs of a neceſſary Self-defence, ſo long as they that heartily endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to live in Peace, are not ſuffered to enjoy in What the <hi>V.</hi> quotes from the learned <hi>Pocie,</hi> is ſo fat from making it appear that this Propheſy makes in favour of his Argument, that it is a ſtrong Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of what I have advanced, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Completion of this Propheſy is yet to come. The Animoſities and Hoſtilities between the <hi>Jews</hi> and Gentiles have never yet been rooted out; this will never be till the <hi>Jews</hi> are converted; nor have Mens Pride, and Paſſions, and Luſts, which are the Cauſes of all Wars, been ſubdued, as this learned Commentator ſays they ſhall be, when this Propheſy ſhall be fulfilled. And when he ſays, that the working Humility, Meekneſs, Self-denial, and true and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Love to all Men, from whence Peace neceſſarily follows, was the Deſign of the Goſpel in all, and the Effect of it in thoſe that rightly received it; this no more proves that he thought this Propheſy makes Defenſive War unlawful under the Goſpel, than that he thought it makes capital Puniſhments by the Magiſtrate ſo. For if it be unlawful for the
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:006120_0102_1027EC4E49ECAE10"/>Magiſtrate to uſe the temporal Sword in Defence of his innocent Subjects, becauſe it was the Deſign of the Goſpel to work Humility, Meekneſs, Self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, and true and fervent Love to all Men, and the Effect of it in thoſe who rightly received it; it muſt by the ſame Argument be unlawful for the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate to defend himſelf and his peaceable Subjects from the villainous Attempts of Murderers and Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throats in his own Dominions; which Doctrine this learned Man was very far from believing. It is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that all have not yet complied with the Deſign of the Goſpel, and it cannot be inferred from any thing in <hi>Poole</hi>'s Words, that he thought it unlawful for thoſe, who have comply'd ſo far with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of it, as to follow after the Things that make for Peace, to defend themſelves againſt thoſe who will not ſuffer them to enjoy it, when they cannot, in any human Probability, eſcape their unjuſt Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <q>The <hi>Jews,</hi> ſays the <hi>V.</hi> underſtood this Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy to relate ſolely to the times of the Meſſiah, and alledge it as a ſtrong Argument that the Meſſiah is not come.</q> Upon which I obſerve, that this <hi>V.</hi> is every where the ſame ſubtle Arguer. The <hi>Jews</hi> underſtood, by this Propheſy, that the Meſſiah would come in the Form of a great temporal Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, to reſtore them to their own Land, that <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> ſhould be the Seat of Government, and that all Nations ſhould bow under his Scepter: In this Senſe, I ſay, they underſtood this Propheſy to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late ſolely to the times of the Meſſiah, and alledge it as a ſtrong Argument that the Meſſiah is not come; I leave the intelligent Reader to make the Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The <hi>Jews,</hi> I grant, uſe this Propheſy by Way of <hi>Argumentum ad hominem</hi> againſt ſuch Chriſtians as this <hi>V.</hi> in order to prove that Chriſt cannot be the Meſſiah propheſied of by <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> who, ſuppoſing that they underſtood this Propheſy in the ſame Senſe
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:006120_0103_1027EC4355BB33B0"/>with themſelves (as indeed ſuch as the <hi>V.</hi> does in one Senſe) urge them with this Queſtion; Why is not War and Fighting ceaſed among the Nations, if your Chriſt be the Meſſiah there propheſied of? So that the <hi>V</hi>'s Argument might paſs well enough, if advanc'd by a <hi>Jew;</hi> but as it comes from the Mouth of the <hi>V.</hi> of a Chriſtian Doctrine, it is moſt intolerable; and argues either the greateſt Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or the moſt ſhameful Prevarication imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. And if the antient Fathers did affirm this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſy to be fulfilled in the Chriſtians in their Times, as the <hi>V.</hi> aſſerts, I muſt beg Leave to deſire him to conſider, that theſe antient Fathers he ſpeaks of, being ſome of that Man-made hireling Miniſtry he complains of, Page 3. of his Vindication, are to be underſtood, <hi>Cum grano ſalis.</hi> This, I dare ſay, he will readily grant me, as to many other Points theſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have moſt ſtrenuouſly maintained; and why their Authority ſhould be of ſo great Weight with the Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicator in this one Point, and no other, is not eaſy to be accounted for to his Credit. I ſhould be glad to know of the <hi>V.</hi> whether he believes that thoſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, upon whoſe Authority he depends ſo much for proving his Point, were among the Number of thoſe <q>Primitive Believers who were faithful to the Appearance of the divine Spirit, and obey'd the Teachings and Directions thereof,</q> or in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy he ſpeaks of, Page 2? If he owns the firſt, he muſt renounce <hi>Quakeriſm,</hi> or elſe ſtand ſelf-condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; if the ſecond, what Reaſon have either we or he to believe that thoſe apoſtate antient Fathers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the true Meaning of this Propheſy?</p>
            <p>BUT further, if theſe antient Fathers did any where affirm this Propheſy to be fulfilled in the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in their Times, they could mean no more, than that it was fulfilled ſo far as that Chriſtians liv'd more peaceably than the Heathens; no more, than that it it was fulfilled in ſome Senſe, as we ſay;
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:006120_0104_1027EC598FB3D238"/>this was evident to every one from Matter of Fact. For tho' they who in times paſt killed one another, upon every little Provocation (as was common a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Heathens) did not then war and fight with their Enemies, as <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> ſpeaks; yet Nation did then fight againſt Nation, and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> againſt Kingdom, as much as ever, and Men learned War then as much as before. So that 'tis impoſſible any Man in his Senſes could think, that this Propheſy was at that Time fully accompliſhed. Could <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> poſſibly imagine, that a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſy concerning the Peace and Tranquility of all Nations, was fulfilled in the paſſive Obedience of a very inſignificant Number, in Compariſon with all Nations? If he did, we may venture to ſay, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Breach of Charity, that he was as much miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in this Point, as the <hi>V.</hi> cannot but think he was in ſome others, which we look upon to be of far greater Importance. But granting the <hi>V.</hi> that the Fathers univerſally allow the Reign of Chriſt to be deſcrib'd by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> Chap. xi. where he ſays, <hi>They ſhall not hurt nor deſtroy in all my holy Mountain, for the Earth it ſhell be full of the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Lord, as the Waters cover the Sea.</hi> Will it therefore follow, that Defenſive War is unlawful in every Period of this Reign? By no means. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be inferr'd from it againſt the Unlawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs thereof, but only in that Period of it, when there ſhall be none to hurt nor deſtroy in all God's holy Mountain; and when the Earth ſhall be full of the Knowledge of the Lord, as the Waters cover the Sea. And if <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> took the holy Mountain in this Propheſy to be ſpoken of the Church of Chriſt, as the <hi>V.</hi> aſſerts, and if he tho't that this would be the State of the Church in every Period of it, we muſt beg Leave to think he was miſtaken; for 'tis evident from Fact, that the Caſe is otherwiſe. The Time has never yet been when
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:006120_0105_1027EC56E6D930C0"/>it could be truly ſaid, there was none to hurt nor deſtroy in the viſible Church of Chriſt, tho' we have good Ground to believe there will be ſuch a Time; and then we acknowledge that no Kind of War will be lawful, no, not a Defenſive War; and the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, becauſe there will be no Violence to defend ourſelves againſt. But ſo long as lawleſs Violence is offered, ſo long will Defenſive War be lawful, and no longer, provided always it be managed with Juſtice and Humanity.</p>
            <p>AND here I cannot but obſerve, that that Cauſe muſt be built on a very poor Foundation, which ſtands in Need of ſuch wretched Props to ſupport it, as ſome broken and imperfect Sentences of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Fathers, made Uſe of for this Purpoſe, by thoſe very Men who deſpiſe their Authority in other Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which the whole Chriſtian World, but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, allow to be of much greater Importance; and raking into ſome obſcure Prophecies of the Old Teſtament, which, as is evident in Fact, have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet been literally fulfilled; and which the <hi>Jews</hi> make Uſe of to prove that Chriſt cannot be the true Meſſiah, and <hi>Juſtin Martyr, Tertullian,</hi> and a great many more of the <hi>V</hi>'s Authorities, to prove the millenary Reign of Chriſt, when all the Juſt ſhould riſe from the Dead with the ſame Bodies that they liv'd in formerly, that they ſhould fare delici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, and enjoy corporeal Delights, and beget Children as before; and all this with an equal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Claim to Truth with this Vindicator; they are equally qualified to ſupport each of the latter Doctrines as the former, and each of the Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors ſeems to be intituled to an equal Degree of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, for ſuch <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

            <p>THAT neither theſe Predictions, nor the Example and Teſtimony of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, do in the leaſt take away the Uſe of carnal Weapons, ſo as to make it unlawful for the Chriſtian Magiſtrate to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend his Subjects againſt a foreign Enemy, I have fully prov'd already. And as for the primitive Chriſtians, I will ſhew preſently, that neither does their Example, or Teſtimony, do ſo. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what the <hi>V.</hi> thinks ſtrong and cogent Proofs, that a Defenſive War (for we contend for no other) cannot be conſiſtent with the Purity and Perfection of the Chriſtian Religion, as delivered by our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and written by the Apoſtles in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, will be no Proofs at all, but the meer Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of his own Imagination, which, inſtead of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Truth of his Doctrine, will expoſe it to the juſt Indignation of every unprejudic'd reaſonable Man.</p>
            <p>NOW as to the Example and Teſtimony of the primitive Chriſtians, nothing can reaſonably be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:006120_0107_1027EC4B99C0CDD0"/>from hence againſt the Lawfulneſs of Defenſive War, for ſeveral Reaſons. Firſt, it muſt be conſidered that they being Subjects under their Magiſtrates, which their Religion taught them to regard as an Ordinance of God, had no Right to reſiſt any Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence offered by them, as they were but private Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; becauſe in ſo doing, they would have been Rebels, and ſo would have incurr'd the Penalty of Damnation. A particular Party of Men may be barbarouſly us'd by their Superiors, and yet it may neither be expedient nor lawful for them to defend themſelves by Force of Arms, becauſe the Laws of the Community are againſt them; and as they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in Conſcience comply with theſe Laws, whatever Reaſon they may have to lament their Misfortune, they can have none to complain of being obliged to ſuffer the Penalty, in Caſe of Tranſgreſſion. For every Perſon that ſubmits to a Government, and becomes a Subject to any Prince, either explicitly or implicitly, ſtipulates and conſents, that he will pay due Obedience to all the Laws of the Common-Wealth to which he belongs; which Obedience is juſtly due from him to the Government, for the Protection it affords him, and the Privileges he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys under it. Now if any Subject, under ſuch O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bligations, ſhould find himſelf oblig'd in Conſcience to alter his Conduct, whereby he tranſgreſſes ſome ſtanding Law of the Community; if in this Caſe, I ſay, he is made to ſuffer the Penalty in Caſe of ſuch Tranſgreſſion, it is no more than he had Reaſon to expect, becauſe he is ſuppoſed to have promis'd O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to whatever Laws ſhould be made by the Legiſlature of that Government to which he hath ſubmitted; and to attempt to defend himſelf by Force of Arms againſt the Execution of the Laws of this Government, would be no leſs than Rebellion. Wherefore the only lawful Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy left him in this Caſe, is Patience, and Meekneſs,
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:006120_0108_1027EC48E790BD08"/>under his Sufferings. Now this was the Caſe of the primitive Chriſtians. They were a Party of Men barbarouſly uſed, and they had, no doubt, a Right to better Treatment; but no one can ſhew, either that they could juſtly complain of the Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Laws, unleſs it can be made appear, that their Superiors were convinc'd that they had a divine Commiſſion for what they did contrary to thoſe Laws; or (which is a Conſideration of great Weight in this Debate) that it would have been for the Intereſt and good of the Publick, or whole Community, that they ſhould have riſen up in Arms, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> for their own particular Self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence againſt their Superiors and Fellow Subjects, have put who<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> Nations in Combuſtion, and ſo have been the Occaſion of great and univerſal Calamities. Every Body can ſee at once the infinite Difference between the Caſe of the primitive Chriſtians, who were puniſhed by their own Magiſtrates, becauſe they could not in Conſcience obey the Laws of their Country, and that of one Nation's invading ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Beſides, it was very much for the Honour and Propagation of their Religion, whilſt they were but a Party of Subjects, not concerned in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of State-Affairs, that they ſhould engage the Favour of their Princes, and attract the Hearts of all Men to their Profeſſion, by their ſignal Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and Submiſſion to the greateſt Torments i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginable. But it muſt be extremely to the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace and Hindrance of their Religion, if it obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them, when they became the whole of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, govern'd by their own Laws, to ſubmit themſelves to be ruined and made miſerable by eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry lawleſs, foreign Invader. By the former they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated to all the World the Power of their Faith, in Caſes in which it was lawful and honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for them to ſuffer, and to prefer their Duty to God and their Country, before their own private
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:006120_0109_1027EC51411C1E60"/>Intereſt. But, upon the latter Suppoſition, nothing could be included, but that Chriſtianity was an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to the publick Good of human Society, and that it tended to conclude whole Nations under Slavery and Oppreſſion; unleſs, at the ſame time, it could be ſhewn, that Chriſtians have good and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Grounds to hope for a miraculous, or to truſt in an ordinary Providence, without the Uſe of Means for their Protection.</p>
            <p>BUT beſides the Practice, we are urged with the Teſtimony of the primitive Chriſtians eſpecially of the Fathers) againſt the Unlawfulneſs of War un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel. To which I reply; That tho' the univerſal Teſtimony of the primitive Fathers of the Chriſtian Church, as to Matters of Fact, muſt of Neceſſity be received; yet their Judgment, in any difficult Point, or any Part of their Practice depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon their Judgment, ought not to be any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> regarded, than as it is founded either on the Reaſon of the Thing itſelf, or on the Declarations of Chriſt and his Apoſtles. As to the Point before us then, nothing can be concluded from the Sayings of the Fathers, but that it was the Opinion of ſome private Men. The firſt Teſtimony the <hi>V.</hi> quotes is that of St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> a Man-made Miniſter, and an eminent Biſhop, whoſe Teſtimony, if it be authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick in every Point he treats of, will be very little to the <hi>V</hi>'s Credit. And beſides, what he ſays in that Paſſage he hath quoted from him, relates intirely to his own Order, as will evidently appear to any One that can read his Offices, a Book wrote by him on purpoſe to teach Eccleſiaſticks their Duty; which rather implies, that others were not concluded by the ſame Rule, than the contrary. <hi>Againſt Arms and Soldiers,</hi> ſays he, in another Place <note n="*" place="bottom">Lib. <hi>5.</hi> Orat. in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

SO may the Paſſage quoted by him from <hi>Origen</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Celſus,</hi> as appears from the following Words; <hi>To thoſe who, being Unbelievers,</hi> ſays he, <hi>would oblige us to fight for the Commonwealth, and to deſtroy Men, we ſhall give this Anſwer, That even their own Idol Prieſts, and thoſe that attend upon the Service of their reputed Gods, do keep themſelves unſtained with human Blood, that ſo they may offer up their Sacrifices for the whole Nation with clean and unpolluted Hands. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in caſe there ſhould ariſe a War, are theſe Men to be liſted in their Armies; and if this be not done without Reaſon, how much more may they be ſaid after their Manner to fight, who, being Prieſts to the moſt high God, endeavour to preſerve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves free from Blood and Rapine? That ſo whilſt others are polluted with Spoil and Slaughter, they may wreſtle with God himſelf by conſtant and inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Prayers, for the Welfare of them who make War juſtly</hi> (mark this) <hi>and for the Safety of them that govern righteouſly</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Apocalyps, <hi>i. 6.</hi>
               </note>. It was an Opinion early introduced into the Church, that ſuch as put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into holy Orders, ought not to be entangled with any other Care, nor diverted by any other dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Labour. The Clergy, among all Nations, were ever exempted from bearing Arms; which Practice obtain'd likewiſe among the Chriſtian Clergy very early, as appears by that Collection of Rules called <hi>The Apoſtolical Canons;</hi> and thus we have ſtumbled upon the true Origin of the Quakers Non-reſiſting Principle, which, in the Opinion of ſome, looks much more like a Branch of Prieſtcraft, than a Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>THAT St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> and <hi>Origen</hi> did not look upon all Sorts of War to be unlawful under the Goſpel, is evident from hence: The ſame <hi>Origen</hi> brings in Bees, as a Proof that it was lawful for Chriſtians to make a juſt and well order'd War, as often as Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity required.

               <q>That ſimply to go to War was no Sin, but only to fight for Spoil and Plunder.</q> And likewiſe in his Offices he ſays, <q>That Force, whereby either our Country is defended from our Enemies by War, or the Weak and Innocent defended at Home, or our Associates from Pirates and Robbers, is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Juſtice.</q> And in another Place he ſpeaks thus <note n="†" place="bottom">De Offic.

They might indeed bear the Name of Chriſtians, as Multitudes do Now-a-days.</q> Anſwer; It appears from what I have juſt now ſaid, that there were many Soldiers among the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Chriſtians, who did more than bear the Name of Chriſtians; for they ſuffered Martyrdom, not becauſe they would not bear Arms, but becauſe they would not renounce Chriſtianity. And even thoſe Soldiers in <hi>Diocleſian</hi>'s Army, might be more than meer nominal Chriſtians, tho' they were not ſo ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous as <hi>Maximilian</hi> was; who by miſtaking the true Meaning of ſome Paſſages in the Goſpel (as ſome now-a-days do) might think they imply'd a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:006120_0114_1027EC2E46C7A438"/>of all Uſe of the Sword. But this <hi>V.</hi> I find, will allow none to be more than nominal Chriſtians, who have not got an Underſtanding exactly of a Size with his own; in which Caſe, I can aſſure him, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Authority he hath here quoted, will be but a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal Chriſtian; for they and he differ very widely on every Point of the Chriſtian Religion, however well he may think they agree in this. But further; that there were Soldiers in the primitive Times, that were more than meer nominal Chriſtians, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear from the noted Paſſage of the <hi>Thebean</hi> Legion. But before I proceed to give any Account of it, it will be proper to obſerve, that ſometimes when the Perſecution was heightened, all the Chriſtian Soldiers and Officers, as well as others, were commanded to renounce Chriſtianity, and embrace Paganiſm, by pouring Incenſe on the Altar to the Heathen Gods, or delivering up their Bibles, and the like, which, tho' ſome thro' Fear comply'd with, yet great Numbers abſolutely refuſed it; and this drew upon them the Torments they ſuffered. Now this Legion having been converted unto Chriſtianity ſome Time before by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> when they lay in <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> as <hi>Eucheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> ſaith, contentedly ſerv'd in the Army all that Time, but being ſuſpected by the Emperor <hi>Maximian</hi> of having embrac'd Chriſtianity, they were command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſacrifice to Idols; which they abſolutely refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and confeſſing themſelves to be Chriſtians, were all put to Death at the Emperor's Command. Now this Legion, though very powerful (it conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of 6666 brave Soldiers) did not attempt any Reſiſtance; both becauſe it would have been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for them to defend themſelves againſt the Emperor's whole Army, and becauſe they look'd upon it as inconſiſtent with the Duty of Subjects to oppoſe their Magiſtrates in the Execution of the Laws. But tho' they would not defend themſelves againſt their own Magiſtrates (which indeed would
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:006120_0115_1027EC312EE43620"/>not have been agreeable to the Law of Nature) yet it appears from the noble Speech they made before their Execution, that they were not principled againſt bearing Arms in Defence of their Country. <q>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any foreign Power, ſay they, we freely of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer our Hands, which yet we dare not imbrue in the Blood of Innocents. Our Arms which have been long practis'd in ſuppreſſing Vice, and in van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhing Foes, never yet knew how to oppreſs the Righteous, or to cut the Throats of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and Fellow Citizens. When firſt we enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in War, we remember it was to protect, and not to deſtroy: We have hitherto fought for Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, for Piety, for the Defence of Innocence; for theſe Prizes we have ſlighted all Dangers; we have fought for the Defence of our Faith, which ſhould we have broke with God, how canſt thou, O Emperor! expect that we ſhould keep with thee?</q>
            </p>
            <p>IN ſhort, in moſt of the antient Perſecutions, we find Examples of Chriſtian Soldiers, who were as content and ready to die Martyrs, as any other Chriſtians. In <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s Time, it appears, they were as couragious in paſſive, as active Valour. And in the Perſecution of <hi>Decius,</hi> we read of a File, or, as ſome render it, a Troop of Soldiers, who attending in the Court of Judicature, where Chriſtians were try'd for their Religion, ran to the Bar, and cry'd out, We are Chriſtians; and made the Judges themſelves tremble. <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſaith, <q>Chriſtian Soldiers went out in a Kind of Pomp and State to die, and rejoic'd at the Teſtimony they were to give for the Faith.</q> I could bring many more Examples of this Nature among the Chriſtian Soldiers, but this is enough to ſhew, that there were Numbers of Soldiers among the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Chriſtians that were more than meer nominal Chriſtians, as this <hi>V.</hi> uncharitably ſuggeſts. From
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:006120_0116_1027EC365FA1E680"/>all which it appears, that nothing can be concluded from the Teſtimony or Practice of the primitive Chriſtians againſt the Lawfulneſs of Defenſive War againſt a foreign Invader.</p>
            <p>BUT even ſuppoſing that ſome of the Chriſtian Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were really of Opinion, that all War was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful under the Goſpel; what then? Will this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to a Proof that it really is ſo? Every Father the <hi>V.</hi> hath quoted, taught Doctrines, and held Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions more zealouſly than he can prove they did the Unlawfulneſs of Defenſive War; and yet I preſume their Authority has no Weight with him in theſe Points. St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> maintain'd the Neceſſity of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopacy to the Being of a true Church, that Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Baptiſm, and the Belief of the Reſurrection of the ſame Body, were neceſſary to Salvation (as did all the Fathers he hath mentioned.) <hi>Athenagoras</hi> main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd the Worſhip of Angels, and that they were created to take Care of Things here below. He recommends Virginity, condemns ſecond Marriages, and calls them an honourable Adultery.</p>
            <p>TERTULLIAN, who writes more like a Poet than an Hiſtorian, can hardly ever be literally interpreted, without making him to appear a Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of no good Character. He aſſerts<note n="*" place="bottom">De Idol. Cap. <hi>17.</hi>
               </note>, That a Chriſtian cannot in Conſcience perform the Function of a Judge, nor ſerve as an Executioner of Juſtice. He abſolutely condemns ſecond Marriages, as being Aduitery<note n="†" place="bottom">De Coron. Cap. <hi>11.</hi>
               </note>. He prohibits Chriſtians to avoid Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and enjoin'd the moſt ſtrict and frequent Faſts.</p>
            <p>CLEMENS ALEXANDRINUS held the abſolute Neceſſity of Water Baptiſm, pleads that 'tis unlawful to fly from Perſecution, contrary to our Saviour's Words; that a true Chriſtian is free from Paſſions, even the moſt innocent Ones, except ſuch as regard the Preſervation of the Body; and that the Chriſtian is the only rich Man<note n="‖" place="bottom">Pedag.</note>.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="100" facs="unknown:006120_0117_1027EC390FCC1910"/>
ORIGEN maintains, that all intelligent Beings ever did, and ever ſhall, exiſt; that they have been always free to do Good and Evil, and that they have been precipitated into low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Places, and confin'd to Bodies for a Puniſhment of their Sins<note n="‡" place="bottom">De Principiis Strome.</note>.</p>
            <p>AS to <hi>Maximilian,</hi> who, as the <hi>V.</hi> ſays ſuffered Death for refuſing to bear Arms, nothing can be inferr'd from this obſcure ſingle Inſtance againſt the Lawfulneſs of the Practice; ſince, as I have ſhewn, many Chriſtians who ſuffered Death for the ſake of their Religion did ſo. Either there might be ſome Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance attending his particular Caſe, which made it his Duty to refuſe it; or he may have been one of thoſe Chriſtians we read of, who were ſo intemperate in their Zeal, that they ran unneceſſarily to Torments, and deſir'd rather to be condemn'd than abſolved; and did ſeveral other Things in which we are under no Obligation to follow their Steps, nor to think that they were obliged by any Precept of the Goſpel to act as they did. Now what I would obſerve, from what I have ſaid upon theſe Opinions of the Fathers, is this; That if this <hi>V.</hi> will not allow the Authority of theſe Fathers in one Caſe, as I am pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty confident he will not, why ſhould he urge it ſo ſtrenuouſly in another? If the univerſal Example of the primitive Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans is not to be followed in one Caſe, it cannot, if we conſider it by itſelf, be juſtly accounted of greater Force in any other.</p>
            <p>IT may juſtly be expected, that they who argue ſo ſtrongly from their Example, according to the Account given of it by theſe Antients, ſhould imitate it in all other Inſtances recorded by the ſame Writers, or, at leaſt, argue for the Neceſſity of ſo doing. But whilſt they acknowledge no ſuch Neceſſity in many other Caſes, we cannot think their bare Example to be, in this Caſe only, of great Importance, even could it be prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But in Truth none of the Fathers ſay any thing from whence it can be concluded, that Defenſive War, againſt a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Enemy, was reckoned unlawful by the primitive Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. <hi>Tertullian,</hi> 'tis true, ſeems, in ſome Caſes, to ſpeak doubtfully of it, not becauſe it was in itſelf unlawful, as I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved above, but becauſe Chriſtian Soldiers were apt to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to ſome Actions which were not conſiſtent with their Chriſtian Profeſſion. Hence we find he objects in one Place, <q>That Chriſtian Soldiers were ſometimes commanded to ſwear by the Heathen Gods:</q> Whereupon in another Place he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues thus; <q>Shall, ſays he, a Chriſtian watch to guard the Temples of thoſe Gods whom he hath renounced? Shall he ſup there where he is forbidden to eat? Shall he defend thoſe Spirits by Night, which he exorciſeth by Day?</q> And then he adds; <q>How many other great Offences may be ſeen in military Duties, which cannot be otherwiſe interpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but as Breaches of our Chriſtian Laws?</q> But tho' in
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:006120_0118_1027EC3AA9471F98"/>ſome Places he thus ſpeaks doubtfully, yet in other Places he ſpeaks more favourably, ſo as to make it appear, that he did not underſtand it to be inconſiſtent with the Purity and Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Chriſtian Religion. He ſpeaks of it as dangerous, but not as unlawful; and that it is ſo, I know no body that will deny. Beſides, the Places I have quoted already, wherein this Father ſpeaks favourably of a juſt War, in his <hi>Idololatria,</hi> he ſays; <q>It is much queſtioned whether Chriſtians may take Arms, or whether Soldiers may be admitted to Chriſtianity.</q> And in his <hi>Corona Militis,</hi> after he had diſputed a while againſt the Lawfulneſs of War, he at length diſtinguiſhes between him that entered into Arms before he was baptized, and him that liſted himſelf after Baptiſm. <q>For, ſays he, their Condition is plainly otherwiſe, who being firſt Soldiers, were afterwards converted to the Faith, as theirs whom St. <hi>John</hi> admitted to his Baptiſm; or that faithful Centurion's whom Chriſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of, and whom St. <hi>Peter</hi> inſtructed; provided that having once embraced the Chriſtian Faith, and being ſealed up thereunto by Baptiſm; they either renounce the War preſently, as ſome have done, or take ſpecial Care that they do nothing therein that may offend God.</q> Whence it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that <hi>Tertullian</hi> look'd upon the military Office only as dangerous, but not as unlawful; becauſe Chriſtians might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in Arms after Baptiſm, which certainly would not have been permitted by him, if he had thought that all War was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Goſpel, no more than Magicians and Soothſayers were permitted after Baptiſm to retain their unlawful Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. <q>They who profeſs ſuch Arts as the Chriſtian Diſcipline do not allow, ſays he<note n="†" place="bottom">De Idel. Cap. <hi>8.</hi>
                  </note>, are not to be admitted into the Church of Chriſt.</q> And of the ſame Opinion were St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> and St. <hi>Cyprian.</hi> I have ſhewn above, that both St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> and St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> approv'd of a juſt War, and ſo did St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and St. <hi>Baſil.</hi> 
               <q>Good Men, ſaith the Firſt<note n="*" place="bottom">De Civitate Dei, Lib. <hi>4.</hi>
                  </note>, make War their Refuge; but wicked Men make it their Delight.</q> And the Laſt gives this Teſtimony of the primitive Chriſtians; 'That their Anceſtors never accounted that Execution which was done in a juſt War as Murder; but always held them excus'd, that fought for the Defence of Chaſtity, and of Piety.</p>
            <p>NEITHER was there any one Biſhop, that we read of, among ſo many that were great Sufferers for Religion, that ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd <hi>Conſtantine</hi> (who was turn'd Chriſtian) for making War, or that ever endeavoured to make his Soldiers decline it; tho' many of them were very ſevere Diſciplinarians, ſparing neither Prince nor People, that were defective in their Duties. Now let the impartial Reader but conſider what this <hi>V.</hi> hath alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Example and Teſtimony of the primitive Chriſtians to prove the Unlawfulneſs of Defenſive War, and what I have
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:006120_0119_1027EC40AD1D83C8"/>advanced in Anſwer thereto, and then let him judge with what Aſſurance he could ſay, <q>That the Examples and Teſtimonies of the primitive Chriſtians, that Obedience to the Goſpel had that Effect, not only to give Chriſtians inward Peace, but to take away the Uſe of carnal Weapons, are very ſtrong and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Proofs, that War cannot be conſiſtent with the Purity and Perfection of the Chriſtian Religion</q> And even tho' it may appear doubtful, whether theſe Antients look'd upon all War to be unlawful, which, to me, it does not, yet we ought not from thence to make any Doubt, whether it be lawful for us to enter into a neceſſary War for defending our Country againſt a foreign Enemy. Many of the primitive Fathers diſallow'd of ſecond Marriages, and ſeveral other lawful Practices, as I have ſhewn above; yet no wife Man will conclude, that they are in themſelves unlawful. For tho' the Omiſſion of ſuch Practices might be expedient then, and, in ſome Circumſtances, Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Chriſtian Profeſſion, and acceptable to God; ſuch as Celibacy in times of Perſecution, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet they are not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd upon as by the Neceſſity of any Law.</p>
            <p>NAY further; Admit there are ſome Texts of Scripture, which ſeemingly forbid all Sorts of War; yet ſince it hath been reckoned by all good Men a Means ſufficient for avoiding perſonal Inconveniencies (as cutting off a Right hand, or pluck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out a Right-eye) to admit of any Senſe rather than the literal; much rather ſhould thoſe Places of Scriptute that are urg'd againſt the Uſe of carnal Weapons in Defence of Mens Lives and Liberties admit of any Senſe, than that Chriſtianity ſhould be made to deſtroy that which is one of the main Pillars of Human Society. For if it be granted that the World cannot ſubſiſt without Government, nor any Government without Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection and Defence, which every Body but a wild Viſionary, or bare fac'd Hypocrite, will readily grant; then it is as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that that Religion cannot be Good, which teaches ſuch Doctrines, which, if followed, thro' their native Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, will deſtroy all Government, and turn human Society into a Field of Blood. And therefore I conclude, that every ſuch Doctrine, let its Pretences to Sanctity be ever ſo ſpecious, and the Abettors of it ever ſo preciſe, ought not only to be held in the utmoſt Abhorrence and Deteſtation, by every true Friend to his Country, but to be ſuppreſt with all poſſible Care and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as a Nuiſance and Peſt to the Government where it is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd, and an egregious Reproach to the Chriſtian Religion.</p>
