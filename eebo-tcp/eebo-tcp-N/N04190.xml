            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>To the READER,</head>
            <p>THERE needs no Apology for the Publication of the following Sermons; the vaſt Importance of the Subject, renders a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of this Kind always ſeaſonable; tho' perhaps it may be thought by ſome, that no Apology can be ſufficient, for the enſuing Remarks upon an Author of ſo great Name and Character, as Dr. <hi>Waterland.</hi> But as I have endeavoured to approve myſelf unto God, in that Undertaking; I can patiently bear any of thoſe Invectives that may be expected, from the Gentlemen of contrary Sentiments.—I am as fully perſuaded, that the Cauſe I am de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending is the Cauſe of God, as I am that the Scriptures are the Word of God. If I believe the one, I muſt believe the other, if it be poſſible to underſtand the Meaning of the moſt plain, familiar, and expreſs Words that can be ſpoken,—The Souls of Men are therefore nearly concern'd in this Matter; and the Miniſters of the Goſpel loudly called upon, vigorouſly to exert themſelves, that they may prevent, if poſſible, the Defection that is already begun in ſeveral Parts of the Land, upon Account of this great Article of Chriſtianity. If this be not a ſufficient Reaſon for this Undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I have none to give.</p>
            <p>I don't intend by theſe Remarks, merely a Refutation of Dr. <hi>Waterland's</hi> Book, but of his Principles, alſo by whomſoever eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſed. I have therefore been larger upon ſome Points, than would have been neceſſary in Anſwer to that Diſcourſe; and either wholly paſſed over, or but briefly touched upon, ſome other very erroneous Principles, that do not ſo immediately enter into the Merits of the Cauſe.—What I aim at, is, to furniſh the Reader with Armour from the Word of God, not only againſt the dangerous Doctrines contain'd in that Diſcourſe; but alſo againſt any other
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:005163_0003_1016CB1A201E2718"/>
Attack of the like Kind, from any other Quarter. And I hope he may be ſufficiently ſecured, by duly attending to what is ſaid, in the following Sermon and Remarks.</p>
            <p>I have thought myſelf called, to make theſe Animadverſions upon Dr. <hi>Waterland's</hi> Diſcourſe in particular, partly becauſe it is induſtriouſly handed about in ſeveral Parts of the Country, to make Proſelites; and partly becauſe the Subject is the moſt conciſely and plauſibly handled in that Diſcourſe, of any that I have met with.</p>
            <p>I expect to be cenſured, for expreſſing ſo much Confidence and Aſſurance in the Caſe before us, in Oppoſition to Men of ſo great Name, on the other Side of the Queſtion; as if I was arrogating Infallibility to myſelf: But I have this to ſay in my Defence, Tho' I am far from ſuppoſing myſelf infallible; yet I don't think it a juſt Reaſon to run into Sceptiſciſm; and to doubt of the Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of ſome of the plaineſt and moſt important Truths in the Word of God; becauſe I am fallible and liable to miſtake.—I am not willing to make a Compliment of ſuch an eſſential Article of prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Godlineſs, upon which our Eternity immediately depends, to any Perſons of what Name or Character ſoever; or to appear wavering or uncertain about it, that I may avoid this Cenſure; and beſpeak the Character of a modeſt Writer.</p>
            <p>Beſides, I muſt either entertain this Confidence and Aſſurance, or ſuppoſe at leaſt a Poſſibility of Truth, in ſome of the greateſt Abſurdities in the World.—I muſt either be confident that I am right, or elſe ſuppoſe a Poſſibility.—</p>
            <p n="1">1. That all the Texts of Scripture which I have cited, both from the old and new Teſtament, with others of the like Kind, which ſpeak of being ſprinkled, waſhed, or cleanſed with Water, do all immediately refer to Water Baptiſm; or elſe,—</p>
            <p n="2">2. I muſt ſuppoſe, that theſe Words in <hi>Joh.</hi> iii. 5; and <hi>Tit.</hi> iii. 5. muſt be underſtood of Water Baptiſm; tho' no other Scriptures exactly parallel to them are ſo to be underſtood; and tho' I can't imagine any Reaſon from the Words themſelves; or from the Nature of Things, why it ſhould be ſo.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I muſt ſuppoſe it poſſible, that every baptized Perſon, has all the Properties and Characters aſcribed to the New Birth, in Scriptures, or elſe.—</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="v" facs="unknown:005163_0004_1016CB1BAF24E0D0"/>4. I muſt ſuppoſe, that ſome Perſons are truly regenerate in their Baptiſm; and will never want any <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Regeneration, who have not the Characters given of the New <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; nor ever will have without a Reformation <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>ovation. This I think is plainly taught by Dr. <hi>Waterland</hi> (p. 3<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>.) And this if I miſtake not, is plainly to teach, that a Man may be rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate and not regenerate at the ſame Time.</p>
            <p>Theſe Things I muſt ſuppoſe; or elſe</p>
            <p n="5">5. I muſt ſuppoſe, that the Scriptures ſpeak of two different Kinds of Regeneration, as Qualifications for the Kingdom of God; the one baptiſmal, which may be without Holineſs; the other a Change of Heart, neceſſarily productive of a holy Life. That is in other Words, that Holineſs of Heart and Life is the neceſſary Fruit of Regeneration; and yet is not neceſſarily found in all that are truly Regenerate.</p>
            <p>Theſe and other ſuch like Abſurdities, mention'd in the following Diſcourſe, I muſt ſuppoſe; or elſe I muſt retain my Confidence, that I am not liable to miſtake in the preſent Caſe.—There is no other Choice before me.—I have therefore choſen the ſafeſt and ſureſt Side of the Queſtion, which I hope through the Grace of God to ſtand to; and according to my poor Ability to defend, as long as I can hold a Pen in my Hand.</p>
            <p>The Subject has naturally led me to uſe the ſame Manner of Reaſoning, more than once, upon different Occaſions, in the enſuing Remarks; and I had rather be cenſured for uſing needleſs Repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition; than to fail of giving my Reader Conviction, of the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Danger of the Doctrine which I oppoſe.</p>
            <p>I have no Favour to aſk of the Reader, on Account of any Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accuracies in the Manner of Performance, or the Stile.—If this Attempt be bleſſed of God, to convince poor unregenerate Sinners, of the infinite Miſchief that will follow a Miſtake in this great Concern; and to put them upon proper Solicitude, to lay ſuch a Foundation of Hope; that they may finally enter into the Kingdom of God; my End is obtained.—And whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, I hope for Acceptance from Him, whoſe Intereſt I have conſulted; and endeavoured to promote.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HESE Words were occaſion'd by a Viſit made to our bleſſed Saviour, by <hi>Nicodemus</hi> a Ruler among the Jews, who being convinc'd by the miraculous Works which Chriſt had wrought, that he was divinely inſpired, was probably now enquiring of him the Way of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. This Anſwer ſeems therefore to be given, to obviate all his falſe Apprehenſions and vain Hopes of Acceptance with God, by any outward Privileges or Performances; and to ſhew him, that there muſt be a great Change wrought in the Heart of every one, that would be a Partaker of the future Glory. Such a Change as is of the Nature of a <hi>new Creation;</hi> and may
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:005163_0006_1016CB2196626090"/>
be aptly compared to being <hi>born again.</hi> Our Lord aſſures him by a repeated Aſſeveration, (thereby to awaken his moſt ſerious Attention) that this Change is ſo abſolutely neceſſary, that without it, no Man ſhall ever <hi>ſee the Kingdom of God.</hi>—This Doctrine was taught <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> not as a Concern peculiar to himſelf, but as what equally referred to all Men, without Diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It therefore as much affects us as it did him, and is of the greateſt Importance to us all, ſince no leſs than our eternal Welfare depends upon it. Let us then conſider</p>
            <p n="1">1. What we are to underſtand by <hi>the Kingdom of God,</hi> which no unregenerate Man can ever ſee.</p>
            <p n="2">2. What we are to underſtand by being <hi>born again,</hi> without which we cannot ſee the Kingdom of God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Whence this Change which our Saviour here ſpeaks of, is called a <hi>new Birth.</hi> And</p>
            <p n="4">4. Whence it is ſo, that the unregenerate <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee the Kingdom of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. I am firſt then to conſider, what we are to underſtand by the Kingdom of God, which an unregenerate Man cannot ſee.</p>
            <p>I muſt here obſerve, that there is a twofold Interpretation of theſe Words, <hi>(the Kingdom of God)</hi> according to the different Senſe, in which they are elſewhere uſed in Scripture.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Some underſtand them to ſignify <hi>the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Grace;</hi> or that ſpiritual Kingdom, which our Lord was erecting here in the World. In that Senſe, we are to conſider them as being of
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:005163_0007_1016CB234CA98BF0"/>
the ſame Tendency, as if our bleſſed Saviour had ſaid to <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> You come to me as to a <hi>Teacher ſent from God;</hi> and ſeem willing to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come one of my Diſciples and Followers; and to be a Member of my ſpiritual Kingdom. But I aſſure you this cannot be, while you remain in your preſent State. None can be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged as real Members of that ſpiritual and heavenly Kingdom which God is now ſetting up, who have not experienced ſo great a Change of Heart, as may be aptly called a <hi>new Birth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Words being thus underſtood, plainly ſhew, that we cannot be Chriſtians indeed, we cannot be vital Members of Chriſt's myſtical Body; nor Partakers of the ſaving Benefits of his Redemption, whilſt unregenerate. But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. I chuſe to underſtand the Words of <hi>the Kingdom of Glory.</hi> And in that View, they are to be conſider'd, as if our bleſſed Lord had ſaid to <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> You ſeem deſirous to know how you may ſecure a Title to the heavenly Glory; and it is therefore neceſſary immediately to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form you, that it is not your high Birth nor external Privileges, it is not your Conformity to the ceremonial Law; nor your acknowledging me to be a <hi>Teacher ſent from God,</hi> that will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title you to that Glory and Happineſs: But I would have you receive it as a moſt certain and important Truth, that no Man can ever be Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of that glorious Inheritance, except he firſt experience ſo great a Change of Heart and Life, as will be like coming into a new World; and

may be fitly compar'd to his being <hi>born again.</hi> In this Senſe the following Scriptures are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily to be underſtood. Mark ix. 47. <hi>It is better for thee to enter into the Kingdom of God with one Eye, than having two Eyes, to be caſt into Hell Fire.</hi> Luk. xiii. 28. <hi>There ſhall be Weeping and Gnaſhing of Teeth, when ye ſhall ſee</hi> Abraham, <hi>and</hi> Iſaac, <hi>and</hi> Jacob <hi>in the Kingdom of God; and you yourſelves thruſt out.</hi> So likewiſe verſe 29.. with Acts xiv. 20. and many other Places.</p>
            <p>This Interpretation of theſe Words appears moſt agreeable, becauſe <hi>Nicodemus</hi> (how igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant ſoever of the <hi>new Birth</hi>) ſeems to have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood what our Lord meant by the <hi>Kingdom of God;</hi> and to be affected with the Danger of coming ſhort of it. Whereas, if our bleſſed Saviour had ſpoken to him of his ſpiritual King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in this World, he could not have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood him; but would have been at as great a Loſs to have found out his Meaning in this, as in the other Part of his Diſcourſe. In this Senſe therefore <hi>Nicodemus</hi> did underſtand the Words; and in this Senſe, our bleſſed Lord deſign'd that he ſhould underſtand 'em. For in the other Senſe, he could have known Nothing at all of their Meaning. — Beſides, it was probably his Concern for an Intereſt in <hi>the Kingdom of Glory,</hi> (and not of <hi>the Kingdom of Grace,</hi> which he knew ſo little about) that prompted <hi>Nicodemus</hi> to this Conference with our bleſſed Saviour. To this Concern, if not to ſome previous Queſtion about the Way of Salvation, our Lord accommodates
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:005163_0009_1016CB2993BFBD88"/>
his Anſwer; and ſhews him the neceſſary Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification for that eternal Salvation, he was ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous about.</p>
            <p>But the Conſequence is the ſame, whether we fix upon the one, or the other of theſe Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. For they who cannot be Members of <hi>the Kingdom of Grace,</hi> can never be Partakers of <hi>the Kingdom of Glory.</hi> We muſt be qualified for that State; or utterly unqualified for this.— This awakening Leſſon is therefore taught us by both theſe Explications, that without <hi>Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> there can be no Salvation: We muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come new Creatures, or periſh eternally: An awful Thought! O that it were duly conſider'd and laid to Heart, by a ſtupid Generation of Men, who live at Eaſe and Security in a State of Nature, and conſequently in a State of Wrath and Perdition! This is a Thought that muſt have its Influence upon them, either now while they have a Day of Grace, or hereafter, when they experience the Truth of theſe Words, by their Excluſion from <hi>the Kingdom of God.</hi> I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to conſider</p>
            <p n="2">II. What we are to underſtand by being BORN AGAIN, without which we cannot ſee the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God.</p>
            <p>To illuſtrate this Point, I ſhall firſt give a general Deſcription of this important Change, and then particularly conſider the ſeveral Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of that Deſcription.</p>
            <p>Regeneration <hi>is a new ſpiritual and ſupernatural Principle, wrought by the Spirit of God in all the
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:005163_0010_1016CB2BE6EE7DE0"/>
Faculties of the Soul, enclining and enabling unto the Exerciſe of a Life of Faith in Chriſt; and new Obedience to God.</hi> To be more particular.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I conſider <hi>Regeneration</hi> as being a new <hi>Principle.</hi> And thus the Scripture conſiders it. It is accordingly called <hi>the Seed of</hi> GOD, (1 Joh. iii. 9) <hi>the new Man</hi> (Col. iii. 10. <hi>the divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> (2 Pet. i. 4) and <hi>the incorruptible Seed</hi> (1 Pet. i. 23) All which Expreſſions plainly ſignify a new <hi>Principle</hi> of Action.—Our original Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy, has brought ſuch an univerſal Deprava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon all the Faculties of the Soul, that the <hi>whole Head is ſick; and the whole Heart faint,</hi> the whole Nature Guilt and Defilement, all the Affections and Paſſions alienated from the Life of God; and <hi>the carnal Mind Enmity unto him.</hi> What therefore but corrupt Streams, can flow from ſuch a poiſon'd Fountain? How can they that are in the Fleſh, ever pleaſe God? How can they that are dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins, perform any vital Actions? <hi>Can the Fig-tree, my Brethren, bear Olive Berries, or the Vine Figs? So can no Fountain yield both ſalt Water and freſh. Either make the Tree good; that the Fruit may be good; or the Tree will be corrupt, and his Fruit corrupt.</hi> There is a natural Neceſſity, that all the Actions of an unregenerate Perſon, ſhould partake of the Quality of thoſe carnal ſinful Diſpoſitions and Affections, from whence they flow. And there is the ſame Neceſſity, that we be <hi>renewed in the Spirit of our Minds;</hi> and obtain a new Source and Spring of Action; or as our Lord
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:005163_0011_1016CB2E36AAB870"/>
expreſſeth it, <hi>a new Treaſure of the Heart,</hi> in Order to our living acceptably to God here, or enjoying him hereafter.—There can be no Kind or Degree of moral Behaviour, no external Acts of Obedience, no Appearances of Piety and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion accepted of God, while our Hearts are eſtranged from him. <hi>The Lord looketh on the Heart.</hi> And what is the Heart of an unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate Man? The Scriptures tell us it is <hi>deceitful above all Things; and deſperately wicked.</hi> Jer. xvii. 1. Whence its of laſt Neceſſity, that <hi>a new Heart be given us; and a new Spirit put within us,</hi> in order to our <hi>walking in</hi> GOD'S <hi>Statutes; and keeping his Judgments to do them</hi> (Ezek. xxxvi. 26, 27) Its of Neceſſity, that we are <hi>created anew in Christ Jeſus unto Good Works,</hi> if we would <hi>walk in them</hi> (Eph. ii. 10) It is of Neceſſity, that God <hi>puts his Law in our Minds; and writes them in our Hearts,</hi> in Order to his being <hi>our</hi> GOD; <hi>and we his People</hi> (Heb: viii. 10)—<hi>Let no Man</hi> my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, <hi>deceive you with vain Words.</hi> You muſt not only have a new external Converſation; but a new vital <hi>Principle,</hi> if you would be the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God indeed. You muſt be <hi>quickned, who are dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins.</hi> You muſt <hi>hear the Voice of the Son of</hi> GOD <hi>and live;</hi> and partake of that <hi>Life, which is the Light of Men.</hi> You muſt <hi>put off the old Man; and put on the new Man, which after</hi> GOD, <hi>is created in Knowledge and true Holineſs;</hi> or elſe you are never like to ſee <hi>the Kingdom of</hi> GOD.</p>

               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:005163_0012_1016CB3196545AB8"/>2. I deſcribe <hi>Regeneration</hi> to be a ſpiritual and ſupernatural Principle. And thus likewiſe doth the Scripture deſcribe it. <hi>That which is born of the Spirit is Spirit</hi> (Joh. iii. 6) <hi>Of his own Will begat he us</hi> (Jam. i. 18) This Change is wrought by <hi>the exceeding Greatneſs of his Power; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Working of his mighty Power</hi> (Eph. i. 19)—I know that there are ſome, that call themſelves Chriſtians, who pretend that this Change is the Effect of moral Suaſion only: And that it is only thro' the Prevalence of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Means upon their Minds, that Men are excited to become new Creatures, by the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of their natural Abilities, in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of moral Virtues; and religious Duties. That (according to them) the whole Work of <hi>Regeneration</hi> and progreſſive Sanctification, is but the Improvement of thoſe Powers, which are given in common to all, that enjoy the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of the Goſpel. Tho' they will in Words acknowledge our Want of divine Aſſiſtance, in Order to this Change, they ſeem to allow no more of the peculiar and immediate Influences of the bleſſed Spirit, in this great Concern, than in the common and ordinary Occaſions of Life, How loath are poor proud Worms, to give God the Glory, of his glorious free Grace and divine Operations! How willing to think well of themſelves; and therefore to ſlight and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach all thoſe Experiences of the divine Power upon the Soul, which they themſelves are unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with!—But how doth the Scriptures,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:005163_0013_1016CB33847D4AC0"/>
how doth moſt clear and evident Experience repreſent this Caſe to us?— Are we not by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſpiritually <hi>dead?</hi> (Eph. ii. 1) Can a dead Man by the Force of any Perſuaſion, be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon, to reaſſume his Life and vital Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? Are we not naturally <hi>without Strength?</hi> (Rom. v. 6) And can the Force of Perſuaſion prevail with an enfeebled Cripple, or an ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated Paralitick, to ariſe and walk? Are we not naturally <hi>blind?</hi> (2 Cor. iv. 4) And can the Power of Perſuaſion, enable a blind Man to open his Eyes and ſee? Are not our Minds naturally, not only Enemies; but <hi>Enmity</hi> itſelf <hi>unto</hi> GOD? (Rom. viii. 7) And can mere Perſuaſion change all the Powers, Faculties, and Diſpoſitions of the Mind from Enmity to Friendſhip, from Hatred to Love; and from an habitual Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to Godlineſs, unto a Delight in the Ways of God? Are we not naturally polluted and guilty Creatures? (Rom. iii. 12) And can any Methods of mere Perſuaſion, bring a clean Thing out of an unclean; or bring a guilty Rebel into an Eſtate of Innocence, or into Peace and Favour with God? How vain are ſuch Pretences! How inconſiſtent and abſurd muſt they appear to any Man, who believes the Doctrine of ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Sin, as it is taught us by the Scriptures and our own Experience!—By this View of the Caſe, we may plainly ſee, that there muſt be a ſupernatural and divine Energy exerted, in this <hi>new Creation.</hi> We muſt be <hi>made willing in the Day of Christ's Power</hi> (Pſal. cx. 3) <hi>God muſt work
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:005163_0014_1016CB36984ACFA0"/>
in us both to will and to do, of his own good Pleaſure,</hi> (Phil. ii. 13) It is a great and wonderful Change, that <hi>Regeneration</hi> makes, too great for all the Men upon Earth, or Angels in Heaven to effect; and is therefore aſcribed to the ſame <hi>mighty Power, which was wrought in Chriſt, when he was raiſed from the Dead</hi> (Eph. i. 20)—This Truth is not only confirmed to us by the Word of God; but by our continued Obſervation and Experience. Don't we daily ſee the Unſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of all Attempts to perſuade Men to turn and live? Don't we daily ſee what becomes of all the good Purpoſes and Reſolutions, which Men take up in their own Strength; and wear off again as ſoon as the Din of Conſcience is out of their Ears? And don't we ſee how effectual the Work proves, when God himſelf undertakes it? How ſudden and unexpected it often is in its Beginning; and how permanent in its bleſſed Effects and Fruits? How then doth it concern us all, to maintain a deep Impreſſion of our own Impotence, to lye at the Foot of God's ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Grace, to aſcribe the whole Glory of this great Work to his mere good Pleaſure and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Power; and to experience this ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Change in our own Hearts; For it will certainly be found in the Concluſion, that none but thoſe who are <hi>born again,</hi> by the ſpecial In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of ſupernatural omnipotent Grace, ſhall ever <hi>ſee the Kingdom of</hi> GOD.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I have conſider'd this <hi>new Birth,</hi> to be a Principle wrought in us, by the immediate In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:005163_0015_1016CB39A49591F0"/>
of God's <hi>holy Spirit.</hi> And thus likewiſe it is conſider'd by the Word of God. <hi>That which is born of the Spirit is Spirit. So is every one that is born of the Spirit. Except a Man be born of Water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of</hi> GOD (Joh. iii. 5, 6, 8) <hi>It is the Spirit that giveth Life</hi> (2 Cor. iii. 6) <hi>We are changed into the divine Image, by the Spirit of the</hi> LORD (2 Cor. iii. 18)—It is true, this Work is ſometimes aſcribed unto the Father. <hi>No Man can come unto me, except it</hi> (the Power) <hi>were given unto him of my Father</hi> (Joh. vi. 6 5) And it is ſometimes aſcribed unto the Son. <hi>Thy People ſhall be willing in the Day of thy Power</hi> (Pſal. cx: 3) And it is neceſſarily true, that each Perſon in the God head, is the Author of every Work of God; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe each Perſon is the ſame divine Nature; and therefore the ſame undivided Principle of Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. But the Order of Operation among the diſtinct Perſons of the Trinity, follows the Order of their Subſiſtence. The Foundation or Fountain of all Grace to Mankind, is the Love of God the Father<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The meritorious or procur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Cauſe of all Grace, is Jeſus Chriſt our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; and the Application of all ſpecial Grace to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Souls, is by the Holy Ghoſt.— So that when this Work of <hi>Regeneration</hi> is aſcribed to the Father, we muſt rememb that <hi>he quickneth us by his Spirit.</hi> (Rom. viii. 7) When it is aſcribed unto the Son, we muſt alſo conſider, that he works this glorious Change, by <hi>ſending the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter to convince of Sin, of Righteouſneſs, and of
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:005163_0016_1016CB3B32FAF2F8"/>
Judgment</hi> (Joh. xvi. 7, 8) And that the whole Work of our Sanctification, whether initial in our <hi>Regeneration,</hi> or progreſſive in the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences and Fruits of it, is by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt. Being ſanctified by the Holy Ghoſt</hi> (Rom. xv. 16)</p>
            <p>If it be enquired, in what Manner the Holy Spirit operates, in procuring this Change? I anſwer, The Manner of his Operations, are like his glorious Nature, infinitely above us. Theſe <hi>Things of God knoweth no Man; but the Spirit of</hi> GOD. But if this be conſider'd, with Reſpect to the Influence that his Operations have upon our Minds, the Change is wrought by Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. He <hi>ſhines into our Hearts, to give the Light of the Knowledge of the Glory of</hi> GOD, <hi>in the Face of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> 2 Cor. iv. 6. <hi>The new Man is renewed in Knowledge, after the Image of him that created him.</hi> Col. iii. 10. It is <hi>with open Face, beholding as in a Glaſs the Glory of the</hi> LORD: <hi>that we are changed into the ſame Image.</hi> 2 Cor. iii. 18.—The <hi>Spirit of</hi> GOD diſſipates the Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Stupidity of the Mind, and gives ſuch a lively reallizing and ſenſible View of divine Things, as proves a Principle of ſpiritual Life and Operation; and actuates all the Powers and Faculties of the Soul, unto a Conformity to God; as I have more particularly conſidered elſewhere. The Operations therefore of the <hi>bleſſed Spirit,</hi> in our new Creation, are in their Effects upon our Souls, always ſenſible and diſcernible; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways felt by all that have them; tho' it be with many, the greateſt Difficulty to diſtinguiſh their
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:005163_0017_1016CB3DD8F1ECE0"/>
Quality; and to know whether they are, or are not of a ſaving Efficacy.</p>
            <p>This then is of vaſt Concernment to every one of us, that we do experience the Operations of the <hi>bleſſed Spirit</hi> upon our Hearts: That we have ſuch a feeling Impreſſion of our Guilt, Miſery and Impotence, as makes us reject all Confidence in the Fleſh: That we have ſuch a ſenſible View of the Excellency and Sufficiency of Jeſus Chriſt, as inclines us to receive him upon his own Terms; ſuch a View of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Perfections of the divine Nature, as prompts us to love God above all; and to truſt our Souls in his merciful Hands; ſuch a Diſcovery of the Beauty of Holineſs, as inclines us to be Holy in all Manner of Converſation and Godlineſs; and ſuch a lively Apprehenſion of the eternal World, as makes us <hi>look not to the Things which are ſeen and temporal; but to the Things which are unſeen and eternal.</hi>—However Men may deceive themſelves with their Reformations and moral Attainments, <hi>if they have not the Spirit of Chriſt, they are none of his.</hi>—But of this more particularly under the next Head.</p>
            <p n="4">4. I have deſcribed <hi>Regeneration,</hi> as being a new Principle, in all the Powers and Faculties of the Soul. Thus alſo is the <hi>new Creature</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in the Scriptures. <hi>Old Things are paſſed away; behold all Things are become new.</hi> (2 Cor. v. 17)—If this were conſider'd with Reſpect to each of the intellectual Powers, it will be found that they are all become new, when this Change is wrought in the Soul.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:005163_0018_1016CB40F2526688"/>Thus with Reſpect to the <hi>Underſtanding,</hi> it is not only enlarged by <hi>Regeneration;</hi> but renewed. Whence we read 1 Joh. v. 20. <hi>The Son of</hi> GOD <hi>is come; and hath given us an Underſtanding, that we may know him.</hi> Implying, that we had no <hi>Underſtanding</hi> whereby we could know him before. So likewiſe we are told, that <hi>the Eyes of our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding are enlightened, that we may know what is the Hope of his Calling</hi> (Eph. i. 18) Without this Illumination, <hi>the natural Man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not receive the Things of the Spirit of</hi> GOD; <hi>for they are Fooliſhneſs unto him, neither can he know them; becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcern'd</hi> (1 Cor. ii. 14) There is therefore a new and divine Light ſhining into the Soul, in <hi>Regeneration,</hi> enabling us to ſee Things in another Manner, than we ever did or could do before; and giving us a more ſenſible Apprehenſion of God, of Jeſus Chriſt, and of the Concerns of the eternal World, than we could before attain to. As I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready obſerved.</p>
            <p>In Conſequence of this, the <hi>Will</hi> is alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed. And the Perſon that before <hi>ſaw no Form nor Comelineſs in Chriſt, that he ſhould deſire him;</hi> and therefore <hi>would not come to him that he might have Life,</hi> has by <hi>Regeneration,</hi> ſuch a Diſcovery of his own Neceſſities and Chriſt's Excellencies, as bows his <hi>Will</hi> to the Obedience of Chriſt, to a hearty Compliance with the Goſpel Offer.— The Perſon who before was obſtinately bent upon the Gratification of his Luſts and Idols, who <hi>loved Strangers; and after them would go,</hi> has by
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:005163_0019_1016CB4284078268"/>
his <hi>new Birth,</hi> ſuch a Diſcovery of the Evil of Sin, as makes him renounce his Luſts and Idols with Abhorrence; and groan after Deliverance from their remaining Power and Tyranny. The Perſon who before, would venture Soul and Body, Time and Eternity, rather than maintain a Life of Religion, and a cloſe Walk with God; has by this wonderful Change, ſuch a Diſcovery of the Pleaſantneſs and Peace, that are to be found in the Ways of Wiſdom, that he prefers a Life of Piety and Communion with God, to all the Profits of the World; and Pleaſures of Senſe. Thus are we <hi>made willing in the Day of Chriſt's Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I muſt add, the <hi>Affections</hi> alſo are renewed, when this Change is wrought in the Soul. They who are <hi>riſen with Chriſt, have their Affections ſet upon the Things that are above, where Christ Jeſus ſits at the right Hand of</hi> GOD (Col. iii. 1, 2)</p>
            <p>They have <hi>new Deſires.</hi> Tho' they were before for <hi>fulfiling the Deſires of the Fleſh,</hi> they are now above all Things deſirous of the Favour of God, of an Intereſt in his Son, the Graces of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; and a continued Progreſs in Faith and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, until made meet for the final Gratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all their <hi>Deſires,</hi> in the Emjoyment of God for ever. It is the Language of a regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Soul in Pſal. lxxiii. 25. <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee; and there is none upon Earth, that I deſire beſides thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They have <hi>new Delights.</hi> Tho' they before delighted in their Luſts and Pleaſures, Mirth
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:005163_0020_1016CB4507C6A960"/>
and Vanity, they now <hi>delight in the Law of the Lord, after the inward Man</hi> (Rom. vii. 22)</p>
            <p>They have <hi>new Joys.</hi> Their temporal Acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions are no more the principal Matter of their Rejoicing; but they <hi>rejoice in</hi> GOD'S <hi>Salvation;</hi> and <hi>in the Hope of his Glory.</hi> This is the Subject of their chiefeſt Joy, when they find themſelves in a truly joyful Frame. They <hi>rejoice in Chriſt Jeſus, without Confidence in the Fleſh</hi> (Phil. iii. 3)</p>
            <p>They have <hi>new Hopes.</hi> They have renounced their former vain Confidences; and can no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger build their Hopes upon the ſandy Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their own Righteouſneſs, religious At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments, Purpoſes or Promiſes; but they now <hi>hope,</hi> not from what they do or ſuffer for Chriſt; but from what he has done and ſuffered for them, not from their Promiſes to him; but from his Promiſes to them. <hi>Chriſt Jeſus is their Hope.</hi> (1 Tim. i. 1) <hi>Chriſt in them is their Hope of Glory</hi> (Col. i. 27)</p>
            <p>Their Appetites are renewed, that the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous Miſer is no longer like the Horſe-leach, <hi>crying, Give, Give,</hi> no longer eagerly ſeeking great Things for himſelf; but labouring to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent himſelf with the Diſpoſals of Providence, he is <hi>ſeeking thoſe Things which are above, where Chriſt ſitteth on the right Hand of</hi> GOD (Col. iii. 1) And thus the Epicure is brought to refrain his inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate Purſuit of ſenſual Pleaſure, the Drunkard to abhor his Cups; and the unclean Perſon his laſcivious Luſts. For <hi>they that are Chriſt's, have crucified the Fleſh, with its Affections and Luſts,</hi> Gal. v. 24:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:005163_0021_1016CB46FA91E580"/>Their <hi>Paſſions</hi> are likewiſe renewed. That they no longer indulge <hi>the Fruits of the Fleſh, which are Hatred, Variance, Emulations, Wrath and Strife;</hi> but live in the Exerciſe of <hi>the Fruits of the Spirit, which are Love, Joy, Peace, Long-Suffering, Goodneſs and Meekneſs</hi> (Gal. v. 20. 21)</p>
            <p>The Bent and Biaſs of their Thoughts, and their habitual Courſe of <hi>Meditation,</hi> is changed and become <hi>new.</hi> They are no longer <hi>carnally minded, which is Death; but ſpiritually minded, which is Life and Peace</hi> (Rom. viii: 6)—So great a Change does <hi>Regeneration</hi> always make, in the whole Soul! Theſe bleſſed Fruits of this new vital Principle, are all of them experienced, in a greater or leſſer Degree, by every one that is born of God. Let no Man therefore delude his Soul with airy Dreams of a ſafe State, until he has had ſome Experience of this Change, in every particular Inſtance.—What a Pity it is, that any of you ſhould <hi>feed upon Aſhes,</hi> entertain a deluded Hope; and at laſt <hi>be found with a Lye in your right Hands!</hi>—What a Pity, that you who have now ſuch glorious Advantages in your Hands, ſhould at laſt be ſhut out of the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
            <p n="5">5. I have deſcribed <hi>Regeneration,</hi> as a new Principle, inclining and enabling the Soul to the Exerciſe of Faith in Chriſt. And thus like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe do the Scriptures conſider it. <hi>Whoſoever believeth that Jeſus is the Christ, is born of</hi> GOD. <hi>He that believeth on the Son of</hi> GOD, <hi>hath the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in himſelf</hi> (1 Joh. v. 1. 10) <hi>But as many as
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:005163_0022_1016B81E073ED3F0"/>
received him, to them gave he Power to become the Sons of God, even to them that believe on his Name, which were born not of Blood, nor of the Will of the Fleſh, nor of the Will of Man; but of</hi> GOD (Joh. i. 12, 13)—Faith in Chriſt is the firſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or vital Act of the <hi>new Creature,</hi> the firſt Grace which is exerciſed in the renewed Soul, Tho' <hi>Regeneration</hi> be conſider'd, as being in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Nature previous to Faith; yet in order of Time, they are always together. The ſame Time that the Eyes of the Soul are opened, they look to Jeſus, as the Author of our eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. The ſame Time that this <hi>new Creature</hi> is form'd, it lives; and acts Faith in the Son of God. Whence we are ſaid to be <hi>created in Chriſt</hi> (Eph. ii. 10) i. e. to be immediately united to him by Faith, at our <hi>new Creation.</hi> Upon this Account, the <hi>new Birth</hi> and <hi>Faith</hi> in Chriſt are ſpoken of in Scripture, as mutually implying each other.—The divine Light which ſhines into the Soul in <hi>Regeneration</hi> not only gives a feeling Apprehenſion of our own loſt and periſhing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: But ſuch a View of Chriſt's Readineſs to ſave; and his abundant Fulneſs to ſupply all our Wants, as conſtrains us to conſent to the Goſpel Offer; and encourages us to truſt all our Intereſts in his Hands. This Diſcovery, brings the Soul to a hearty Aſſent to the Truth of the Goſpel, a chearful Conſent to the Terms of the Goſpel; and a ſteady Reliance upon Chriſt, as the only Foundation of our Hope.— It brings the Soul to receive him in all his Offices, as our
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:005163_0023_1016CB4C577C40B8"/>
Prophet to teach and guide us by his Council, as our Prieſt to attone for our Offences; and to be our Righteouſneſs before God, as our King to ſanctify our Souls; and to rule and reign in our Hearts. — It brings the Soul to receive him, notwithſtanding any Difficulties that may attend the chriſtian Life; and to ſubmit, not only to wear his Yoak; but to take up his Croſs and follow him. — This receiving of Chriſt unites us to him, as the Branch is united to the Vine. Whence by a vital Union to this Stock, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive future Supplies of Life and Nouriſhment from him; and are enabled to live in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of all the Graces of the Spirit of God; and <hi>to glorify our heavenly Father, by bringing forth much Fruit,</hi> By theſe new Supplies received from Chriſt, the Believer <hi>walks by Faith; and not by Sight</hi> (2 Cor. v. 7) <hi>And the Life which he now lives in the Fleſh, is by the Faith of the Son of</hi> GOD (Gal. ii. 20.)</p>
            <p>Thus it appears to be of laſt Conſequence to every one, to have this Witneſs in himſelf, that he is born of God. For <hi>without Faith it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to pleaſe</hi> GOD. (Heb. xi. 5) <hi>He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves not ſhall be damned</hi> (Mark xvi. 16)—With what ſolemn Care and Sollicitude ſhould we then ſee to it, that we build our eternal Hope upon no other Foundation than the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that we fly for Refuge to this Hope ſet before us, that we heartily comply with the Offer he makes of himſelf and his ſaving Benefits; and <hi>are found in him, not having on our own
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:005163_0024_1016CB4F686FBAF8"/>
Righteouſneſs which is of the Law; but that which is thro' the Faith of Chriſt, the Righteouſneſs which is of</hi> GOD <hi>by Faith.</hi> It will be amazing beyond all Apprehenſion, to be found among Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in the Day of Chriſt; and with them to be ſhut out of the Kingdom of God.</p>
            <p n="6">6. I conſider <hi>Regeneration</hi> as a Principle of <hi>new Obedience</hi> to God. And thus likewiſe doth the Scriptures conſider it. <hi>He that hath this Hope in him, purifieth himſelf as he is pure</hi> (1 Joh. iii. 3) <hi>Whoſoever is born of</hi> GOD, <hi>doth not commit Sin; for his Seed remaineth in him; and he cannot Sin, becauſe he is born of</hi> GOD (verſe 9) — It is a falſe and groundleſs Calumny, to repreſent this Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine under Conſideration, or the Profeſſors of it, as opening a Door to Licentiouſneſs, or <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging Men to Sin, that Grace may abound.</hi> The Caſe is quite otherwiſe. And this Principle of which I ſpeak, is a continued Source of vital Piety, a living Fountain of Holineſs both in Heart and Life. He that is <hi>born of</hi> GOD, hates every falſe Way, maintains a ſtrict Watch over his Affections, Appetites, Paſſions, Words and Actions, cuts off his right Hand and Foot; and plucks out his right Eye, when they offend him, maintains no Reſerve of ſecret and darling Luſts; but abhors and rejects them all, and groans under the Burthen of his remaining Corruptions, with ſuch Language as that (Rom. vii. 24) <hi>O wretched Man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the Body of this Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:005163_0025_1016CB5160431C08"/>He that is truly <hi>regenerate, watches at Chriſt's Gates; and waits at the Posts of his Doors.</hi> He conſcienciouſly endeavours to be found in a ſincere and acceptable Performance of every known Duty; and to <hi>walk in all the Commandments and Ordinances of the Lord blameleſs.</hi> For he <hi>has inclined his Heart to keep</hi> GOD'S <hi>Statutes always, even unto the End</hi> (Pſal. cxix. 112)</p>
            <p>He that is <hi>born of God,</hi> is of a kind, charitable, forgiving and beneficial Spirit towards his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; and has a peculiar Love of Complacency to all of whatever Denomination, that appear to be the Children of God. <hi>By this we know, that we are paſſed from Death to Life, becauſe we love the Brethren. He that loveth not his Brother, abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in Death</hi> (1 Joh. iii. 14)</p>
            <p>He that is <hi>born again,</hi> is a Man of ſtricteſt Juſtice and Honeſty, in all his Dealings, and will by no Temptation, be led into the Practice of Violence, or known Fraud and Deceit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Neighbour; knowing that GOD <hi>is the Avenger of all ſuch</hi> (1 Theſſ. iv. 6)</p>
            <p>He that is <hi>born again,</hi> endeavours to fill up every Relation, with Duty; and to demean him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in each Station he ſuſtains, whether ſacred, civil, or domeſtic; and in each Circumſtance of Life, whether ſuperior, inferior, or equal, as becomes the excellent Religion he profeſſes; and the Vocation by which he is called — In a Word, he <hi>herein exerciſes himſelf, to have always a Conſcience void of Offence towards</hi> GOD; <hi>and towards Man</hi> (Acts xxiv. 16)—It is true, there
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:005163_0026_1016CB54756860E8"/>
will a great deal of ſinful Imperfection accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany his higheſt Attainments; but this is his Grief and Burthen. This is what he neither does, nor can approve and indulge.</p>
            <p>Theſe my Brethren, are the Characters of every Child of God; and they who have them them not, whatever Pretences they may make to Religion, whatever Progreſs they may make in Shews of Devotion, whatever internal Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences they may pretend to, are yet in a State of Death; and Heirs of eternal Deſtruction and Miſery. For <hi>whoſoever doth not Righteouſneſs, is not of</hi> GOD; <hi>nor he that loveth not his Brother</hi> 1 Joh. iii. 10.—From whence it appears with the ſtrongeſt Evidence, that without theſe Marks of the regenerate State, you <hi>cannot ſee the Kingdom of</hi> GOD.</p>
            <p>I now proceed to conſider,</p>
            <p n="3">III. Whence it is, that the Change under Conſideration is called a <hi>new Birth;</hi> or a being <hi>born again.</hi> To illuſtrate this, I ſhall briefly take Notice of a few Particulars wherein the Propriety of this Mode of ſpeaking will evidently appear.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It may be called a <hi>new Birth,</hi> becauſe it brings a Perſon into a new State of Exiſtence. As the Birth of an Infant brings it into a new World; and into a State in every Reſpect altogether new. So in the Caſe before us, <hi>Regeneration</hi> is the Renewal of the whole Soul; and therefore brings a Man in all ſpiritual Reſpects, into a new Kind or State of Being. On this Account, it is called in Scripture the <hi>new Creature;</hi> or the <hi>new Man.</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:005163_0027_1016CB5607A36220"/>
Not that we are to ſuppoſe, there is hereby given us any other Powers or Faculties of the Soul, than we had before; but that thoſe Powers which we had before, are made ſpiritually new. It is not a natural; but a moral and ſpiritual new Birth. He that was before in a State of Guilt, has now by <hi>Regeneration, his Heart ſprinkled from an evil Conſcience.</hi> He that was before under the damning Sentence of the Law, ſhall now no more <hi>enter into Condemnation.</hi> He that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Child of Wrath, is now <hi>at Peace with God;</hi> and <hi>made nigh by the Blood of Christ.</hi> He that was before altogether Pollution and Defilement, is now <hi>waſhed and ſanctified, in the Name of our Lord Jeſus; and by the Spirit of our God.</hi> And in Fine. He that before was of his Father the Devil, is now a Child of God; and belongs to his Houſhold and Family. O bleſſed Change! Bleſſed are they of the Lord, who are the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of it! This is coming into a new World indeed; and may well be called being <hi>born again.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. It may be called a <hi>new Birth,</hi> as it brings a Perſon into a new Capacity for ſpiritual Action. As the Birth of a Child gives it the Power to exerciſe the proper Functions of Life; and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables it to breathe, to cry, to eat and drink, to move; and ſucceſſively in their Time and Order, to perform the ſeveral Operations for which it was made: So this <hi>new Birth</hi> (as I have already obſerved) gives us a Capacity to exerciſe the ſeveral Graces; and to perform in a ſpiritual
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:005163_0028_1016CB57D0BAA760"/>
Manner, the ſeveral Duties of the chriſtian Life: Whilſt unrenewed, we are no more capable of the Exerciſe of Grace, than the Child unborn is of natural Operations. <hi>Without me</hi> (ſays Chriſt) <hi>ye can do nothing</hi> (Joh. xv. 5) But when <hi>rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate</hi> and united to Chriſt, we can act from a new Principle, from new Motives, in a new Manner; and to a new End; and are enabled <hi>to walk in Newneſs of Life</hi> (Rom. vi. 4) Whence we are ſaid to be <hi>created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good Works</hi> (Eph. ii. 10) Our Works before could not pleaſe God (<hi>Heb.</hi> xi. 6) But now they are <hi>accepted in the Beloved</hi> (Eph. i. 6) Thus then we are <hi>born again,</hi> as we are brought <hi>thro' Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the Spirit, unto Obedience</hi> (as 1 Pet. i. 2)</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is called a <hi>new Birth,</hi> as it makes us Heirs of an eternal Inheritance: As the King's eldeſt Son, is born an Heir to his Crown. So as ſoon as we are <hi>Children, we are Heirs: Heirs of God; and joint Heirs with Chriſt</hi> (Rom. viii <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>7) Thus are we ſaid to be <hi>begotten</hi> (or as it is in the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, <hi>to be born) again, to an Inheritance incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible and undefiled, that fadeth not away</hi> (1 Pet. i. 3)—O how great is the Dignity, how glorious the Privilege and Hope, of all that have expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced this Change! <hi>Beloved now we are the Sons of God; and it doth not yet appear what we ſhall be; but we know that when he ſhall appear, we ſhall be like him; for we ſhall ſee him as he is</hi> (1 Joh. iii. 2)</p>
            <p n="4">4. This Change may be called a <hi>new Birth,</hi> with Reſpect to its inſtantaneous Production: As it is true in every Moment of Time, that a
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:005163_0029_1016CB5BA7AE0520"/>
Child either is, or is not born. So it is equally true, in every Moment of a Man's Life, that he is either in a regenerate; or in an unregenerate State. Whatever Oppoſition this may meet with in the World, there can be no Demonſtration in <hi>Euclid</hi> more evident, than this Truth. It is impoſſible but that every Man in the World, muſt always, every Moment of his Life, be either converted or unconverted, a Believer or an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believer, a Child or God, or a Child of the Devil. There is no Medium. And one of theſe is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly at this Inſtant, the State and Condition of every one of my Hearers. <hi>Ye are not in the Fleſh; but in the Spirit, if ſo be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. But if ye have not the Spirit of Chriſt, ye are none of his</hi> (Rom. viii. 9)</p>
            <p n="5">5. It may be called the <hi>new Birth,</hi> with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to our being altogether paſſive in its Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction. As the Infant has no Hand at all, no Manner of Agency or Efficiency, in his own Birth. So in the preſent Caſe, tho' we have a great deal to do, that we may be found in the Way, in which we may hope to have this Change wrought in us: Yet the Charge itſelf is God's own immediate Efficiency, the Diſplay of his almighty Power, in which we can have no active Concurrence. As in the Creation of the World, the Creature could have no Hand in giving Being to itſelf. So in <hi>Regeneration,</hi> we can have no Hand in making ourſelves <hi>new Creatures.</hi> This demands our moſt ſerious Attention; and ſhould have ſuch an Influence upon our Minds, as will
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:005163_0030_1016CB5D36ADA288"/>
bring us to the Foot of God's Sovereign Grace. For let poor Potſherds of the Earth, contend as much as they will with their Maker, they will yet find it true, that <hi>it is not in him that willeth, nor in him that runneth; but in God that ſheweth Mercy</hi> (Rom. ix. 16)</p>
            <p>I am now</p>
            <p n="4">IV. To give the Reaſons why it is ſo, that the <hi>Unregenerate cannot ſee the Kingdom of God.</hi> And I ſhall briefly obſerve, that it is ſo in an eſpecial Manner, for theſe two Reaſons follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe theſe can have no Righteouſneſs to juſtify them in the Sight of God. They have no Faith in Chriſt; and are therefore <hi>condemn'd already</hi> (Joh. iii. 18) And how can they attone for their innumerable Sins; and expiate the mountainous Load of Guilt that lies upon their Souls? How can they procure the Favour of God; and get into an Eſtate of Reconciliation and Friendſhip with him? How can they purchaſe a Title to the eternal Inheritance? There is Sin enough cleaves to their beſt Duties, to encreaſe their Debt to divine Juſtice; and to widen the Breach between God and them. All they can do, is therefore very far from Purchaſing the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God; or giving them a Claim to his Salvation. There is Nothing can anſwer the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of Juſtice, but the perfect Righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt; and this they have no Intereſt in. They have not received the Lord Jeſus Chriſt by Faith; and therefore can have no Power
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:005163_0031_1016CB5EC821DD08"/>
to become the Sons of God. They conſequently remain (and while unregenerate they muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main) in a State of Enmity to God. And will God admit his Enemies into his Kingdom? No! ſuch as theſe are to expect that terrible Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, from the Mouth of their Judge (Luk. xix: 27) <hi>Thoſe mine Enemies, that would not I ſhould reign over them, bring hither, and ſlay them before me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe they are utterly unqualified for that glorious Kingdom. That's a Kingdom, where <hi>no unclean Thing ſhall enter.</hi> What has a Swine from a miry Sty, to do in a Prince's Palace, or a more filthy and polluted Soul in the Palace of the King of Kings?— God is a holy God, Heaven is a holy Place, the Saints and Angels forever exerciſed there in the moſt holy Employments. There is therefore no Room for unrenewed and unſanctified Souls.— Beſides, the Unregenerate are altogether uncapable of the Bleſſedneſs of the heavenly World. There is Nothing there to gratify their carnal Deſires: Nothing, but what is ſo contrary to the Diſpoſitions of their Souls, that it would render 'em miſerable if it were attainable. We muſt therefore all of us be renewed, and become holy in Heart and Life, If we would ever be admitted to the Perfection of Holineſs, in the Kingdom of God. For the Decree will quickly bring forth. <hi>He that is unjuſt, let him be unjuſt ſtill; and he that is filthy, let him be filthy ſtill</hi> (Rev. xxii. 11)</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:005163_0032_1016CB6153BB7F98"/>I now proceed to make ſome practical Reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, upon what has been ſaid. And</p>
            <p n="1">1. This adminiſters Matter of Conviction and of moſt awakening Concern, to much the greateſt Part of the profeſſing World, in that it is viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and undoubtedly true, that there are but few of the numerous Profeſſors of Chriſtianity, that have ever entred into this ſtraight Gate which leads to the Kingdom of God. There are but few among thoſe who enjoy the greateſt Privileges, and entertain enlarged Hopes of Salvation, that have been <hi>born again,</hi> and thereby <hi>made meet for an Inheritance with the Saints in Light.</hi> As this is true of the goſpelized World in general, ſo may it be preſumed to be alſo true, with Reſpect to thoſe who are now here before the Lord. And can ſuch of you my Brethren, enjoy Peace and Security, who are yet in ſuch a State and Condition, as to be under the Guilt of Sin the Wrath of God, the Tyranny of Satan, and the Empire of Death and Hell!— I have ſhewn you the Nature and Neceſſity of the <hi>new Birth.</hi> I have prov'd the Whole to you from that Standard of all Truth <hi>the Word of God.</hi> I have not been pleading for a Sect or Party. <hi>I have not handled the Word of</hi> GOD <hi>deceitfully;</hi> but have endeavour'd <hi>the Manifeſtation of the Truth to every Man's Conſcience, in the Sight of</hi> GOD. And now I can with Confidence teſtify to you, that the <hi>new Birth</hi> which I have deſcribed, is <hi>the true Grace of</hi> GOD, <hi>in which you muſt ſtand</hi>— The Doctrine I know is exceeding repugnant to
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:005163_0033_1016CB62E1B33E38"/>
Men's carnal Minds; and therefore meets with greateſt Oppoſition. But it is the Doctrine of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, a Doctrine which he will vindicate, when you and I muſt ſtand before his Tribunal. Well then dear Souls! Conſider what Proſpect you have of the heavenly Inheritance. You hope to be ſaved. But have you experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced the <hi>new Birth,</hi> as it has been deſcribed to you? I ſummon your Conſciences in the Name and Fear of God, to give an impartial Anſwer to this Demand. You have heard the ſeveral Properties and Characters of this ſaving Change. Now then look into your own Hearts, and ſee if you can find them there. If not, how dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful is your State, how exceeding great is the Danger of your being ſhut out of the Kingdom of Heaven forever! And can you ſtill <hi>ſleep upon the Top of the Maſt of a Ship!</hi> Can you ſtill <hi>cry Peace Peace, when ſudden Deſtruction is ready to come upon you, as Travail upon a Woman with Child, whence you cannot eſcape! Be aſtoniſhed O ye Heavens,</hi> at the Security and Stupidity of ſuch a Generation as this! <hi>What meaneſt thou O Sleeper, ariſe call upon the Lord, if ſo be that God will think upon thee, that thou periſh not! Awake thou that ſleepeſt; and ariſe from the Dead, that Chriſt may give thee Light.</hi> (Eph. v: 14)</p>
            <p n="2">2. This ſhews us the dreadful Miſchief of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing miſguided by a deceitful Miniſtry; and thereby obtaining Hopes of Heaven, without this ſaving Change, which is (by the Verdict of our Lord himſelf) of laſt Neceſſity to all, that
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:005163_0034_1016CB6771159CE0"/>
would ever attain to that bleſſed Inheritance. The laſt <hi>perillous Times</hi> are come, wherein <hi>many falſe Prophets are gone out into the World.</hi>—What Oppoſition does the faithful Preaching of this moſt important Doctrine meet with, even from thoſe who by the moſt ſacred Bonds, are ſet for the Defence of it. What Danger appears before us from our formal <hi>Laodiceans,</hi> who would quiet Men's Conſciences with a mere Form of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, without the Power. And ſome of theſe would even put poor ſleepy Sinners into a vain Dream of their having already received a <hi>baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Regeneration;</hi> and thence encourage their Hopes of a ſafe State, merely from their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, or (as it is expreſſed by a late Author) from their being upon the improving Hand, in gaining Ground of their Vices and Paſſions: And thus, the Neceſſity of the converting and the renewing Influences of the bleſſed Spirit; and of a vital Union to Chriſt by Faith, begins to be left out of our Creed; and Sinners are flattered with an Imagination of Safety, without experiencing either the one or the other. But with Reſpect to ſuch Teachers as theſe, I muſt warn you in the Apoſtle's Language (2 Tim. iii. 5) <hi>From ſuch turn away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beware of any Preachers or Books, that aſcribe any Sufficiency to yourſelves; or that would leſſen your Apprehenſions of your loſt, undone, guilty, periſhing, impotent, and helpleſs State by Nature. — For you are <hi>by Nature Children of Wrath</hi> (Eph. ii. 3) You are <hi>all under Sin</hi> (Rom. ii. 9)
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:005163_0035_1016CB6902CF21A8"/>
and all <hi>without Strength</hi> (Rom. v. 6) And you muſt <hi>humble yourſelves</hi> under a deep Senſe of this, <hi>if you would be exalted</hi> (Luk. xviii. 14)</p>
            <p>Beware of any Teachers that would leſſen your Apprehenſions of the Freeneſs and Sovereignty of the divine Grace. For God is abſolutely Sovereign, in the Donation of his own Favours; And if he beſtows ſpecial Grace upon any, it is <hi>even becauſe it ſo ſeemed good in his Sight</hi> (Mat. xi. 26) And you muſt come to a feeling Senſe that you lye at Mercy, before you have this great Change wrought in you.</p>
            <p>Beware of thoſe Teachers, that ſpeak againſt, and eſpecially thoſe that ridicule and banter experimental Religion. For the Change I am treating of, is a ſenſible Change (as I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd before) and the Operations of the Spirit of God are ſenſible Operations. And you muſt therefore never content yourſelves (leſt you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude your Souls with a vain Hope) until you have ſenſible Diſcoveries of Chriſt's Sufficiency; and of your hearty Compliance with the Goſpel Offer, until you experience the Fruits of the bleſſed Spirit in your Heart and Life; and until your <hi>Experience begetteth Hope</hi> (Rom. v. 4) and you <hi>thereby know that he abideth in you, by the Spirit which he hath given you</hi> (1 Joh. iii. 24)—It is from Compaſſion to your precious Souls, that I give you Warning of theſe Things; and teſtify to you, that (let Men ſay what they will) your eternal Intereſts are immediately concern'd. And this you muſt be convinc'd of firſt or laſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="unknown:005163_0036_1016CB6BAC8A30F0"/>You may perhaps object, that you are preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced againſt theſe Doctrines, by ſome Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders to 'em, who ſeem to place their Religion in certain Degrees of Heat and Flame, in ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary Impulſes, Raptures, and Extaſies, who ſeem to <hi>think highly of themſelves; and to deſpiſe others;</hi> and who are in the Practice of ſuch a cenſorious Judging of others, as is directly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the Rules of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>I wiſh there were no Grounds for this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint. It muſt be acknowledged and lamented, that there has been too much of this Kind among us, that has given an Occaſion to the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries of ſpecial Grace to triumph. It ſeems very much owing to this, that inſtead of the joyful Tidings which we have lately had, of many <hi>enquiring the Way to Zion, with their Faces thitherwards; our, Souls are now exceedingly filled with the Scorning of thoſe that are at Eaſe; and with the Contempt of the Proud.</hi> — But is this a reaſonable Objection againſt the Doctrines you have heard? Will you reject the Doctrines, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Men have abuſed them? Becauſe ſome influenced by a warm Imagination, have run into one Extream, will you run into the other, to your eternal Perdition?—<hi>I beſeech you Brethren, that you ben't ſoon ſhaken in Mind or troubled, by any Attempts of the little Foxes that ſpoil the Vines. Let no Man beguile you of your Reward, neither by frustrating the Grace of</hi> GOD, <hi>as if Righteouſneſs came by the Law; and ſo Chriſt is dead in vain: Nor by intruding into thoſe Things which they have

not ſeen, being vainly puff'd up in their fleſhly Mind.</hi>

            <p>You may be ſurprized with a Review, of the Greatneſs and Aggravations of your paſt Sins. But have you not ſincerely mourned for 'em all; and renounced them without Reſerve? Can't you truly ſay, that they are the Matter of your greateſt Abhorrence; and that you would not commit them again for all the World? Don't you long and groan after a Deliverance from Sin?—Do then that Honour to the Redeemer's Blood, as to depend upon it for Cleanſing from all your Sins. Do that Honour to God's infinite Grace, as to depend upon it, that <hi>where your Sins have abounded, his Grace ſhall abound much more</hi> (1 Joh. i. 7) Rom. v. 20)</p>

            </p>
            <p>Let me then entreat you, to realize your Miſery and Danger. Set apart ſome Time every Day to meditate upon the vaſt Number and Aggravations of your Sins, the dreadful Weight of your Guilt, the terrible Wrath of an angry God, which hangs over your Heads; and the amazing Eternity which you are haſtning into. Meditate theſe Things, till they excite in you a ſerious, earneſt, and laſting Enquiry after an Eſcape from the Wrath to come: For indeed poor Souls, <hi>it is a fearful Thing to fall into the Hands of the living God</hi> (Heb, x. 31)</p>

            <head>REMARKS On a Diſcourſe of Dr. <hi>Waterland</hi>'s, entitled, <hi>Regeneration ſtated and explain'd, according to Scripture and Antiquity.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>AVING in the proceeding Sermon, ſomething diſtinctly conſider'd the Nature and Neceſſity of Regeneration, there will be no Occaſion to take particular Notice of all that's exceptionable in Dr. <hi>Waterland</hi>'s Diſcourſe upon that Subject. I ſhall therefore endeavour no more, than briefly to ſhew in the General, that the Foundation upon which he builds his Hypotheſis is falſe and deceitful; that his Doctrines are erroneous and dangerous, and his Arguments weak and inconcluſive. For this is ſufficient to reſcue thoſe from the perillous Deluſion, who have a juſt Value for their immortal Souls, without making any ſpecial Remarks, upon many particular Errors, ſtrongly aſſerted, without any other Evidence, than the great Name and Character of the Author.</p>
            <p>The Diſcourſe I am conſidering, is the Subſtance of two Sermons, preached from Tit. iii. 5. <hi>Not by Works of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſ, which we have done; but according to his Mercy he ſaved us, by the Waſhing of Regeneration, and the Renewing of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Dr. interprets <hi>the Waſhing (or Laver) of Regeneration in this Text, of Water Baptiſm, as</hi> (he tells us) <hi>the Antients always did; and the Rules of true Criticiſm require</hi> (pag. 2) and underſtands <hi>this latter Part of the Text, to be nearly parallel
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:005163_0044_1016CB7E589D5C70"/>
to thoſe Words of our Lord, except a Man be born of Water and the Spirit he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi> (p. 4)</p>
            <p>In conſidering this Caſe, I ſhall firſt give my Reaſons, why I can't underſtand either of theſe Texts of a baptiſmal Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and then proceed to ſhew, that if they are to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood as referring to Water Baptiſm, they will prove no Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for the Doctrines, Dr. <hi>Waterland</hi> pretends to build upon them.</p>
            <p>To begin with that in Tit. iii. 5. Why may not the <hi>Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Regeneration,</hi> be here underſtood of the firſt Converſion of a Sinner, whereby he is (as it were in a Laver) cleanſed from the former Pollution and Defilement of his Sins; and the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> be underſtood of a progreſſive Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; or elſe the latter Clauſe be conſider'd as exegetical of the former, ſhewing us, that <hi>the Waſhing of Regeneration,</hi> is by the <hi>Renewing of the Holy Ghoſt?</hi> The Dr. tells us that <hi>the Rules of true Criticiſm require,</hi> that it ſhould be otherwiſe underſtood. But certain it is, that the Rules of true Criticiſm do not require that numerous Places of Scripture, both in the old Teſtament and the New, parallel to the Words before us, ſhould be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in the Senſe he pleads for: But on the Contrary make it neceſſary, that they muſt be underſtood in the View which I now propoſe. To exemplify this. That Text in Ezek. xxxvi. 25, 26, 27. muſt neceſſarily be underſtood, according to my Interpretation of the Words under Conſideration; and cannot by any rational and modeſt Conſtruction, be forc'd into the Dr's Scheme. <hi>Then will I ſprinkle clean Water upon you; and make you clean from all your Filthineſs; and from all your Idols will I cleanſe you. A new Heart alſo will I give you; and a new Spirit will I put within you. And I will take away the ſtony Heart out of your Fleſh; and I will give you an Heart of Fleſh. And I will put my Spirit within you; and cauſe you to walk in my Statutes; and keep my Judgments and do them.</hi>—In theſe Words it is plainly viſible, that by <hi>ſprinkling with clean Water,</hi> muſt be underſtood the firſt Change made by Converſion and Regeneration; that Change by which <hi>a new Heart is given,</hi> and a <hi>new Spirit put within</hi> the happy Recipients of it; and <hi>the ſtony Heart taken out of their Fleſh; and a Heart of Fleſh given them.</hi> This then, is <hi>the Waſhing of Regeneration.</hi> And
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:005163_0045_1016CB8127840338"/>
is not God's <hi>putting his Spirit within them; and cauſing them to walk in his Statutes, and keep his Judgments and do them,</hi> a progreſſive Work of Sanctification; or <hi>the Renewing of the Holy Ghoſt?</hi>—I can't ſee any Appearance of Reaſon, why thoſe Words in Tit. iii. 5. mayn't be interpreted, as theſe ſo appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently parallel to 'em, muſt be interpreted. — If indeed this were the only Place in Scripture, were <hi>Waſhing</hi> with Water; and the <hi>Renewing of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> were to be underſtood in the Senſe I plead for, the Caſe were more diſputable; but a diſtinct View of this Matter will plainly ſhew us, that the like Phraſeology has this conſtant and invariable Meaning, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Bible. Thus for Inſtance in Iſa. xliv. 3. <hi>I will pour Water upon him that is thirſty, and Floods upon the dry Ground. I will pour my Spirit upon thy Seed, and my Bleſſing upon thing Offspring.</hi> Iſa. lii. 15. <hi>So ſhall he ſprinkle many Nations.</hi> Pſal. li. 7.10. <hi>Waſh me, and I ſhall be whiter than the Snow. Create in me a clean Heart O God, and renew a right Spirit within me.</hi> Joh. xiii. 8. <hi>If I waſh thee not, thou haſt no Part with me.</hi> 1 Cor. vi. 11. <hi>But ye are waſhed, but ye are ſanctified, but ye are juſtified in the Name of the Lord Jeſus, and by the Spirit of our God.</hi> Heb. x. 22. <hi>Having our Hearts ſprinkled from an evil Conſcience, and our Bodies waſhed with pure Water.</hi> Many other Texts to the ſame Purpoſe, might be cited; but it is needleſs to enlarge.</p>
            <p>If it be enquired, why this Metaphor of ſprinkling or waſhing with Water is ſo conſtantly uſed, to repreſent our <hi>Regeneration,</hi> or that new Principle, whereby we are brought to the Exerciſe of Faith in Chriſt, and to a Life of Holineſs. I anſwer, there is ſuch a lively Reſemblance, between the Waſhing away of external Defilement with Water, and the Purifying our Hearts from internal Pollution, by Faith in the Blood of Chriſt, as renders this Way of ſpeaking moſt pertinent, plain and familiar. And accordingly, the Apoſtle in the ninth Chapter to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews, particularly ſhews us, that all the legal Purifications among the Jews, were Types and Prefigurations of the Blood of Chriſt, by which (when received by Faith) <hi>our Conſciences are purged from dead Works to ſerve the living God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another Reaſon why I cannot underſtand the Dr's Text, in the Senſe which he pleads for, is becauſe <hi>Regeneration</hi> or the
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:005163_0046_1016CB83DA37A3B0"/>
               <hi>new Birth,</hi> is ſo very often ſpoken of in Scripture, without any Referrence to Water-Baptiſm; and conſequently ought in like Manner to be underſtood, in the Words before us. Thus Joh. i. 13. <hi>Which were born, not of Blood, nor of the Will of the Fleſh, nor of the Will of Man, but of God.</hi> Gal. iv. 29. <hi>But as then, he that was born after the Fleſh, perſecuted him that was born after the Spirit, even ſo it is now.</hi> 1 Pet. 1.23. <hi>Being born again, not of corrptible Seed; but of incorruptible, by the Word of God, which liveth and abideth forever.</hi> 1 Joh. iii. 9. <hi>Whoſoever is born of God, doth not commit Sin. For his Seed remaineth in him; and he cannot Sin, becauſe he is born of God.</hi> 1 Joh. v. 4, 18. <hi>For whatſoever is born of God, overcometh the World. — We know that whoſoever is born of God, ſinneth not.</hi> In all which Texts, where the <hi>new Birth</hi> is expreſly mention'd, there is not the leaſt Appearance of any Reference to Water Baptiſm. And this will further appear to be the Caſe, if we take Notice of ſeveral Paſſages of Scripture, where the ſame Thing is ſpoken of in different Terms. For Inſtance, to be <hi>begotten of God,</hi> gives us the very ſame Idea with <hi>Regeneration,</hi> or the <hi>new Birth;</hi> and is not only uſed in the very ſame Senſe, but is the very ſame Word in the Original, wherever it occurs. 1 Joh. v. 18. <hi>We know, that whoſoever is born of God, ſinneth not; but he that is begotten of God, keepeth himſelf, and that wicked One toucheth him not.</hi> 1 Pet. 1.3. <hi>Hath begotten us again, to a lively Hope.</hi> Jam. 1.18. <hi>Of his own Will begat he us, with the Word of Truth.</hi> 1 Joh. v. 1. <hi>Whoſoever believeth that Jeſus is the Chriſt, is born of God: And every one that loveth <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> allow'd, that thoſe Texts of Scripture which ſpeak of our being <hi>created anew,</hi> or becoming <hi>new Creatures,</hi> or <hi>new Men,</hi> muſt ſignify, the very ſame Thing, with being <hi>born again,</hi> or <hi>born of God,</hi> ſince both the one and the other, are Metaphors uſed to the ſame Purpoſe, with a Deſign to repreſent our being brought into a new State, as then (in a ſpiritual Senſe) begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to exit, or to have Life. And if all ſuch Paſſages of Scripture <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> diſtinctly conſider'd, not one of them will be found to have <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Reference to <hi>Baptiſm.</hi> To exemplify this. We read <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Cor. v. 17. <hi>If any Man be in Chriſt he is a new Creature; old Things are paſſed away, behold all Things are
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:005163_0047_1016CB862E254F08"/>
become new.</hi> Gal. vi. 15, <hi>For in Chriſt Jeſus, neither Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion availeth any Thing; nor Uncircumciſion: but the new Creature.</hi> Eph. i. 10. <hi>For we are his Workmanſhip, created in Chriſt Jeſus, unto good Works.</hi> Col. iii. 10. <hi>And have put on the new-Man, which is renewed in Knowledge, after the Image of him that created him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now upon this View of the Caſe, what Manner of Reaſon can be aſſigned, why the <hi>Waſhing of Regeneration,</hi> muſt ſignify <hi>Baptiſm?</hi> Muſt it be ſo, becauſe the Word <hi>Waſhing</hi> or <hi>Laver,</hi> muſt be literally underſtood and neceſſarily carries the Idea of <hi>Water</hi> in it? We find, by many Inſtances of the like Uſe of the ſame Way of Speaking in Scripture, that this Concluſion can by no Means be juſtified. This Expreſſion therefore, muſt not be taken in a literal, but in a metaphorical and ſpiritual Senſe. —Muſt it be ſo, becauſe the Nature of the Thing does ſuppoſe and require this Interpretation? This Suppoſal alſo, appears to have no Foundation, as has been fully and clearly exemplified — If therefore it be a good Rule, to interpret Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by Scripture; if we are ordinarily to find out the Meaning of a particular Text of Scripture, by the conſtant and inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable Uſe of the ſame Manner of Diction, in other Parts of the Bible; this Notion of a <hi>baptiſmal Regeneration,</hi> has no Foundation at all in the Word of God.</p>
            <p>If we ſhould proceed to compare the Characters of the <hi>new Birth,</hi> in thoſe Scripture Paſſages which I have cited, with Dr. <hi>Waterland</hi>'s Account of it, we ſhall find ſtill further Evidence, of his Miſinterpretation of the Text in Queſtion. For Inſtance.</p>
            <p>To be <hi>born of God,</hi> in the Scripture Account of it, implies that vital Principle, whereby we are enabled to believe in Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Whoſoever believeth that Jeſus is the Chriſt is born of God.</hi> 1 Joh. v. 1. but in Dr. <hi>Waterland</hi>'s Account of it. A Man may be regenerat<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>who receives Baptiſm (like</hi> Simon Magus <hi>ſuppoſe) in Hypocriſy or Impenitency;</hi> when <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and Grace, and all Goſpel Privileges, are conditionally made-over to them, tho' not actually applied, by Reaſon of their Diſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications.</hi> (from p. 27 to p. 30)—That is in plain Terms, he may be regenerated, without any actual Application of any of the ſaving Graces of the Spirit of God. And on the other
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:005163_0048_1016CB88D3933330"/>
Hand. Faith in Jeſus Chriſt, is (according to him) ſo far from being an Evidence of Regeneration, that a Man may have Faith in Chriſt, before he is born of God. <hi>Preventing Grace</hi> (ſays he) <hi>muſt go before, to work in the Man Faith and Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, which are Qualifications previous to Baptiſm.</hi> Theſe he calls <hi>the firſt and loweſt Degrees of Renovation.</hi> (p. 13) He again tells us, that <hi>an Adult, coming to Baptiſm fitly prepar'd by Faith and Repentance; and afterwards perſevering to the End, —He is not yet</hi> (before Baptiſm) <hi>buried with Chriſt into Death, nor planted in the Likeneſs of his Reſurrection; nor indeed cloathed with the baptiſmal Garment; and therefore in ſtrictneſs, he is not a Member of Chriſt, nor a Child of God.</hi> (p. 20. 22)</p>
            <p>In the ſcripture Account of Regeneration, <hi>whoſoever is born of God, doth not commit Sin; for his Seed remaineth in him, and he cannot Sin, becauſe he is born of God. He keepeth himſelf, and that wicked One toucheth him not.</hi> 1 Joh. iii, 9, 18. But in the Dr's Account, a Man that is regenerated, may be ſo far from having the Seed of God REMAIN in him, and from keeping himſelf that the wicked One ſhall not touch him, that <hi>he may Revolt from God, either for a Time, or for ever</hi> (p. 12.)</p>
            <p>In the ſcripture Account of <hi>Regeneration,</hi> it is wrought in the Soul by the Word of God, as the ordinary Means, by which we are brought into the new Life. <hi>Of his own Will begat he us, by the Word of Truth.</hi> Jam 1.18. <hi>Being born again, not of corruptible Seed, but of incorruptible, by the Word of God.</hi> 1 Pet. i. 23. But in the Dr's Account of it, <hi>the Holy Spirit, in and by the Uſe of Water Baptiſm, cauſes the new Birth</hi> (p. 3)</p>
            <p>Moreover from the ſcripture Account of this Change, the happy Partaker of it, lives a Life of Holineſs and new Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. <hi>He ſinneth not, He overcometh the World. He lives in the Love of God and his Brethren. Old Things are paſſed away, and all Things are become new.</hi> He <hi>is created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good Works, which God hath before ordained, that he ſhould walk in them,</hi> as appears from the Texts before cited. But on the Contrary, the Dr. ſuppoſeth, that <hi>the Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate may finally fall from Grace</hi> (p. 18 in the Margin) And that ſuch as have been ſavingly regenerated may <hi>fall away by Deſertion and Diſobedience;</hi> and that <hi>a Perſon once ſavingly

regenerated, may afterwards loſe all the ſalutary Uſe of it</hi> (p. 26) And that thoſe may be regenerated <hi>who receive Baptiſm (like</hi> Simon Magus <hi>ſuppoſe) in Hopocriſy and Impenitency</hi> (p. 27)</p>
            <p>The Reader is now to judge, which of theſe two Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the Caſe is right, and to chuſe which of them he will believe. Whether the Scripture Account, which declares all Believers in Chriſt to be <hi>born of God,</hi> or the Dr's Account of this Matter, who ſuppoſeth a Man may be <hi>born of God</hi> without Faith in Chriſt; and that a Man may have Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, before he is <hi>born again;</hi> the Scripture Account, which repreſents <hi>Regeneration</hi> as an abiding Principle, or the Dr's, which ſuppoſes the regenerate may revolt from God, either for a Time, or for ever. He may chuſe, whether he will believe the Scripture Repreſentation, that the Word of God is the ordinary Means of <hi>Regeneration,</hi> or the Dr's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal, that this is wrought by <hi>Baptiſm</hi> only: the Scripture Repreſentation, that the Regenerate are a holy People, or the Dr's Suppoſal, that they may be Apoſtates, Hypocrites, and Impenitent. He muſt judge whether this be not ſufficient Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that the Dr. <hi>knew not what he ſaid, nor whereof he affirmed,</hi> that he has laid his Foundation upon the Sand, and that his Superſtructure muſt neceſſarily ſink with it.</p>
            <p>Upon the Whole then, we may ſafely conclude, that the <hi>Waſhing of Regeneration</hi> in the Dr's Text, does not, cannot ſignify <hi>Baptiſm;</hi> becauſe wherever the like Methods of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing are found in Scripture, they neceſſarily have a quite different Meaning, becauſe <hi>Regeneration</hi> is ſo often mention'd in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, without the leaſt Reference to <hi>Water Baptiſm;</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Characters which the Scripture gives; and thoſe which the Dr. gives of the <hi>new Birth,</hi> are directly oppoſite and inconſiſtent.</p>
            <p>Since I wrote this, I happen'd occaſionally to meet with Dr. <hi>Doddridge</hi>'s excellent Sermons on <hi>Regeneration,</hi> and finding there a Paragraph moſt oppoſite to the preſent Purpoſe, I could not forbear tranſcribing it. <q>Now I have ſhewn you (ſays he) from a Variety of Scriptures, under the former Heads, that every one whom the ſacred Oracles repreſent as <hi>born of God,</hi> receiveth Chriſt, overcometh the World, and ſinneth not. But it is too plain, that theſe Characters do not agree to every
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:005163_0050_1016CB8DC95F1FC8"/>
one that is <hi>baptized,</hi> and conſequently it evidently follows, that every one that is <hi>baptized</hi> is not of Courſe <hi>born of God</hi> or rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate; and therefore that <hi>Baptiſm</hi> is not ſcripture <hi>Regeneration.</hi> I think no mathematical Demonſtration plainer or more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that this Concluſion. And therefore, whatever great and ancient Names may be urged, on the other Side of the Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I ſhall reſt the Matter here, without leading you into the Niceties of a Controverſy, ſo eaſily decided.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I now proceed to conſider, whether our bleſſed Lord ſpeaks of <hi>a baptiſmal Regeneration,</hi> in Joh. 3.5. — And here it muſt be premiſed, that all the Reaſons already aſſigned, why the other Text cannot be underſtood in this Senſe, are equally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive in the preſent Caſe. All the Scriptures which I have cited, do as directly ſerve to illuſtrate the Meaning of this, as of the other Text. And all the Scripture Characters of the <hi>new Birth,</hi> are as applicable here, as they be there. To be <hi>born of Water, and of the Spirit,</hi> is the ſame Thing, with <hi>the Waſhing of Regeneration, and Renewing of the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> and as I have made it appear, that the latter does not ſignify a <hi>baptiſmal Regeneration;</hi> it thence alſo appears, that the former can have no ſuch Signification. I ſhall however conſider ſome further Reaſons, why <hi>being born of Water and the Spirit,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be underſtood in the Senſe the Dr. contends for.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If being born with Water in this Text ſignifies Baptiſm, then there are none in any Caſe whatſoever, who dye unbap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, that ſhall ever obtain Salvation. The Excluſion of all who are not <hi>born of Water, and of the Spirit,</hi> is peremptory, and without any Limitation. Our Lord ſtrongly aſſerts, that theſe <hi>cannot enter into the Kingdom of God,</hi> And now will any of the Dr's Admirers venture to teach, that all Infants who dye in the Womb, at the Birth, or at any Time before there be Opportunity to obtain the Ordinance of Baptiſm for them, will be eternally ſhut out of the Kingdom of Heaven? Will they venture to teach that ſuch Adults, as are truly penitent for their Sins, and true Believers in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, ſhall eternally periſh, for being providentially deprived of the Opportunity of being baptized? Will they venture to teach, that every unbap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized Perſon whatſoever, under whatever Diſadvantages of Education, in whatever Place of Abode Providence has fixed his Habitation, how impoſſible ſoever it may be for him to obtain
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:005163_0051_1016CB9018DD5370"/>
this Ordinance, ſhall not, notwithſtanding the Sincerity of his Repentance towards God, and Faith in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and notwithſtanding his holy and heavenly Converſation, and hearty deſire of Baptiſm, be eternally ſhut out of the Preſence of God — And yet this cruel and uncharitable Doctrine, is the neceſſary Conſequence of their Interpretation of this Text. But bleſſed be God, theſe are not the Doctrines of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. He teaches us indeed, that <hi>he that believeth and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved.</hi> Mark xvi. 16. But the negative Part of that Propoſition is limited to the Unbeliever only. <hi>He that believes not, ſhall be damned.</hi> Tho' he makes no Promiſe of Salvation to the Deſpiſer, or wilful Neglecter of this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, yet he does not denounce Damnation, to all who are neceſſarily deprived of this precious Privilege.—And accordingly the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> inſtructs us, that it is <hi>not the putting away the Filth of the Fleſh,</hi> by the Water of Baptiſm <hi>that ſaveth,</hi> 1 Pet. iii. 21. It cannot therefore be the Want of this, without Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt or Neglect, that will damn us.—From theſe Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, we may then ſafely and certainly conclude, that the Text does not ſpeak of a <hi>baptiſmal Regeneration;</hi> the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of ſuch an Interpretation being too frightful and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merciful, to be allowed or ſuppoſed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another Reaſon againſt aſſigning this Meaning to the Words before us, is our Saviour's upbraiding <hi>Nicodemus</hi> for his Ignorance of theſe Things. <hi>Art thou a Maſter in</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and knoweſt not theſe Things?</hi> (verſe 10)—What Things does our Saviour Mean. —Does he upbraid him for not knowing the Neceſſity of his Compliance with the Goſpel Ordinance of <hi>Baptiſm;</hi> and his being regenerated by the Spirit, in the Uſe of that Ordinance? How ſhould a <hi>Maſter in Iſrael</hi> know theſe Things, which he had never read or heard of before?—This therefore cannot be our Lord's Meaning. But if we allow the Conſtruction of theſe Words, which I am pleading for, the Reproof will appear moſt natural and reaſonable. It was indeed a Shame, for a <hi>Maſter in Iſrael,</hi> to be ignorant of that Birth of Water and of the Spirit, which is ſo often ſpoken of by the <hi>Prophets.</hi> It was a Shame for <hi>Nicodemus</hi> to be ignorant of the Neceſſity of being <hi>ſprinkled with clean Water, and made clean,</hi> of having <hi>God's Spirit put within him, that he might walk in God's Statutes; and keep his Judgments and do them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="unknown:005163_0052_1016CB9384450098"/>Dr. <hi>Waterland,</hi> ſeems to have been apprehenſive of this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ection, and in Order to obviate it, tells us, that <hi>the Name or the Notion, probably was not altogether new in our Lord's Time. For the Jews had be'n uſed to admit Converts from Heatheniſm into the Jewiſh Church, by a Baptiſm of their own; and they called Admiſſion or Reception of ſuch Converts, by the Name of Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration or New-Birth, as it was ſomething like bringing them into a new World.</hi> P. 5.</p>
            <p>He does not indeed tell us what it is, that he ſounds this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture of his upon, that we alſo might judge, whether the Name or the Notion was <hi>probably</hi> not altogether new in our Lord's Time. But admit that this was not only probably but certainly Fact, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> is it to the Purpoſe? For how could a <hi>Maſter</hi> in Iſrael <hi>know,</hi> that becauſe <hi>Heathens</hi> were waſhed with Water, when admitted as Converts from Heatheniſm into the Jewiſh Church, that therefore a <hi>Jew</hi> muſt be baptized, in order to his entring into the Kingdom of Heaven? How could he know that our bleſſed Lord would <hi>improve the Notion</hi> (as Dr. <hi>Waterland</hi> ſays he did) <hi>by the Addition of the Spirit; and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large the Uſe of the Rite, by ordering, that every one, every Convert to Chriſtianity, every Candidate for Heaven, ſhould be baptized?</hi> (p. 7) It is plain, that his being <hi>a Maſter in Iſrael,</hi> would acquaint him with none of theſe Things; and therefore that this could not be our Lord's Meaning, if we allow any Propriety in this his Reproof of <hi>Nicodemus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Another Reaſon why this Text cannot be underſtood, as ſignifying a <hi>baptiſmal Regeneration,</hi> is our Lord's Interpretation of his Meaning, in the ſixth Verſe of this Context. <hi>That which is born of the Fleſh it Fleſh, that which is born of the Spirit is Spirit.</hi> Whereby he plainly ſhows us, that it was a ſpiritual Birth he ſpake of; and they were ſpiritual Perſons who had obtained it. Now could Dr. <hi>Waterland</hi> pretend, that all who were <hi>baptized,</hi> and ſo (according to his Conſtruction of the debated Text) were <hi>born of Water and of the Spirit,</hi> were truly ſpiritual Perſons? No! he could not but acknowlege, that there are ſome of theſe, (like <hi>Simon Magus) in a State of Hypocrify and Impenitency.</hi> And it is viſibly and lamentably true, that the far greateſt Part of the <hi>Baptized,</hi> who (according to him are all <hi>born of Water and of the Spirit,</hi> have no Claim at all to the Character of ſpiritual Perſons.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="unknown:005163_0053_1016CB965B3FE038"/>Theſe Things put together, make it appear to me equal to Demonſtration, that our Lord Jeſus Chriſt had no Reference to <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> in theſe Words under Conſideration. We may not ſuppoſe, that he poſitively pronounced all ſuch uncapable of the Kingdom of God, who are by his holy Providence, denied the Opportunity of enjoying <hi>Baptiſm.</hi>—We are certain, that he would not upbraid <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> for his Ignorance of what it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible he ſhould have been acquainted with.—We are certain, that all baptized Perſons are not truly Spiritual; and yet our Lord aſſures us, that the <hi>Birth</hi> he ſpeaks of, has that transforming Efficacy upon thoſe that experience it, as to make 'em all ſuch.— Theſe Texts are therefore ſafe in our Hands, notwithſtanding all Endeavours to wreſt them from us. And theſe two which I have now conſider'd, are the only Texts in the Bible, which can with any Appearance of Plauſibility, be urged in Favour of the Dr.'s Hypotheſis. How many there be, that do in the ſtrongeſt Terms contradict this Scheme has been already conſider'd.</p>
            <p>But after all, ſhould we allow that both theſe Texts have a Reference to Baptiſm. Should we allow, that being <hi>born of Water</hi> and <hi>the Waſhing of Regeneration</hi> are to be underſtood of Baptiſm. Theſe Texts will prove no Foundation for the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines which Dr <hi>Waterland</hi> and the epiſcopal Clergy among us (who ſeem generally to be of his Way of thinking) pretend to build upon them.</p>
            <p>Be it then ſuppoſed, that the Ordinance of <hi>Baptiſm</hi> is here referred to, in both theſe Texts, it can in neither of 'em imply any more, than the Pledge, Sign, Seal, or Token of our <hi>Regeneration.</hi> It cannot imply, that <hi>Regeneration</hi> itſelf always accompanies this Ordinance; and that all who are <hi>bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,</hi> are <hi>born again.</hi> If we allow this Senſe of the Words, we thereby ſuppoſe, that to be <hi>born of Water,</hi> is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Baptiſm as a Pledge or Sign of our being cleanſed from our Pollution, by the divine Influences of the Spirit of God, and of our thereby becoming new Creatures, and as it were born a new. And thus <hi>Baptiſm</hi> may be called the <hi>Laver of Regeneration,</hi> as it is a Pledge and Sign of our being cleanſed by <hi>Regeneration,</hi> as it were in a <hi>Laver.</hi> In both Caſes, the Sign muſt be (by this Interpretation of the Words) put for the Thing ſignified, as being a lively Emblem and Repreſentation thereof. — This is a Way of ſpeaking commonly, and frequently
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:005163_0054_1016CB98AE01A238"/>
uſed in Scripture, Thus we read of <hi>the Covenant of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion.</hi> Acts vii. 8. i. e. that Covenant, whereof Circumciſion was a Sign and Seal. Thus likewiſe we read of Chriſt our Paſſover. 1 Cor. v. 7. i. e Chriſt the Subſtance and Antitype, ſignified and repreſented by the <hi>Paſſover.</hi> Thus we alſo read of the <hi>Circumciſion of the Heart in the Spirit.</hi> i. e. that Reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Heart by the Spirit, whereof Circumciſion was the Sign and Seal. In like Manner our Lord Jeſus Chriſt is called <hi>the Lamb of God, our Sacrifice,</hi> &amp;c to ſhew us, that all the legal Oblations referred to, and terminated in him. And if the Texts before us have any Relation at all to Baptiſm, they muſt be underſtood in this Senſe and no other, for the following Reaſons,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe there is no neceſſary Connection between <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,</hi> and our being <hi>born of the Spirit.—Simon Magus</hi> was rightly and duly baptized, and yet had <hi>no Part or Lot is that Matter;</hi> but was <hi>in the Gall of Bitterneſs, and Bonds of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</hi> Acts viii 21.23. I have already ſhewn, that the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of the <hi>new Birth,</hi> belong to but very few of the <hi>baptized</hi> World. All Diſcourſe therefore of a ſpiritual Birth, with Relation to theſe who live and dye in a carnal State, is but a Medly of Inconſiſtency and Contradiction.—Should we ſuppoſe with Dr. <hi>Waterland</hi> (p. 28, 22) that <hi>the Holy Spirit has ſome Way or other a Hand in every true and valid Baptiſm;</hi> that <hi>the Holy Spirit is in ſome Sort offered to all that receive Chriſtian Baptiſm;</hi> that <hi>the holy Spirit conſecrates and ſanctifies he Waters of Baptiſm, giving them an outward and relative Holineſs;</hi> and that <hi>the Unworthy are by their Baptiſm put into an</hi> external <hi>chriſtian State.</hi> What is all this to their being born of the Spirit? What is this to thoſe Characters of the <hi>new Birth,</hi> that have been particularly recited from the ſacred Oracles. <hi>Baptiſm</hi> cannot therefore be the <hi>new Birth;</hi> becauſe it is a Fact too notorious to be diſputed, that the moſt of thoſe who are <hi>baptized,</hi> were never <hi>born of the Spirit</hi> at all, never had any of the Characters of a regenerate State; and conſequently this Ordinance can be no more, than the Sign, Pledge, or Seal of <hi>Regeneration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Regeneration</hi> is an Act of God's Sovereign Grace: the Product of his mere good Pleaſure and Almighty Power.
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:005163_0055_1016CB9A4116BF60"/>
Whatever Means he is pleaſed to make Uſe of, in bringing about this bleſſed Change; yet the Change itſelf, is by his own immediate Agency, without the Help of any other concurring Cauſe in its Production. <hi>The Wind bloweth where it liſteth, and thou heareſt the Sound thereof; but canſt not tell whence it cometh, nor whither it goeth, ſo is every one that is born of the Spirit.</hi> Joh. iii 8. We are <hi>born, not of the Will of Man, but of God.</hi> Joh. i. 13. <hi>Of his own Will begat he us.</hi> Jam. i. 18. We are <hi>God's Workmanſhip, created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good Works.</hi> Eph. ii. 10. No Man then can have more Agency in the <hi>new Birth,</hi> than in the Generation of the Wind, the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the divine Will, or the Creation of a new World. This Dr. <hi>Waterland</hi> acknowleges. <hi>No Man (ſays he) rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerates himſelf at all, that is, he has no Part in the regenerating Act (which is intirely God's) whatever he may have in the Receptive. And if in this Senſe only it be ſaid, that he be purely paſſive, it is good and ſound Doctrine.</hi> (p. 17) I therefore inſiſt upon it, that this good and ſound Doctrine, does utterly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert his whole Scheme. If Man can have no Hand in the regenerating Act, but that is intirely God's, and Man can have a Hand in <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> it is then certain, that <hi>Baptiſm</hi> is not the regenerating Act, nor can in any Senſe be called <hi>Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration;</hi> but as it is an outward Sign, Seal, of Token of it. I ſee no poſſibility of an Anſwer to this, but either by retract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Dr's Conceſſion now cited, and endeavouring to prove directly contrary to the above cited Scriptures, that <hi>Regeneration</hi> is not an Act of God's Prerogative and Sovereignty; and that Man may concur and have a Hand in it, Or elſe by endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to prove, that Man does not concur, and has no Hand at all in the Adminiſtration of <hi>Baptiſm;</hi> but this alſo is God's peculiar Prerogative, and a Work of his immediate Power. Here then the Matter muſt reſt.</p>
            <p>It won't at all help the Caſe, to ſay with Dr. <hi>Waterland,</hi> that <hi>the Unworthy are by their Baptiſm, put into a chriſtian State, otherwiſe they would be mere Pagans ſtill</hi> (p. 29) If this be granted, what follows? What neceſſary Connection is there between a viſible and external chriſtian State, and <hi>Regeneration?</hi> None at all, as I have particularly ſhewn before. And I now enquire, how they are brought into the chriſtian State? Are
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:005163_0056_1016CB9E028C0210"/>
they <hi>God's Workmanſhip, created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good Works?</hi> Are they <hi>born, not of the Will of Man but of God?</hi> No! they are yet unrenewed. They are yet <hi>in Hypocriſy and Impenitency.</hi> They have had no more than a Change of their external Relation. A Change that depends upon the Will of Man, and how then can they be properly ſaid to be <hi>born again.</hi> How can their <hi>Baptiſm</hi> be any more than an external Sign, or Seal of that ſpiritual Change, which they have had no Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of.</p>
            <p>What is the regenerating Act, according to the Dr. <hi>with reſpect to God Almighty,</hi> but <hi>Admiſſion or Adoption into Sonſhip or ſpiritual Citizenſhip?</hi> (p. 11) And what is this Adoption or Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with reſpect to a great Part of thoſe that partake of it; but the <hi>Conſecration of the Waters of Baptiſm, to an outward and relative Holineſs,</hi> and <hi>a Conſecration of the Perſons alſo, i<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> himſelf ſuppoſes, with reſpect to a great Part of the baptized World. And all this does (upon his Scheme) depend upon the Will of Man. For it's what always accompanies every true and valid Baptiſm, tho' adminiſtred to the Hypocrite, impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent and unworthy, as appears from his 28, 29, and 30 Pages. And conſequently, this regenerating Act, is always as much at the Choice of every Man good or bad, as it is at his Choice, whether he will, or will not be baptized.</p>
            <p>In a Word, the regenerating Act (upon this Hypotheſis) is nothing but <hi>Baptiſm</hi> itſelf. For it enters into the Definition of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> that the <hi>Water have an outward relative Holineſs;</hi> and that the baptized Perſon be brought into an external <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian State.</hi> The outward Conſecration of the Water, and the Adminiſtration of the Ordinance in the Name of the ſacred Trinity, neceſſarily imply both theſe Things. The whole Queſtion therefore is, whether Man do, or do not concur in the Ordinance of Baptiſm.—The <hi>holy Spirit</hi> (he tells us) <hi>has a Hand in every valid Baptiſm.</hi> What Hand? None at all in the Caſe before us, but to make the Ordinance valid. There is no real Change wrought in ſuch an impenitent Hypocrite.

No relative Change, but what he may chuſe or refuſe at Pleaſure.</p>
            <p>I can't forbear taking Notice upon this Occaſion, of a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt Blunder and Contradiction in the Dr's Scheme. <hi>Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> (he tells us) <hi>is the Work of the Spirit in the Uſe of Water, that is the Work of the Spirit ſingly; for Water does nothing, is no Agent at all</hi> (p. 16) It is <hi>a Change from the State natural, into the State ſpiritual, a Tranſlation from the Curſe of Adam, into the Grace of Chriſt</hi> (p. 11) And again, <hi>the Holy Spirit tranſlates them</hi> (Infants) <hi>out of a State of Nature to which a Curſe belongs, into a State of Grace, Favour and Bleſſing, this is their Regeneration</hi> (p. 24) And yet thoſe Adults may be regenerated, who have never had any Work of the Spirit upon their Hearts, never been tranſlated into the Grace of Chriſt; but <hi>are yet in Hypocriſy and Impenitency</hi> (p. 27) And thoſe <hi>Infants may be regenerated, where Renovation has no Place at all for the Time being</hi> (p. 13) and conſequently, they are not tranſlated at all <hi>into a State of Grace, Favour and Bleſſing.</hi>— He again tells us, that <hi>in the Caſe of Adults, Regeneration and Renovation muſt go together, otherwiſe, the Regeneration is not a ſalutary nor a compleat Regeneration.</hi> (p. 19) And yet (as I have ſo often obſerv'd) he allows, and endeavours to prove, that ſuch Adults as have been baptized, are <hi>born of Water and of the Spirit,</hi> tho' they have no Renovation at all, but <hi>are in a State of Hypocriſy and Impenitency.</hi> —His Admirers would have done well to have reconciled theſe Contradictions, before they had been ſo active in propagating his dangerous Doctrines.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I will add this further Evidence to the Point before us, that the Apoſtle aſſures us, that <hi>neither Circumciſion availeth any Thing, nor Uncircumciſion; but the new Creature.</hi> Gal. vi. 15. By which it appears, that notwithſtanding the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any Ordinances, the <hi>new Creature</hi> or the <hi>new Birth</hi> may by wanting, and our Privileges, avail us nothing at all. The ſame Thing is confirm'd by the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to <hi>Baptiſm</hi> in particular, 1 Pet. iii. 21. <hi>The like Figure whereunto, even Baptiſm doth alſo now ſave us, (not the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting away the Filth of the Fleſh, but the Anſwer of a good Conſcience towards God) by the Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>

                  <hi>Dr.</hi> Owen Pneumatalogia. p. 180.</note> has paraphras'd theſe Words. <q>The outward Adminiſtration of this Ordinance conſider'd materially, reacheth no further but to the Waſhing away the Filth of the Fleſh, but more is ſignified thereby. There is denoted in it, the Reſtipulation of a good Conſcience toward God, by the Reſurrection of Chriſt from the Dead; or a Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence purged from dead Works, to ſerve the living God. Heb. ix. 14. And quickned by Vertue of his Reſurrection, to holy Obedience, ſee Rom. vi. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.</q> By theſe Texts it is evident, that <hi>Baptiſm</hi> is not the <hi>new Creature;</hi> and that it ſaves us, only as it is a Pledge and Sign of a renewed Conſcience, and of our being quickned by Vertue of Chriſt's Reſurrection, unto Newneſs of Life. Or in other Words, it is not properly in any Reſpect <hi>Regeneration</hi> itſelf, but the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Sign, Pledge, or Token of it. Which was the Thing to be proved.</p>
            <p>By what has been ſaid, I think it is clearly manifeſt, that if theſe Texts under Conſideration, are even allow'd to have a Referrence unto <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> this cannot be ſuppoſed in any other Senſe, than <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               <hi>Baptiſm</hi> is an outward Sign, Seal, Pledge or Token of <hi>Regeneration;</hi> and not properly in any Reſpect the <hi>new Birth</hi> itſelf. For how can that ſtrictly ſpeaking be the <hi>new Birth,</hi> or any Part of it, which is enjoy'd by Multitudes, who have no one ſcripture Character of the regenerate State? How can a Perſon be ſaid to <hi>be born not of the Will of Man but of God,</hi> to <hi>be God's Workmanſhip, created anew in Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> and to be born of God's mere good Will and Pleaſure by this Ordinance which depends upon the Will and Pleaſure of Man? How can <hi>Baptiſm</hi> in Strictneſs and Propriety of Speech, be the <hi>new Creature,</hi> when we may enjoy all Ordinances without being <hi>new Creatures?</hi> How can <hi>Baptiſm</hi> in itſelf avail to our <hi>Regeneration,</hi> when no Ordinance will avail any Thing without <hi>Regeneration</hi> or the new Creature? How can the Waſhing away the Filth of the Fleſh, be <hi>Regeneration,</hi> without what is ſignified thereby, a renewed Conſcience, and a Conformity to the Reſurrection of Chriſt, in a Renovation of our Lives?

muſt needs ſay, they are bold enough, who dare venture their Eternity upon the Dr's Scheme, after ſuch Evidence as this againſt it.</p>
            <p>Thus I have given my Reaſons againſt the Dr's Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of theſe Scriptures; and muſt now attend to what he has to ſay in Favour of it.</p>
            <p>His principal Argument for this Conſtruction of the Words, is this, <hi>One Thing is certain, that the Ancients took in Baptiſm into their Notion of Regeneration. A learned Writer has prov'd at large, that both the Greek and Latin Fathers, not only uſed that Word for Baptiſm; but ſo appropriated it alſo to Baptiſm, as to exclude any other Converſion or Repentance not conſider'd with Baptiſm, from being ſignified by that Name</hi> (p. 8)</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, that tho' I don't pretend to vie with the Dr. in the Knowledge of Antiquity; yet I can't but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, from what little Acquaintance I have with the Doctrines of the Ancients, that they generally underſtood theſe Texts to ſignify <hi>Regeneration,</hi> in no other Senſe than I have now laſt explain'd them. And what ſtrengthens my Preſumption is, that ſome of his own Quotations plainly carry this Senſe with them, and particularly that from St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> whom he has cited in Confirmation of his Doctrine, <note n="*" place="bottom">Aqua igitur, exhibens forinſecus Sacramentum Gratiae, et Spiritus operans intrinſecus Beneficium Gratiae, ſolvens Vinculum Culpae, reconcilians Bonum Naturae, regenerant Hominem in uno Chriſto, ex uno Adamo generatum.</note> expreſſy ſhews us his Senſe of this Matter, that <hi>the Water</hi> (of Baptiſm) <hi>externally ſhews forth the Sacrament of Grace; and the Spirit internally operates the Benefit of it.</hi>—The Fathers ſome of them did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed (as was their uſual Method of ſpeaking) uſe very ſtrong and hyperbolical Expreſſions upon this Subject, which would almoſt lead one into the Apprehenſion, that they held even the Popiſh Opinion of the Neceſſity of the Sacraments, and of their conferring Grace <hi>ex Opere operato,</hi> by their own proper Virtue. But then when we find them on ſet Purpoſe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring their Sentiments of this Matter, denying the abſolute Neceſſity of Baptiſm to Salvation; and calling Baptiſm <hi>Obſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natio

            <p>But it ſignifies but very little, what was the Opinion of the Fathers in this Caſe. We have the Bible as well as they, and as good Advantages to underſtand the Meaning of it, as they had. And it is as well known by all that are any Thing acquainted with Antiquity, that they held many ſuch ridiculous Opinions, as would now expoſe a Man to the Contempt and Scorn of the World, if he ſhould make a Profeſſion of them. To exemplify this, in an Inſtance ſomething parallel to the Caſe before us. Some of them explain'd that Text Joh. vi. 53. <hi>Except ye eat the Fleſh of the Son of Mun, and drink his Blood, ye have no Life in you,</hi> to be underſtood of the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, and thence argued the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Infants partaking of that Ordinance, in Order to their Salvation; and they accordingly fed them with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated Elements. <hi>Sine Chriſti Carne et Sanguine,</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi>

Without the Fleſh and Blood of Chriſt, neither can Infants have Life in themſelves.</hi> And thence it was the Cuſtom of thoſe Times, to give that Sacrament unto Infants, as the ſame Father tells us. <hi>Parvulis adhuc et infirmis, ſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantur quaedam de Sacramentis.</hi>

               <hi>Some Part of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is inſtilled or dropt into the Mouths of young and tender Children</hi> —I would now aſk the Dr's Admirers, whether this Argument from the Fathers is good and concluſive? If not, why is it urged? If it be, why don't they adminiſter the Lord's Supper to Infants? Why are the Fathers preſs'd into their Service, when they think they will ſerve their Turn; and rejected when they differ in Sentiments from them?</p>
            <p>Another Argument the Dr. uſes to ſupport his Interpretation of theſe Scriptures, is this, That <hi>there is no Inſtance, no Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in Scripture, of any Exhortation made to Chriſtians, to be born anew, but to be reform'd only, or renewed in the inward Man</hi> (p, 32)</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="unknown:005163_0061_1016CBA961CFBF18"/>To this I anſwer. That one good Reaſon why there is no more Exhortations found in the New Teſtament unto profeſſed Chriſtians, to obtain a regenerate State, or to be born again, is becauſe they to whom the Books in the New Teſtament were immediately directed, were conſider'd by the inſpired Writers as being generally Chriſtians indeed, who had already experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced, and therefore could not now want a firſt Converſion unto God. And its obſervable, that the Apoſtles in their Epiſtles to the Churches, addreſſed them as being truly Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate; and accordingly, they directed their Epiſtles <hi>to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved of God, called to be Saints.</hi> Rom. i. 7. <hi>To them that are ſanctified in Chriſt Jeſus, called to be Saints.</hi> 1 Cor. i. 2. <hi>To all the Saints which are in all</hi> Achaia. 2 Cor. i. 1. <hi>To the Saints which are at</hi> Epheſus. Eph. i. 1. <hi>To the Saints in Chriſt Jeſus, which are at</hi> Phllippi. Phil. i. 1. <hi>To the Saints and faithful Brethren in Chriſt, which are at</hi> Coloſſe. Col. i. 2. <hi>To the Church of the</hi> Theſlalonians, <hi>which is in God the Father, and in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> 1 Theſ. i. 1. <hi>To the Elect, according to the Foreknowledge of God.</hi> 1 Pet. i. 2. <hi>To them that have obtained the like precious Faith with us.</hi> 1 Pet. i. 1. &amp;c. It is remarkable, that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in his Introduction to every one of his Epiſtles to particular Churches, ſalutes them as Saints, his Epiſtle to the <hi>Galatians</hi> only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted. Of theſe <hi>Galatians,</hi> he was <hi>was afraid, leſt he had beſtowed upon 'em Labour in vain.</hi> Gal. iv. 11. <hi>He ſtood in Doubt of them,</hi> verſe 20. For theſe therefore he <hi>travail'd in Birth again, till Chriſt were form'd in them.</hi> Verſe 19. or until they were <hi>born again,</hi> which is the Fruit of travailing in Birth, and the plain Meaning of having <hi>Chriſt formed in them.</hi> Here then is a clear Inſtance of the Neceſſity of <hi>Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration</hi> in profeſſed Chriſtians, whatever Dr. <hi>Waterland</hi> alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to the Contrary. I grant indeed with him, that <hi>this is not favourable to the Notion of a ſecond Regeneration.</hi> (p. 33) But it is favourable to the Notion of the Neceſſity of a firſt <hi>Regeneration,</hi> even in nominal Chriſtians; and ſhews the Apoſtles Concern for ſuch, that they might now be <hi>born again,</hi> ſince he was afraid his former Travail in Birth for them, had prov'd in vain.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="58" facs="unknown:005163_0062_1016CBAC92BD1E80"/>And I muſt further obſerve, that tho' the Apoſtles in their Epiſtles to the Churches, conſider'd them as Chriſtians, yet they frequently put them in Mind of the Importance of their being ſo indeed, as well as in Profeſſion; and to that End, repreſented to 'em the Neceſſity of the <hi>new Birth,</hi> either in expreſs Terms, or in Words that fully <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ply'd it. Thus Eph. iv. 24. <hi>Put on the new Man, which after God, is created in Righteouſneſs and true Holineſs.</hi> Eph. v. 14. <hi>Awake thou that ſleepeſt, and ariſe from the Dead.</hi> 2 Cor. v. 17. <hi>If any Man be in Chriſt he is a new Creature.</hi> Gal. vi. 15. <hi>In Chriſt Jeſus, neither Circumciſion availeth any Thing, nor Uncircumciſion; but the new Creature.</hi> In all which Texts, the <hi>new Man,</hi> a <hi>Reſurrection from the Dead,</hi> or the <hi>new Creature</hi> (expreſſions every Way ſynonimous to the <hi>new Birth</hi> as I have ſhewn above) are propos'd, as neceſſary to our eternal Safety. And the ſame Neceſſity of the <hi>new Birth,</hi> to profeſſed Chriſtians, is apparent from ſundry Texts of Scripture before cited. For it is by this, that ſuch get a Victory over their Sins. 1 Joh. iii. 9. By this, that they are brought to believe in Jeſus Chriſt, 1 Joh. v. 1. to live in the Love of God and their Neighbour, 1 Joh. iv. 7. to overcome the World, 1 Joh, v. 4. To conquer the Temptations of Satan, 1 Joh. v. 18. and in a Word, by this they have a lively Hope of future Glory, 1 Pet. i. 3. By all which we may ſee, that the Dr's Obſervation is founded upon a manifeſt Miſtake, is falſe in Fact, and would have been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent, if never ſo true.—To conclude this Head. Does not our bleſſed Lord himſelf, in as ſtrong Terms as can be ſpoken aſſure us, that <hi>except a Man be born again, he cannot ſee the Kingdom of God?</hi> Joh. iii. 3. But he ſpoke this to <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus,</hi> and <hi>Nicodemus was a Jew,</hi> (p. 14) What then? Was it ſpoken to <hi>Nicodemus</hi> only? Are not the Words an indefinite and unlimited Propoſition, which equally reſpects the whole Race of Mankind, without any Reſtriction, Exception, or Limitation? Certainly there is none will find himſelf ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted, when it comes to the great deciſive Trial, by what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Imaginations he may at preſent delude himſelf.</p>
            <p>It may be expected, that I ſhould ſay ſomething to the Diſtinctions the Dr. makes betweeen <hi>Regeneration</hi> and <hi>Reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi> But its ſufficient in general to obſerve, that if the
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:005163_0063_1016CBB080313990"/>
Notion of a <hi>baptiſmal Regeneration,</hi> be a mere Figment, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſcripture Foundation at all. (as I think I have clearly proved) Then <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> Diſtinctions which he makes, with Relation to a <hi>baptiſmal Regeneration,</hi> are but Diſtinctions about a non-Entity; and therefore merely fictitious Impertinencies.</p>
            <p>To this I ſhall only add, that tho' it were right to ſuppoſe that the <hi>Renovation</hi> in his Text, implies a progreſſive Work of Sanctification, as well as to ſuppoſe this to be different from the new Birth, or firſt ſaving Change, it will no Ways follow, that <hi>Regeneration</hi> is not alſo a ſaving <hi>Renovation;</hi> but even this Suppoſal makes it neceſſarily appear to be ſo. We are renewed by being born again; and from this new Principle, (put into Exerciſe by the Spirit of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> flows a continued <hi>Renovation</hi> or <hi>Sanctification. The new Man is after God, created in Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and true Holineſs.</hi> Eph. iv. 24. And thence it is, that <hi>he that is born of God ſinneth not, and cannot Sin;</hi> but <hi>purifieth himſelf as God is pure; becauſe this Seed of God remaineth in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall paſs over the many exceptionable Paſſages in this Diſcourſe, leaving the Reader to determine the Fate of the Superſtructure, by the Foundation upon which it is built, which I hope he has by this Time, a pretty full and clear View of. And ſo I ſhall proceed to ſome brief Remarks upon ſome Part of the Improvement he makes of the Doctrine, which has been conſider'd.</p>
            <p>He begins with this Reflection, <hi>that 'tis very improper Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage at leaſt, to call upon thoſe that have been once regenerated in their Infancy, who have had their new Birth already at the Font, to be now regenerated, or to bid them expect a new Birth.</hi> (p. 31, 32) But is it ſo very improper Language, to call upon thoſe to be now regenerated, who have neither been regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in their Infancy, nor in any ſucceeding Part of their Lives, who have indeed enjoy'd the Sign and Seal of <hi>Regeneration</hi> at their <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> but are Strangers to the Thing ſignified; and are yet dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins?—That this is the ſad Caſe of much the greateſt Part of profeſſing Chriſtians, is but too viſible, from the whole Tenour of their Lives and Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. And muſt we leave them to go on ſecurely in the Paths of Deſtruction and Death? Muſt we not call upon 'em to
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:005163_0064_1016CBB2D7DA4ED8"/>
               <hi>awake out of their Sleep, and ariſe from the Dead, that Chriſt may give them Light?</hi> Muſt we in a ſcornful Manner be told, that <hi>ſuch Application might properly be directed to Jews, Turks, or Pagans, or ſuch nominal Chriſtians as have caſt off their Water Baptiſm</hi> (p. 31) How much does it concern the Miniſters of the Goſpel, the more earneſtly and conſtantly to uſe <hi>Line upon Line, and Precept upon Precept,</hi> to inculcate this moſt important Point upon their People, when ſuch Attempts are made to lull them aſleep, in a dangerous and fatal Security. And how much does it concern our People in general, to <hi>hold faſt the faithful Word, as they have been taught;</hi> and to <hi>be no more Children toſſed to and fro, with every Wind of Doctrine,</hi> to the Loſs of their precious and immortal Souls</p>
            <p>The Dr. <hi>proceeds in the next Place to obſerve, how very miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous it is many Ways</hi> (to call upon profeſſed Chriſtians to be regenerated) <hi>and therefore that it cannot be look'd upon as a mere verbal Buſineſs, or an innocent Miſnomer.</hi> To which it is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Anſwer, that this is the Doctrine of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles, as I think I have fully prov'd; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whatever miſchievous Conſequences Men may pretend to draw from it, the Miſchief does not flow from the Doctrine itſelf, but from the Abuſe of it.</p>
            <p>Among ſome other Inſtances of the miſchievous Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, which he imagines from this Doctrine, he mentions and chiefly inſiſts upon this, <hi>that many—may be apt to go in Queſt of what they call Impulſes or inward Feelings of the Spirit, which commonly are nothing more than warm Fancies, tow'ring Imaginations, and ſelf-flattering Preſumptions.</hi> (p. 36)</p>
            <p>If by <hi>Feelings of the Spirit,</hi> he means, feeling or ſenſibly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Operations of our Minds, excited by the Influences of the Spirit, this is ſo far from being a warm Fancy, or tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Imagination, that it is neceſſarily experienced by every true Chriſtian. It is impoſſible from the Nature of Things to be otherwiſe. Can a Man poſſibly be under Conviction of Sin, under the Exerciſe of Repentance for Sin, of Faith in Chriſt, of Love to God, or of ſpiritual Mindedneſs, and not be ſenſible of theſe Operations of his own Mind? And does not the Scripture expreſly aſcribe all theſe gracious Exerciſes of the Mind, to the Influences of the Spirit of God? So that all the
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:005163_0065_1016CBB482AB5598"/>
Graces of the Spirit of God, wrought in the Heart of an Adult Perſon, are always ſenſibly felt, tho' the Quality of 'em are not always diſtinctly known. And I muſt add, that no one that has a true Love, either to his God or his own Soul, will be banter'd out of the Neceſſity of experimental Piety, by oppro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brious Invectives and reproachful Characters; but will <hi>beware that no Man ſpoil him, thro' Philoſophy and vain Deceit, after the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Men, after the Rudiments of the World, and not after Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if by Impulſes and Feelings of the Spirit, be intended, Raptures, Extaſies, Viſions, and enthuſiaſtick Inſpirations. I leave all Pretenders to theſe Things, to the Dr's Diſcipline, and only add a Paragraph or two out of Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> upon this Head, <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Pneumatalogia. p.</hi> 186, 188.</note> 
               <q>The Work of the Holy Spirit (ſays he) in <hi>Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,</hi> doth not conſiſt in enthuſiaſtick Raptures, Extaſies, Voices, or any Thing of the like Kind. It may be ſome ſuch Things have been by ſome deluded Perſons, appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, or pretended to; but the Countenancing any ſuch Imaginations, is falſly and induſtriouſly charg'd on them, who maintain the powerful and effectual Work of the Holy Spirit, in our <hi>Regeneration.</hi>
               </q> And again, <q>Such Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions for the moſt Part, are either Conceptions of diſtemper'd Minds and diſcompoſed Fancies, or deluſions of Satan, transforming himſelf into an Angel of Light, which the Doctrine of <hi>Regeneration</hi> ought not to be accountable for.</q>
            </p>
            <p>That Dr. <hi>Waterland</hi> may do his Buſineſs effectually, he next proceeds to enter a Caveat againſt <hi>the Marks and Tokens of Regeneration. Thoſe</hi> (ſays he) <hi>that firſt began to talk in this Way (and who have long been dead) might be pious and well-meaning Men, but they were not very happy in the Uſe of their Terms, or in the Choice of their Marks</hi> (p. 42) Theſe Marks he tells us, <hi>may be prudently thrown aſide, as human Invention.</hi>—But who were theſe pious well-meaning Men, whoſe Ignorance the Dr. complains of, but the moſt Eminent of the reformed Clergy, in the early and pureſt Times of the Reformation? Happy had it been for the <hi>Church of England,</hi> if all her ſucceeding Clergy had as well underſtood, and as faithfully taught, the Marks of a regenerate State, as many of thoſe excellent Men
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:005163_0066_1016CBB84C146C28"/>
did, which he thus complains of.—Into what a ſad and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing State is practical Godlineſs reduced in that Church, where ſuch Doctrines as this paſs current, and the Marks of Converſion are conſider'd, as <hi>having a Tendency to perplex ſome, and to deceive others; and therefore prudently to be thrown aſide, as Things of human Invention.</hi> (p 43)—What! are theſe of human Invention? How then does the Dr. bring in our bleſſed Lord and the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> as giving the Marks of a converted State. p. 43, 44 And why does the Dr. himſelf run into the Practice of theſe Things of human Invention, by giving Marks of <hi>a renewed Heart and Mind? What Marks</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſhould a Man pitch upon to ſatisfy himſelf in that Caſe, but a good Conſcience? Or what Marks to ſatisfy others, but a good Life?</hi> And again, <hi>if we ſincerely endeavour to do the beſt we can, and are daily gaining Ground of our Vices and our Paſſions, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ourſelves after the ſtricteſt Examination, to be upon the improving Hand, then may we comfortably believe, that our Regeneration abides ſalutary and entire, and that we are in a State of Salvation</hi> (p. 44)—Why (I ſay) did the Dr. practice theſe Things of human Invention? The Reaſon probably was, that he thought himſelf ſecure, from <hi>perplexing ſome, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving others,</hi> by ſuch Marks as theſe. And indeed there is no Reaſon to fear his giving any Perplexity to the Conſciences of ſecure Sinners, by ſuch an Opiate. But oh that there was as little Reaſon to fear his deceiving Multitudes of poor unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate Creatures, to their eternal Ruin!—Here is a Mark, by which a Man may conclude himſelf <hi>in a State of Salvation,</hi> without having ever been <hi>weary and heavy laden</hi> with his Sins; tho' it is ſuch whom Chriſt invites to <hi>come to him for Reſt.</hi> Mat. xi. 28. without feeling himſelf ſick, tho' it is ſuch to whom Chriſt is the Phyſician.

the World, cannot have the Love of the Father in them,</hi> 1 Joh. ii 15. without any <hi>Love to the Brethren,</hi> or the Children of God, tho' <hi>by this we are to know that we are paſſed from Death to Life.</hi> 1 Joh. iii. 14. without a careful Attendance upon the Duties and Ordinances of Religion, tho' we are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected thus to <hi>ſeek, if we would find, and knock if we would have the Door opened.</hi> Mat. vii. 7, 8. without having <hi>old Things paſs away and every Thing become new,</hi> tho' all <hi>that are in Chriſt Jeſus, are thus new Creatures.</hi> 2 Cor. v. 17. And in a Word, without having <hi>Chriſt in him,</hi> which every one muſt have, <hi>except he be a Reprobate.</hi> 2 Cor. xiii. 5. All that is propoſed, is to be daily gaining Ground of our Vices and of our Paſſions, and in this to be upon the improving Hand. — If this be a ſufficient Mark of Safety, why may not all the moral Heathen be in a State of Salvation, as well as ſuch Pretenders to Chriſtianity? They have in this the Better of them, that they are unbaptized, whereas theſe by their empty Profeſſion, daily break thro' all the Bonds of their baptiſmal Covenant, and thereby greatly aggravate their Guilt and Miſery.—It infinitely concerns all the Profeſſors of Chriſtianity to ſee to it, that they have better Evidences of a ſaving Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion to God than this comes to, otherwiſe however they are daub'd with untemper'd Mortar at preſent; they won't ſtand the Trial of the Great Day: It will in that Day be found what they have got by it, who are deſerting our Communion, thro' Prejudices conceiv'd againſt the Doctrines of ſpecial Grace, and the Neceſſity of <hi>Regeneration,</hi> in Order to their future Safety; and have join'd themſelves to another, where they ſeem to hope, they ſhall find a wider Gate, and a broader Way to eternal Life. Pity it is, that ſuch as theſe, can't foreſee the Conſequence of their dangerous Miſtake, before its too late. In Order to this, let them ſeriouſly reflect upon the following <hi>Corollaries</hi> from what has been ſaid.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Coroll.</hi> 1. It appears from the foregoing Diſcourſe, that the <hi>Regeneration</hi> deſcribed in Scripture, and the <hi>Regeneration</hi> deſcribed by ſome of our epiſcopal Clergy, are two diſtinct Things, which differ ſpecifically, and are directly repugnant in their Nature and Properties.—This is not a diſtant and for fetcht Conſequence, but what naturally and neceſſarily flows
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:005163_0068_1016CBBC76D00F08"/>
from the Premiſes, and may be received with as full Aſſurance as we can have in any Caſe whatſoever. I know men may wrangle perpetually, and by the Power of Words, make the moſt deſperate Caſe look ſomething plauſible. But I know alſo, that as Contradictions can never be reconciled, ſo it is impoſſible in the preſent Caſe, to make the <hi>Regeneration</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by ſome of our epiſcopal Clergy, to be the ſame with that deſcribed in Scripture, without making it appear on both Parts true, that all who are born of God, are true Believers; and ſome that are born of God, may <hi>neither have Faith nor Repentance;</hi> that all who are born of God, do not ſin, and cannot ſin; and ſome who are born of God may be <hi>in Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitency and Hypocriſy;</hi> that all who are born of God may have his Seed remaining in them that they cannot ſin; and ſome that are born of God, may not have his Seed remain in them, but <hi>may finally fall from Grace,</hi> with ſundry more In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtences, before conſider'd particularly. This then is no longer a Matter of Speculation, but of utmoſt Certainty, that they mean one Thing and the Scripture another, by <hi>Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;</hi> and that theſe are as much two Things, and as truly diſtinct and different, as any two Things in the World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Coroll.</hi> 2. From hence it further appears, that we <hi>cannot ſee the Kingdom of God,</hi> in Conſequence of theſe Principles, eſpouſed by ſome of our epiſcopal Clergy. How harſh ſoever the Conſequence may be ſuppoſed, it is nevertheleſs infallibly certain.</p>
            <p>Our Lord aſſures us, that without <hi>Regeneration,</hi> we <hi>cannot ſee the Kingdom of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What theſe Gentlemen call <hi>Regeneration,</hi> is not the <hi>new Birth</hi> which our bleſſed Saviour means, and which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture deſcribes: And therefore not the new Birth, by which we muſt be prepar'd for the Kingdom of God, and without which we can never enter into it. As I have fully prov'd.</p>
            <p>Their Principles teach, that there is no other <hi>Regeneration</hi> neceſſary, than what they deſcribe as above.</p>
            <p>The Scripture teaches us, that the Properties and Characters of that <hi>Regeneration,</hi> which is abſolutely neceſſary, in Order to our entring into the Kingdom of God, are eſſentially di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct and different from the Properties and Characters of that
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:005163_0069_1016CBBF09C3E890"/>
               <hi>Regeneration</hi> which they deſcribe; whence it neceſſarily follows, that we cannot enter into the Kingdom of God in Conſequence of their Principles.</p>
            <p>By this it appears of what Conſequence it is, to be ſet right in this Matter.—I would not be here miſunderſtood, as though I determine all ſuch uncapable of the Kingdom of God, who hold the Doctrine which I oppoſe. No! I doubt not, but ſome of theſe may have experienced in their Hearts, what they oppoſe in their Heads; and be practically acquainted, with what they are in Speculation prejudiced againſt. But theſe muſt get to Heaven, in a Way very diſtant from their Principles; under the dreadful Diſadvantage of a powerful Biaſs to incline them the wrong Way.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Coroll.</hi> 3. It thence alſo further appears, how much ſafer it is for our People, to hold faſt the Form of ſound Words which they have heard, in this important Point, than to venture upon a Change, to theſe Schemes of our epiſcopal Clergy—It muſt be obſerv'd, that I am not now ſpeaking of the Diſcipline or Ceremonies of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> whatever Objections may lye againſt them; but of this great Article of our Faith and Hope, which is thus ſubverted by ſome of their Clergy. — Were it poſſible they ſhould be in the Right, our Profeſſion is nevertheleſs ſafe. We are baptized in Obedience to our Lord's Command, as well as they, and have therefore as fair a Claim to <hi>baptiſmal Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration</hi> as they can have; and are beſides ſeeking for <hi>Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration</hi> diſtinct from <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> to qualify us for the Kingdom of God, Here then can be no Danger, if we act up to our Principles; and experience what we judge neceſſary to our Salvation. But then, if our Sentiments are right, (which I hope by this Time I have a Claim to ſuppoſe) what will become of them, who have no other, and who ſeek no other than a <hi>baptiſmal Regeneration,</hi> to qualify them for the Kingdom of God.</p>
            <p>Thus I have made ſome brief Remarks, upon what I eſteem'd of the moſt dangerous Tendency, in Dr. <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terland</hi>'s Diſcourſe of <hi>Regeneration,</hi> hoping that by the divine Bleſſing, it may be of ſome Uſefulneſs, for reclaiming ſome,
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:005163_0070_1016CBC16111BA90"/>
who have been too ſoon led away from their Stedfaſtneſs; for eſtabliſhing others, in the Faith once delivered to the Saints; and for impreſſing upon the Minds of our People in general, the laſt Neceſſity of their experiencing a greater Change, than the moſt of them have yet experienced, if they would ever enter into the Kingdom of God.</p>
