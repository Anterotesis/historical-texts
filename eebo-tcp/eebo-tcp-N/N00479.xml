            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Q. <hi>Give us an Example in another case.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> All men have a Principle of Natural Reason in them, which without all outward means (either of Men or books) teacheth them immediately some things belonging to Natural Reason; and yet none will deny but that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>oth Men and Boo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s are very useful and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to further us in the Knowledge of Natural Things, and in the
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:000604_0005_0FA95F61D65FC0B0"/>
exercise of our Natural Reason, to the further improving the same.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>But are the Immediate Teachings of God and Christ of absolute Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity unto every Man, to give him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
                  </gap> true and saving knowledge of God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yea, they are<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap> for indeed all outward Means could do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without the immediate teaching and ministring of God and Christ, by his holy Spirit, Light and Life; because the Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate is the Ground and Foundation, or Principle, for or because of which the outward means are useful and profitable.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Give us an Example in another case.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The same as before; for if men had not an inward and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Principle of Natural Reason in them, that taught them immediately some things belonging to Natural Reason, all the Men and Books in the World, though never so convincing, could not gain ground upon them; but because Men have a Principle of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in themselves, therefore when things of Reason are presented and offered to them, by Men and Books, they imbrace them and receive them, not simply or only because the Men and Books say so, but because the innate Principle of Reason in themselves saith so, and doth witness and answer to the same things.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>By this it would seem that men are taught many more things immediately, than mediately.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yea surely, for according to the aforesaid Example, what men are there (except Fools and Idiots) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ut the Principle of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Reason in them, teacheth them, in the things of Natural Reason, above an hundred to one, more than any Books or Men ever did, or can do? As is manifest in the daily Occurrances and Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions in the outward Life, a man's Natural Reason teacheth him a Thousand things which he never learned from Men or Books. Even so, the Children of God are taught of God many Divine &amp; Spiritual Things, which Men nor Books never did, or could teach them.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>By all this i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap> seemeth, that the Knowledge of Divine and Spiritual Things, must flow from a divine and spiritual Principle in the Heart, and that they cannot be known and learned sufficiently from or by the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Principle of Natural Reason.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> It is even so; for tho' the Natural Reason in a subservient way, may be made use of, yet it can no more reach unto the things that are spiritual and divine, nor indeed so much, as a blind Man by all his Reason can reach unto Colours, to judge of them distinctly or
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:000604_0006_0FA95F628B120F88"/>
a Deaf man to judge of Sounds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for even as the things of Sence are judged or known by a Principle of their own Nature, which Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son cannot immediately reach unto by descending; so the things of Faith, which are divine and spiritual, are judged and known by a Principle of Faith that is of their own Nature also, to wit, divine and spiritual, which Reason cannot immediately reach unto by its ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; but as a man, having the Natural exercise of his Senses, can use his Reason in Natural things that are sensible; so he who hath the use of his spiritual Senses, can use the same Reason in Spiritual things, to wit, in a subservient and subordinate way.</p>

            <head>A Post-script to the fore-going Sheet.</head>
            <p>WHereas some years ago I writ some Questions and Answers is one Sheet, chiefly directing to the Fundamental and Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Principle of divine Knowledge, which as a sacred Key opens the door into the Treasures of divine Wisdom as well as of divine Life &amp; Virtue, my principal end and aim in that sheet being to direct the minds of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple thereunto, and leaving the said Sheet in the hands of a Friend, after I was come away for <hi>America,</hi> my dear Friend <hi>R.
