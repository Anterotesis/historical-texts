            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE CONVERSATION <hi>&amp;</hi> CONDUCT, OF THE LATE UNFORTUNATE JOHN YOUNG.</head>
            <p>THE Public mind has been of late much exerciſed by the fate of the unfortunate John Young. I was the firſt perſon who viſited him after his receiving ſentence of death. I attended him on Sunday, the 6th of Auguſt, at which time I addreſſed him on the fall of man, the nature of ſin in general, and of that in particular for which he had been condemned: And endeavoured to lay before him, the awful conſequences of dying in an impenitent ſtate, but all that was ſaid at that time, ſeemed to have had but little effect on him. He did not how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, diſcover an unwillingneſs to receive inſtruction reſpecting the things of God. The next day, two friends viſited him, and one of them ſpeaking abrubtly of the murder he had committed, he ſeemed to reſent it, and aſked him, if he came there to ubraid him. The ſame day another friend paid him a viſit, and converſed with him largely on his dangerous ſituation, when he confeſſed himſelf a loſt ſinner, and wept bitterly on account of his ſins in general, and the late un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy event in particular. He told me he was deeply affected at the ſituation of Mr. Barwick's wife and children, and that he ſhould be the means of making her a widow and them fatherleſs. He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed me at the ſame time that he left fifty dollars to Mrs. Barwick for to help to educate her children, to be paid when his debts are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered by his attorney, as there will be more than that on balance. From the firſt time the friend before mentioned viſited him, he ſeemed to have different views of himſelf than he had before; he was truly weary, and heavy laden; his head ſeemed to be waters and his eyes a fountain of tears; for like penitent David, he often water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his couch with them. He opened the Bible and ſhewed me the 51ſt Pſalm, ſaying, that is greatly bleſſed to me. But as he was amazingly ignorant of the word of God, he ſpent much of his time in reading the Appeal to Reaſon and matter of Fact; this was the chief inſtrument of opening to his view Chriſt crucified; and the all-ſufficiency of his blood and Righteouſneſs to ſave to the uttermoſt, all that come unto God by him. As the perſons who ſo frequently viſited him, had not been backward in ſpeaking the alarming awakening truths of God to him hitherto; ſo now (when they found he was ſick and wounded) they were not back ward in pointing him to the good phyſician the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.—They ſang and prayed with him continually, and he with them that the Lord would relieve him, burſt his ſpiritual fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:032133_0004_0FF15082A69D8F20"/>
and reveal his love to him. The Lord fulfilled his promiſe, <hi>To this man will I look, unto him who is humble and of a contrite ſpirit, and trembleth at my word</hi>:—He took away his burthen, and gave him peace and happineſs, which he poſſeſſed at leaſt for the three laſt days he liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Now he became all engaged with the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.—He told me and others that he went aſleep, praying unto the Lord Jeſus, and he was the firſt in his thoughts when he awoke. Was not this ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like what David ſays? <hi>When I awake I am ſtill with thee.</hi>—The Lord was gracious in directing to ſome paſſages in the Bible, Fletch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's Appeal, and the Hymn Books he had, that were peculiarly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable to his ſtate. He ſhewed me places turn'd down in ſeveral of them; ſaying, theſe I opened promiſcuouſly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> O what a Book is that, exclaimed he, alluding to Fletcher's Appeal. What do you ſee ſaid I when you read it? He replied, "I ſee the beauty of the upper world." The day before his execution I ſpent two hours with him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone; a great part of the time interrogating him reſpecting the ſtate of his mind, that I might be ſatisfied whether he was building on the ſand or on the Rock of Ages: And I was fully convinced that he was building upon the rock, for,
<q>
                  <l>"No ſtrength of his own, or goodneſs he claim'd,</l>
                  <l>"His ſtrength was all thrown, on Jeſus's name,</l>
               </q>
I found the fear of death taken away, and peace and happineſs poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing his mind. At this time he told me a dream, which he had that morning, "I dreamed" ſaid he, "that ſeveral perſons came to ſee me, and that one of them aſked me if I was happy? I anſwered I am: He aſked me again if I was afraid to die? I anſwered no: He aſked me if I had the full aſſurance of faith? I anſwered, I had not: He then replied, I have it for you! but, you will not receive it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til you come near the place of execution. To which I anſwered, I hope the Lord will give it to you to night, when I and my friends, will ſtay with and pray for you. About 10 o'clock, three friends and myſelf entered his cell to ſtay with him,—ſuch a night I never expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced! We ſang, prayed, and converſed alternately 'till two o'clock, but it did not ſeem that half the time was ſpent. With great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety one of the friends ſung,</p>
            <p>'Priſons would palaces prove, if Jeſus would dwell with me there', It was indeed, more like a rational congratulatory viſit to a bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom, or a man about to be put in poſſeſſion of great earthly happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, than a viſit to one, who in a few hours was to ſuffer an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious death. How indeed, could we be ſad? to ſee a man in fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and yet at liberty, in priſon, and yet ſeemingly in a palace! con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to death, and in a few hours to have the ſentence executed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and yet ſpiritually alive to God, ſo that not only reſignation to his fate was evident, but a conſtant chearfulneſs and ſerenity which is the reſult of a mind at peace with God, and all mankind. He talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed rationally of the vanity of this world, of men in general, and
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:032133_0005_0FF1507D8E1410A0"/>
of himſelf in particular; in not ſerving God, and glorifying his name, and obſerved, the reaſon was, becauſe men were diſſipated and inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinately attached to the things of this world:—For, ſaid he, if men would but exerciſe their reaſon aright, they would live to God.</p>
            <p>When converſing on reſignation to Divine Providence in general, and particularly his preſent ſituation, he more than once ſaid, if the Governor, would grant me a reprief, when at the place of executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I do not know that I would take the trouble of writing for it.</p>
            <p>We repeatedly aſked him, if he inclined to ſleep? He anſwered, "not in the leaſt;" but we adviſed him to ſtrive to doze a little, as we thought it would be better for him. He did ſo, and ſhortly after, fell aſleep, and ſlept as compoſed as any one poſſibly could. About half paſt three o'clock, we concluded to go home and refreſh ourſelves, as he was ſtill aſleep, and return again to accompany him to the place of execution. I returned at half paſt ſeven, and was about an hour alone with him, before any one came. When I went into the Dungeon, I aſked him how he found his mind? He anſwered with a placid ſerenity, "I am comfortable thank God." What did you think, ſaid I, when you awoke and found the light out, and we not there? He ſaid, "I imagined the lamp went out, and that perhaps you were all aſleep, till the day-light convinced me ye were gone." How did you feel your mind exerciſed, ſaid I, when you awoke? "I found it thinking on the Lord Jeſus," ſaid he, "and while I was meditating alone, I thought what a poor helpleſs ſinner I was, that had nothing to bring to God as an offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but the blood of Jeſus Chriſt:" I anſwered, That is enough, for that is the ſacrifice that is acceptable to Him.</p>
            <p>O! in how many inſtances did I ſee this ſcripture exemplified in him. <hi>My ſpirit ſhall take of the things that are mine, and ſhew them unto you.</hi> I ſang a hymn, and he then requeſted me to ſing the one that we had ſung in the night, and which had Glory be to God on High for the chorus. We ſang it, and he requeſted that it ſhould be one of the hymns we ſhould ſing going to the place of execution. About half paſt nine o'clock, his chains were taken off, and his cloaths brought. As ſoon as he ſtood up, he ſaid to the turn-key, "Well, George, you won't have the trouble of putting thoſe irons on me any more, he then waſhed his legs and feet, and dreſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with the ſame degree of compoſure and cheerfulneſs he had poſſeſſed the day before.—When he was done, he took his old cloaths and put them in his bed, and turned it up. Then he took his hymn-book, and we ſang and prayed, till the Sheriff and Jailor came to have him prepared tor his execution. When he was pini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, and the rope about his neck, the Sheriff kindly gave him a quarter of an hour longer to pray. After one or two perſons had prayed, he deſired me to turn down the hymns that were to be ſung,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:032133_0006_0FF1512E1CF39F00"/>
chooſing two favourite hymns for himſelf, and left the others to me. As he came through the Priſon, ſome of the genteeler Debtors came and took their laſt farewell of him with affected hearts, and guſhing eyes, which greatly affected him. When he came out into the ſtreet, there was a conſiderable noiſe, occaſioned by the vaſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of people that crouded. We ſtopped there a few minutes, 'till the Militia was ready. Fearing the noiſe would diſſipate his mind, I aſked him if I ſhould begin to ſing? He anſwered, "no, not 'till we are ſtarted and out of the noiſe, I want to be recollected and meditate." So intenſely was his mind fixed on the Lord Jeſus, that he declared to me, that the affectedneſs of his friends (though it affected him) and the noiſe of the people, did not hurt his confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in Jeſus.—As ſoon as we ſtarted, he and the friends that were with us, ſung, the following hymns.</p>

               <pb facs="unknown:032133_0008_0FF15080F2952478"/>When we ſtopped a little diſtance from the Gallows, he came to the verſe Here I'll raiſe my Ebenezer, &amp;c. then we that attended him, could perceive the remarkable happineſs and ſtrength that beamed forth in his countenance. We who had heard him relate the dream he had the day before, ſaid to him, "We believe your dream is now accompliſhed; Have you the full aſſurance of faith?" "Yes," exclaimed he, "I have, glory be to God. When we had finiſhed the hymn and chorus, we ſtopt, but he would not; but cried out again, Glory, glory, glory, &amp;c. He then went up into the Cart under the Gallows, and I with him. A little while after he turned about to me, and ſaid, "in about half an hour more, I ſhall be in the arms of Jeſus." One of the friends gave an Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the vaſt multitude that was convened; and I ſpoke a few words reſpecting the ſtate of his mind; after which, he ſaid to me, "Go, and ſee the writing I left in the Priſon be put to print." We then joined in ſinging the following Hymn:</p>
            <lg>
               <l>HAPPY ſoul, thy days are ended;</l>
               <l>All thy mourning days below;</l>
               <l>Go by Angel guards attended.</l>
               <l>To the ſight of Jeſus go.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Waiting to receive thy Spirit,</l>
               <l>Lo the Saviour ſtands above,</l>
               <l>Shews the purchaſe of his merit,</l>
               <l>Reaches out the crown of love.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Struggle through the lateſt paſſion,</l>
               <l>To thy dear redeemer's breaſt,</l>
               <l>To his uttermoſt ſalvation,</l>
               <l>To his everlaſting reſt:</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>For the joy he ſets before thee,</l>
               <l>Bear a momentary pain,</l>
               <l>Die, to live a life of glory,</l>
               <l>Suffer, with thy Lord to reign.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>The Sheriff aſked him, if he wiſhed to ſay anything, he anſwered "nothing, but that I die in the fear and grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt." He then wiſhed me farewell, pulled the cap over his face, and in a quarter of an hour after, he was in Eternity. He died with an eaſe that aſtoniſhed the ſurrounding ſpectators. However diſſipated he might have lived, however aggravated the crime might have been that was the cauſe of his ſhameful death, it muſt appear evident to every impartial mind, he died a ſubject of Divine Mercy and Favor, on Thurſday, Auguſt 17, 1797. Aged 40 Years, and 4 Days.</p>
