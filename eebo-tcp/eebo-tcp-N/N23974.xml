            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>An ORATION.</head>
            <p>MANKIND have differed in nothing more than in their religious opinions. Their creeds have been as various as their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances. Education has no ſmall ſhare in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing this wonderful variety. We are paſſive to its influence.</p>
            <p>Religion, of ſome kind or other, has been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by all mankind, in all ages, and in all parts of the globe. It has been conſidered as the moſt noble employment of the ſoul, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of the moſt beneficial conſequences to civil ſociety. Theſe things have occurred, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though moſt of the religions extant owe their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence more to ignorance than to argument, and are more the effects of blind credulity, than rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable conviction. This ariſes from the nature of the ſubject. Our religion is formed before the reaſoning faculties are ſufficiently matured for examination. Principles imbibed in infancy are extremely difficult to be eradicated. They grow with our growth, they ſtrengthen with our ſtrength. Here commences the boaſted empire of conſcience, whoſe dictates it is thought the higheſt criminality to violate. There is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing too in the ſubject of religion ſo ſolemn and awful, that we dare ſcarcely attempt to reaſon ourſelves out of pre-eſtabliſhed errors. A dread of ſomething hereafter, the hopes of happier days, ruſh upon the anxious ſoul, and diſarm it of its reaſoning power. Men in all ages have been the ſubjects of religious fear. Immoderate
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:031712_0003_0FEE15E995F4E538"/>forebodings of a world <hi>to come,</hi> have robbed the <hi>preſent</hi> of half its lawful enjoyments.</p>
            <p>Religion, deſigned to render man "mild and ſociable to man," has rendered him ſelfiſh and implacable. Abſurdities and perſecutions have been the attendants of every ſyſtem of religion under heaven. How often have the rights and dignity of human nature been inſulted, degraded and trampled upon? How often have the honour and character of Deity been traduced, by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious and abſurd doctrines of religious eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? How often have mankind been deceived and led aſtray from truth, by ſyſtems bearing on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>name</hi> of Divinity? How often has the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred name of Jehovah been inſulted by men act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the ſpecious appearance of ſuperior piety? Theſe abuſes, with many others commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted under the maſk of religious hypocriſy, have induced ſome to reject all revelation, as repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to reaſon; impoſing on the ignorance and credulity of the vulgar; degrading the exalted abilities of man, and inconſiſtent with the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Deity. They either artfully inſinuate, or openly declare, that the religion of a Saviour ſtands on the ſame foundation with that of a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet, and the fables of antiquity. They inſiſt that ignorance and impoſition are equally the ſupporters of all. They renounce all the lumin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous truths of revelation; they place in their ſtead the forlorn "age of reaſon." They aim their wit and ridicule at the very exiſtence of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity, and treat with impious and ungenerous contempt that life and immortality brought to light by the goſpel. They rob virtue of her hope. They add inſult to the misfortunes of life. They transform the beauties of Paradiſe into the barren wilds of non-exiſtence. They plant on the grave the ſeeds of annihilation. They level man with the brute. Deſtined, like a meteor of the night, to blaze for a moment, he vaniſhes
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:031712_0004_0FEE15EB1F228520"/>forever in the ſhades of darkneſs. To-day he exults in the higheſt glory; to-morrow he min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles with the worm in the duſt.</p>
            <p>Man, as a being prone to err, becomes an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of commiſeration. Ridicule is a breach of humanity; it is oftering violence to the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the human heart. We will ſhed the tear of ſorrow over the tomb of man's departed glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; but let us not deprive him of that religion which alone can alleviate the misfortunes of life.</p>
            <p>While men have been pleading an univerſal toleration of religious opinions, we rejoiced at their ſucceſs; we ſaw them diſarming perſecution of her weapons; we imbibed their ſympathy; we warmed with their philanthropy. That elegance of ſtyle and independency of thought which charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terize the writings of ſome who have oppoſed reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, have in ſome inſtances captivated the paſſions and ſeduced the judgment. They have with great exultation vilified the character of the clergy. We are ſenſible of eccleſiaſtical abuſes; they cannot be too much expoſed: but while we deprecate the ambition of the clergy, ſo deſtructive to the peace of civil ſociety, when ſtrengthened by the arm of the magiſtrate, let us not abuſe indiſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately an order of men ſo important and uſeful to mankind. Society, in an improved ſtate, cannot exiſt without them. Though they form the mind and mend the heart, yet ſome, either from ignorance or envy, have repreſented them as unfriendly to the improvements of the human mind—to the lights and progreſs of philoſophy. We feel ourſelves peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly pleaſed and honoured in appealing to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent occaſion, as a full refutation of their illiberal aſperſions. Thoſe venerable Worthies, whoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence gives dignity and reſpect to the ceremonies of this day; whoſe benevolence is at this moment liſtening to the feeble efforts of the ſpeaker, riſe ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to the inſinuations of malice, and ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evince their attachment to ſcience and virtue.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:031712_0005_0FEE15C5681CC0C8"/>
But what have the ſyſtems and errors of men to do with the religion of heaven? We renounce all ſyſtems but the ſyſtem of God. Men, in ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their favourite opinions, have undoubtedly been led into error. This by no means derogates from truth. While we ſmile at the incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible commentaries of ſyſtem-builders, our vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for the great original is increaſed. Like its divine Author, it cannot be deſtroyed. Heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en and earth ſhall paſs away, and nature diſſolve at the feet of Jehovah—but religion exiſts for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
            <p>As a ſyſtem coming from heaven, with every mark of its divinity, it ought to influence our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief and actions. But, ſay ſome, the belief of the Chriſtian ſcriptures is no proof of their truth and importance. Becauſe, continue the objectors, the ſame proof is applicable to every ſyſtem of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror extant. This will be granted. Things are either true or falſe, independent of belief. "Man cannot create, he can only diſcover."</p>
            <p>But the credence of falſe ſyſtems of religions, is no proof or argument againſt one which carries indelible characters of its divinity. It rather heightens its value. Virtue never more intereſts the heart than when contraſted with vice. To reject <hi>all</hi> truth, merely becauſe we are liable to err, is the height of abſurdity. Man, it is true, is from his cradle expoſed to deception. This by no means argues him deſtitute of knowledge. Admit this reaſoning to be juſt, and you not only deſtroy the credibility of revealed religion, but you ſtrike at the root of all knowledge, and level man's boaſted acquirements in the duſt.</p>
            <p>The weakneſs of human reaſon to determine on many things in morals and religion, points out to man the neceſſity of ſome ſuperior guide, of ſome unerring ſtandard, to which he may refer his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and appreciate their worth. The very idea of man's moral agency involves in it the ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:031712_0006_0FEE15ECA791CA90"/>of laws to aſcertain and govern his actions. From whom can thoſe laws originate, but the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlator of the Univerſe? If God govern the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral world by univerſal laws, why not the moral? The ſame neceſſity is evident in both. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgation of theſe laws is the revelation we plead for. The neceſſity and importance of ſuch a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation becomes a ſerious and all-intereſting enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. It involves in it man's preſent and future happineſs.</p>
            <p>The great end Deity had in view, in delivering to man a tranſcript of his mind, was to make known to him his true character; to teach him in what his real happineſs conſiſts; to confirm the wiſhes of his heart in immortality; to offer the greateſt incentives to virtue, the greateſt deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from vice, by eſtabliſhing the doctrine of a future ſtate of rewards and puniſhments. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſibility of ſome parts of revelation has, with great force and dependence, been urged as an inſuperable objection to their veracity. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains for thoſe who make the objection to prove this peculiar to revelation.</p>
            <p>As well might we reject the truth of our own exiſtence, becauſe we cannot comprehend the laws of animal motion. Shall we diſbelieve the exiſtence of all thoſe magnificent ſcenes diſcloſed to our view throughout the works of creation, becauſe we cannot comprehend <hi>all</hi> the laws by which they are governed? Man, after all his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful diſcoveries, will find more to admire than to comprehend—more to animate his devotion than to confirm his unbelief.</p>
            <p>This, ſo far from being an argument againſt the truth of revelation, is one of the greateſt in its favour. If man had been its author, would it not in every reſpect have been within the ſphere of his comprehenſion? Like all the works of man, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of genius or imitation, it might have been perfectly underſtood.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:031712_0007_0FEE15C19DFF8120"/>
In a revelation coming from heaven, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not expect, in the preſent ſtate of exiſtence, fully to comprehend all its deſigns. The weakneſs of human reaſon is ſuch, as to render us totally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualified to ſcan the counſels of the Divinity.</p>
            <p>That there are many things beyond the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of the human mind, is the experience of philoſophy. The Chriſtian ſcriptures are not a ſingular caſe. Omniſcience is an attribute of Deity only. It is ſufficient for man he can learn his duty, and motives powerful enough to prompt him to its performance. Revelation contains both in an eminent degree. All knowledge flows from God. The mind that can fully comprehend the anatomy of a fly, is equal to the knowledge of the univerſe. The power that can give animation to a mite, can with the ſame eaſe move unnum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered worlds.</p>
            <p>Aſtoniſhed at the wonderful diſcoveries made in the philoſophic world, ſome have ſuppoſed revelation to be ſuperfluous. Philoſophy, it is true, diſcloſes to us ten thouſand ſcenes, all beautiful; all magnificent; all ſublime. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frſted by ſcience, man has read the great volume of creation; he has triumphed over the elements; he has rendered the laws of nature obedient to his will. But however extenſive man's reſearches may be; however he may have improved his mind or exalted his nature by the lights of reaſon and philoſophy; yet, aſſiſted by theſe alone, all his proſpects, all his expectations, terminate in uncertainty. Clouds and darkneſs hover over the regions of the grave. We mark man's entrance into life; we obſerve the developement of his genius, in all his wonderful diſcoveries; we fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him to the tomb—but, deſtitute of the light of revelation, we loſe him forever.</p>
            <p>The diſpoſition of Deity towards man, in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning his ſins, and reſtoring him to future hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, can never be diſcovered by the efforts of
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:031712_0008_0FEE15FB17B682C8"/>reaſon, however improved by philoſophy, or matured by experience. The hiſtory of ages proves to us the uncertainty in which the light of nature and the ſagacity of philoſophy leave man, with reſpect to a future exiſtence.</p>
            <p>The human mind, long before the dawn of the Chriſtian aera, had arrived at an aſtoniſhing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of refinement. Poets had reached the height of ſublimity, orators had harangued in all the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemence of eloquence, philoſophers had taught the principles of morality; but the great problem of man's immortality remained unſolved. It was reſerved for revelation to demonſtrate the truth of man's reſurrection. Her energiſing voice awakes the ſlumbers of the tombs. She gives to man a new creation. She proclaims him the heir of immortal glory. Situated in the midſt of gaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing worlds, he intereſts the feelings of all that bright train which bow before the burning throne of God.</p>
            <p>The proſpects of man are great—his happineſs inviolate. Deity has diſtinguiſhed him as an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of his peculiar beneficence and attention. He has ſtamped on him the ſeal of his divinity. His progreſs in ſcience and religion proves the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite perfectibility of his mind. Erect in ſtature, man ſeems formed for contemplating all the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and ſublime works of nature. Although an inhabitant of earth, his wiſhes reach beyond the ſtars. The glittering portals of heaven lie wide extended for man's reception. The ſhades of ignorance and tyrannic gloom, which have ſo long beclouded the proſpects of man, are vaniſhing before him. Wafted on the wing of inſpiration, we hail the period as not far diſtant, when the religion of peace and good-will ſhall emancipate man, and give to the univerſe the higheſt poſſible happineſs.</p>

               <p>IN retiring from the place of our education, gratitude demands our acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the honourable Corporation.</p>
               <p>If to form the mind to virtue and knowledge, is an object of the firſt magnitude in a free ſtate, what reſpect is due to the founders and patrons of this flouriſhing inſtitution! Your benevolent exertions in the cauſe of ſcience and religion, merit the eulogium of every friend of humanity, but more eſpecially of us, who this day receive the honours of this Univerſity. To you, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, are due the firſt fruits of all our toils. It is to you, ye friends of ſcience and freedom, we owe the birth of that inſtitution which calls us her ſons. This renders your names and your virtues dear to our memories. Senſible of the importance and neceſſity of a general diffuſion of knowledge in a republican government; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated by the noble principles of patriotiſm and philanthropy, you have founded and foſtered to its preſent reſpectability you aſylum of the arts and ſciences. Your exertions have not been in vain. Under your patronage, and the bleſſings of an approving heaven, each returning anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:031712_0010_0FEE15EE30E40D60"/>has rewarded your toils, and animated your zeal.</p>
               <p>Go on, generous Sirs, in your laudable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings; perfect the important deſigns of your inſtitution, and immortalize your names.</p>

               <p>He who patronizes the arts and ſciences, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the benefactor of mankind. We know your zeal and exertions in the cauſe of educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and freedom. The intereſt and welfare of this inſtitution lie near your heart. May its fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture proſperity be equal to your benevolent wiſhes. May ever be bleſſed by the guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dianſhip of ſuch illuſtrious worthies. We hope the patronage of a character ſo influential, will become an example of imitation to the worthy citizens of Rhode-Iſland.—Then ſhall our Alma Mater rejoice in the number of her <hi>native</hi> ſons, and receive the patronage of the Legiſlature. Your rewards ſhall then be the gratitude of an enlightened people, and the approbation of the Judge of the Univerſe.</p>

It is to you we are indebted for thoſe leſſons of wiſdom and morality, which add dignity to our natures, and ſenſibility to our feelings.

               <p>TO the worthy Profeſſors and Tutors is juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly due the tribute of gratitude. In looking back on the paſt ſcenes of collegiate life, we behold you, Gentlemen, alluring us through the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful walks of ſcience and refinement. You have animated us in the purſuit of virtue and knowledge by your own amiable examples and extenſive acquirements. If we have not improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it cannot be imputed to your want of atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:031712_0012_0FED37C7073AB540"/>You have on all occaſions convinced us of the neceſſity and importance of acquiring and maintaining characters fair and unfullied. May our future conduct in life never diſappoint the benevolent wiſhes of your hearts. We can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſufficiently admire thoſe talents and virtues, which have been ſo zealouſly devoted to our beſt intereſt. That reſpect and eſteem you have taught us to entertain for the great and the good, we feel in a pre-eminent degree for you. This, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, is not the language of adulation, but the ſentiments of thoſe, who wiſh to expreſs the feelings of their hearts. Time will not permit us to treſpaſs on your patience, by relating the many favours you have conferred on us. Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, ye guardians of our education; may the beſt of heaven's bleſſings reward your virtues.</p>

In youth ten thouſand faſcinating charms captivate the paſſions, and divert the mind from the nobler purſuits of ſcience. Theſe can be overcome by reſolution and perſeverance only.

We now, young Gentlemen, bid you adieu, wiſhing you may do honour to the place of your education, and receive the approbation of a grateful country.</p>

               <p>WITH a heart filled with the tendereſt emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, I now addreſs a ſociety with whom I have participated in the moſt friendly intercourſe; in whoſe arms and attachment I have paſſed the happieſt moments of my life; with whom I have formed a connexion in purſuits the moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norary to our natures, and uſeful to mankind. We have enjoyed in common the pleaſures and advantages of ſcience and philoſophy. But theſe ſcenes, ſo pleaſing to the youthful mind, are ſoon to be cloſed. The time ſet apart and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to our education is meaſured and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted. A new day advances with haſte, to light us to the boſom of our country. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful retreats of philoſophic repoſe are to be exchanged for the rights and duties of civil ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety. This to us becomes an all-important pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod; while it terminates our reſidence in the
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:031712_0014_0FEE15B0ABF042B0"/>ſchool of claſſic erudition, it gives us admiſſion on the wide theatre of the world. We become citizens of an enlightened nation. Let us carry with us into its boſom thoſe leſſons of patriot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm and freedom we have been taught in the ſhades of the academic grove. Let our future lives, as citizens and as men, be worthy the place of our education. May thoſe who have with parental care guided the ſteps of our youth, rejoice in our future uſefulneſs to mankind. We cannot deny them this ſmall recompence. May our lives be ever governed by the great lights of reaſon and revelation. Then ſhall we meet theſe our friends beyond the narrow tide of time, where ſighing and ſorrow ſhall be no more, and tears ſhall be wiped from all faces. Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated by this heart-cheering proſpect, ſet us put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the career of unlimited improvement. The God of boundleſs love will never ſuffer the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful acquirements of man to ſleep in the cold bed of death. Each improvement we make in virtue, each acquiſition we gain in ſcience, will be treading the courts of immortality.</p>
               <p>Although ſeparated as we ſoon ſhall be by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to our homes—yet by indulging a retro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective view of the ſciences we have ſtudied to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, of the pleaſures we have enjoyed in each other's ſociety, and the friendſhips we have here contracted, ſhall we not daily meet in yon retreat of the Muſes, and ſteal ourſelves from the cares of a buſy world? Yes, my Claſs-Mates, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection of your friendſhip and tenderneſs ſhall often, through the varied ſcenes of future life, excite the tear of ſympathy and love. Your friendly images are too deeply engraved on the tablets of my heart for time ever to eraſe. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, dear Brothers, my beſt wiſhes for your future happineſs. May the gentle breath of peace forever attend you. But why ſhould we, in the
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:031712_0015_0FEE15BA45430008"/>midſt of this liſtening and ſympathiſing audience, recount our attachments, or renew the ſincerity of our friendſhip? They are not inſenſible of our feelings. They can witneſs to the reluctance of our parting.</p>
               <p>But time haſtens us to perform the moſt pleaſing and affecting ſcene of this day's anniverſary.</p>
               <p>To you, ye Companions of my youthful days, I now appeal for a deſcription of ſenſations with which my heart is agitated.</p>
               <p>I muſt bid you a long, perhaps to ſome of you —an eternal adieu!. Let not our ſeparation weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en or break the cords of friendſhip and love.</p>
               <p>I have now arrived at the moſt trying ſcene my duty has ever called me to perform. The curtain of ſeparation is faſt drawing. One more moment diſſolves forever our collegiate connexion. With the ſincerity of a friend, the love of a brother, and the benediction of heaven, I wiſh you all an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate FAREWELL!</p>
