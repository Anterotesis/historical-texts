            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>AN <hi>ORATION,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THE universe consists of a vast gradation of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. From the lowest instinct to the highest created intelligence are intermediate orders, in a regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly graduated succession; each order constituting a distinct link in the great chain, and all together com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing one stupendous, systematic whole. At the head of this gradation, on earth, is man. Raised by the fiat of Omnipotence to preeminence in this lower creation, he is invested with a dominion over all the tribes of animated nature. Earth, air, and sea, with all throughout this wide domain, lay their homage at his feet, and move in subserviency to his purposes. The whole race, however, occupies but a single grade in the general scale; and they drop from the all cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ative Hand into a state of perfect equality. Every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual, upon whom the GOD of nature has impressed the stamp of humanity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is entitled to all the rights and prerogatives of man. All, therefore, being naturally in a state of equal freedom and independence, ought to regard each other, as brethren, and fellow sovereigns of the world.</p>
            <p>Yet such has been the prevalence of ambition, such the lust of domination, that man has, time immemorial, invaded the rights of man, assumed prerogatives, in defiance of the laws of nature, &amp; arrogated a sovereignty over his fellows; a sovereignty, which belongs only to the supreme Governor of the universe. Hence o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginated imaginary gradations among men—hence the distinctions, lords and vassals, masters and slaves; hence the doctrine of servile submission of the many to the few.</p>
            <p>This assumption of power, this violent invasion of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prescriptible rights, laid, at an early period, a foundation for all the revolutions, which, during the progress of humanity, have deranged the features of the social and political world. Nature has made provision against
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:029922_0003_0FE3140BB40C3FD0"/>
the violation of her laws, and the confusion of her system, by inspiring her whole offspring with invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble abhorrence of degradation from the rank, in which she has placed them. Usurpers, therefore, have, in all ages, met with opposition; an opposition founded on the eternal principles of right, and the feelings of the human heart. Ever since the standard of tyranny was erected on the plains of Shinaan, the contest between right and prerogative has been agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, with unremitting violence and devastation. This contest has involved the most tragical scenes, which have ever been exhibited on the theatre of nations. By this, the garden of nature has been converted to a field of blood!—</p>
            <p>To support their usurpation, and advance the cause of arbitrary sway, the despots of the world have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hausted all the resources of artifice, as well as force. Too well have they known, that science and the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which is delineated in the volumes of nature and revelation, ever range themselves under the ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of liberty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that ignorance and superstition furnish the ground, upon which the foundations of ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny are consolidated. Hence they have employed every possible mean to darken and terrify the world. The mysteries of paganism, the doctrines, of the Koran, and the thunders of the conclave, have been plied, as engines of despotism, till mankind was reduced to a state of meanness and servility, infinitely below the dignity of the human character, and the way prepared for the establishment of the tyrannical system, in a great part of the globe.</p>
            <p>The grand contest between right and prerogative commenced in the regions of the east. Asia, first in every thing, was first to embrace the shackles of sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very. For ages convulsed, and distracted by perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al struggles, she at length gave over the controversy, and bowed to the enormous weight of consolidated empire. Africa was next prostrated at the foot of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, and forced to resign her rights and liberties in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of petty tyrants and usurpers. The fate of Europe was stamped at the passage of the Rubicon.
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:029922_0004_0FE3140DCECF0BD0"/>
Here may we fix a memorable epoch in the history of despotism. It is easy to see, that all the revolutions, which took place, and all the scenes, which were acted upon the European theatre, subsequent to the extinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Roman liberty, compose one connected series of events, which paved the way for the consolidation of a refined tyrannical system, in that quarter of the globe. This was a system, which, by cementing a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alition of despots, and artfully ballancing their res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pective powers, embraced all the advantages, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected all the disadvantages, of the unwieldy empires of Asia, and the petty regencies of Africa. This sys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem was consummated in the last century, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, unimpaired, till a late period in the present.</p>
            <p>Thus was tyranny established in three quarters of the globe. Asia, Africa, and Europe, sunk under the weight of oppression, and exhibited a dreary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vastation of humanity. The Genius of Liberty, exiled from the eastern continent, sought an asylum in the wilds of the new world. Even here, however, the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial fugitive found but a narrow residence; for alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy had the Colossus of tyranny bestrid the Atlantic, and secured a footing near the western sun. The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glo-Americans alone, of the civilized world, retained the spirit and sentiments of a free people, and they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone promised adherence to the standard of liberty.</p>
            <p>Britain, at this time, held an eminent rank among the nations of the earth:—Britain the land of our father's sepuchres, the birth-place of freemen—the pretended friend and advocate of liberty; but the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riest champion in the cause of tyranny. Raised by a long series of prosperity to the empire of the main, she affected to waft the terror of her arms to remotest realms, and awe the world to submission. Flushed with recent conquest, and plumed with laurels, won by her prowess from the combined powers of France and Spain, she assumed the nod of universal decision, and grasped at the power <hi>paramount</hi> on both sides the Atlantic. As from this giddy pinnacle of false glory she looked round on the world, she cast an indignant eye on a people, who presumed to set bounds to her
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:029922_0005_0FE31414CB4306B0"/>
ambition, and hold in check the tide of oppression. Her American colonies, though steady in their alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance to the parent state, had never relinquished the rights of man, nor bowed the knee to the Baal of ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny. Notwithstanding therefore their loyalty, &amp; their zeal for the glory of her empire, she regarded their senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as dangerous to her boasted prerogative; and the spirited language of freemen gave her more distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance, than could the whole artillery of Europe united a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst her. She anxiously eyed the sacred flame, which they kept burning upon the altar of freedom, &amp; foresaw, that unless speedily extinguished, it would consume the pillars of her own grandeur, and even the fabric of des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potism. Britain, in fine, regarded her Colonies, as the sole guardians of the celestial standard, as the forlorn <hi>Corps de reserve</hi> of the cause of liberty and equal rights, and presumed, that to bring them to her feet would at once place her own glory beyond the region of danger, terminate, forever, the contest between right and prerogative, and establish the tyrannical system upon a basis never more to be shaken. For this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, she roused and summoned her whole might. To this point she directed all the politics of her cabinet, all the resources of her finances, and the whole force of her armament. Well collected and prepared, she rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her arm to deal the tremendous stroke, which was, at once, to decide the fate of the world.</p>
            <p>This was a crisis.—The colonists were struck with consternation—the Genius of Liberty lifted herself from the earth, on the point to revisit her native skies— Europe beheld with amazement—the eyes of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse were fixed on the scene—and nature was anxious for the event!—<hi>Let them be sovreign states,</hi> said a voice from Heaven!—<hi>Let them be sovreign states,</hi> reechoed the colonial Congress!—The voice reverberated through the world, and nature felt relief.—The ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial genius realighted upon earth, and reanimated freemen rallied, in crowds, around her standard. Under her banners, &amp; the auspices of Heaven, they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rested the blow—they triumphed, they confirmed their independence. Thus the pride of Britain was humbled
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:029922_0006_0FE314165523BE40"/>
—thus the efforts of tyranny were baffled—thus the towering hopes of despots were blasted—thus the rights of nature were vindicated!</p>
            <p>This, my fellow citizens, is the anniversary of that eventful day, which declared the Independence and sovereignty of United Columbia;—this is the day, which arrested despotism, and made a decisive stand for the liberties of man;—this is the day, which opened, to the intelligent universe a new and glorious succession of events;—this is the natal day of the regenerated world! The transactions of the 4TH OF JULY, 1776, are registered in the archives of Heaven, and their influence, in the affairs of nations, will be felt through the revolution of ages. The voice, which, this day, proclaimed these states independent, shook the political world to the centre,—the shackles were loosened from the human mind—the bulwarks of despotism were levelled with the ground—thrones tottered on their bases—and the Dagon of tyranny fell, prostrate, before the altar of Liberty.</p>
            <p>Americans! the declaration of Independence was the salvation of our country. It was this, which blew in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a flame the almost smothered embers of freedom, and roused, from the vale of despondence, the genius of Columbia. It was this, which wrested us from the grasp of tyranny, from the iron hand of oppression, and promoted us, to an eminent rank, among the nations of the earth. This is the first link in a grand chain of events, which issued in the establishment of a consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, which combines the wisdom of ages, which se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures to us the rights, the privileges, &amp; the blessings, of a free people, and, under which, this federal republic is rapidly ascending the heights of political importance and national glory.</p>
            <p>Can any thing be wanting to awaken our sensibility to the blessings we enjoy, as the fruits of our freedom and Independence? Cast an eye over the world—look at Asia,—at Africa,—at a great part of Europe, and America. What a prospect rises to our view! A scene of oppression—a waste of humanity—a ravage of nature—a world of slaves!—Ye ministers of benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:029922_0007_0FE31417E0AF62C8"/>
draw the veil.—But turn, my fellow citizens, to a brighter scene—turn home!—Survey these favorite states—this pleasant land of liberty—this fairest dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trict of creation. See here a race of men—a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of freemen—a band of brothers, united upon the principles of equality, by the bonds of nature, of soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, and of benevolence. Here is happiness—here is dignity—here is sublimity of character!—Here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignant Nature smiles on her work, and rejoices in the advancement of her offspring—Here the day is active, and the night secure; while, borne o'er the turrets of this western world, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the shadowy fleecings of the sky, Peace beams a diffusive radiance on the scene, and sheds her kindly influence into every soul. Here the forest becomes a luxuriant field, the desert assumes the blooming aspect of Eden, and the crude materials of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are wrought into articles of use, convenience, and elegance; while Commerce, from every distant shore, rolls to our ports her golden tides, which flow in am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple streams throughout the land. See here the bright fields of Science, trodden by the frequent foot of Genius, and the flowery heights of Parnassus thronged by the votaries of the Muses: while even the peasant lights his flambeau at the hallowed shrine of philosophy, and the meanest religionist burns incense, upon his own altar, to the God of nature.</p>
            <p>The transactions of this day are not, however, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, in their happy effects, to our nation, nor to our age. United Columbia is but a miniature of what the world shall shortly be. Already have the beams of philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy irradiated the political horizon of the eastern world; there the public mind begins to emerge from the gloom, in which it has long been inveloped, and to expatiate in regions more bright and more congen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ial to its nature. A spark, wafted from this land of freedom, has enkindled the flame beyond the Atlantic. Liberty has again erected her standard, on the shores of Europe, and, from the brow of the rampart, demands a reestablishment in that quarter of the globe. Her po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent voice, like that, which ran through the regions of primeval chaos, has, from the confused elements of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:029922_0008_0FE314196D6352E0"/>
nature, called forth myriads of embattled freemen to assert her cause. These, with the impetuosity of a torrent, rush upon the empire of despotism and sweep thrones, dignities and distinctions into one general ruin. In vain does the world rise in arms against them. Where is the monarchy of France, where the despotic race of the Capets?—Where is the aristocracy of Holland? Where the tyranny of the house of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ange? Where are the impregnable fortresses of Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders? Where the antient boundaries of Spain and of the German empire? Nay, where is the threatening front and the boasted arm of the tyrannical coalition? And still the tocsin sounds—still the flame rages— still liberty is mounted in the car of victory. And thus shall it be, till tyranny has measured back the course, by which it advanced over the globe, and till the tree of liberty be planted in the place of every throne in the universe. The subversion of the Gallic monarchy, the abolition of Belgic aristocracy, and the general convulsion of Europe, are but a prelude to the final catastrophe of the tyrannical system. Scene o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens after scene, in great and rapid succession. The grand consummation is at hand—the conflagration of the political world; that conflagration, which this day enkindled, and from its ashes is arising a new and more glorious fabric—a fabric founded on the eternal prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of virtue and of reason.</p>
            <p>Hail the auspicious day! Well may it be celebrated as the festival of man, as the jubilee of nations. So long as virtue shall warm the patriot, so long as benev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence shall enliven the universe, so long may the FOURTH OF JULY be solemnized, as a sacred anniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say, throughout the world. This day, let creation as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume her brightest glories:—May those morningstars, which sang the birth of time, with sweetest music, ush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in the dawn: may the slowly advancing Sun, as he traverses the concave of heaven, diffuse his mildest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, and light all nature into smiles, while every land breaks forth in songs of joy!</p>
            <p>It is for us, Americans! it is for us, as the eldest brothers of freemen, to lead, in the solemnities of this
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:029922_0009_0FE3142064CA4238"/>
day. Proclaim it, then, sacred to virtue, to patriot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ism, and to the rights of nature! Display the ensigns of freedom, rear the triumphal arch, blaze upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of despotism, in all the majesty of a free people! Throw wide the portals of Liberty, throng her sacred temple,—renew the solemn vows at her altar, and swear eternal fidelity to the laws of nature, and the rights of man!—Rehearse the history of American In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence,—Hail the rising Republics of Europe, and announce to the world, the prevalence of reason, the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs of freedom, and the downfall of tyranny! Bril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liancy and exultation become the day! But, while each soul dilates with joy—while every bosom glows with the patriotic flame, and every tongue pronounces a <hi>health and fraternity</hi> to the world, let grateful an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thems, to the GOD of reason, fill earth with harmony, till seraphs catch the rapturous song! Nor let us, on this joyous occasion, forget, that our Independence was seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the blood of thousands of our fathers and our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. Sacred be the memory of WARREN, of MONT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GOMERY, and of all, who bled in their country's cause—this day will we celebrate their virtues and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count their achievements—this day will we rear mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uments to eternize their fame and inshrine their ashes in our inmost bosoms. And the still surviving patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots, who, either in the cabinet or in the field, asserted and maintained the rights of man and the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of these States, shall this day be honored, as the saviours and defenders of their country, and as the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments of human nature. Especially, let the man, who in war was our shield, and in peace becomes our guardian and glory, this day, renewedly receive the united acknowledgements of his grateful country. It was virtue like his, my fellow citizens, which ensured success, in the arduous struggle for Liberty and Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence; and such virtue alone can perpetuate the blessings of our Federal Union, and support that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, which is the Palladium of our political exist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Let us, then, rouse into activity all that is great, all that is noble, all that is patriotic in man—Let vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue be the stability of our Republic, and patriotism
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:029922_0010_0FE3142279BE8438"/>
the bond of our political union. Let us prize, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuable, the privileges of a free people, and hold, as inviolable, the principles of a free government. While we maintain that vigilance and that spirit of free in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vestigation, which have ever been the guardians of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican Liberty, let us, at the same time, cultivate a reverence for the laws and the constituted authorities; and detested be the wretch, who would heap unreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able odium upon the public functionaries, invidiously destroy the influence of merit, or wantonly hurl the fire-brand of discord into the bosom of his country. While we enter, warmly, into the cause of humanity, and rejoice in the success of our brethren in arms, for the rights of nature, let us be just and benevolent to all nations, and remember, that even the savages of the wilderness are members, with us, of the great family of man. And, while, with open arms, our Federal Republic invites, to her bosom, the distressed of all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and promises an asylum from the sword, perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, and oppression, shall an unransomed American groan under the bloody scourge of a barbarous Alge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine; or an unfortunate African drag the chains of slavery, in the very sanctuary of freedom! Nature remonstrates, and Nature will vindicate her rights.</p>
            <p>Americans! we are elevated upon the high places of liberty—a monument to all nations, of the natural rights of man, and the attainable sublimity of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man character; and, forbid it, Heaven! it should ever be said of these Confederated States, they <hi>once</hi> were inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent, they <hi>once</hi> were virtuous, they <hi>once</hi> were free. For ever may we support the majesty of a free people; forever may despots tremble at the American name! May we escape the disasters, which have befallen the Republics of ancient and modern times, and transmit, inviolate, to remotest posterity, our birthright, among regenerated nations. And while, aloof from the din of battle, and the ravage of war, we survey the awful conflict between republicans and despots; while we see kings hurled from their thrones, kingdoms torn up by the roots, and empires swept from the stage; may we rejoice in the rapid progress of reason, and
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:029922_0011_0FE3142408ACC788"/>
the consequent emancipation of man, and gratefully anticipate the day, when war and tyranny, with all their horrors, shall cease from the earth, and when un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interrupted peace, benevolence, and happiness, shall prevail, under the glorious reign of IMMANUEL, throughout the <hi>Universal Republic</hi> of the CONFEDE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RATED WORLD!</p>
