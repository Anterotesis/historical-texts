            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The PREFACE.</head>
            <p>HOW <hi>Pious</hi> or <hi>Learned</hi> the Author of the Book I undertake to answer may be, I am no more concern'd to know, than I am who the Author is, whom the Publisher hath thought fit to commend as such; and having so done, to conceal. But he is not (as far as I conceive) the more <hi>Learned</hi> or <hi>Pious</hi> for Writing this Book: Not the more <hi>Learned</hi>; for by all the helps he professes to have had from <hi>Didoclavius,</hi> &amp;c. he is guilty of many gross and palpable Mistakes: And not the more <hi>Pious,</hi> because of the uncharitable Reflections and Inferences he every where makes. F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>r would any man of a truly Christian Temper alledge these things now against the Common-Prayers, which were alter'd or expunged above thirty years before he publish'd his <hi>Brief Discourse?</hi> Or charge us with <hi>violating</hi> the Word of God, because we change the word <hi>Sabbath</hi> for the <hi>Seventh</hi> Day; or say that we sacrilegiously steal from it, because <hi>Hallelujah,</hi> or <hi>Praise the Lord,</hi> is sometimes left out in the Reading-Psalms; or that we equal the Apocrypha to, or set it up above the Canonical Scriptures, because it's read on the Highest Holy-days (as he saith, but not very truly) tho the Articles of our Church expresly declare them to be only of hamane composition. Suppose now I should treat this Author after the same manner; and whereas he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses to have <hi>compared</hi> our <hi>Liturgy</hi> with the <hi>Missal</hi> &amp;c. I should take all advantages given in his Book, to shew, that notwithstanding this, he had never read them. I am certain, I could much more easily, and as charitably do it, as he make good his abovesaid Charge. For would any one conversant in the <hi>Missal, Breviary</hi> and <hi>Ritual</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> have said (as he doth, <hi>p 5.) That</hi> Beza <hi>notes, that in the</hi> Roman <hi>Liturgy men are taught to cry,</hi> Iesu Miserere mei, <hi>no less than ten times one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</hi> For what need he quote <hi>Beza</hi> for that which he has (as he saith) read himself; and which after all, <hi>Beza</hi> mistook, and he with <hi>Beza</hi>; or rather h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> mistakes <hi>Beza</hi> in; since the <hi>Jesu Miserere</hi> thus repeated, is not in the <hi>Missal,</hi> &amp;c. but in private Offices of that Church. Who again, that had been conversant in our Liturgy, would have said as the Author, <hi>Some have observ'd that of 172 Apocryphal Chapters, but 38 are omitted</hi>? For
<pb facs="unknown:001592_0004_0FB3D95B13822400"/>
what need be to be beholden to another's <hi>Observation,</hi> for what he that had thus read the Liturgy must have under his own eye? So easy it is to repay him in his own Coin, if we will reflect and infer after his way.</p>
            <p>It's a shrewd sign this Author was hard put to it to make good his Charge against the Liturgy, and to prove his Point, That it's unlawful to <hi>be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent at the Common-Prayer Worship.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And after all, it's of little Service to our Author, and those of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, to make such Exceptions as he has done; for if all things were alter'd and remov'd that he obj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> in their Publick Congregations.</p>
            <p>Indeed he had dealt more sincerely, if he had acquainted his Reader; That they hold it unlawful to communicate with us, because we are a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Church; and that they dont joyn in the Common-Prayer Worship, because it's a Form, and all Forms are in his Opinion unlawful. This indeed had struck at the Root of all; but this he knew was not so easily prov'd, nor would look so p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <head>A BRIEF DISCOURSE Concerning the Lawfulness of Worshipping GOD BY THE COMMON-PRAYER.</head>
            <p>THE Question proposed by the Author, is,</p>
            <p>Q <hi>What are the Reasons why you judge it unlawful to be present at, or to partake in the Common Prayer Worship?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Reason he gives are four taken,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>From the Original of the Common-Prayer-Book, which,</hi> saith he, <hi>with the Ceremonies and Worship prescribed therein, I find to be in a great measure Popish and Heathenish.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. <hi>From the Matter of the Common Prayer-Book</hi>

            <p n="3">3. <hi>Because Publick Liturgies of Humane Composure, are an Innovation and Deviation from Primitive Purity.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>These are the Reasons he advances, and by which he endeavours to justify their continuance in a Separation from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the Worship therein Administred.</p>
            <p>And these I shall take the liberty to examine.</p>

               <head>CHAP. I. Of the Original of the <hi>English</hi> Liturgy.</head>
               <p>OUR Author saith, <hi>That the Common Prayer Book, with the Ceremonies and Worship prescribed therein, are in a great measure Popish and Heathenish</hi>; and therefore it is unlawful to joyn with it.</p>
               <p>This will be resolved into Two Questions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q</hi> 1. Whether the Common Prayer be taken out of the Mass-Book, and be Heathenish, as well as Popish?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q</hi> 2. Whether the being taken-out of the Mass-Book, makes it unlawful to be used or joyned with, tho' it be good and lawful in it self?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q</hi> 1. Whether the Common Prayer is taken out of the Mass Book? As our Author takes care to represent it, one would think there is little of the <hi>Roman</hi> Service left out in ours. <hi>The Common Prayer,</hi> saith he, <hi>is in a great measure Popish — is taken out of the Popes Mass Book — it cannot be denied it's derived from thence,</hi> p 1. <hi>There is very little in the</hi> English, <hi>which is not to be found in the other,</hi> p. 2. This is matter of Fact, and so is not to be determined by Authority. He himself makes a fair proposal, which I shall accept of, viz <hi>Let such as have any hesitancy about this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter compare the Popish Missal,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>with the</hi> English <hi>Liturgy, and they will be cenvinced,</hi> That he had never read and compared them; or is guilty of a notorious Abuse that he puts upon his Ignorant Reader, that after he pretends to have read and compared, shall assert so gross a falshood, and say, There is very little in the <hi>English,</hi> that is not to be found in the other, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. For there is little comparatively in the <hi>English,</hi> which is to be found in the <hi>Roman</hi> Liturgy, and far more is left out, than ever was taken thence. This is indeed directly contrary to what he affirms, and yet let any one compare them, and he will be convinced of the truth of it. Take that which is called <hi>the Canon of the Mass,</hi> or Form of Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string the Eucharist, and there is no Agreement, not one Collect or Prayer the same. Go we to Baptism, there is not one Prayer belonging to that Office that is in ours. And as for the Litany, there is not a third part of theirs in ours, and much in ours which is not in theirs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is nothing in the Service of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which makes it <hi>the Popes Missal,</hi> and is peculiar to that Church, that is in ours; that is, there is no Popery in our Liturgy. This he is in part forced to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:001592_0007_0FB3D95F932DFD08"/>
                  <hi>There are,</hi> saith he, <hi>things (as Prayers for the Dead,</hi> &amp;c.) <hi>in the</hi> Roman <hi>Liturgy, which are not translated into</hi> English. His <hi>Et cetera,</hi> if branched into particulars, would be very large, as he could not but know, if he had <hi>read</hi> and <hi>compared</hi> them. As for Example, Where are their Crossings, Elevati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Adoration of the Elements? Where their Solitary Communion, and Communion in one kind? Where their frequent Crossings of themselves, and of the Book? Where their material Crosses, and the Adoration of them? Where their Prayers for the Dead? Where their Intercessors, the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> and Saints, that are to be found in the Canon of the Mass? Where are the many Exorcisms, the Puffs they blow in the Infants face, their Conjuration of Salt, <hi>for a wholesome Sacrament to the driving away of Devils,</hi> that's put into the Mouth of the Infant, <hi>as a Propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto Eternal Life</hi>? Where the Spittle with which the Ears and Nostrils of the Infant are touched with an <hi>Ephphatha, be opened</hi>? Where the <hi>Oyl of Salvation,</hi> (as it's call'd) wherewith the Priest anoints the Child's Breast and Shouldiers in form of a Cross? Where the Chrism or Oyntment wherewith he anoints the Crown of the Head in figure of a Cross? Where the change of Garments, their Purple and White Robe, that the Child is to <hi>carry unspotted before the Tribunal of our Lord</hi>? Where the lighted Candle put into the Child's hand, that <hi>when our Lord shall come to the Wedding, he may meet him</hi>? Where the many Crossings of the Head before Baptism, and of the Eyes, Ears, Nostrils, Breast, Shouldiers, Mouth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be found in their Ritual and Pasto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral? <hi>Lastly,</hi> To go no further, Where are the <hi>O Holy</hi> Mary, <hi>Mother of God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>pray for us</hi>? Where are the Angels and Arch-Angels, the Patriachs and Prophets the Apostles and Evangelists; the Martyrs, Popes and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors, the Priests and Levites, the Monks and Hermits, the Virgins and Widows, the Forty seven Saints in particular, and all Saints in general, that are called upon in their Litiny, <hi>Pray for us</hi>? And if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is truly Popish be to be found in our Liturgy, we have so far reason to deny that it's taken out of the Mass-Book.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I add, That our Service is so far from being taken out of the Missal, that whatsoever in it is the same with the Office in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is mostly taken out of the Ancient Offices of the Christian Church. And because every one cannot compare it, I will produce Impartial Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority for it. Thus saith Mr. <hi>Ball,</hi> a Nonconformist of great Note in the last Age, <hi>The</hi> English <hi>Liturgy is not a Collection out of the Mass Book, but a refining of the Liturgy,</hi>

of <hi>New England,</hi> wrote <hi>Anno</hi> 1637 <hi>It's no hard task to shew, that our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice Book was reformed in most things according to the purest Liturgies, which were in use long before the Mass was heard of in the World,</hi> p. 2.</p>
               <p>To these I will add one more, for the Character our Author gives of him, <hi>viz</hi> Bishop <hi>Iewel</hi> (whom he calls <hi>that great Light in the</hi> English <hi>Church,</hi> p. 9) Who saith, <hi>We are come as near as possibly we could to the Church of Apostles, and of the old Catholick Bishops and Fathers. — And besides we have aimed not only our Doctrine, but Sacraments also, and Form of our Publick Prayers after the patern of their Rites and Ordinances.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To say the truth, its a very odd thing to represent our Liturgy as Popish, when those that composed and useth the Liturgy, were burnt by the Papists for it, and when to this day they will not communicate in it, nor with the Church that used it. Our Author saith, <hi>There have been Iesuits and Popish Intelligencers that approved of our Service, and Pope</hi> Pius 5<hi>th would have ratified it?</hi> And is it therefore Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish? The Independant allows the Presbyterian Confession of Faith; And this Author saith, p. 4 <hi>It must be acknowledged that such of the Church-of</hi> England-<hi>men, as keep to the</hi> 39 <hi>Articles in matter of Doctrine, are as Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox as any Protestants in the World.</hi> And is therefore the Independant a Presbyterian, or this Author a Church-of-<hi>England</hi> man? I trow not. All is, that they agree in the common Principles the other receives, and yet one is no more the other, than if they had no agreement in such Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. And so is it here, the <hi>English</hi> Liturgy has nothing but what is agreeable to the Doctrine of the Gospel, and allowable by the Christian Church; and therefore what the Papist will, or ought to allow; but for all that, we are no more Papists, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>or that any more Popish, than the Independant is a Presbyterian, or our Author a Church-of-<hi>England</hi>-man. It was not then, because it was Popish, that they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of our Service, but that it was Christian, and pure in its Order and Composure: It was not because it was Popish, that the Pope would have ratified it, but because upon any terms he would have prevailed upon Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to own his Authority, and regain'd her to their Church.</p>
               <p n="4">4. However I deny not, but that the Compilers of the Liturgy did peruse the Popish Offices, and take as much from thence, as was confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madable to the Ancient Offices, and was fit to be used; and that the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>, that they might the more easily satisfy doubting or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented Minds under the Alterations then made, and induce them to comply with them. And this was the meaning of King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Proclamation. A practice very Christian and commendable, and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

               <p>And which the Nation soon felt the happy Effects of, when by this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Conduct it became, generally speaking, Reformed. But yet after all, so little was taken out of the Mass Book, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that they differ'd more than they agreed in, and more was left than taken out.</p>
               <p>But our Author stays not here, <hi>That the</hi> English <hi>Liturgy,</hi> saith he, <hi>is ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally Heathenish as well as Popish, is manifest,</hi> 1. <hi>In that the Pope's Liturgy from whence ours is deriv'd, is so. The principal Parts of the Mass-Book were borrowed from Idolatrous Pagans. They came from</hi> Numa Pompilius, <hi>p.</hi> 4. <hi>Ans.</hi> It has been sufficiently made out by Protestants, that there is a great Affinity and Agreement between the Heathenish and Pop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sh Rites; but our Author does an injury to the Argument, when affirming, that the <hi>Principal Parts</hi> of the Mass-Book were borrowed from Idolatrous Pagans, he goes no further than <hi>Vestments, Holy Water, and Incense,</hi> as if these were the <hi>principal Parts</hi> of the Mass-Book, and the chief things that that agreed in with the Idolatry of the Heathens.</p>
               <p>But this indeed is not to our purpose; suppose there be this Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity between the Papist and the Pagan; what is that to us, if we agree with neither? But that he attempts to prove.</p>
               <p>But tho' he cannot find <hi>Incense</hi> and <hi>Holy Water,</hi> and his <hi>Et caetera</hi> among <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, yet he saith, <hi>What vain Repetitions does the Common Prayer Book abound with? In one Service the Worshippers must repeat these words,</hi> Good Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver us, <hi>Eight times over. And,</hi> We beseech thee to hear us, <hi>Twenty times over. The</hi> Gloria Patri <hi>is to be repeated Ten times in the same Morning or Evening Service. That the Heathens were wont to Worship their Idols just after the same manner, is clear from</hi> Matth. 7. &amp;c. <hi>And</hi> Beza <hi>notes, That the</hi> Roman <hi>Liturgy does abound with them, wherein Men are taught to cry,</hi> Jesu, Jesu, miserere mei, <hi>no less then Ten times one after another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the better Resolution of which, I shall proceed in this order.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We grant, that there may be such things as vain Repetitions in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and other Divine Offices, for that is a fault our Saviour charges on the Heathens; and what we, as well as our Author, charge on the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and is also frequently charged by those that use and plead for Forms, on those that use extemporary Prayers.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We yet do maintain, That there are such Repetitions in Divine Worship, as are not vain, that are neither Heathenish or Popish. Such do we read of in the <hi>Old Testament</hi> as <hi>Psalm</hi> 57.1.75.1, 4, 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 94<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1.103.1, 2, 22.107 8, 15, 21, 31.136 <hi>throughout.</hi> And thus our Saviour repeated the same words thrice in his Agony in the Garden, <hi>Matt.</hi> 26.44<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and twice
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:001592_0010_0FB3D9641314B078"/>
on the Cross, <hi>Matt</hi> 27 46. And consequently all Repetitions are no more condemned by our Saviour in <hi>Matt.</hi> 6.7. than all long Prayers are, <hi>Matt.</hi> 23.14. So that the vanity of Repetitions does not consist in using the same words eight times or twenty times in Prayer. For do we repeat in our Service, <hi>Good Lord deliver us,</hi> eight times: And <hi>Glory be to the Father,</hi> &amp;c. ten times? And, <hi>We beseech thee to hear us, good Lord,</hi> twenty times? So we find, that they not only had their thrice, and their four times, but their twenty seven times in every Verse of <hi>Psalm</hi> 136. <hi>His mercy endureth for ever</hi>; which <hi>Psalm</hi> was most used on solemn Occasions, as we may find it, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 5.13.7.3, 6 20, 21. <hi>Ezra</hi> 3.11. <hi>Ior.</hi> 33.11. So that we may more truly say of the Church of God among the <hi>Iews,</hi> than he doth of the <hi>Heathens,</hi> and their Idols, that <hi>they were wont to Worship</hi> God <hi>just after the same manner,</hi> with Repetitions in their Service, as we.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We are to consider wherein the vanity of Repetitions consists, so as to be after the manner of the Heathens. This admits great variety, and just bounds cannot be set; so that it's not to be exactly said, Here the vain Repetitions begin. But they are such;</p>
               <p n="1">1. When they that use them, think that they shall be <hi>heard for their much speaking,</hi> as our Saviour saith, the Heathens did: Thus the Priests of <hi>Baal</hi> did, crying out, <hi>O Baal hear us,</hi> from Morning till Noon; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly <hi>Elijah</hi> upbraids them. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.26, 27.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When it is nothing but Tautology, <hi>viz.</hi> a Repetition of the same words without new Matter; or of the same matter, but in different words. Such were the Verses of <hi>Battus</hi> the babling Poet. Such were the Hymns used often by the Heathens, in the worship of their gods. Such are the <hi>Iesu, Iesu<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c.</hi> without Intermission, sometimes used in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church.</p>
               <p>But when there are distinct Petitions, as when we say, <hi>We beseech thee to hear us good Lord,</hi> it's as lawful to close each after that manner, as it is to say <hi>Amen,</hi> which we find to follow every particular Petition, and was distinctly repeated for twelve times together after that manner, <hi>Deut.</hi> 27.15.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Vain Repetitions, are when the words are thought sufficient, tho' the Heart be not with them; but this may be common to any. So that tho' there are Repetitions in our Service, as there were among the Heathen, and are in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet ours are not vain, nor such Repetitions as theirs, by reason of the matter only, if accompanied with the heart.</p>
               <p n="3">3 He saith, <hi>Some of the most Learned Patrons of Liturgies produce it as an Argument for them, that the Heathen made use of Forms in their Idolatrous Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> p 5 And so he makes this the difference between the Heathens and Christians, that the first used Forms, but the last prayed without them. As for the practice of the Christians, we shall have occasion to speak of
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:001592_0011_0FB3D96593376348"/>
it under another Head; neither shall I trouble my self with the Opinion of those <hi>Learned Patrons of Liturgies,</hi> he speaks of: But I shall take his Argument as it lies before us, which is, That our Liturgy is Heathenish, because we use Forms a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> they did. He might as well have said, our Litur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>gy is Heathenish, because we use words as they did, since it's no more Heathenish to use Forms than Words. If they had the use of Forms, it rather shews the sense that Mankind generally have of this matter; and that there cannot be too great a care taken of our demeanour in Divine Worship, according to the Direction of the Wise man, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 5 2 <hi>Be not rash with thy mouth</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for God is in heaven,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>therefore let thy words be few,</hi> and well considered. But if the Heathens had Forms, so had the <hi>Iews,</hi> so had Christians, as I shall shew; and so Forms no more make our Worship Heathenish than Jewish. But of this afterwards. But supposing, that our Liturgy was (as he would have it) taken out of the Mass-Book<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet,</p>
               <p>Q 2. Will the being taken out of the Mass-Book, make that Worship which is otherwise, good and lawful, to become unlawful to be used, or joyned with?</p>
               <p>This he affirms, and offers to prove after this manner,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It's a known maxim,</hi> (saith he) Omnis honor Idoli est Idolatria. <hi>He that shall put any respect upon an Idol, cannot be clear of the Sin of Idolatry; but the Mass Book is an Idol. And he that useth a Prayer, or joyns with a Prayer <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                     </gap> an Honour upon an Idol. — How then can we joyn in Prayer taken out of the Idolatrous Mass-Book, and offer them to the Holy God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In which there are there Three things contained.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Mass-Book is an Idol.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That to take a Prayer out of the Mass-Book is a respect to an Idol<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and is Idolatry</p>
               <p n="3">3 That it's unlawful to joyn in Prayers taken out of the Mass-Book</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The Mass Book is an Idol</hi> This we may justly question, because an Idol is the Representation of some Divine or Beatified Obj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ct, and that is as such propounded and set up for Adoration; such are the Images of God and our Saviour, of Angels and Saints in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> But in this sense the Mass Book is no Idol, there is no Prototype or Obj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ct it repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents, nor is any such Adoration paid to it, as is paid to an Image, or a Crucifix We grant as well as he, that the Mass Book is <hi>Idolatrous,</hi> as it contains some things that are so, and is used in Idolatrous Worship: But it no more follows from thence, that it is an Idol, than that the Incense, Holy Water, or Vestments, are Idols, which are used when they say Mass.
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:001592_0012_0FB3D9676CEF1128"/>
But supposing the Mass-Book for once to be an Idol, that we may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the next question, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Whether the taking a Prayer out of the Mass Book, be such a respect to it, as makes the Prayer to be Idolatrous? To this I answer, That the Prayers taken out of the Mass Book, and inserted in our Liturgy, are so far from being a respect, that it is a disrespect to it. For at the same time that some Prayers were taken out, those were rejected that were left behind, for the gross Corruptions that were in them; and by so doing, the Reforme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> as much testified to all the World their abhorrence of it, as the emptying of the House of the Goods and Utensils not infected by the Leprosy, and their forsaking it, was a plain declaration of its Pollution. So that if Prayers taken from thence are good, the using them when taken thence, is no Idolatry, and Communion in them no Sin, and no more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful than it was to use the Vessels that were carried out of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected House.</p>
               <p>But this is the main Question, <hi>viz.</hi>

               <p>This he denies, and for it offers these Reasons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>We ought not to name an Idol, but with detestation; much less may we offer it as Worship to God,</hi> Psal. 16 4. Exod. 23.13. <hi>Hos</hi> 2.16, 17 P. 4.</p>

               <p>Before I proceed to consider these Arguments in particular, I shall state the Case it self; for resolving of which we may observe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That there are things Idolatrous in their own nature, or by a stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing positive Law, and so are always the same. Such is the Picture of God, and Worshipping by Images.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There are things that have been customarily appropriated to Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Worship, and the use of which in common estimation has been accounted Idolatrous Such was the offering Incense among the <hi>Heathens</hi>; and therefore the Primitive Christians refused it, as an acknowledgment of their Worship, and the <hi>Thurificati</hi> were reputed Idolaters.</p>
               <p n="3">3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> There are other things that are used as well in true as Idolatrous

Worship, and are lawful in themselves; such as Time, Place, Habit, Posture.</p>
               <p>The first is always unlawful, and makes the Worship Idolatrous.</p>
               <p>The second is not to be used where it has been thus appropriated, and thus accounted, during such an opinion of them.</p>
               <p>So that it's the last of these that the whole turns upon; for after all the clamour he makes about Idolatry, and the charge he would fain fasten up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, he can produce nothing that is Idolatrous amongst us, no Images, no Prayers to Saints, nor so much as any thing appropriated, or in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon estimation so accounted; no incensing of Books or Images, no sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of Holy Water; but it all amounts to this, that <hi>Forms</hi> and <hi>Repetitions</hi> have been us'd by Idolaters; that they had <hi>White Garments,</hi> and observ'd <hi>Holy days</hi>; So <hi>p</hi> 4 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 8 Which are things lawful in themselves (as I shall shew) and cannot be made unlawful by being us'd in Idolatrous Worship.

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Idolatry is not in the nature of the thing, but in the use, take away the use, and the Idolatry ceaseth; and consequently it may be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully used where there is no Idolatry in the Worship, and no Idolatry in the use of it. And if it be not to be used, it's not because it's unlawful in it self to use it, but because it's forbidden by God, as was the case a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Iews</hi>; or because of some circumstances that make it inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and dangerous. Thus it was lawful to eat that Meat, which had been offer'd to Idols, when it was afterward expos'd to sale in the Shambles, or set upon the Table at an Entertainment;<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.25, 26.</note> because it was thereby restor'd to a common use; when yet it was not lawful to s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t at Meat in an Idols Temple, for that was to have fellowship in the Idolatry, <hi>Chap.</hi> 8.10, 20. It is then no more Idolatry to use a White Garment, or a Temple, or observe a Day, or to use a Prayer that has been used or observ'd in Idolatrous Worship<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or by an Idolatrous Church, than it was to eat Meat that had been offer'd to Idols. Purifie the Gold, and separate the Dross from it, and the Gold is not the worse for the Dross that was before mingled with it. Scrape the Walls, and cast out the infected materials of it, so that the House be freed from the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prosie, and it might have been as well inhabited as if it had never been infected, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.41 (to make use of former Comparisons, <hi>p.</hi> 2<hi>d</hi> and 3<hi>d</hi>) and take the things lawful from the things unlawful, and they become lawful again, and may be lawfully used.</p>
               <p>But saith he <hi>The Rubbish of the Leprous house was to be cast into an unclean place: And the Leprosie breaks out still; therefore we may have no communion with it</hi> p <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>But surely it's the same thing if we leave the House that is infected, as
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:001592_0014_0FB3D96A1516BA38"/>
it is to carry away the Rubbish into an unclean place; else why doth he talk of leaving the Communion for the sake of the Leprosie of Idolatry? We grant the Church we left to be Idolatrous, there the Leprosie is; and therefore we left it; but we left the Idolatry with the Church, and let him prove there is any of the Leprosie of Idolatry in what we have taken out of it, and then he would say somewhat to the purpose; but that he is far from.</p>
               <p>Let us however consider his Arguments relating to the general part. 1. We ought, saith he, not to name an Idol, but with detestation, much less offer it as worship to God.</p>
               <p>I answer, 1<hi>st.</hi> The <hi>naming</hi> there forbidden, is the naming an Idol with respect; and indeed the addressing any Worship to it. So <hi>Psal.</hi> 16.4. <hi>Their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another God; their drink-offering of blood will I no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> offer, nor take up their name into my lips</hi>: That is, they might not name them by way of worship, nor offer Sacrifice to them.</p>
               <p n="2">2<hi>d</hi> Where is there such a naming of an Idol amongst us? what respect do we give to his Idol the <hi>Mass Book</hi>? what Saint do we adore? <hi>But,</hi> saith he, <hi>The Prayers are taken out of the Idolatrous</hi> Mass-Book. But what then, if there be nothing of their Idolatry in the Prayers that are taken thence they are no more Idolatrous than before they were taken into the <hi>Mass Book.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2<hi>d</hi> He saith, <hi>It was</hi> Paul<hi>'s Iudgment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that meat once offer'd to Idols should not be made use of,</hi> 1 Cor 10 28 <hi>Therefore a Service-Book offer'd to Idols ought not to be us'd. For there is a parity of Reason.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I conceive he is much mistaken in the account he gives of the Apostle's <hi>Iudgment,</hi> who is so far from maintaining <hi>meat offer'd to Idols to be unlawful,</hi> that he makes it a thing indifferent (as before); and what a person may with a safe conscience eat of without scruple, unless it be with respect to another's conscience that is thereby offended, as the Apostle determines it, <hi>v.</hi> 28 29 Now if Meat offered to Idols might be eaten of, then a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice-Book that has been used in Idolatrous Worship may be lawfully us'd (when the things contain'd in it are otherwise lawful and good.) <hi>For there is a parity of Reason,</hi> as he argues.</p>
               <p n="3">3 He saith <hi>God hath prohibited his people all symbolizing with Heathen,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>We grant that God did prohibit the <hi>Iews</hi> all symbolizing and agreement with the <hi>Heathens</hi> in their Idolatry. That is not the Question But,</p>
               <p n="1">1 Whether an agreement with Idolaters in what was once used by them in Idolatry, becomes Idolatry, or be unlawful because it has been so used?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Or whether what was forbidden to the <hi>Iews</hi> is forbidden to all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and to Christians as well as they?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="unknown:001592_0015_0FB3D96B954B04F0"/>These we deny.</p>
               <p>The first we deny as to the <hi>Iews,</hi> that every thing us'd in Idolatrous Service was unlawful to them; for he says, <hi>The Priest of</hi> Isis <hi>used to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </p>
               <p>Again, we deny that what was in that kind forbidden to the <hi>Iews,</hi> was forbidden and unlawful to all. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1<hi>st.</hi> A great part of what they were forbidden, was with respect to the people that before Inhabited the Land; with whom they were to make no Covenant, but were utterly to destroy them, their Altars and Groves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Exod. 23.32, 33, 34.12 Deut. 7 2, 3, 5.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They were a people very prone to Idolatry, and so were tied up by strict Restrai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>s and Penaltier.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They both came from <hi>Egypt,</hi> where they had long convers'd with Idolatrous Service, and afterwa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d border'd upon Nations violently ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to Idolatry and Sorcery; and in such circumstances there were these Checks laid upon them; and an assimilation to the Customs of such forbidden.</p>
               <p>And all this was not from the nature of the thing, and because all usages of Idolaters were unlawful, but because of the circumstances of people, time, and place: And if so, then we must leave the case of symbolizing, and no longer make it a Case of Conscience, but of prudence and expediency; and so we are left to judge what is fit to be retained, and what not; what practised, and what not.</p>
               <p>And here our Reformers shew'd their Prudence and Moderation, by what they chose; when the Ceremonies were few; and what were the Ceremonies of the Protestant Church, rather than the <hi>Romish.</hi> When they chose some, that they might not give offence to the Churches of Christ in other parts of the World; and yet retain'd no more, that they might not burthen their own Communion. When the Offices they selected were agreeable to the Ancientest Offices of the Church.</p>
               <p>So that there was no Reformation in any place, where so much temper was preserv'd, and where the purity of Religion, and the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity and solemnity of Divine Service were more regarded: that what was good was retained; what was noxious was purg'd out, and even what was superfluous was exscinded.</p>
               <p>But this he will not allow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For,</hi> saith he, <hi>the use of such a Liturgy doth harden the Papists in their

               <p>But 1. How can such a Liturgy <hi>harden</hi> them in their Idolatry, or <hi>lead</hi> thither, which has none of their Idolary in it; and in which the Papists are expresly charged with Idolatry? <hi>Vid.</hi> Rubrick at the Communion.</p>
               <p n="2">2 How can this harden them or lead thither, which has been the means of banishing and keeping their Idolatry out of the Kingdom?</p>
               <p n="3">3 How can this <hi>harden</hi> them, or <hi>lead</hi> thither, when the Papists agree with our Author, <hi>That it's unlawful to be present at, or partake in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prayer Worship,</hi> and are excommunicated if they do?</p>
               <p n="4">4. How can this harden them, or lead thither, when there is nothing that the Papists more labour to prossess the people with prejudices against?</p>
               <p>But he adds, <hi>p.</hi> 4. <hi>The</hi> Jews <hi>themselves are scandalized by the Liturgy. It's a celebrated Saying among them, That the Christians have their</hi> Jephilleth <hi>from</hi> Armillus; <hi>that is, their Prayer-Books from</hi> Antichrist.</p>
               <p>At what are the <hi>Iews</hi> scandalized? Is it that we have a Liturgy? So have they themselves had of latter Ages at least. And so the Author saith, <hi>p.</hi> 13. That he had <hi>seen Liturgies written in the</hi> Hebrew <hi>Tongue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Is it that we receive our <hi>Prayer Book</hi> from <hi>Antichrist</hi>? Yes, saith he, and for this quotes a <hi>Celebrated Saying</hi> of theirs. But is this the truer for their saying so? They say, it seems, that <hi>Christians have receiv'd their</hi> Prayers <hi>from</hi> Antichrist: But I hope that there are many Christians in the World, that have Prayer-Books which they never received from the <hi>Antichrist</hi> he speaks of; So the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Abyssins,</hi> &amp;c. The whole is at least a sorry Mistake, and which, for ought I see, he understands no more than we do his <hi>Iephilleth.</hi> The case is plainly thus; That the Rabbins say, that <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>millus</hi> was to be a person of prodigious form, begot of a Marble Statue in <hi>Rome,</hi> and was to be the last Enemy of the <hi>Iews,</hi> and the Leader of the Christian Forces against them; that he should kill Messias <hi>Ben Ephraim,</hi> and at last be killed by Messias <hi>Ben David.</hi> That he should give <hi>Iephilleth,</hi> and a Law to the Christians, which he and they set up in opposition to the Law of <hi>Moses.</hi> So that we see that his <hi>Tephillell</hi> is the Law as well as the Prayers of Christians; and they make <hi>Armillus</hi> to be toward the end of the World, the last Enemy of the <hi>Iews</hi>; and how could our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy, or the Liturgies now used by Christians, be the Prayers received from <hi>Armillus,</hi> when <hi>Armillus</hi> is yet to come, according to the Rabinical Notion?

               <p>But to return: Before I shall consider his few Instances, that he would make good this Bloody Charge by, I shall premise a few things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Instances he offers are, at the worst, Mistranslations, Slips, and Errors, and not chargeable with perverseness, according to what we charge upon the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> For here is no interest to be served: For what is our Church concern'd, whether it be read as the Liturgical Translation has it, <hi>the</hi> 7<hi>th. Day</hi>; or as the Common Translation, <hi>The Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath</hi>; whether as that, <hi>they were not obedient to his word</hi>; or as this, <hi>they rebelled not against his word</hi>; whether as that, <hi>The rod of the wicked cometh not into the lot of the righteous</hi>; or as this, <hi>resteth not</hi>: Whether as in that, the Titles of some Psalms and Hallelujahs are omitted; or as in this, they are inserted. Surely here is no interest visible in this, that should incline our Translators of the Psalter to pick out these Texts above all others to make bold with.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Mistranslations and Errors of this kind, are no sufficient reason for not using such a Translation, and much less for separating from a Church where they are used; for then no Translation could be us'd, or no Church communicated with, because no Church is without such Translations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and no Translation without such Errors. Thus it was in the Church of the
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:001592_0020_0FB3D973158C1148"/>
                  <hi>Iews,</hi> when the Septuagint was used in publick; Which doth often alter and add to the original <hi>Hebrew</hi>; and yet was not only used, but is quoted by the Divine Writers, even in many places where those Alterations and Additions are. So it alters, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10 5.11.21. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10 18. <hi>Act.</hi> 7.8. It adds, as <hi>Luk</hi> 3.36, 37. <hi>Acts</hi> 7 14.</p>
               <p>Then also must not our common Translation be used, which besides the mistakes allowed to be in it, does add in many places, and particularly half a Verse, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.23. So it adds the Dates and Subscriptions to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles, Chapters, Verses, and Arguments, throughout the whole, <hi>as if Canonical.</hi> And of this kind are all his Instances.</p>
               <p>As (1.) He saith, <hi>The Common-Prayer Book violates the word of God, as sometimes the words of Scripture are obliterated, and others put in their room. Thus in the Catechism they have changed those words in the Fourth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, The Lord blessed the Sabbath day, into the Seventh day.</hi>

                  <hi>A.</hi> We grant it is so; but it's to be remembred, that it's not so in the 20<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>h of <hi>Exodus,</hi> but in the Liturgy; and if the Liturgy differs from <hi>Exodus,</hi> it's a difference without a distinction, since the Seventh day and Sabbath are all one; and if it differs from <hi>Exodus,</hi> it agrees with the first institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Gen</hi> 2 3. where it's said, <hi>God rested on the seventh day, and God blessed the seventh day, and Sanctified it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">(2.) He saith, <hi>Sometimes the Liturgy makes bold directly and in terms to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict the Scripture; so</hi> Psalm 105.28. <hi>it's said they were not rebellious, but the Common-Prayer-Book saith, they were not obedient; and so</hi> Psal. 125, 3.</p>
               <p>We grant that there is a seeming contradiction in words, but not in the meaning of it; for the relative <hi>they</hi> being undetermined, and indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be applyed to <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> or to the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> accordingly is this place to be interpreted; if understood of the former, it's to be read in the Common Translation, <hi>they were not rebellious</hi>; if of the latter, it's to be read in the Translation of the Liturgy, <hi>they were not obedient.</hi> And this last reading is according to the present reading of the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ptuagint, and some other Translations that follow that. And yet that Translation was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally used by the Primitive Christians, and was worse than any ever used by us. As for Psal. 125 3. <hi>The rod of the wicked shall not come,</hi> &amp;c. that is, so as to rest there, and so as to tempt them beyond what they are able.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) He saith, <hi>Sometimes the Common Prayer Book adds to the Scripture; there are three whole Verses added to the</hi> 14<hi>th Psalm. And the</hi> Gloria Patri <hi>is frequently added to Scriptures, as if it were Canonical.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> When he saith, That <hi>it is a dreadful thing to add to the word of God,</hi> and charges our Church with it, we might expect some very crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal instances to make it good, and when he saith three whole Verses are

               <p>Here for improving this Augument, he alters the words of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face; and for that which is in that, <hi>agreeable to the same,</hi> he reads <hi>evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently grounded on the same,</hi> and then triumphs, <hi>Is the Apocrypha so</hi>? But take it how he will, it's evident from hence, that the Apocrypha is so far from being made equal with Scripture, that there is a plain difference between them; for that to which a thing is agreeable, and on which it's grounded, is above that which is agreeable to it, and grounded upon it. A Plea grounded on the Law, is surely of less Authority than the Law on which it is grounded. The Apocrypha being read, not for establishing any Doctrine, but for informing the Manners; there is nothing in what is appointed of that kind to be read, but what is agreeable to the word of God, and not contrary to it; and so may be read, as well as their Sermons be heard, which can pretend to no more.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) He saith, <hi>The Liturgy appoints the Apocrapha to be read as Lessons, just as I find it in the Pope's Service-Book, and in a great<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </p>
               <p>But surely he doth not <hi>find</hi> in our Service-Book, that the Apocry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha Lessons are read for Canonical Scripture, and declared to be so, as they are in the <hi>Pope's Service Book</hi>; but only as Apocrypha.

               <p>If, as he affirms, the Apocrypha is read in a <hi>greater proportion</hi> than Scripture, it doth more than equalize, and doth rather advance it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove

                  <q>That all Vestments ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to the Worship of God, and appointed for the Significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Spiritual Duties, by the will of Man, are unlawful. But the Surplice is so.</q>
And is, he saith, <hi>Not easy to be answer'd:</hi> but if it be to be answered, no matter whether it's not easy. From hence arise two Questions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q</hi> 1. Whether it's unlawful to use any thing appropriated to the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God by the Will of Man?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q</hi> 2. Whether it's unlawful to use any thing in the Worship of God that is appointed for the signification of Spiritual Duties by the Will of man?</p>
               <p>By the first it's unlawful for men to appropriate places, or times, or postures to the Worship of God. And so it's necessary to avoid this Superstition, to make all the Meeting-places to be Houses of Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize, and to be equally divided between Religious and Common Uses. By the 2<hi>d.</hi> any thing that has such a Signification applied to it, is made unlawful, by vertue of such Signification, and which without such Signification would have been lawful. So a Surplice would have been a lawful Garment, if not appropriated, and without Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; and might have been in its self worn as well as a Cloak, since Custom and Use only makes the difference; but appropriate it, and clap a signification upon it, it's unlawful: And so a Cloak may be turn'd out of Service by the same way. So it's in posture, kneeling and standing are indefferent; but once appropriate kneeling to Prayer, and make it significative, and to be a posture of reverence, and it becomes unlawful. And so without end. So much for Mr. <hi>Nichol</hi>'s Argument, and its difficulty.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Come we now to the Cross, <hi>the greatest Devil amongst all the Idols of</hi> Rome; as he tells us Mr. <hi>Parker sheweth.</hi>

               <p n="2">2 He saith, Mr. <hi>Parker proveth it a sin against all the Commandments, and a breach of the Letter of the second: for men to appoint a Religious Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony, is a direct violation of the</hi> 2<hi>d Commandment, which forbids all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Inventions in Divine Worship, as any part thereof.</hi>

                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. There is a way of proving too much, and that any one that reads Mr. <hi>Parker</hi> will soon perceive he doth: And of this I take this Instance of the 2d Commandment to be one of the letter, of which the Author saith, the Cross is a breach. Now the Letter of the Command respects two things; 1. Nor to make any Graven Image for Religious Worship. 2. Not to bow down to any such Object. Now the Cross used in Baptism is an <hi>Aerial Cross,</hi> as he calls it; and where is the Object or the Worship? But our Author goes on to prove it after this manner; <hi>for men to appoint,</hi> &amp;c. Here we grant the Proposition to be true, because God only is to appoint his own Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship; and so it's not in the power of man to appoint any part of it: But now if Religious Ceremonies may be, and yet not be part of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worship, then they are no such human Inventions as are forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; and no direct or indirect violation of the 2d Commandment.

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> This I deny; for the Scripture speaks honourably of the Cross of Christ, which this refers to, but not at all of the rest. Again, the Cross was traduced and reproached by the <hi>Heathens,</hi> which gave occasion to the use of it, and so were not the rest. So that this was used with reason; those without it.</p>

                  <hi>Tho in substance the Service of these Churches do agree, yet we must not think there was one and the same Prescript Form observed, and kept in them all.</hi>

               <p n="2">2 There have been several of his Learned and Good men, as he saith <hi>chose rather to suffer, than sin, by complying with the Liturgy,</hi> that have shew'd those Corruptions not to be sufficient reason for Separation: So Mr. <hi>Bradshaw,</hi> Mr. <hi>Nicels,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They were so far from refusing Communion for them, that the Old <hi>Nonconformists ordinarily and constantly used the Common-Prayer-Book in their publick Ministrations</hi>; as Mr. <hi>Ball</hi> one of them, declares, <hi>Tryal,</hi> p 121, 155.</p>
               <p n="4">4. All of them testified against the <hi>Brownists,</hi> and a separation from the Church. <hi>It was</hi> (saith Mr. <hi>Baxter) the Parish-Churches that had the Liturgy, which Mr.</hi> Jacob <hi>the Father of the Congregational Party wrote for communion with. The same I may say of Mr.</hi> Bradshaw, Dr. Ames, <hi>and other Nonconformists, whom the Congregational Brethren think more favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the close, our Author offers some farther objections from <hi>the false and corrupt Doctrine</hi> he pretends to find in the Liturgy.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) As, that <hi>it's certain by God's word, that Children baptized dying before they commit actual sin, are undoubtedly saved. This,</hi> saith he, <hi>savours of</hi> Pelagianism.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="unknown:001592_0035_0FB3D989954B1878"/>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> I don't understand the falseness, or Pelagianism of it. It's certain by God's Word, that <hi>of such is the Kingdom of God,</hi> and so they must be capable of it. If capable of it, it must be upon Gospel terms; but what terms they are capable of but Baptism, I understand not.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) That <hi>there are two Sacraments necessary to Salvation; which implies a double Error,</hi> viz. <hi>that the Sacraments are necessary to Salvation, and that there are more Sacraments of the New-Testament than two.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> I don't see wherein is the first Error, if he had truly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented it; for it's said in the Catechism, two Sacraments <hi>generally</hi> n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary; that is, that they are a Duty belonging to all persons tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> are capable of it; where there are persons to baptize, and a Congre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gation to communicate with; and therefore is not said absolutely, but <hi>generally</hi> necessary.</p>
               <p>As for the latter, a Sacrament is not a Scripture-word, but a Term of Art, and so hath been variously used and applied; and therefore to set out what it means, the Church has defined what a Sacrament is, and then shew'd there are but two: And so this Phrase is used to distinguish it from any other so called; and that then none but these two are generally ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to all Christians.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) <hi>The Book saith, Some Sins are deadly, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>To this he Answers.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>We do not find in Scripture the Lords Servants were wont to swear after this manner; we read of lifting up the hand,</hi> &amp;c <hi>which is a natural sign of Worship.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. We find in Scripture, that they were wont to put the hand under the Thigh in swearing: And thus the same <hi>Abraham</hi> that lift up his hand, required his Servant to swear, by putting his hand under his Thigh, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24 2. and so <hi>Iacob</hi> made his Son <hi>Ioseph</hi> to use the same Ceremony when he swore, <hi>Gen.</hi> 47.19. Now what natural Sign of Worship was in this Rite?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Since we find different Rites us'd, it's a sign that practice of the Lords Servants is to be no Rule to us in this matter; but that we are to govern our selves by the Custom of the place where, and the People among whom we live, if there be nothing in it self unlawful.</p>
               <p n="3">3 He saith, and seems to allow i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, That the <hi>Romans</hi> of old, and <hi>Italians</hi> and <hi>Spaniards,</hi> use to lift up the Finger when they swear solemnly. Now I conceive lifting up the Finger is no natural Sign of Worship. And if it had any signification, I know no reason why the <hi>Germans</hi> may not lift up three fingers; to intimate, they invoke the Sacred Trinity, which he saith, he <hi>cannot justifie.</hi> Nor why we may not lay the Hand upon, and Kiss th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">2. He answers, <hi>Laying the Hand on the Book is a symbolizing with Popish Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>later<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And therefore, if this be a reason, why we must not lift up the Fingers, because they do so; so we must not lift up the Hand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that is not to be done, but we must lift up the Fingers too.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If it was customary among the <hi>Iews</hi> to produce the Law in giving an Oath, I see no reason to condemn it; and so know no hurt to observe it. They used also to adjure Persons, and our Saviour readily answers to it, when thus call'd upon.</p>
