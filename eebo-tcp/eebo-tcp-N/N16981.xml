            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<q>"O! ſave my Country, Heav'n!"—ſhall be thy laſt.</q>
A youth, beholding the repreſentation of this gallant patriot, ſeems to be ſtruck with admiration, and charmed with delight. A miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diverts his attention to an object of infinitely higher dignity, and greater wonder. If the hero died—PRO PATRIA, <hi>In defence of his country,</hi> CHRIST died—PRO INIMICIS, <hi>For the ſalvation of his enemies.</hi> An inſtance this, of ſuch diſintereſted, diffuſive, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine benevolence; as makes all that heroes have achieved, and patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots ſuffered, dwindle into nothing, and ſcarce deſerve our notice.</p>

She, alas! lives no longer on earth; unleſs it be in the honours of a diſtinguiſhed character, and in the bleeding remembrance of her acquaintance.</p>
                  <p>It is impoſſible, Madam, to wiſh you a richer bleſſing, or a more ſubſtantial happineſs, than that the ſame ſpirit of unfeigned <hi>faith,</hi> the ſame courſe of undefiled <hi>religion,</hi> which have enabled her to triumph over death, may both animate and adorn your life.

                  </p>
                  <p>Long, Madam, may you <hi>bloom</hi> in all the vivacity and amiableneſs of youth, like the charming ſubject of one of theſe contemplations. But at the ſame time remember,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:021885_0017_0FB5EFD583FEC420"/>
that, with regard to ſuch inferiour accompliſhments, you muſt one day <hi>fade,</hi> (may it prove ſome very remote pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod!) like the mournful objects of the other. This conſideration will prompt you to go on, as you have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, in adding the <hi>meekneſs</hi> of <hi>wiſdom,</hi> and all the <hi>beauties</hi> of <hi>holineſs,</hi> to the graces of an engaging perſon, and the refinements of a polite education.</p>
                  <p>And might—O! might the enſuing hints furniſh you with the leaſt aſſiſtance, in proſecuting ſo deſirable an end; might they contribute, in any degree, to eſtabliſh your faith, or elevate your devotion; they would then adminiſter to the author ſuch a ſatisfaction, as applauſe cannot give, nor cenſure take away: A ſatisfaction which I ſhould be able to enjoy, even in thoſe awful moments, when all that captivates the eye is ſinking in darkneſs, and every glory of this lower world diſappear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forever.</p>
                  <p>Theſe wiſhes, Madam, as they are a moſt agreeable employ of my thoughts, ſo they come attended with this additional circumſtance of pleaſure, that they are alſo the ſincereſt expreſſion of that very great eſteem, with which I am.</p>

                  <head>PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>THE firſt of theſe occaſional meditations, begs leave to remind my readers of their <hi>latter end;</hi> and would invite them to ſet, not their houſes only, but, which is inexpreſſibly more needful, their ſouls, in order: That they may be able, through all the intermediate ſtages, to look forward upon their approaching exit, without any <hi>anxious apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions;</hi> and, when the great change commences, may bid adieu to terreſtrial things, with all the <hi>calmneſs</hi> of a cheerful reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with all the <hi>comforts</hi> of a well grounded faith.</p>
                  <p>The other attempts to ſketch out ſome little traces of the <hi>all ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency</hi> of our <hi>Redeemer,</hi> for the grand and gracious purpoſes of everlaſting ſalvation: That a ſenſe of his unutterable dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and infinite perfections, may incite us to regard him, with ſentiments of the moſt profound <hi>veneration;</hi> to long for an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured intereſt in his merits, with all the ardency of <hi>deſire;</hi> and to truſt in his powerful mediation, with an <hi>affiance</hi> not to be ſhaken by any temptations, not to be ſhared with any perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of our own.</p>
                  <p>I flatter myſelf, that the thoughts conceived among the <hi>tombs</hi> may be welcome to the <hi>ſerious</hi> and <hi>humane</hi> mind. Becauſe, as there are few who have not conſigned the remains of ſome dear <hi>relations,</hi> or honoured <hi>friends,</hi> to thoſe ſilent repoſitories; ſo there are none but muſt be ſenſible, that this is the <hi>houſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for all living;</hi> and that they themſelves are ſhortly to remove into the ſame ſolemn manſions.—And who would not
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:021885_0019_0FB5EFDE4B7939B0"/>
turn aſide, for a while, from the moſt favourite amuſements, to view the <hi>place</hi> where his once loved <hi>companions</hi> lie? Who would not ſometimes ſurvey thoſe <hi>apartments</hi> where he <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</hi> is to take up an <hi>abode,</hi> till time ſhall be no more?</p>
                  <p>As to the other little eſſay, may I not humbly preſume, that the very ſubject itſelf will recommend the remarks? For, who is not delighted with the proſpect of the blooming creation, and even charmed with the <hi>delicate attractions</hi> of flowers? Who does not covet to aſſemble them in the garden, or wear them in a noſegay? Since this is a paſſion ſo univerſal, who would not be willing to render it productive of the ſublimeſt improvement? —This piece of <hi>holy frugality,</hi> I have ventured to ſuggeſt, and endeavoured to exemplify, in the ſecond letter; that, while the hand is cropping the tranſient beauties of a flower, the attentive mind may be enriching itſelf with ſolid and laſting good.—And I cannot but entertain ſome pleaſing hopes, that the niceſt taſte may receive and reliſh <hi>religious impreſſions,</hi> when they are conveyed by ſuch <hi>lovely monitors;</hi> when the inſtructive leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are found, not on the leaves of ſome formidable <hi>folio,</hi> but ſtand legible on the fine <hi>ſarcenet</hi> of a <hi>Narciſſus;</hi> when they ſavour, not of the <hi>lamp</hi> and <hi>recluſe,</hi> but come breathing from the fragrant boſom of a <hi>Jonquil.</hi>

                     <salute>MADAM,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>RAVELLING lately into <hi>Cornwall,</hi> I happened to alight at a conſiderable Village, in that county: Where, finding myſelf under an unexpected neceſſity of ſtaying a little, I took a walk to the <hi>Church.</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">I had named, in ſome former editions, a particular church, <hi>viz.</hi> KILKHAMPTON; where ſeveral of the monuments, deſcribed in the following pages, really exiſt. But as I thought it convenient, to mention ſome caſes <hi>here,</hi> which are not, according to the beſt of my remembrance, referred to in any inſcriptions <hi>there</hi>; I have now omitted the name. That imagination might operate more freely, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of the reader be conſulted, without any thing that ſhould look like a variation from truth and fact.</note> The doors, like the heaven to which they lead, were wide open; and readily ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted an unworthy ſtranger. Pleaſed with the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, I reſolved to ſpend a few minutes under the ſacred roof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="2" facs="unknown:021885_0025_0FB5EFE80E198328"/>In a ſituation ſo retired and awful, I could not avoid falling into a train of meditations, <hi>ſerious</hi> and <hi>mournfully pleaſing.</hi> Which, I truſt, were in ſome degree profitable to <hi>me,</hi> while they poſſeſſed and warmed my thoughts; and, if they may adminiſter any ſatisfaction to <hi>you,</hi> Madam, now they are recollected, and committed to writing, I ſhall receive a freſh pleaſure from them.</p>
                  <p>It was an ancient pile; reared by hands, that, ages ago, were mouldered into duſt.—Situate in the centre of a large <hi>burial ground;</hi> remote from all the noiſe and hurry of tumultuous life.—The body ſpacious; the ſtructure lofty; the whole magnificently plain. A row of regular pillars extended themſelves through the midſt; ſupporting the roof with ſimplicity, and with dignity.— The light, that paſſed through the windows, ſeemed to ſhed a kind of <hi>luminous Obſcurity;</hi> which gave every ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject a grave and venerable air.—The deep <hi>Silence,</hi> added to the gloomy aſpect, and both heightened by the lone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of the place, greatly increaſed the ſolemnity of the ſcene.—A ſort of <hi>religious Dread</hi> ſtole inſenſibly on my mind, while I advanced, all penſive and thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, along the inmoſt aiſle. Such a dread, as huſhed every ruder paſſion, and diſſipated all the gay images of an alluring world.</p>
                  <p>Having adored that Eternal Majeſty, who, far from being confined to temples made with hands, has Heaven for his throne, and the Earth for his foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtool—I took particular notice of a handſome <hi>Altar piece</hi>; preſented, as I was afterwards informed, by the maſter builders of <hi>Stow</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">The Name of a grand ſeat, belonging to the late Earl of <hi>Bath</hi>; remarkable formerly for its excellent workmanſhip, and elegant fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture; once the principal reſort of the quality and gentry of the Weſt; but now demoliſhed, laid even with the ground, and ſcarce one ſtone left upon another.—So that corn may grow, or nettles ſpring, where <hi>Stow</hi> lately ſtood.</note>; out of gratitude, I preſume, to that gracious GOD, who carried them through their work, and enabled them to
<q>bring forth their topſtone with joy.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>O! HOW amiable is <hi>Gratitude!</hi> eſpecially when it has the ſupreme Benefactor for its object. I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:021885_0026_0FB5EFEE52816188"/>
looked upon gratitude as the moſt exalted princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that can actuate the heart of man. It has ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing noble, diſintereſted, and (if I may be allowed the Term) generouſly devout. <hi>Repentance</hi> indicates our nature fallen, and <hi>Prayer</hi> turns chiefly upon a regard to one's ſelf. But the exerciſes of gratitude ſubſiſted in paradiſe, when there was no fault to deplore; and will be perpetuated in Heaven, when
<q>GOD ſhall be all in all.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The language of this ſweet temper is,
<q>I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakably obliged: What return ſhall I make?</q>
— And, ſurely, it is no improper expreſſion of an unfeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thankfulneſs, to decorate our Creator's courts, and <hi>beautify</hi> "the <hi>place</hi> where his honour dwelleth." Of old, the habitation of his feet was glorious: Let it not, now, be ſordid or contemptible. It muſt grieve an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous mind, and be a reproach to any people, to have their own houſes wainſcotted with cedar, and painted with vermillion; while the temple of the Lord of hoſts is deſtitute of every decent ornament.</p>
                  <p>Here I recollected, and was charmed with <hi>Solomon</hi>'s fine addreſs to the almighty, at the <hi>dedication</hi> of his famous temple. With immenſe charge, and exquiſite ſkill, he had erected the moſt rich and finiſhed ſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that the ſun ever ſaw. Yet, upon a review of his work, and a reflection on the tranſcendent perfections of the Godhead, how he exalts the one and abaſes the other!—The building was too <hi>glorious,</hi> for the mightieſt monarch to inhabit; too <hi>ſacred</hi> for unhallowed feet even to enter; yet infinitely too <hi>mean,</hi> for the Deity to reſide in. It was, and the royal worſhipper acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged it to be, a moſt marvellous vouchſafement in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created excellency, to "put his name there."—The whole paſſage breathes ſuch a delicacy, and is animated with ſuch a ſublimity of ſentiment, that I cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade myſelf to paſs on, without repeating it. <note n="*" place="bottom">1 <hi>Kings,</hi> viii.27. <hi>But will</hi>—A fine abrupt beginning, moſt ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificantly deſcribing the amazement and rapture of the royal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet's mind!—<hi>GOD:</hi> He uſes no epithet, where writers of infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour diſcernment would have been found to multiply them: But ſpeaks of the Deity, as an incomprehenſible Being, whoſe perfections and glories are exalted above all praiſe.—<hi>Dwell:</hi> To beſtow on ſinful creatures a propitious look; to favour them with a tranſient viſit of kindneſs; even this were an unutterable obligation. Will he then vouchſafe to fix his abode among them, and take up his ſtated reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with them?—<hi>Indeed:</hi> A word, in this connexion, peculiarly emphatical; expreſſive of a condeſcenſion, wonderful and extraordinary almoſt beyond all credibility. <hi>Behold:</hi> intimating the continued, or rather the increaſing ſurpriſe of the ſpeaker, and awakening the attention of the hearer. <hi>Behold! the Heaven:</hi> The ſpacious concave of the firmament; that wide extended azure circumference, in which worlds unnumbered perform their revolutions, is too ſcanty an apartment for the Godhead.—Nay, <hi>The Heaven of Heavens:</hi> Thoſe vaſtly higher tracts, which be far beyond the limits of human ſurvey; to which our very thoughts can hardly ſoar: even theſe (unbounded as they are) cannot afford an adequate habitation for JEHOVAH; even theſe dwindle into a point, when compared with the infinitude of his eſſence; even theſe
<q>are as nothing before him.</q>
—<hi>How much leſs</hi> proportionate is this poor diminutive ſpeek (which I have been erecting and embelliſhing), to ſo auguſt a Preſence, ſo immenſe a Majeſty!</note>
                     <hi>But will
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:021885_0027_0FB5EFEF903DB700"/>
GOD indeed dwell on earth? Behold! The Heaven, and Heaven of Heavens, cannot contain thee; how much leſs this houſe that I have builded!</hi>—Incomparable ſaying! worthy the wiſeſt of men. Who would not chooſe to poſſeſs ſuch an elevated devotion, rather than to own all the glittering materials of that ſumptuous edifice?</p>
                  <p>We are apt to be ſtruck with admiration at the ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and grandeur of a maſterly performance in archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture. And, perhaps on a ſight of the ancient Sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary, ſhould have made the <hi>ſuperficial</hi> obſervation of the diſciples;
<q>What manner of ſtones, and what build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are here!</q>
—But what a <hi>nobler</hi> turn of thought, and <hi>juſter</hi> taſte of things, does it diſcover; to join with <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s king, in celebrating the condeſcenſion of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Inhabitant! That the High and Lofty One, who fills immenſity with his glory, ſhould, in a peculiar manner, fix his abode there!

paſſing bells, inculcate loudly our LORD's admonition;
<q>Take ye heed, watch and pray; for ye know not, when the time is.</q>
—We nod, like intoxicated crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, upon the very verge of a moſt tremendous preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pice. Theſe aſtoniſhing diſpenſations, are the kind meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers of Heaven; to <hi>rouſe</hi> us from our <hi>ſupineneſs,</hi> and quicken us into timely circumſpection. I need not, ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, accommodate them with language, nor act as their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter. Let every one's conſcience be awake, and this will appear their awful meaning—
<q>O! ye ſons of men, in the midſt of life you are in death. No ſtate, no cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, can aſcertain your preſervation a ſingle moment. So <hi>ſtrong</hi> is the tyrant's arm, that nothing can reſiſt its force; ſo <hi>true</hi> his aim, that nothing can elude the blow. <hi>Sudden</hi> as lightning, ſometimes, is his arrow launched; and wounds, and kills, in the twinkling of an eye. Never promiſe yourſelves ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in any expedient, but conſtant preparation. The fatal ſhafts fly ſo promiſcuouſly, that none can gueſs the next victim. Therefore, <hi>be ye always ready: For in ſuch an hour as ye think not,</hi> the final ſummons cometh.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Be ye always ready: For in ſuch an hour as ye think not</hi>— Important admonition! methinks, it reverberates from ſepulchre to ſepulchre; and addreſſes me with line up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on line, precept upon precept.—The reiterated warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I acknowledge, is too needful; may cooperating grace, render it effectual! The momentous truth, though worthy to be <hi>engraved,</hi> on the tables of a moſt tenacious memory; is but ſhightly <hi>ſketched,</hi> on the tranſient flow of paſſion. We ſee our neighbours fall; we turn pale at the ſhock: and feel, perhaps, a trembling dread. No ſooner are they removed from our ſight; but, driven in the whirl of buſineſs, or lulled in the languors of pleaſure, we forget the providence, and neglect its errand. The impreſſion made on our unſtable minds, is like the trace of an arrow, through the penetrated air; or the path of a keel, in the furrowed wave.— Strange ſtupidity! To cure it, another monitor beſpeaks me, from a neighbouring ſtone. It contains the narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of an unhappy mortal, ſnatched from his friends,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:021885_0039_0FB5F018D4797868"/>
and hurried to the awful bar; without leiſure, either to take a <hi>laſt farewel</hi> of the one, or to put up ſo much as a <hi>ſingle prayer</hi> preparatory for the other: killed, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the uſual expreſſion, by a ſudden ſtroke of caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ualty.</p>
                  <p>Was it then a random ſtroke? Doubtleſs, the blow came from an <hi>aiming</hi> though inviſible hand. GOD preſideth over the armies of heaven; GOD ruleth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the inhabitants of the earth; and GOD conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth what men call <hi>chance.</hi> Nothing, nothing comes to paſs through a blind and undiſcerning fatality. If acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents happen; they happen according to the exact fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, and conformably to the determinate counſels, of eternal wiſdom. The LORD, with whom are the iſſues of death, ſigns the <hi>warrant,</hi> and gives the high commiſſion. The ſeemingly fortuitous diſaſter is only the <hi>agent,</hi> or the <hi>inſtrument,</hi> appointed to execute the ſupreme decree. When the king of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was mortally wounded, it ſeemed to be a caſual ſhot. <hi>A certain man drew a bow at a venture</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Kings xxii.34.</note>.—<hi>At a venture,</hi> as he thought. But his hand was ſtrengthened, by an omnipotent aid; and the ſhaft levelled, by an unerring eye. So that, what we term <hi>caſualty,</hi> is really <hi>providence;</hi> accompliſhing delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate deſigns, but concealing its own interpoſition.—How comforting this reflection! Admirably adapted, to ſooth the throbbing anguiſh of the mourners, and compoſe their ſpirits into a quiet ſubmiſſion! Excellently ſuited, to diſſipate the fears of godly ſurvivors, and create a calm intrepidity even amidſt innumerable perils!</p>
                  <p>How <hi>thin</hi> is the partition, between this world and another! How <hi>ſhort</hi> the tranſition, from time to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity! The partition, nothing more than the breath in our noſtrils; and the tranſition may be made in the twink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of an eye. Poor <hi>Chremylus,</hi> I remember, aroſe from the diverſion of a card table, and dropt into the dwellings of darkneſs. One night, <hi>Corinna</hi> was all gaiety in her ſpirits, all finery in her apparel, at a magnificent ball. The next night, ſhe lay pale and ſtiff, an extended corpſe, and ready to be mingled with the mouldering dead. Young <hi>Atticus</hi> lived to ſee his ample and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious

ſeat completed; but not to ſpend one joyous hour, under the ſtately roof. The ſaſhes were hung, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the day; but the maſter's eyes are cloſed in endleſs night. The apartments were furniſhed, to invite ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, or adminiſter repoſe; but their lord reſts in the lower parts of the earth, in the ſolitary, ſilent chambers of the tomb. The gardens were planned, and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand elegant decoratious deſigned; but alas! their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended poſſeſſor, is gone down to "the place of ſkulls;" is gone down to the valley of the ſhadow of death.</p>
                  <p>While I am recollecting, many, I queſtion not, are experiencing the ſame tragical viciſſitude. The eyes of that ſublime being—who ſits upon the circle of the earth, and views all its inhabitants with one comprehenſive glance—even now behold many tents in affliction. Such affliction as overwhelmed the <hi>Egyptians</hi> in that fatal night, when the deſtroying angel ſheathed his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows in all the pride of their ſtrength.—Some, ſinking to the floor from their <hi>eaſy chair;</hi> and deaf even amidſt the piercing ſhrieks of their diſtracted relations.—Some giving up the ghoſt, as they ſit retired, or lie reclined under the <hi>ſhady arbour,</hi> to taſte the ſweets of the flowery ſcene.—Some, as they ſail, aſſociated with a <hi>party</hi> of <hi>pleaſure,</hi> along the dancing ſtream, and through the laughing meads. Nor is the grim intruder mollified, though wine and muſick flow around. Some <hi>intercepted,</hi> as they are returning home; and ſome <hi>interrupted,</hi> as they enter upon an important negotiation.—Some ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted, with the gain of <hi>injuſtice</hi> in their hands; and ſome ſurpriſed in the very act of <hi>lewdneſs,</hi> or the attempt of <hi>cruelty.</hi>

from which we ſuſpect not the leaſt harm, may prove the weapon of our deſtruction, a grape ſtone, a deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable fly, may be more mortal than <hi>Goliath,</hi> with all his formidable armour.—Nay, if GOD give command, our very <hi>comforts</hi> become <hi>killing.</hi> The air we breathe, is our bane; and the food we eat, the vehicle of death.— That laſt enemy has unnumbered avenues for his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach. Yea; lies intrenched in our very boſom, and holds his fortreſs in the ſeat of our life. The crimſon fluid, which <hi>diſtributes health,</hi> is impregnated with the ſeeds of death. Heat may inflame it, or toil oppreſs it; and make it deſtroy the parts, it was deſigned to cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh. Some unſeen impediment may obſtruct its paſſage, or ſome unknown violence may divert its courſe; in either of which caſes, it acts the part of a poiſonous draught, or a deadly ſtab.</p>

Without ſuch an <hi>habitual</hi> readineſs, we are like wretches, that ſleep on the top of a maſt, while a horrid gulph yawns, or furious waves rage, below. And where can be the peace, what the ſatisfaction, of ſuch a ſtate?—Whereas, a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared condition will inſpire a cheerfulneſs of temper, not to be diſmayed by any alarming accident; and create a firmneſs of mind, not to be overthrown by the moſt threatening dangers. When the city is fortified with walls, furniſhed with proviſion, guarded by able and reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olute troops; what have the inhabitants to fear? what may they not enjoy?

The branch ſhoots; but the ſtem withers. The babe ſprings to light; but ſhe that bare him, breathes her laſt. She gives life, but gives it (O pitiable conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion!) at the expenſe of her own; and becomes, at once, a <hi>mother,</hi> and a <hi>corpſe.</hi>—Or elſe, perhaps, ſhe expires in ſevere pangs, and is herſelf a tomb for her infant; while the melancholy complaint of a monarch's woe, is the epitaph for them both; <hi>the children are come to the birth, and there is not ſtrength to bring forth.</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">Iſa. xxxvii.3.</note>—Leſs to be lamented, in my opinion, <hi>this</hi> misfortune than the <hi>other.</hi> Better, for the tender ſtranger, to be ſtopped in the porch; than to enter, only to converſe with afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

With a ſickly appetite, we often lothe what is whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and hanker after our bane. Where <hi>imagination</hi> dreams of unmingled ſweets; there, <hi>experience</hi> fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently finds the bitterneſs of woe.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, may we covet immoderately, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this nor that form of earthly felicity; but refer the whole of our condition, to the choice of unerring wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. May we learn to renounce our own will; and be ready to make a ſacrifice of our warmeſt wiſhes, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they run counter to the good pleaſure of GOD. For, indeed, as to obey his laws, is to be perfectly free; ſo, to <hi>reſign</hi> ourſelves to his diſpoſal, is to <hi>eſtabliſh</hi> our own happineſs, and to be ſecure from fear of evil.</p>
                  <p>Here, a ſmall and plain ſtone is placed upon the ground. Purchaſed, one would imagine, from the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle fund, and formed by the hand, of frugality itſelf. Nothing coſtly: Not one decoration added: Only a very ſhort inſcription; and that ſo effaced, as to be ſcarcely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible.—Was the depoſitory unfaithful to its truſt? Or were the letters worn by the frequent reſort of the ſurviving family; to mourn over the grave of a moſt valuable and beloved relative?—For I perceive, upon a cloſer inſpection, that it covers the remains of a father. A <hi>religious father</hi>; ſnatched from his growing offspring, before they were ſettled in the world, or ſo much as their principles fixed by a thorough education.</p>
                  <p>This, ſure, is the moſt complicated diſtreſs, that has hitherto come under our conſideration, The <hi>ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities</hi> of ſuch a <hi>dying chamber,</hi> are ſome of the moſt melting and melancholy ſcenes imaginable.—There lies the affectionate huſband; the indulgent parent; the faithful friend; and the generous maſter. He lies in the laſt extremities, and on the very point of diſſolution. Art has done its all. The raging diſcaſe mocks the power of medicine. It haſtens, with reſiſtleſs impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity, to execute its dreadful errand; to rend aſunder the ſilver cord of life, and the more delicate tie of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial attachment, and conjugal affection.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>Sufferer,</hi> all patient and adoring, ſubmits to the divine will; and, by ſubmiſſion, becomes ſuperiour to his affliction.

                  <p>He could proceed no farther. His heart was full; but utterance failed. After a ſhort pauſe, with difficulty, great difficulty, he added;—

                     <hi>No longer would the fig tree bloſſom, nor fruit be in the vine: The labour of the olive would fail, and the fields could yield no meat: The flocks muſt be cut off from the fold, and there would be no herd in the ſtall.</hi>—The ſun darts its beams among all the vegetable tribes; and paints the ſpring, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riches the autumn. This pierces to the roots of the vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard and the orchard; and ſets afloat thoſe fermenting juices, which at length burſt into floods of wine, or bend the boughs with a mellow load.—Nor are its fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours confined to the <hi>upper regions</hi>; but diſtributed unto the <hi>deepeſt receſſes</hi> of creation. It penetrates the beds of metal, and finds its way to the place of the ſapphires. It tinctures the ſeeds of gold, that are ripening into ore; and throws a brilliancy into the water of the diamond, that is hardening on its rock.—In ſhort; the beneficial agency of this magnificent luminary, is inexpreſſible.

                        <p>By this interpretation, the text, I think, is cleared of its obſcurity and appears both truely ſublime, and perfectly juſt.</p>
                        <p>May I be pardoned the <hi>digreſſion,</hi> and acquitted from <hi>preſumption,</hi> if, on this occaſion, I take leave to animadvert upon what ſeems harſh and unnatural in the common expoſition of the laſt verſe of this Pſalm? All the commentators (as many, at leaſt, as I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted) inform their readers, that to <hi>drink of the brook in the way,</hi> ſignifies <hi>to undergo ſufferings and death.</hi> Which, in my opinion, is a conſtruction extremely forced, and hardly ſupportable; altogether remote from the import of ſuch poetical forms of diction, cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomary among the eaſtern nations. In thoſe ſultry climes, nothing could be more welcome to the traveller, than a brook ſtreaming near his paths. To quench his thirſt, and lave his feet, in the cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing current, was one of the greateſt refreſhments imaginable, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animated him to purſue his journey. For which reaſon, among others, brooks are a very favourite image with the inſpired penmen; uſed to denote a ſituation <hi>fertile</hi> and <hi>delightful,</hi> or a ſtate of <hi>pleaſure</hi> and <hi>ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction</hi>; but never, that I can recollect, to picture out the contrary condition of tribulation and diſtreſs.</p>

His deſign ſhall not miſcarry, nor his labour prove abortive; though you render it of none effect, with regard to yourſelves.

They ſteal down by ſlow degrees, and with inſenſible ſtillneſs. So ſubtle, that they deceive the niceſt eye; ſo ſilent, that they eſcape the moſt deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate ear: And when fallen, ſo very light, that they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bruiſe the tendereſt, nor oppreſs the weakeſt flower. —Very <hi>different</hi> operations!

The Almighty addreſſed their ſtubborn hearts, as he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> at <hi>Sinai,</hi> with lightning in his eyes, and thunder in his voice. The conſcience, ſmitten with a ſenſe of guilt, and apprehenſive of eternal vengeance, trembled through all her powers; juſt as that ſtrong mountain tottered to its centre. Pangs of remorſe, and
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:021885_0099_0FB5F19BF265EAA0"/>
agonies of fear, preceded their new birth. They were reduced to the laſt extremities, almoſt overwhelmed with deſpair, before they found reſt in JESUS CHRIST.— Others have been recovered from a vain converſation, by methods more <hi>mild</hi> and attractive. The Father of ſpirits applied himſelf to their teachable minds, in
<q>a ſtill and ſmall voice.</q>
His grace came down, as the rain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a fleece of wool; or as theſe ſoftening drops, which now water the earth. The kingdom of GOD took place in their ſouls, without noiſe or obſervation. They paſſed from death unto life, from a carnal to a regenerate ſtate, by almoſt imperceptible advances. The tranſition re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled the growth of corn; was very viſible, when effected; though ſcarce ſenſible, while accompliſhing.— O thou author and finiſher of our faith, recal us from our wanderings, and reunite us to thyſelf! Whether thou <hi>alarm</hi> us with thy terrours, or <hi>allure</hi> us with thy ſmiles; whether thou drive us with the ſcourge of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, or draw us with the cords of love; let us, in any wiſe, return to thee.

                  <p>If, from my low procedure, I may form an alluſion to the moſt exalted practices; I would obſerve upon this occaſion, that the celebrated <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> and our judicious <hi>Locke,</hi> having trod the circle of the ſciences, and ranged through the whole extent of <hi>human</hi> literature, at length betook themſelves ſolely to the <hi>Bible.</hi> Leaving the ſages of antiquity, they ſat inceſſantly at the feet of JESUS.

They ſpent their moſt mature hours, in thoſe hallowed gardens, which GOD's own wiſdom planted; which GOD's own ſpirit watereth; and in which GOD's own ſon is continually

                  <p>Thus would I finiſh the remainder of my days!

                        </gap> circumſtance, not much unlike the preceding. <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> unaided and alone, had routed an innumer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able hoſt of apoſtate ſpirits. This was great and marvellous. But to create a juſter idea of the illuſtrious conqueror, our poet beautifully adds;
<q>Yet half his ſtrength he put not forth.</q>
If we forget to make the ſame remark, when we contemplate GOD in his works; we muſt neceſſarily form very ſcanty conceptions of that SUPREME BEING, before whom all nations are as a
<q>drop of a bucket, and are counted as the ſmall duſt of the balance.</q>

                     <hi>The hiding of his power.</hi> So immenſe is his power; ſo uncontrollable and inconceivable; that all theſe mighty works are but a <hi>ſketch,</hi> in which more is concealed than diſcovered.</p>
                  <p>Thus, I think, we ſhould always view the viſible ſyſtem; with an evangelical <hi>teleſcope</hi> (if I may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the expreſſion) and with an evangelical <hi>micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcope.</hi> Regarding CHRIST JESUS, as the great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jector and architect; who planned, and executed, the amazing ſcheme. Whatever is magnificent or valuable tremendous or amiable; ſhould ever be aſcribed to the redeemer. This, is the chriſtian's <hi>natural philoſophy.</hi>

With regard to this method of conſidering the things that are ſeen; we have an inſpired apoſtle for our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptor and precedent. Speaking of CHRIST, he ſays;
<q>Thou, LORD, in the beginning, haſt laid the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the earth; and the heavens are the work of thy hands.</q>
—Did we carefully attend to this leading principle, in all our examinations of nature; it would, doubtleſs, be a moſt powerful means of <hi>enkindling</hi> our love, and <note n="*" place="bottom">The apoſtles, I obſerve, delight to uſe this method of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playing the <hi>honours</hi> of the Redeemer, and eſtabliſhing the <hi>faith</hi> of his people—The beloved diſciple, teaching that moſt precious doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, "of a Lamb ſlain to take away the ſins of the world;" in order to evince the ſufficiency of CHRIST's ſacrifice for this bleſſed purpoſe, affirms, that <hi>all things were made by him: And without him was not any thing,</hi> no, not ſo much as one ſingle being, <hi>made,</hi> John i.3.—St. <hi>Paul,</hi> preaching the ſame glad tidings to the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> and expreſsly maintaining, that we have redemption through his blood; ſeems to foreſee an objection of this kind.
<q>To expiate tranſgreſſions againſt an infinite majeſty, is a moſt prodigious act. It muſt coſt vaſtly more than any common ſurety can pay, to redeem a ſinful world. What reaſon have we to believe, that JESUS, is equal to this mighty undertaking?</q>
All poſſible reaſon, replies the apoſtle, from the dignity of his perſon, for he is <hi>the image of the inviſible</hi> GOD; and from the greatneſs of his works, for <hi>by him all things were made.</hi> Conſider the operations of his hands, and you cannot doubt the atoning efficacy of his death, <hi>Col.</hi> i.15, 16.—The author of the epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> falls exactly into the ſame train of arguing. Declaring, that CHRIST JESUS has purged our ſins, by the ſacrifice of himſelf; he proves his ample ability for this tremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous office, from his eſſential excellence becauſe he is the <hi>brightneſs of his father's glory</hi>; and from his admirable works, becauſe <hi>he made the worlds, and upholdeth all things by the word of his power,</hi> Heb. i.2, 3.—Which truth, as it is ſo important in itſelf; of ſuch ſignal comfort to chriſtians; and ſo particularly inſiſted on, by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired writers; I hope, I ſhall need no apology, for an attempt to illuſtrate and enforce it, in a kind of evangelical <hi>Deſcant</hi> on <hi>Creation,</hi> annexed to theſe reflections.</note> 
                     <hi>ſtrengthening</hi> our faith. When I look round upon millions of noble ſubſtances, and carry with me this tranſporting reflection,
<q>The maker of them all, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired on a croſs for me;</q>
how can I remain any longer indifferent? Muſt not the <hi>coldeſt</hi> heart, begin to glow with gratitude?—When I ſurvey an immenſity of the fineſt productions imaginable; and remember, that the author of them all, is my

how can I chooſe but repoſe the moſt <hi>cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> confidence, in ſuch a Mediator?</p>
                  <p>Let me add one more remark, upon the admirable <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtment</hi> of every particular, relating to theſe fine colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies planted in the paterre.—With ſuch accuracy and correctneſs is their ſtructure finiſhed, that any the leaſt conceivable alteration, would very much impair their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. Should you ſee, for inſtance, the nice diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>tulip</hi>'s attire fly abroad, diſorderly and irreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ular, like the flaunting <hi>woodbine</hi>: Should the <hi>jeſſamine</hi> rear her diminutive head on thoſe grand columns which ſupports the <hi>hollihock</hi>: Should the erect and manly aſpect of the <hi>piony,</hi> hang down with a penſive air, like the flex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ile bells of the <hi>hyacinth</hi>: Should that noble plainneſs, which diſtinguiſhes the <hi>lily,</hi> be exchanged for the glitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fringes which edge the <hi>pink,</hi> or the gaudy ſtains which bedrop the <hi>iris</hi>: Should thoſe tapering pillars, which ariſe in the middle of its vaſe, and, tipt with golden pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, give ſuch a luſtre to the ſurrounding pannels of ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſter—Should thoſe ſink and diſappear, like the chives which cover the heart of the <hi>anemone</hi>:—In many of theſe caſes, would not the tranſpoſition be fantaſtical and aukward? In all, to the apparent <hi>prejudice</hi> of every indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual?</p>
                  <p>Again; with regard to the <hi>time</hi> of their appearing; this circumſtance is ſettled, by a remarkable foreſight and precaution. What would become of the <hi>ſailor,</hi> if in very ſtormy weather, he ſhould raiſe a lofty maſt, and crowd it with all his canvas!

So that, ſtill, he is the <hi>centre</hi> of the whole; or, as our incomparable <hi>Milton,</hi> equally maſter of poetry and divinity, expreſſes himſelf, <hi>All things live for man. Par. Loſt,</hi> B. XI.161.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>Pope,</hi> in his ethick epiſtles, is pleaſed to explode this tenet, as the height of <hi>pride,</hi> and a groſs <hi>abſurdity.</hi>—For my part, I ſee no reaſon for ſuch a charge. With all ſubmiſſion to ſo ſuperiour a genius, it ſeems very remote from pride, to be duly ſenſible of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours vouchſafed; to contemplate them in all the extent of their munificence, and acknowledge them accordingly. I ſhould rather imagine, that to contract their ſize, when they are immenſely large; to ſtint their number, when they are altogether innumerable; that ſuch a procedure favours more of <hi>inſenſibility,</hi> than our hypotheſis of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption; and has more in it of <hi>ingratitude,</hi> than that of arrogance.</p>
                        <p>And how can it be deemed an abſurdity, to maintain that GOD gave us <hi>a world</hi> for our poſſeſſion, when it is our duty to believe, that he gave us his <hi>only ſon,</hi> for our propitiation? Sure, it can be neither difficult, nor extravagant to ſuppoſe, that he deſigned the habitable globe, with its whole furniture, for our preſent uſe, ſince he withheld not his holy child JESUS, but freely delivered him up, for our final ſalvation.</p>
                        <p>Upon the whole, I cannot but conclude, that the attempt of our famous poet is neither <hi>kind,</hi> with regard to his fellow creatures —nor <hi>grateful,</hi> with regard to his Creator—neither is his ſcheme, in fact, <hi>true.</hi> The attempt not <hi>kind,</hi> with regard to man; becauſe, it robs him of one of the moſt delightful and raviſhing contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions imaginable. To conſider the great author of exiſtence, as hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>me</hi> in his eye, when he formed univerſal nature; as contriving all things, with an immediate view to the exigencies of my par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſtate; and making them all in ſuch a manner, as might be moſt conducive to my particular advantage: This muſt occaſion the ſtrongeſt ſatisfactions, whenever I caſt a glance on the objects that ſurround me—Not <hi>grateful,</hi> with regard to GOD; becauſe it has the moſt direct tendency to diminiſh our ſenſe of his kindneſs, and by that means to throw a damp upon our gratitude. It teaches us to look upon ourſelves, as almoſt loſt among a croud of other beings, or regarded only with an occaſional and incidental beneficence. Which muſt certainly weaken the diſpoſition, and indeed ſlacken the ties to the moſt adoring thankfulneſs.—To which, I apprehend, we may juſtly add, Neither is the ſcheme, in fact, <hi>true.</hi> For, not to mention what might be urged from the ſure word of revelation, this one argument appears ſufficiently concluſive. The world began with man; the world muſt ceaſe with man; conſequently, the grand uſe, the principal end of the world, is, to ſubſerve the intereſt of man. It is on all ſides agreed, that the edifice was erected, when man was to be furniſhed with an habitation; and that it will be demoliſhed, when man has no farther need of its accommodations. When he enters into the houſe not made with hands, eternal in the Heavens, "the earth, and all the works that are therein, ſhall be burnt up." From which it ſeems a very obvious and fair deduction, that man is the <hi>final cauſe</hi> of this inferiour creation.</p>

                  <p>Whatever be the cauſe of this unuſual effect, it ſuggeſts an inſtructive admonition to the chriſtian. <hi>Such</hi> ſhould be our apprehenſive timorous care, with regard to ſin, and all, even the moſt diſtant approaches of vice. <hi>So</hi> ſhould we avoid the very appearance of evil, and ſtand aloof from every occaſion of falling.—If ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners entice, if forbidden pleaſures tempt, or if oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity beckon, with the gain of injuſtice in her hand, O! turn from the gilded ſnare, touch not the beauteous bane; but fly, fly with haſte, fly without any delay, from the bewitching ruin.—Does <hi>anger</hi> draw near with her lighted torch, to kindle the flame of reſentment in our breaſts?

                        <p>A clear and cogent treatiſe, intitled <hi>Submiſſion to the Righteouſneſs of</hi> GOD, was the inſtrument of removing his prejudices, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced him to a better judgment,—in which he has been happily confirmed by the authority of the moſt <hi>illuſtrious</hi> names, and the works, of the moſt <hi>eminent</hi> pens, that have ever adorned our church and nation.

                     <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>AS your honoured father was pleaſed to make choice of me to anſwer in your name at the font, and to exerciſe a ſort of <hi>guardianſhip</hi> over your ſpiritual intereſts; permit me, by putting theſe little treatiſes into your hand, to fulfil ſome part of that ſolemn obligation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gratitude</hi> for many ſignal favours, and a conſcientious regard to my ſacred engagement, have long ago inſpired my breaſt with the warmeſt wiſhes, both for your true <hi>dignity,</hi> and real <hi>happineſs.</hi> Nor can I think of a more endearing, or a more effectual way, of advancing either the one or the other, than to ſet before you a ſketch of your excellent <hi>father's</hi> character.—Illuſtrious examples are the moſt winning incitements to virtue. And none can come attended with ſuch particular recommendations to YOU, Sir, as the pattern of that worthy perſon, from whom you derive your very being.</p>
                  <p>A moſt cordial, and reverential eſteem for the <hi>Divine Word,</hi> was one of his remarkable qualities. Thoſe, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Heaven were his principal delight, and his inſep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arable

companions. Your gardens, your ſolitary walks, and the hedges of your fields, can witneſs,<note n="*" place="bottom">Joſh. xxiv.27.</note> with what an unwearied aſſiduity he exerciſed himſelf in the law of the LORD. From hence he fetched his maxims of wiſdom, and formed his judgment of things. The ſacred <hi>precepts,</hi> were the model of his temper, and the guide of his life; while the precious <hi>promiſes</hi> were the joy of his heart, and his portion for ever.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Improving company</hi> was another of his moſt reliſhing pleaſures. Few gentlemen were better furniſhed, either with richneſs of fancy, or copiouſneſs of expreſſion, to bear a ſhining part in converſation. With theſe talents, he always endeavoured to give ſome <hi>uſeful,</hi> generally ſome <hi>religious,</hi> turn to the diſcourſe. Nor did he ever reflect, with greater complacency on his ſocial hours, than when they tended to glorify the Eternal Majeſty; and to awaken, in himſelf and others, a more lively ſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it of devotion.</p>
                  <p>To project for the good of others, was his frequent ſtudy; and to carry thoſe benevolent contrivances into execution, his favourite employ. When viſited by the young perſons of the neighbourhood, far from taking an ungraceful pride to initiate them in debauchery, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm them in a riotous habit, it was his inceſſant aim, by finely adapted perſuaſives, to encourage them in <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry,</hi> and eſtabliſh them in a courſe of <hi>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>briety;</hi> to <hi>guard</hi> them againſt the allurements of vice, and <hi>animate</hi> them with the principles of piety. A noble kind of hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality this! which will probably tranſmit its beneficial influence to their earthly poſſeſſions; to their future families; and even to their everlaſting ſtate.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="7" facs="unknown:021885_0188_0FB5F2DB68C7CDD8"/>A conviction of human indigence, and a thorough perſuaſion of the divine all ſufficiency, induced him to be <hi>frequent in prayer.</hi> To proſtrate himſelf, in profound adoration, before that infinitely exalted being, who dwells in light inacceſſible, was <hi>his glory;</hi> to implore the continuance of the Almighty favour, and the increaſe of all chriſtian graces, was <hi>his gain.</hi> In thoſe moments, no doubt, he remembered you, Sir, with a particular ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs; and lodged many an ardent petition in the court of Heaven, for his infant ſon. Ceaſe not to ſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ond them with your own devout ſupplications, that they may deſcend upon your head, "in the fulneſs of the bleſſings of the Goſpel of peace."</p>
                  <p>To give their genuine luſtre to all his other endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he was careful to maintain an <hi>humble mind.</hi> Though his friends might admire his ſuperiour abilities, or his acquaintance applaud his exemplary behaviour, he ſaw how far he <hi>fell ſhort</hi> of the mark of his high call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; ſaw, and lamented his defects; ſaw, and renounced himſelf; relying, for final acceptance, and endleſs felicity, on a <hi>better righteouſneſs</hi> than his own; even on the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendently perfect righteouſneſs, and inconceivably prec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious death, of JESUS the Redeemer. This was the rock of his hope, and the very crown of his rejoicing.</p>
                  <p>Theſe, Sir, are ſome of the <hi>diſtinguiſhed</hi> characteriſticks of your deceaſed parent. As you had the misfortune to loſe ſo valuable a relative, before you was capable of form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any acquaintance with his perſon; I flatter myſelf, you will the more attentively obſerve his picture. This his <hi>moral picture</hi>; deſigned, not to be ſet in gold, or ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle

in enamel, but to breathe in your ſpirit, and to live in all your conduct.—Which, though it be entirely your own, calculated purely for yourſelf, may poſſibly (like the family pieces in your parlour, that glance an eye upon as many as enter the room) make ſome <hi>pleaſing and uſeful</hi> impreſſion on every beholder.—May every one, charmed with the beautiful image, catch its reſemblance; and each, in his reſpective ſphere, "go and do likewiſe."</p>
                  <p>But you, Sir, are peculiarly concerned to copy the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable original. As the order of an indulgent Providence has made you heir of the <hi>affluent circumſtances</hi>; let not a gay and thoughtleſs inadvertence, cut you off from the <hi>richer inheritance</hi> of theſe noble qualifications.—Theſe will be your ſecurity, amidſt all the glittering dangers, which are inſeparable from blooming years, and an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated ſituation in life. Theſe are your path, your ſure and only path, to true greatneſs, and ſolid happineſs.— Tread in theſe ſteps, and you cannot fail to be the dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>WE have already exerciſed out ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, on the tombs and flowers; ſurveying nature, covered with the deepeſt horrours, and arrayed in the richeſt beauties. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legory</hi> taught many of the objects, to ſpeak the language of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; while <hi>imagination</hi> lent her colouring, to give the leſſons an engaging air.—And this with a view of imitating that <hi>Divine</hi> Inſtructor, who commiſſioned the <hi>lily,</hi>

Which, beſides its being level to the loweſt apprehenſions; and admirably adapted to ſteal into the moſt inattentive heart; is accompanied with this very ſingular advantage, that it turns even the <hi>ſphere of buſineſs</hi> into a <hi>ſchool of inſtruction</hi>; and renders the moſt ordinary objects a ſet of monitors, ever ſoliciting our regard, becauſe ever preſent to our ſenſes.—So that I believe, it may be ſaid of this <hi>amiable method,</hi> in which, our LORD conveyed, as well as of that <hi>powerful energy,</hi> which attended his doctrines, that <hi>never man ſpake like this man.</hi>—The <hi>harveſt</hi> approaching, he reminds his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of a far more important harveſt, <hi>John</hi> iv.35. <hi>Matt.</hi> xiii.39. when immortal beings ſhall be <hi>reaped</hi> from the grave, and <hi>gathered in</hi> from all the quarters of the earth; when every human creature ſhall ſuſtain the character of valuable <hi>wheat,</hi> or deſpicable <hi>tares</hi>; and accordingly be lodged in manſions of everlaſting ſecurity, or conſigned over to the rage of unquenchable fire.—In his charge to <hi>fiſhermen,</hi> when they are commencing preachers, <hi>Matt.</hi> iv.19, he exhorts them, conformably to the nature of their late occupation, to uſe the ſame <hi>aſſiduity</hi> and <hi>addreſs</hi> in winning ſouls, as they were wont to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe in catching the finny prey.—For the farther illuſtration of this no leſs uſeful, than curious ſubject, I would refer my reader to a valuable note in Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton</hi>'s obſervations on the prophecies, p. 148.4 to edition.</note> ground.</p>

In compliance with this prevailing taſte, I have drawn my ſerious admonitions from the ſtupendous theatre, and variegated ſcenery, of the univerſe; that the reader may learn his duty, from his very pleaſures—may gather <hi>wiſdom,</hi> mingled with <hi>virtue,</hi> from the moſt refined <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments,</hi> and nobleſt <hi>delights.</hi>

                  <p>The moon is inceſſantly <hi>varying,</hi> either in her aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, or her ſtages. Sometimes ſhe looks full upon us, and her viſage is all luſtre. Sometimes ſhe appears in profile, and ſhews us only half her enlightened face. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non a radiant creſcent but juſt adorns her brow. Soon it dwindles into a ſlender ſtreak. Till, at length, all her beauty vaniſhes, and ſhe becomes a beamleſs orb.— Sometimes ſhe riſes with the <hi>deſcending day,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins her proceſſion amidſt admiring multitudes. Ere long ſhe defers her progreſs till the <hi>midnight watches,</hi> and ſteals unobſerved upon the ſleeping world.—Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſhe juſt enters the edges of the weſtern <hi>horizon,</hi> and drops us a ceremonious viſit. Within awhile ſhe ſets out on her nightly tour, from the oppoſite regions

of the eaſt; traverſes the whole <hi>hemiſphere</hi>; and never offers to withdraw, till the more refulgent partner of her ſway renders her preſence unneceſſary.—In a word, ſhe is, while converſant among us, ſtill waxing or waning, and "never continueth in one ſtay."</p>
                  <p>Such is the moon, and ſuch are all <hi>ſublunary things;</hi> expoſed to perpetual viciſſitudes.—How often, and how ſoon, have the faint echoes of <hi>renown</hi> ſlept in ſilence, or been converted into the clamours of oblo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quy! The ſame lips, almoſt with the ſame breath, cry hoſanna and crucify.—Have not <hi>riches</hi> confeſſed their notorious treachery, a thouſand and a thouſand times? Either melting away, like ſnow in our hands, by inſenſible degrees, or eſcaping, like a winged priſoner from its cage, with a precipitate flight.—Have we not known the bridegroom's <hi>cloſet,</hi> an antechamber to the <hi>tomb</hi>; and heard the voice, which ſo lately pronounced the ſparkling pair huſband and wife, proclaim an everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing divorce, and ſeal the decree with that ſolemn aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeveration, "aſhes to aſhes, duſt to duſt?"—Our <hi>friends,</hi> though the medicine of life; our <hi>health,</hi> though the balm of nature; are a moſt precarious poſſeſſion.

But could you inſure the <hi>continuance</hi> of this agreeable entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? No, truly. At the leaſt diſturbing noiſe, at the leaſt terrifying appearance, they ſtart from their ſeats; they mount the ſkies; and are gone in an inſtant, are gone forever.

When my thoughts were benumbed and ſtupefied, thy quickening influence rouſed them into activity; when they were diſconcerted and wild, thy regulating influence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced them into order: Refitted me at once to rel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh the innocent entertainments of an <hi>animal,</hi> and to enjoy the ſublime gratifications of a <hi>rational</hi> capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: When darkneſs covered the creation, at thy command, the <hi>ſun</hi> aroſe; painted the flowers, and diſtinguiſhed every object; gave light to my feet, and gave nature, with all her beautiful ſcenes, to my eye.—To thee, O thou GOD of my ſtrength, I owe the <hi>continuance</hi> of my being, and the <hi>vivacity</hi> of my conſtitution. By thy ſacred order, without any conſciouſneſs of mine, the wheels of life move, and the crimſon fountain plays. <hi>Overruled</hi> by thy exquiſite <hi>ſkill,</hi> it transforms itſelf, by the niceſt opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of an inexplicable kind of chymiſtry, into a

variety of the fineſt ſecretions; which glide into the muſcles, and ſwell them for action; or pour them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into the fluids, and repair the inceſſant decays; which cauſe cheerfulneſs to ſparkle in the eye, and health to bloom in the cheek.</q>

But thy faithfulneſs and truth, like an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penetrable ſhield, guarded me all around. Under this divine protection, I walked ſecure, amidſt legions of <hi>apparant</hi> perils; and paſſed unhurt through a far greater multiplicity of unſeen evils. Not one of my bones was broken; not a ſingle ſhaft grazed upon my eaſe; even when the eye that watched over me, ſaw, in its wide ſurvey, <hi>thouſands falling beſide me,</hi> in ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recoverable ruin; <hi>and ten thouſands</hi> deeply wounded, <hi>on my right hand.</hi>—If ſickneſs has, at any time, ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened my chamber, or pain harrowed my fleſh, it was a <hi>wholeſome</hi> diſcipline, and a <hi>gracious</hi> ſeverity. The chaſtiſement proved a ſovereign medicine, to cure me of an immoderate fondneſs, for this imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect troubleſome ſtate; and to quicken my deſires, after the unembittered enjoyments of my eternal home. —Has not thy munificence, unwearied and unbound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſpread my <hi>table</hi>; and furniſhed it with the fineſt wheat; repleniſhed it with marrow and fatneſs? While temperance ſweetened the bowl; appetite ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned the diſh; contentment and gratitude crowned the repaſt.—Has not thy kindneſs, O GOD of the families of <hi>Iſrael!</hi> preſerved my affectionate <hi>relations</hi>; who ſtudy, by their tender offices, to ſoften every care, and heighten every joy? Has not thy kindneſs given me valuable <hi>friends</hi>; whoſe preſence is a cordial to cheer me in a dejected hour; and whoſe converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion mingles improvement with delight?</q>

If, through the impulſe of ſenſuali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or the violence of paſſion, I have been hurried into the ſnare, and ſtung by the ſerpent, thy faithful admonitions have <hi>recalled</hi> the fooliſh wanderer;
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:021885_0259_0FB5F481914C63F8"/>
while the blood of thy Son has healed his deadly wounds.—Some, no doubt, have been cut off in the midſt of their iniquities, and tranſmitted from the thrillings of polluted joy, to the agonies of eternal deſpair. Whereas I have been diſtinguiſhed by long-ſuffering mercy; and, inſtead of lifting up my eyes in torments, to behold a heaven irrecoverably loſt, I may lift them up under the pleaſing views of being admitted, ere long, into thoſe abodes of endleſs felic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity.—In the mean time, thou haſt vouchſafed me the <hi>revelation</hi> of thy will; the influences of thy <hi>ſpirit</hi>; and abundance of the moſt effectual <hi>aids,</hi> for advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in knowledge, and growing in godlineſs; for becoming more conformable to thy image, and more meet for thy preſence; for taſting the pleaſures of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and ſecuring the riches of eternity.</q>

                  <p>
                     <q>How various is thy benificence, O thou Lover of ſouls! It has unſealed a thouſand ſources of good; opened a thouſand avenues of delight; and heap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed bleſſings upon me, with a ceaſeleſs liberality. If I ſhould attempt to declare them, they would be more than the <hi>ſtarry</hi> hoſt, which glitter in this unclouded ſky; more than the <hi>dewy</hi> gems, which will adorn the face of the morning.</q>

Rather let my pulſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get to beat!—Shall I render Him <hi>no</hi> expreſſions of thankfulneſs? Then might all nature reproach my ingratitude.—Shall I reſt ſatisfied with the <hi>bare</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of my lips? No: Let my life be vocal, and ſpeak his praiſe, in that only genuine, that moſt emphatical language—the language of devout obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. Let the <hi>bill</hi> be drawn upon my very heart; let all my affections <hi>acknowledge</hi> the draught; and let the whole tenour of my actions, in time and through eternity, be continually <hi>paying</hi> the debt—the ever pleaſing, ever growing debt of duty, veneration, and love.</q>

Whatever defilement I have contracted, waſh it thoroughly away, in redeeming blood; and let neither the ſinful ſtain, nor the ſinful inclination, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company me to my couch!—Then ſhall <hi>I lay me down in peace, and take my reſt</hi>; cheerfully referring it to thy allwiſe determination, whether I ſhall open my eyes in <hi>this</hi> world, or awake in the unknown regions of <hi>another.</hi>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HIS evening, I exchange the nice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treats of art for the noble theatre of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: Inſtead of meaſuring my ſteps under the <hi>covert</hi> of an arbour, let me range along the <hi>ſummit</hi> of this gently riſing hill.—There is no need of the leafy ſhade, ſince the ſun has quitted the horizon, and withdrawn his ſcorching beams. But ſee, how advantages and inconveniences are uſually linked, and chequer our affairs below! If the <hi>annoying heat</hi> ceaſes, the <hi>landſcape,</hi> and its pleaſing ſcenes, are alſo removed.—The majeſtick caſtle, and the lowly cottage, are vaniſhed together. I have loſt the aſpiring moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and its ruſſet brow; I look round, but to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, for the humble vale, and its flowery lap. The plains whitened with flocks, and the heath yellow with furze, diſappear. The advancing night has wrapt in darkneſs the long extended foreſt, and drawn her mantle over the windings of the ſilver ſtream. I no longer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold that luxuriant fertility in the fields; that wild mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence of proſpect, and endleſs variety of images; which have ſo often touched me with delight, and ſtruck me with awe, from this commanding eminence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="82" facs="unknown:021885_0262_0FB5F4911321EB30"/>The loſs, however, is ſcarcely to be regretted, ſince it is amply compenſated by the opening beauties of the ſky. Here I enjoy a free view of the whole hemiſphere; without any obſtacle from below, to confine the explor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eye; or any cloud from above, to overcaſt the ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious concave. 'Tis true, the lively vermilion which ſo lately ſtreaked the chambers of the weſt, is all faded. But the <hi>planets,</hi> one after another, light up their lamps; the <hi>ſtars</hi> advance in their glittering train; a thouſand and a thouſand luminaries, ſhine forth in ſucceſſive ſplendours; and the wole firmament is kindled into the moſt beautiful glow. The blueneſs of the ether, height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened by the ſeaſon of the year, and ſtill more enlivened by the <hi>abſence</hi> of the <hi>moon,</hi> gives thoſe gems of heaven the ſtrongeſt luſtre.</p>
                  <p>One pleaſure more, the invading gloom has not been able to ſnatch from my ſenſe. The night rather im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves, than deſtroys, the fragrance which exhales from the <hi>blooming beans.</hi> With theſe, the ſides of this ſloping declivity are lined; and with theſe, the balmy zephyrs perfume their wings. Does <hi>Arabia,</hi> from all her ſpicy groves, breathe a more liberal, or a more charming gale of ſweets? And, what is a peculiar recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the rural entertainments, preſented in our happy land, they are alloyed by no apprehenſions of danger. No poiſonous ſerpent lurks under the bloſſom; nor any ravenous beaſt lies ready to ſtart from the thicket.— But, I wander from a far more exalted ſubject. My thoughts, like my affections, are too eaſily diverted from the heavens, and detained by inferiour objects. Away, my attention, from theſe little blandiſhments of the earth; ſince all the <hi>glories</hi> of the <hi>ſky</hi> invite thy regard.</p>
                  <p>We have taken a turn among the <hi>tombs,</hi> and viewed the ſolemn memorials of the dead, in order to learn the vanity of mortal things, and to break their ſoft en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment.—We have ſurveyed the <hi>ornaments</hi> of the <hi>gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>; not that the heart might be planted in the parterre, or take root among the flowery race; but that theſe del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icacies of a day might teach us to aſpire after a better paradiſe, where beauty never fades, and delight is ever in the bloom.—A third time we lighted the candle of

Let me juſt recollect the moſt material of thoſe <hi>ſtupendous diſcoveries,</hi> in order to furniſh out proper ſubjects for contemplation. And let the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned remember, that the ſcene I am going to diſplay, is the workmanſhip of that incomprehenſible GOD, who is "perfect in knowledge, and mighty in power:" Whoſe name, whoſe nature, and all whoſe operations, are "great and marvellous:" Who ſummons into being, with equal eaſe, a ſingle grain, or ten thouſand worlds.—To this if we continually advert, the aſſertions, though they will certainly excite our <hi>admiration,</hi> need not tranſcend our belief.</p>
                  <p>The earth is, in fact, a round body; however it may ſeem, in ſome parts, to be ſunk into vales, and raiſed into hills;<note n="*" place="bottom">A learned writer, I think Dr. <hi>Derbam,</hi> has ſomewhere an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation to this purpoſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>—That the loftieſt <hi>ſummits</hi> of hills, and the moſt enormous <hi>ridges</hi> of mountains, are no real objection to the <hi>globular</hi> or round form of the earth.

Conſequently, the rotund figure is no more deſtroyed in the former caſe, than in the latter.— On the ſame principle, I have not thought it neceſſary to take any notice of the comparatively ſmall difference between the <hi>polar</hi> and <hi>equatorial</hi> diameter of the earth.</note> in other parts, to be ſpread into a ſpacious plain, extending to the confines of the heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens, or terminated by the waters of the ocean:—We may fancy that it has deep foundations, and reſts upon ſome prodigiouſly ſolid baſis.

Juſt as the diurnal and annual motions are ſo far from <hi>claſhing,</hi> that they entirely <hi>accord</hi>; and inſtead of being deſtructive of each other, by mutually blending their effects, they give proportion and harmony to time, fertility and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable benefits to nature.</p>

would be too mean a ſatisfaction for inexorable juſtice; too ſcanty a reparation of GOD's injured honour. So flagrant is human guilt, that nothing but a victim of <hi>infinite dignity</hi> could conſtitute an adequate propitiation. —<hi>He</hi> who ſaid,

Inſtead of creating diſcouragement, it points out the way to obtain a ſettled tranquillity. Its natural tendency is, to engage the ſerious mind in a more conſtant and attentive meditation on the unknown merits of the Divine MEDIATOR. And were we more <hi>thoroughly</hi> acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, more <hi>deeply</hi> affected, with his unutterable dignity, I am perſuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, our uneaſy apprehenſions would <hi>proportionably</hi> vaniſh, our faith <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Be my iniquities like debts of millions of talents, here is more than full payment for all that prodigious ſum. Let the enemy of mankind, and accuſer of the brethren, load me with invectives; this one plea—<hi>A di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Redeemer died,</hi> moſt thoroughly quaſhes every indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is true, in the delightful ſeaſons, HIS tenderneſs and HIS love are moſt eminently diſplayed.—In the <hi>vernal</hi> months, all is beauty to the eye, and muſick to the ear. The clouds drop fatneſs; the air ſoftens into balm; and flowers, in rich abundance, ſpring whereever we tread, bloom whereever we look.—Amidſt the burning heats of <hi>ſummer,</hi> He expands the leaves, and thickens the ſhades. He ſpreads the cooling arbour to receive us, and awakes the gentle breeze to fan us. The moſs ſwells into a couch, for the repoſe of our bodies: while the rivulet ſoftly rolls, and ſweetly murmurs, to ſoothe our imagination.—In <hi>autumn,</hi> HIS bounty covers the fields with a profuſion of nutrimental treaſure, and bends the boughs with loads of delicious fruit. He furniſhes his hoſpitable board with preſent plenty, and prepares a copious magazine for future wants.—But, is it <hi>only</hi> in theſe ſmiling periods of the year, that GOD, the all gracious GOD, is ſeen? Has <hi>winter,</hi> ſtern winter, no tokens of his preſence? Yes: All things are eloquent of his praiſe. "His way is in the whirlwind." Storms and tempeſts fulfil his word, and extol his power. Even piercing froſts bear witneſs to his goodneſs, while they bid the ſhivering nations tremble at his wrath.—Be

winter then, for a while, our theme.<note n="*" place="bottom">A ſketch of this nature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I muſt acknowledge, is quite different from the ſubject of the book; and, I cannot but declare, was as far diſtant from the thoughts of the author. But the deſire of <hi>ſeveral</hi> acquaintance, together with an intimation of its uſefulneſs, by a very <hi>polite letter</hi> from an <hi>unknown</hi> hand, prevailed with me to add a few deſcriptive touches, and improving hints, on what is ſo often ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced in theſe northern regions. I hope the attempt I have made to oblige theſe gentlemen, will obtain the <hi>approbation,</hi> or at leaſt the <hi>excuſe,</hi> of my other readers.</note> Perhaps thoſe <hi>barren</hi> ſcenes may be <hi>fruitful</hi> of intellectual improvement. Perhaps that rigorous cold, which binds the earth in icy chains, may ſerve to enlarge our hearts, and warm them with holy love.</p>
                  <p>See! how the day is <hi>ſhortened!</hi>—The ſun, detained in fairer climes, or engaged in more agreeable ſervices, riſes, like an unwilling viſitant, with tardy and reluctant ſteps. He walks, with a ſhy indifference, along the edges of the ſouthern ſky; caſting an oblique glance, he juſt looks upon our dejected world, and ſcarcely ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters light through the thick air. Dim is his appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, languid are his gleams, while he continues. Or, if he chance to wear a brighter aſpect, and a cloudleſs brow; yet, like the young and gay in the houſe of mourning, he ſeems uneaſy, till he is gone; is in haſte to depart.—And let him depart. Why ſhould we wiſh for his longer ſtay, ſince he can ſhew us nothing but the creation in diſtreſs? The ſlowery families lie dead, and the tuneful tribes are ſtruck dumb. The trees, ſtript of their verdure, and laſhed by ſtorms, ſpread their naked arms to the enraged and relentleſs heavens. Fragrance no longer floats in the air; but chilling damps hover, or cutting gales blow. Nature, diveſted of all her beautiful robes, ſits, like a forlorn diſconſolate widow, in her weeds. While winds, in doleful accents howl; and rains, in repeated ſhowers, weep.</p>
                  <p>We regret not, therefore, the ſpeedy departure of the day. When the room is hung with <hi>funeral black,</hi> and diſmal objects are all around, who could deſire to have the <hi>glimmering taper</hi> kept alive, which can only

diſcover ſpectacles of ſorrow; can only make the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour viſible?—And, ſince this mortal life is little better than a continual conflict with ſin, or an unremitted ſtruggle with miſery, is it not a <hi>gracious</hi> ordination, which has reduced our age to a <hi>ſpan?</hi> Fourſcore years of trial, for the virtuous, are ſufficiently long; and more than ſuch a term, allowed to the wicked, would render them beyond all meaſure vile. Our way to the kingdom of Heaven lies through tribulations. Shall we then <hi>accuſe,</hi> ſhall we not rather <hi>bleſs</hi> the providence which has made the paſſage ſhort?

The waters drop inceſſantly from the eaves, and ruſh in rapid ſtreams from the ſpouts: They roar along the channelled pavements, and ſtand in foul ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows amidſt the village ſtreets. Now, if the inatten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive eye, or negligent hand, has left the roof but ſcanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly covered, the inſinuating element finds its way into every flaw, and oozing through the ceiling, at once upbraids and chaſtiſes the careleſs inhabitant. The ploughman, ſoaked to the ſkin, leaves his half tilled acre. The poor poultry, dripping with wet, crowd into ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The tenants of the bough fold up their wings, afraid to launch into the ſtreaming air. The beaſts, joyleſs and diſpirited, ruminate under their ſhades. The roads ſwim, and the brooks ſwell.—The <hi>river,</hi> amidſt all this watery ferment, long contained itſelf within its appointed bounds: But, ſwollen by innumerable cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and rouſed at laſt into uncontrollable rage, burſts over its banks, ſhoots into the plain, bears down all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,

                  <p>How happy for man, that this inundation comes, when there are no flowery crops in the valley, to be overwhelmed; no fields ſtanding thick with corn, to be laid waſte! At <hi>ſuch</hi> a juncture, it would have been <hi>ruin</hi> to the huſbandman and his family: But, <hi>thus</hi> timed, it yields <hi>manure</hi> for his ground, and promiſes him <hi>riches</hi> in reverſion.—How often, and how long, has the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majeſty bore with the moſt injurious affronts from ſinners! His goodneſs triumphed over their perverſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and graciouſly refuſed to be exaſperated. But, O preſumptuous creatures! multiply no longer your provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations: Urge not, by repeated iniquities, the Almighty arm to ſtrike; leſt his long ſuffering ceaſe, and his fierce anger break forth; break forth like a <hi>flood of waters,</hi>

Then, with irreſiſtible impetuoſity, they fly forth, ſcattering dread, and menacing deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>The atmoſphere is hurled into the moſt tumultuous confuſion. The aërial torrent burſts its way over mountains, ſeas, and continents. All things feel the dreadful ſhock. All things tremble before the furious blaſt. The <hi>foreſt,</hi> vexed and tore, groans under the ſcourge. Her ſturdy ſons are ſtrained to the very roof, and almoſt ſweep the ſoil they were wont to ſhade. The ſtubborn oak, that diſdains to bend, is daſhed headlong to the ground; and, with ſhattered arms, with proſtrate trunk, blocks the road.—While the flexile reed, that ſprings up in the marſh, yielding to the guſt (as the <hi>meek</hi> and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>For a moment, the turbulent and outrageous ſky ſeems to be aſſwaged; but it intermits its wrath, only to increaſe its ſtrength. Soon the ſounding ſquadrons of the air return to the attack, and renew their ravages with redoubled fury. The ſtately dome rocks amidſt the wheeling clouds. The impregnable tower totters on its baſis, and threatens to overwhelm whom it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to protect. The ragged rock is rent in pieces;<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Kings, xix.11.</note> and even the hills, the perpetual hills, on their deep foundations, are ſcarcely ſecure.—Where now is the place of ſafety?

All is uproar in the elements; all is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation among mortals; and nothing but one wide ſcene of rueful devaſtation through the land.—Yet, this is only an <hi>inferiour</hi> miniſter of divine diſpleaſure; the executioner of <hi>milder</hi> indignation.

But, in one circumſtance, the prophet is very much ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to the poet. The prophet, by giving a ſtriking <hi>contraſt</hi> to his ſentiments, repreſents them with incomparably greater energy. He ſays not, <hi>men</hi> in the groſs, or the <hi>human heart</hi> in general; but men of the moſt <hi>elated</hi> looks, hearts big with the moſt <hi>arrogant</hi> imaginat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions. Even <hi>theſe</hi> ſhall ſtoop from their ſupercilious heights; even <hi>theſe</hi> ſhall grovel in the duſt of abaſement, and ſhudder with all the extremes of an abject puſillanimity.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>ocean</hi> ſwells with tremendous commotions. The ponderous waves are heaved from their capacious bed, and almoſt lay bare the unfathomable deep. Flung into the moſt rapid agitation, they ſweep over the rocks; they laſh the lofty cliffs, and toſs themſelves into the

clouds. Navies are rent from their anchors; and, with all their enormous load, are whirled, ſwift as the arrow, wild as the winds, along the vaſt abyſs.—Now they climb the rolling mountain; they plough the frightful ridge; and ſeem to ſkim the ſkies. Anon they plunge into the opening gulf; they loſe the ſight of day; and are loſt themſelves to every eye. How vain is the pilot's art! how impotent the mariner's ſtrength! They reel to and fro, and ſtagger in the jarring hold; or cling to the cordage, while burſting ſeas foam over the deck. <hi>Deſpair</hi> is in every face, and <hi>death</hi> ſits threatening on every ſurge.—But why, O ye aſtoniſhed mariners, why ſhould you abandon yourſelves to deſpair? Is the LORD's hand <hi>ſhortened,</hi> becauſe the waves of the ſea rage horribly? Is his ear <hi>deafened</hi> by the roaring thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and the bellowing tempeſt? Cry, cry unto HIM, who

HE is all gracious to hear, and almighty to ſave. If HE command, the ſtorm ſhall be huſhed to ſilence; the billows ſhall ſubſide into a calm; the lightnings ſhall lay their fiery bolts aſide; and, inſtead of ſinking into a watery grave, you ſhall find yourſelves brought to the deſired haven.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes, after a joyleſs day, a more diſmal night ſucceeds.—The lazy, louring vapours had wove ſo thick a veil, as the meridian ſun could ſcarcely penetrate. What gloom then muſt overwhelm the nocturnal hours! The moon withdraws her ſhining. Not a ſingle ſtar is able to ſtruggle through the deep arrangement of ſhades. All is <hi>pitchy darkneſs,</hi> without one enlivening ray. How ſolemn! how awful! It is like the ſhroud of nature, or the return of chaos. I do not wonder, that it is the parent of terrours, and ſo apt to engender melancholy.—Lately, the tempeſt marked its rapid way with <hi>miſchief</hi>; now the night dreſſes her ſilent pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilion with <hi>horrour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have <hi>ſometimes</hi> left the beaming tapers, withdrawn from the ruddy fire, and plunged into the thickeſt of thoſe ſooty ſhades, without regretting the change, rather exulting in it as a welcome deliverance. The very gloom was pleaſing, was exhilarating, compared

with the converſation I quitted. The ſpeech of my companions (how does it grieve me, that I ſhould <hi>even</hi> once have occaſion to call them by <hi>that</hi> name!) was the language of darkneſs—was horrour to the ſoul, and torture to the ear. <hi>Their teeth were ſpears and arrows, and their tongue a ſharp ſword,</hi> to ſtab and aſſaſſinate their neighbour's character: <hi>Their throat was an open ſepulchre,</hi> gaping to devour the reputation of the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, or tainting the air with their virulent and polluted breath. Sometimes their licentious and ungovernable diſcourſe, ſhot arrows of <hi>profaneneſs</hi> againſt Heaven it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and, in proud defiance, challenged the reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Omnipotence. Sometimes, as if it was the glory of human nature to cheriſh the <hi>groſſeſt</hi> appetites of the brute, or the mark of a gentleman to have ſerved an apprenticeſhip in a brothel, the filthieſt jeſts of the ſtews (if low <hi>obſcenity</hi> can be a jeſt) were nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeouſly obtruded on the company. All the <hi>modeſt</hi> part were offended and grieved, while the other beſotted creatures laughed aloud, though the leproſy of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs appeared on their lips.—Are not theſe perſons <hi>priſoners</hi> of <hi>darkneſs,</hi> though blazing ſconces pour arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial day through their rooms? Are not their ſouls im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured in the moſt baleful ſhades, though the noon tide ſun is brightened by flaming on their gilded chariots?— They diſcern not that great and adorable Being, who fills the univerſe with his infinite and glorious preſence; who is <hi>all eye</hi> to obſerve their actions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <p>They have forced me out, and are, perhaps, deriding me in my abſence; are charging my reverence for the ever preſent GOD, and my concern for the dignity of our <hi>rational</hi> nature, to the account of humour and ſingularity; to narrowneſs of thought, or ſourneſs

                  <p>I ride home amidſt the gloomy void. All darkling and ſolitary, I can ſcarce diſcern my horſe's head, and only gueſs out my blind road.

We ſhould have known neither our true good, nor real evil: We had been a riddle to ourſelves; the preſent ſtate all confuſion, and the future impenetrable darkneſs.—But, the Sun of righteouſneſs, ariſing with potent and triumphant beams, has diſſipated the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing cloud; has opened a proſpect more beautiful than the bloſſoms of ſpring; more cheering than the treaſures of autumn; and far more enlarged than the extent of the viſible ſyſtem;—which, having led the eye of the mind through fields of grace, over rivers of righteouſneſs, and hills crowned with knowledge, ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates at length in the heavens; ſweetly loſing itſelf in regions of infinite bliſs, and endleſs glory.</p>
                  <p>As I walk along the fog, it ſeems, at ſome little diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, to be almoſt ſolid gloom; ſuch as would ſhut out every glimpſe of light, and totally impriſon me in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity.

both inſtances we are graciouſly diſappointed. The keen edge of the calamity is blunted, that it may not wound us with incurable anguiſh; the exquiſite reliſh of the proſperity is palled, that it may not captivate our affections, and enſlave them to inferiour delights.</p>
