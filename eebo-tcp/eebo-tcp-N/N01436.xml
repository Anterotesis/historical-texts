            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  </gap> Introduction, touching Banks in general.</head>
               <p>MOney, whether Gold or Silver, is but a meaſure of the value of other things; yet hath, for a long Succeſſion of Ages (eſpecially in the Civilized and Trading part of
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:001703_0004_0FB62967A366F148"/>
the World) obtained to be the uſual, and beſt known means of Interchange.</p>
               <p>This meaſure and way of Interchange, was ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally occaſioned by the experimented inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences of common Barter; in which way, unleſs both the Parties dealing, have like occaſion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocally, of each others Commodities, the leſs neceſſitous Over-reaches the greater, by impoſing the price of both, to his own advantage, and the others detriment, which is not equal; nor can there be Equality where there is no common Standard between them.</p>
               <p>But, whether the Mines fail, or Men have not been ſo fore-ſeeing and induſtrious to bring in, to moſt Countreys, a ſufficiency of Money or Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, wherewith to manage their increaſing Trades, or, that Traders, for want of other Returns, have been neceſſitated, for Balance of the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of Goods imported, to remit the Coyns of ſome Countreys into others: Or, for other Cauſes (not neceſſary on this occaſion to be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inquired into) tis now ſo hard to come by, in ſome places, for carrying on of Trade, to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the vaſtneſs of Mens attempts, and aims of increaſe in Merchandize, as that its found, in many Countreys, inſufficient in this Age of the World: And that hath put divers Perſons and Countreys, upon contrivances how to ſupply that Deficiency, by other Mediums; ſome of which have happily pitch'd upon that of Banks, Lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bards, and Exchange of Moneys by Bills, which have thriven with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="unknown:001703_0005_0FB6296B776E9CE0"/>
The two former of theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> Banks and Lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bards, have been ſet on foot in divers Trading Countreys, by their reſpective Publick Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings, and have ſucceeded to their abundant In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching. Perhaps others have thought, that would have occaſion'd the overflowing of Moneys amongſt them: Eſpecially if they raiſed the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lues of Gold &amp; Silver above the common Standard; but as they have been miſtaken, or their Surfeit of Trade hath obſcured the viſibility of it; and protracted more rational Conſiderations of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing, till it hath proved almoſt Fatal, to the impoveriſhing of their Countreys: So the other have really experimented, that their Banks have been, as well with other Countries, as amongſt themſelves, of greater Value than the Species of Gold and Silver: And yet, ſuch Places drain away the ſaid Species from the other, who under thoſe miſtaken apprehenſions have Courted it, as the only real good thing for a Countrey.</p>
               <p>The Third, <hi>viz.</hi> that of Exchange of Moneys, hath been for the moſt part managed by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Merchants of all places; who in their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Dealings and Correſpondences (fore-lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Advantages to themſelves thereby) have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountably controll'd it, and vary it often, in each Annual Revolution.</p>
               <p>'Tis not to be doubted, but that all Three of theſe may be accommodated &amp; improved, to the Publick Advantage of any Countrey: Eſpecially, if managed in Partnerſhip by Private Hands, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perſons of known Integrity, Prudence and
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:001703_0006_0FB6297FA8FBAB30"/>
Eſtates: ſubjecting the annual Profits accruing thereby to the anſwering the Injury, damage, or loſs, by their undertaking.</p>
               <p>The beſt Foundation for ſuch an Attempt, is, that of Real and Perſonal Eſtates, inſtead of the <hi>Species</hi> of Gold and Silver. For, as a Bank of Moneys is liable to many caſualties and hazards; ſo, the hoarding up of Moneys in Banks, neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates the taking out the more Bills; which is one Malady this Propoſed Bank will cure.</p>
               <p>We ſhall therefore, at preſent, begin with, and principally diſcourſe of the two firſt of theſe: <hi>viz.</hi> The Bank of Credit, as it may be rendred ſuſceptible of the Second, <hi>viz.</hi> The Lumbard, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct: accounting both the one and the other to be founded as aforeſaid, <hi>viz.</hi> On Lands or Real Eſtates mortgaged, and ſtaple durable Goods, and Merchandiſes depoſited: ſuch as any Countreys Products and Manufactures will by Art and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry produce and furniſh.</p>
               <p>Here might be alſo diſcours'd, A Lumbard for the Poor, by ſome called, <hi>Mons Pietatis:</hi> But that's fitter to be the Handmaid of the other; for, 'twill be too poor to encourage an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking by it ſelf, or for a beginning: Neither will there be any ſuch neceſſity thereof, when this Bank is ſettled; foraſmuch as this will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy moſt of thoſe, who are uſually maintained in Idleneſs, if they will betake themſelves to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, at ſuch moderate wages as would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able them to live comfortably, without expoſing their Imployers to like Poverty with themſelves.
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:001703_0007_0FB6298120683038"/>
And beſides, this Bank of Credit and Lumbard, when underſtood, and received in any Countrey with general Approbation, will in due time ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that, as alſo the Third, <hi>viz.</hi> that of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of Moneys by Bills, the more intelligible, and as uſeful.</p>

               <head>Of the ſixth Particular, viz. The anſwering ſome few of the moſt material Pertinent Queries, and Objections touching this Bank, viz.</head>
               <p>Q 1. C <hi>An I have Monyes for Bank-bills, when I have occaſion?</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. 'Tis not propounded to be a Bank of Moneys (which is liable to inexpreſſible &amp; unfore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen hazards) but of Credit to be given forth by Bills; not on Moneys advanced, as in other Banks; but (on Lands or Goods, as aforeſaid,) to ſupply ſuch as cannot get Moneys (by reaſon of its ſcarcity) with whatſoever may be had for Moneys. Yet,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2. As oft as any perſons Redeem their Lands, or Goods, they muſt do it in Bank-bills, or with Moneys. If in ready Moneys, the Partner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip may exchange Bills therewith, to ſuch as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it; as is afore provided by the Rules.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 3. However, this Bank is no occaſion of ſtreightning men that would have Moneys; but leaves them free; and in this caſe, the Merchant-brokers of the Bank will be helpful, between thoſe who have and who want Moneys, and Bills re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively; as is likewiſe aforementioned in the ſaid Rules. But,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 4. If it be made to appear to you, that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who have Moneys, will be willing to change your Bank-bills into thoſe Species of Gold &amp; Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, &amp; thank you for offering them the occaſion (tho' the Bank Partnerſhip do it not) you'l have no cauſe to decline the other advantages propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: Eſpecially if you may both be gainers by the Exchange. Now, if I ow'd you 500 <hi>l.</hi> to be paid in Silver, which I could not do, but ſhould propoſe to pay you in Gold, at the intrinſique Coyn'd Value, which if you part with again will yield you <hi>Five Pound</hi> profit, or more: Would you then refuſe Gold?</p>

Obj. <hi>But how will you apply this, to make it Credible? Sol.</hi> Thus, Whoever hath any Payment to make in Bank, which (in probability if ſuch Bank take effect in any Countrey) will be every Man that deals in above <hi>Twenty Shillings</hi> at a time) will find, that we muſt pay <hi>Forty Shillings</hi> more, in every <hi>Hundred Pounds</hi> of ready Money, than in Bank-bills of Credit; as <hi>per</hi> the forementioned Rules of the Bank) which is about <hi>Five-pence</hi> benefit to the Exchanger, in every 20. <hi>s.</hi> No doubt then of having Moneys (by a little inquiry of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant-broker) at the Value contained in the Bills, of all ſuch as muſt redeem their Mortgages, and Depoſits. But,</p>
               <p>Bills, wherever Banks have been erected (tho' Money Banks) have always been of better Value than Moneys in Specie. Whereof three Reaſons may be given.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) For the eaſe of Compting and Carriage; and preventing damage to the Receiver, by Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit, Clip'd, Light or Baſe Coyn: (Which is obvious to all.)</p>
               <p n="2">(2) For ſafety in Travelling, Laying up, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> As viſible as the other.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) For the advantage that is to be made by the Exchange, on the account of ſuch Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences. Whereof take two Examples, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">(1.) The Bank-bills of <hi>Holland</hi> are ordinarily better than Moneys, by at leaſt <hi>Three Pounds per Cent.</hi> And,</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) Thoſe in <hi>Venice,</hi> by <hi>Twenty Pounds per Cent.</hi> and Laws made there to keep them from riſing
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:001703_0025_0FB629F341C5F6D8"/>
higher; for they were once at 28. <hi>l. per Cent.</hi> and not without ſome difficulty Reduced to <hi>Twenty;</hi> ſo that each Bill of 100 <hi>l.</hi> is now Current at 120. <hi>l.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But how is that Poſſible or Credible?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> There is this account rendred of it (which has confirmation by many other Inſtances that might be given, concerning the current Prices of many Commodities, which have not ſo much of intrinſique value in them,) <hi>viz.</hi> The State of <hi>Venice</hi> propounded the Erecting a Bank to conſiſt of <hi>Two Millions of Duckets:</hi> Accordingly Moneys were brought in, Bills given out for the ſame Value; and a ſtop put to the receiving, or giving out any more of either.</p>
               <p>The Uſefulneſs of theſe Bills was ſuddenly found to be ſuch in the practice and imployment of them, upon the three forementioned Accounts, that every Man, at one time or other, found his Affairs required them: So, that at firſt, ſuch Bills would not be parted with for Money, under <hi>Ten Shillings per Hundred Pounds;</hi> And no ſooner was that become the Current Rate, but they were ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively raiſed, by <hi>Ten Shillings</hi> at a time, till they came to be in every ones Eſtimation, 28. <hi>l per Cent.</hi> better than Moneys in Specie; and ſo paſs'd accordingly. Whereupon,</p>
               <p>The State of <hi>Venice</hi> enacted ſeveral Laws againſt their paſſing ſo high: which failing to accompliſh what was required, at length they conceived it neceſſary, in order to the bringing down the Price, to propoſe the giving forth Bills for <hi>Three Hundred Thouſand Duckets</hi> more: By which means they
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:001703_0026_0FB629F6A03A6D60"/>
brought it back to <hi>Twenty Pounds per Cent.</hi> (which pleaſed the People) and there fixt it, as to its riſing higher afterwards, by a ſevere Law; ſince when, it ſtands ſo to this Day: And this is no more than what is familiar in the Price of other things, <hi>viz.</hi> Diamonds, Rubies, Pearls, Horſes, Pictures, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> which have their Eſtimation from the various Pleaſures and Fancies of Men, &amp;<hi>c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And, if it be demanded, what induced that State to allow it ſo high?</p>
               <p>The Anſwer is eaſie, <hi>viz.</hi> The State of <hi>Venice</hi> had made uſe of the Moneys depoſited, in their Publick Occaſions (where obſerve the hazard of a Money Bank) and, having promiſed for Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of Creditors, to raiſe the like Sum, if they ſhould have occaſion for it, reap this advantage, of their Peoples high Opinion of Bills, that, they are thereby aſſured, that never, will any Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor come to ask them 100 <hi>l.</hi> for a Bill of 100 <hi>l.</hi> when he may have 120 <hi>l.</hi> from any other hand. A notable way to pay a vaſt Debt. But, by means hereof, the Creditor has no other Fund or Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity but the States Word: For, there is not one Ducket for them in Bank.</p>
               <p>Q. 2. <hi>My Lands or Goods are already Mortgaged for Moneys, at a higher Rate of Interest; and the Mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Q. 3. <hi>I have neither Lands nor Goods, but a Trade, by
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:001703_0027_0FB629F7A4FFE4B0"/>
which I could live comfortably if I had a ſmall Stock; and I could afford to give a greater Intereſt, and have Friends that would help me too, upon my own Bond: But they have not Moneys. Which way ſhall I be help'd?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> If your Friends have Lands or Goods, they may have theſe Bank-bills of Credit, at <hi>Four Pounds per Cent. per Annum,</hi> to Lend you at ſuch Rates as you can agree: Whereby they alſo may be gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and have incouragement to help you.</p>
               <p>Much more might be ſaid upon this Subject, but theſe ſeem to be ſufficient, for incouraging an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt: And, the experiments of the things ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted will give ſuch clear Demonſtrations of the Uſefulneſs, Advantage, Neceſſity &amp; Security of ſuch Banks, in moſt places, beyond all others that have been hitherto put in practice, as thoſe who are not ſo prompt to receive things into their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings by the Notions of them, or are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced by miſtaken apprehenſions about them, &amp; thence raiſe many impertinent Objections (not worth ſcribling) may be preſumed will follow o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Examples, in well-doing, when thoſe are obſerved to thrive who go before therein.</p>

               <head>We ſhall therefore, for the Concluſion, which is the laſt Particular mentioned, to be Diſcourſed, Sum up all, in this general Aſſertion, viz.</head>
               <p>THat there will ariſe many more Convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces &amp; Advantages, by this Bank, to ſuch Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys where they ſhall be erected, than have been enumerated, in the ſeveral foregoing inſtances; or, well, can be.</p>

1. By this, the Trade &amp; Wealth of any Country is eſtabliſh'd upon its own Foundation: and upon a <hi>Medium</hi> or <hi>Balance</hi> ariſing within it ſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> The Lands &amp; Products of ſuch Countrey, &amp; not upon the Importation of Gold or Silver; or the Scarcity or Plenty of them, or, of any thing elſe Imported from Foreign Nations, which may be with-held, prohibited, or enhanſed, at the Pleaſure of others.</p>
               <p n="2"> 2. The Native Commodities of ſuch Countrys will thus become improved to a ſufficiency <hi>(at leaſt)</hi> for their own Uſe; and thereby afford a comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Subſiſtence to many ingenuous &amp; induſtrious Perſons, in ſuch Countrys, who know not how to Subſiſt: Eſpecially ſuch as are Baniſh'd, or inforced to forſake their Native Countrys, by reaſon of the heat of Perſecution, upon the account of Religion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It will not be in the Power of any, by Extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion &amp; Oppreſſion, to make a Prey of the Neceſſitous.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Fiſhery of ſuch Countrys, as lye conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for it, may be improved: and the Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion &amp; Shipping increaſed, for Uſe or Sale.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Publick Revenues thereof, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of theſe, will be augmented.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Rents of Lands, yea, the Purchaſe value thereof, will riſe: For, the Plenty of Money, or a valuable Credit equivalent thereunto, &amp; the Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering of Intereſt, muſt neceſſarily have that effect.</p>
               <p n="7">7. It will ſupply the defect or ſcarcity of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys in Specie, until by the ſetling of <hi>Manufactures,</hi> &amp;<hi>c.</hi> (which this Bank propoſes) the Products of ſuch Countrey for Exportation ſhall come to Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance or Exceed the value of it's Importations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="27" facs="unknown:001703_0029_0FB62A09A71084D0"/>
which afterwards will neceſſitate the bringing in of Moneys, as faſt as the want thereof hath carried it away. For, the true ground of the Plenty or Scarcity of Moneys in any Countrey, is not the high or low Value of the Money (as ſome errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly conceive) but, that the Value of Goods Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported from other parts hath been greater than that of the Export. The Balance whereof muſt neceſſarily be anſwer'd with Moneys, &amp; for the ſame Reaſon, Revers'd, the Export of Goods when bro't to exceed the value of the Import, muſt, as neceſſarily bring it back again to ſuch proportion as the Export can be raiſed. And whatſoever o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther means may be ſuggeſted for furniſhing of Moneys, muſt be fruitleſs, for, there will abide no more than ſuch proportion; let what Value will be put on Moneys above the Currant Price there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in other Countrys with whom they ſhall Trade; which may be further Evidenced, if this hint thereof be not ſufficiently intelligible. To which may be added, That the leſs need there is of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys in Specie, by reaſon of ſuch Currant Credit, the more will be the increaſe of Money it ſelf; as is manifeſt in <hi>Holland, Venice,</hi> &amp; all Places where Bank-credit ſupplies the defect of thoſe Species; leaſt, the Money that remains in ſuch Countreys, will be at greater liberty for ſuch petty occaſions as cannot be ſo well accommodated by Bills.</p>
               <p>In Order therefore, &amp; as Praevious to the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring upon ſuch an Affair, tis requiſite that other Queries be Propounded and Reſolved, viz.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1.

But,</p>
               <p>Q. 5. It may be further inquired, viz. <hi>What if ſome ſorts of Perſons requiſite for a univerſal Circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Bills, will not, in all caſes, ingage to accept Bank-bills: but ſome will wholly Refuſe them, &amp; Cry up Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, inhans'd to a higher Rate than they paſs at in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Countreys,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Others will be for either, or both, as they find it for their Advantage,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Its not neceſſary that all ſhould, in all caſes, oblige themſelves to Bills, as long as there is Moneys to be had: But if there be not a ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of that for carrying on of Trade, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> as, this Bank hinders not the Currency of Moneys, but that may be imployed as far as it will go, (which, for the moſt part, during the Scarcity of it, will be in ſmall dealings,) ſo, the Bills will be found uſeful to ſupply the defect. The needful pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion whereof will ſoon be underſtood; and each Perſon will caſt his Buſineſs, and make his Contracts accordingly: And conſequently, this need not hinder, or diſcourage the attempt; if there be a competent number of each, or moſt ſorts, that cannot, otherwiſe, deal as they would.</p>
               <p>Q. 6. And, if any ſhall inquire, <hi>What Number of Merchants and other Tradesmen may be ſufficient (at firſt erecting ſuch a Bank) to aſſiſt a Circulation of Bills in Trade, in caſe ſome ſhould, not only withdraw from, but, obſtruct, &amp; miſrepreſent the Affair, or Perſons managing it, as not having the Publick Approbation, or Sanction of the Authority of a Countrey, which they may ſuggeſt to be neceſſary?</hi> It's Anſwered,</p>

the neceſſity, uſefulneſs, and ſecurity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, who cannot eaſily take it up in the Notion, or by Diſcourſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that ſuch will come in by Degrees: for, if, (being Merchants) they ſtand out, ſuch of their Chap-men as ſhall find it their intereſt to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
