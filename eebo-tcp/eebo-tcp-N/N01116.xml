            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>THE Great God,</hi> who is the only <hi>Fountain</hi> of true <hi>Honour,</hi> has imprinted that Majeſty and Beauty on true Excellency &amp; Piety, that they command E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem and Reverence from all that obſerve them. And the more Eminent any are in Intellectual or Moral Perfections, the more diffuſive in their Goodneſs; the greater Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is due to them when <hi>Living,</hi> &amp; when <hi>Dead.</hi> Such as have been Publick Benefact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors to the World by their Worthy Deeds,
<pb facs="unknown:001329_0003_0FB27D7089A55088"/>
challenge the moſt Publick Acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And to deny their Memory this juſt Tribute, will argue an heavy Imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Ingratitude and Injuſtice, both to God and Them. This ſeems agreeable to the <hi>Natural Notices</hi> of what is Good and Excellent, which are ingraven on the Minds of all men.</p>
                  <p>Hence the <hi>Very Unletter'd Nations</hi> have had many Contrivances, ſome odd enough, to Eternize the Memory of their admired <hi>Hero's.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That Part of the <hi>Heathen World,</hi> that has been <hi>better Diſciplined,</hi> has always had an Honourable Regard to the Names of their Departed Friends, who either for Wiſdom, or Courage, or Vertue, did ſingularly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve of the Publick. <hi>Funeral Panegyricks</hi> were made to Celebrate their Praiſe; &amp; the greateſt Care was uſed to tranſmit their Names with all Marks of Honour to their <hi>Lateſt Poſterity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The People of God</hi> themſelves have in all Ages accounted it a part of Piety, Juſtice and Charity to pay deſerved Reſpects to the Memory of Great and Good men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Jews</hi> were famous for this: They were wont to prepare the Bodies of their Worthy's for their Funeral by Coſtly Spices,
<pb facs="unknown:001329_0004_0FB27D72035CE2B8"/>
Rich Odours and Perfumes. This we have an account of at the Death of <hi>Aſa.</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.14. To which Cuſtome poſſibly the Wiſe man alludes, when he tells us, <hi>A Good Name is better than precious Oyntment, Eccl.</hi> 7.1. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Sepulchres</hi> were provided for their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terment; and <hi>Funeral Elegies</hi> made in their Praiſe. Their Names were not mentioned without a <hi>Bleſſing on their Memory</hi>: And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeably the <hi>Rabbins</hi> ſeldome quote any Perſon of this Figure, but with that Form of Honourable Commemoration, <hi>viz. Such an One of Bleſſed Memory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Primitive Chriſtians</hi> accounted it no ſmall part of their Religion, to do Suitable Honour to the Memory of their Deceaſed Saints, eſpecially <hi>Martyrs,</hi> and faithful <hi>Paſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors.</hi> They took care that the very Aſhes of their Martyrs ſhould not be treated as Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Duſt: They were wont to Enſhrine their Remains of Mortality <hi>in Tombs,</hi> &amp; Erect Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents, on which were Inſcribed their Names, Quality and Character. <hi>Funeral O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations</hi> were made upon them: And they had Publick Records, called their <hi>Diptychs,</hi> in which their Names were Enrolled with all Circumſtances of Honour. And in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time they were prone to pay a Reverence,
<pb facs="unknown:001329_0005_0FB27D738173F2C0"/>
                     <hi>to a fault great,</hi> to the very Dormitorys of thoſe that Slept in Jeſus. To be ſure in a few Ages they came to pay undue Honour to their Memory; which open'd the way to that <hi>Superſtition,</hi> and <hi>Idolatry</hi> in their Invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and Worſhip of Saints, which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has been for many Ages Infamous for.</p>
                  <p>And tho' it becomes us to avoid all that was <hi>Superſtitious,</hi> and <hi>faulty</hi> herein practiſed either by Jew or Gentile, Chriſtian or Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del; yet it ſeems agreeable to the Light of Reaſon &amp; Revelation to perpetuate the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of our Worthies, and to mention their Names with due Reſpect. The Wiſe man tells us, Prov. 10.7. <hi>That the Memory of the Juſt ſhall be bleſſed</hi>; i. e. <hi>ſhall be praiſed as ſome; or ſhall be with praiſes, as others read it.</hi> And it is a <hi>Command given,</hi> Heb. 13.7. <hi>Remember them that have the Rule over you, who have ſpoken to you the Word of God, whoſe faith follow, conſidering the end of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation. Indeed</hi> a great care is neceſſary that in all the Praiſes we give to departed Saints, we ultimately reſpect the Glory of God, who was the <hi>Giver</hi> of all their Valuable Endowments: Their Worthy Actions muſt be ſet forth in a manner ſuitable, and with a
<pb facs="unknown:001329_0006_0FB27D7A72036FB0"/>
juſt deſign, to incite the <hi>Living</hi> to an Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Imitation of them. And thus there will be no real Inconſiſtency, but an admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Harmony, between <hi>Praiſing the Dead,</hi> &amp; <hi>Inſtructing the Living.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I cannot therefore but think that I have done but my Duty, what Chriſtianity allows, &amp; In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites to, in giving ſome Account of the Gifts &amp; Graces of that Excellent Perſon, who was late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Serving God, and the Intereſt of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation here below; but is now giving his Attendance on the Throne of the Lamb Above: And am perſwaded it may be many ways ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous, eſpecially to this Flock of Chriſt; to gratify the deſires of many, by a Publication of what of his Character was deliver'd in the following Sermon, in which I have the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to have ſaid <hi>Leſs,</hi> than I am fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, was his <hi>Due.</hi> And ſure I am, this ſhort account of this Servant of God may, thro' the Bleſſing of Heaven, be of conſiderable Service to us, that have ſo long Sat under his Shadow, and have had our Souls, if not our own fault, often refreſhed with his Diſpenſations.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Great</hi> &amp; <hi>Good</hi> things that are juſtly ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of him, ſhould lead us to magnify Chriſt the <hi>Fountain</hi> from whence all his Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were derived; and teach us what Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our is due to God in whom all Perfections do Concenter. They tend to inſpire us with Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
<pb facs="unknown:001329_0007_0FB27D7BC3CDE850"/>
to Heaven for the beſtowment of ſo <hi>Rich</hi> a <hi>Bleſſing</hi> on us, and for the Continuance of the ſame for ſo long a ſeaſon; and ſo to breathe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us the <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Temper</hi> of Holy <hi>Bernard,</hi> who on the Death of his Brother <hi>Gerard</hi> broke out into that flight:
<q>Lord, Thou haſt given, and Thou haſt taken away; tho' we grieve that Thou haſt Taken away, yet we cannot forget that Thou didſt give him.</q>
His <hi>Character</hi> may Excite us to a ſtrict Examination of our ſelves, whether our Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of ſo great a Bleſſing has been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to our advantages, which hereby have been ſingular; and may lead us to a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Conſideration of that <hi>Awful Account</hi> we have to give up to God of ſo <hi>Rich a Price</hi> we have had in our hands; &amp; how Speechleſs we ſhall be found if at the laſt we appear Strangers to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his <hi>Holineſs.</hi> It may ſerve to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote our Humiliation, and Repentance for our paſt barrenneſs under ſuch Manuring, as Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven has afforded us, by the Care, Wiſdom and Fidelity of This his Servant: It may direct our Endeavours after, and Prayers for a <hi>Succeſſor,</hi> that may Enjoy a double Portion of his Gifts and Graces, to fit him to Stand in the Gap that is made in our Hedge. In a word, it may ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate us to a due Imitation of his Holy Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and to a juſt value for, and holy Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of what of his WORKS are left in our Hands, by which tho' DEAD, He yet Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth aloud to us.</p>

This Knowledge we muſt Endeavour to get, and improve in: which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary both to Truth and Growth in Grace. Without it our Affections are but blind Powers: they may be moved, and made Tumultuous, but not well regulated, and all the Impreſſions made on them will ſoon be Effaced.</p>

                  <p>Let us be careful how we take our State to be <hi>Regenerate</hi> without <hi>Examination</hi>: Too many it is to be feared, think they were Converted at ſuch a Seaſon, when they were under Legal Terrors, and afterward had ſome ſenſible Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation; and they have recourſe to this ever after, without trying themſelves by their After Lives, which have the black Marks of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanctifyed upon them.

                  <p>IN the Concluſion of the former Chapter, our Lord-Redeemer entertains his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples with a <hi>Praediction</hi> of thoſe Deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, that were coming upon the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Nation; In the final Deſtruction of their <hi>City</hi> and <hi>Temple,</hi> their <hi>Polity</hi> and <hi>Worſhip</hi>; in which He would appear in the viſible ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of his Wrath, and the Triumphs of his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:001329_0017_0FB27D9C39E0F888"/>
and Juſtice: and is therefore ſtiled his <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> Upon this Praediction his Diſciples came to Him as He ſat on the Mount of <hi>Olives,</hi> and put two Queries to Him, <hi>viz. When ſhall theſe things be?</hi> i. e When will the final Ruin of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> Commence? The other Enquiry was, <hi>What ſhall be the ſign of thy Coming, and of the End of the World</hi>? This I underſtand to be diſtinct from the former; and to refer to the <hi>Final Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> The reaſon why the Diſciples joyn theſe two Queries together, may be this, <hi>viz.</hi> They had haply Entertained that Miſtake, which prevailed in that day, that the End of the World, or Final Judgment, would either Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chroniſe with, or immediately follow upon, <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalems</hi> Deſtruction. Our Saviour returns an Anſwer to both theſe Queſtions; which tho' not fitted to gratify their Curioſity, yet was wiſely adapted to promote their praeparation for theſe his Awful Appearances. He particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly acquaints them with ſome of the infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Prognoſticks and Fore-runners of his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance in the Clouds of Heaven, to Judge the <hi>Quick</hi> and <hi>Dead.</hi> For I can by no means perſwade my ſelf to ſubſcribe the Opinion of ſome <note n="*" place="margin">

                     </note> Criticks of no common figure in the Learned World, who look upon the whole of our Saviours Diſcourſe in this Chapter, to look no further than the Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi>: But muſt think that a great part of this
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:001329_0018_0FB27D9E493139C8"/>
Diſcourſe has a principal aſpect upon the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Judgment. Now Chriſt applies the Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine of this his Perſonal Appearance to Judge the World, to Engage them to greater diligence and watchfulneſs, in their preparation to meet Him, when He ſhall be revealed from Heaven in flaming fire, and with the Retinue of Migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Angels. This their preparation He further Excites them to, from two Conſiderations, the <hi>Suddenneſs</hi> of his Appearance, and the certain <hi>Bleſſedneſs</hi> of ſuch as ſhall be found diligent and faithful in their Maſters Work at his Coming<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The latter of which Arguments is contained in our Text. The words read, tho' in their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſcope are applicable to all Believers; yet nextly and peculiarly they belong to Chriſt's Faithful Miniſters; who are in an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate ſenſe the Servants of his Houſe, the Stewards of his Family, and the Shepherds of his Flock. In them we may obſerve two prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal parts.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We have the Character of a true Goſpel Miniſter; which is drawn.</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) From his Relation to Chriſt. He is Chriſt's <hi>Servant,</hi> and Chriſt is his Lord. And every Goſpel Miniſter is his Servant, not only by the common profeſſion of Chriſtianity, but ſpecial deſignation; by their particular as well as general Calling.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) From his Work, <hi>i. e.</hi> to <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Feed</hi> Chriſt's Houſhold<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this is Eſſential to the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:001329_0019_0FB27D9FCF1EBE28"/>
of a Steward in a Family, to aſſign to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Servant his Work and Proviſion. He has the Care and Order of the other Servants com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him. The Church is Chriſt's own Houſe, the Houſhold of Faith; and this muſt be cared for: fed with the Word and Bread of Life; govern'd &amp; order'd according to Chriſt's Inſtitutions, who is the Great LORD of the Houſhold.</p>
                  <p n="3">(3.) From thoſe Vertues and Endowments which qualifie him for his Poſt, and which are to be Exerciſed in the diſcharge of the Duties thereof, <hi>viz. Fidelity</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom.</hi> He muſt be a <hi>Faithful</hi> and <hi>Wiſe</hi> Servant; faithful to keep the charge and truſt committed to him; and wiſe to diſcharge it in the beſt manner, ſo as beſt to ſerve the end of it; the Good of Chriſt's Family, and the Honour of the Great Maſter of it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We have the reward of that Servant, who is wiſe and faithful in the Service aſſigned him. He ſhall be <hi>Bleſſed</hi> when his Lord comes; which undoubtedly intends not barely that he ſhall obtain true bleſſedneſs, but an <hi>Eminent degree</hi> thereof, in proportion to his wiſdom and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall not Endeavour to graſp all theſe things into one Doctrine; But ſhall conſider them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly in that order in which they have been obſerved to lie in our Text. So that there are theſe four things to be conſidered.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="5" facs="unknown:001329_0020_0FB27DA179F5D078"/>1. The Relation that a Goſpel Miniſter bears to Chriſt, He is his <hi>Servant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Work incumbent on him, to <hi>Feed</hi> and <hi>Rule</hi> Chriſt's Flock.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Virtues and Endowments that are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the true diſcharge of this Work. <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. The <hi>Diſtinguiſhing</hi> Reward, that ſhall be given unto him, by his Lord at his Coming.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <hi>I.</hi> We are to Conſider the Relation that an Evangelical Paſtor ſtands in to Chriſt: He is the Servant of Chriſt. The Great Doctor of the Gentiles glories in this Relation, and challenges the acknowledgment of it from others, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.1. <hi>Let a man account of us as the Miniſters of Chriſt, &amp; the Stewards of the Myſteries of God.</hi> The Honour of this Relation belongs not only to the Exalted Station of an Apoſtle; but to the meaneſt in the Sacred Function in the Succeſſive Ages of the Church.</p>
                  <p>It muſt be acknowledged that there are ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Wayes in which Men, and other Creatures, may truely come under this Denomination. By <hi>Creation,</hi> all Creatures are his Servants: For He is Lord of Heaven and Earth: He has an unalienable Propriety in, and an abſolute Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preamacy over all Creatures therein, as they are the Works of his hands. Subjection to his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment well becomes the State of the higheſt Order of Created Beings. The bright Angels.
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:001329_0021_0FB27DA3817D4190"/>
of Light, who Excel in Strength, are at his Command, and obey his Will. He ſtands at the Head of the Lower Creation, and leads forth Creatures Animate, &amp; Inanimate to Serve him, at his Pleaſure. The Sun, Moon, and Stars in their Courſes; Stormy Wind, Hail, Snow and Vapour, in their places are under his Command, and fulfill his Will. Thus all men as they are the Creatures of God, are his Servants. He ſpake the Word, and we Started into Being at his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating Call: <hi>He made us, and not we our ſelves; Let us come before the Lord our Maker, and give him the Glory due to his Name.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All profeſſed Chriſtians are his Servants by <hi>External Vocation</hi>; viſible <hi>Dedication,</hi> and ſolemn <hi>Stipulation.</hi> In Baptiſm we are openly conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated to the Service of the Living JEHOVAH: And did ſolemnly renounce all other Service, unleſs in Subordination to Chriſt: And ſo we ſtand obliged to Chriſt as our Maſter by our own free Conſent and Compact; to which Heaven and Earth are Witneſſes.</p>
                  <p>All Believers are the Servants of Chriſt by <hi>Redemption,</hi> and the UNCTION of the HOLY ONE. They are not their Own, for they are bought with a price, their Spirits and Bodies are his Propriety. He has formed them for himſelf; and their Ears are bored to the Poſts of his Door. And theſe are of his Family.</p>
                  <p>But in a more <hi>Appropriate Sence,</hi> Evangelical Paſtors are the Servants of Chriſt's Family, by a peculiar Separation to Special Service;
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:001329_0022_0FB27DAA96DA1900"/>
by which they are diſtinguiſhed not only from the World, but from the reſt of Chriſts own Houſhold. By a ſpecial <hi>Deputation</hi> He has Set them over his houſe; He has given them a Commiſſion to repreſent his Perſon, and Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide under him in the great Affairs of his Viſible Kingdom, Worſhip and Service. To be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated to the Work of the Goſpel is not the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar priviledge of an Apoſtle, but common to every ordinary Goſpel Miniſter. Chriſt has not left the Work of his Houſe in <hi>Common,</hi> but has drawn a Sacred <hi>Incloſure</hi> about it, to keep out vain pretenders, that would take this Honour to themſelves. A <hi>Liberty</hi> of <hi>Propheſying,</hi> as aſſerted by ſome, is indeed but a liberty to overturn the Order of the Goſpel. All are intruders, and guilty of an Invaſion upon the Sacred Office of the Miniſtry, that have not their <hi>Miſſion</hi> from Chriſt. For how ſhall they Preach unleſs they be ſent? And who ſhall ſend them but Chriſt whoſe Ambaſſadors they are? No man taketh this Honour to himſelf, but he that is Called as was <hi>Aaron.</hi> This authority the Apoſtles, who were the firſt Heralds of the Everlaſting Goſpel, were immediately by Chriſt inveſted with: But this is mediately communicated to Chriſts ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Miniſters, as their Succeſſors. And theſe are not <hi>of men,</hi> tho' they are <hi>by men,</hi> by whom they are authoriſed to diſpenſe the Unſearchable riches of Chriſt. Their <hi>Meſſage</hi> they receive from Chriſt, whoſe Meſſengers they are. Their
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:001329_0023_0FB27DAD23CC8530"/>
ſolemn <hi>Charge</hi> is given in his Name, and by his Authority they act. Agreeable hereto the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> tho' appointed by an ordinary Call, are ſaid to be made <hi>Overſeers</hi> of <hi>the Flock</hi> by <hi>the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> the Spirit of Chriſt, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28. And none but ſuch can Adminiſter the Word and Sacraments with Authority, or a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable proſpect of Succeſs. The Service that every Goſpel Miniſter is Engaged in has an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate reſpect to Chriſt: He aſſigns them their Work: Of his Revenue they are Maintained; and to him they muſt finally give up an account. Thus in a peculiar ſence they are the Miniſters of Chriſt; and only the Servants of their People for Chriſts ſake. They are the <hi>Stewards</hi> of his Houſhold; <hi>Labourers</hi> in his Vineyard &amp; Harveſt; Whoſe Province is to Sow, Plant, Cultivate and Manure the Soil of the Church, that Garden of Chriſt. And this their Relation to Chriſt tells us that their <hi>Station</hi> is high and honourable; their <hi>Charge</hi> moſt important; and their <hi>Account</hi> awful: That to contemn, inſult, and outrage their Character, will be interpreted as an inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable Indignity offer'd to Chriſt himſelf; and that their <hi>Maſter will highly reſent it as ſuch.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <hi>II.</hi> In the Second place we are to Conſider the <hi>Work</hi> of Goſpel Miniſters. The relation of Servants neceſſarily infers Work, and Service for their Lord. And the ſpecial Service, which they are called to, is to <hi>Feed, Rule</hi> and <hi>Order Chriſts Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.</hi>
                     <pb n="9" facs="unknown:001329_0024_0FB27DAE0D6F9EF8"/>
They are <hi>Rulers</hi> over his <hi>Houſhold</hi> to give them their <hi>Meat</hi> in due Seaſon. How honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is their Work! How difficult their Poſt, and the Service thereof! The dignity of their Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Employment would well become the Excellency, and its difficulty requires the power, purity, and activity of the Higheſt Angels, that incircle the Throne of God. Their Work con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of two parts, and we may Conſider them diſtinctly.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Work of an Evangelical Miniſter is to <hi>Feed Chriſt's Family.</hi> Chriſt's Flock muſt be fed, and his Houſhold muſt have ſuitable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion made for them. And this by Office be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to Chriſt's Servants, to whom he has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the Word of Reconciliation. Theſe are under the moſt Solemn Obligations, and awful charge to take care of this; as they would not be found Idle Shepherds, Slothful Servants, and Unfaithful Stewards, by their Lord <hi>at His Coming</hi>; and be Animadverted on as ſuch. What Chriſt pathetically inculcates upon <hi>Peter,</hi> has a reſpect to all the Meſſengers of Peace, <hi>John</hi> 21.15, 16, 17. Simon Son of Jonas loveſt thou me more than theſe? — <hi>Feed my Lambs— Feed my Sheep— Feed my Sheep.</hi> The ſame addreſs He makes to every Paſtor with the like Expreſſions of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearment. This therefore is a principal, and eſſential part of their Office Work, to give the other Servants of God's Family their Food.</p>
                  <p>This Food muſt be Spiritual: Such a Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:001329_0025_0FB27DB02409C4E0"/>
as may be a proper Entertainment for the Soul: as may be ſuited to the Nature, Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Spiritual Appetite, and Cravings of an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Spirit, As bodily Food does anſwer the wants of the Body. Proper Food is <hi>Pabulum Vitae.</hi> It is neceſſary to the preſervation, growth and nouriſhment of the outward man: It is ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in its nature and deſign, to confirm and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the ſtrength and health of the Body: To repair the decayes of Nature, and maintain it in a due Temperature and diſpoſition to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the proper functions of life. Now in <hi>Analogy</hi> to this: Spiritual Food is whatever tends to beget, maintain and improve the true ſpiritual life of man. To nouriſh the Soul with Divine Knowledge, which is the proper food of the Underſtanding; to beget and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, to encreaſe and nouriſh the Divine Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Grace and Vertue in the heart; to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the Soul from one degree of Vertue to another; from it's Infant to a more virile State; To reſtore it from it's decayes and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual languiſhments to an athletick and healthy Condition; This is to afford it ſuitable food. And this is the buſineſs of the Stewards of Goſpel Myſteries. Chriſt ſends his Servants on this very Errand to open blind eyes, to ſoften hard Hearts, to awaken ſecure Conſciences, and Edify the Body of Chriſt. And to feed Chriſt's Flock is to inſtruct their ignorance, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten their darkneſs, to nouriſh them with
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:001329_0026_0FB27DB15112BE28"/>
ſpiritual wiſdom and vertue; to uſe proper methods to render their knowledge productive of an Heavenly Converſation, and to turn the principles of Truth into living principles of Action: It is to heal the wounded ſpirit, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort the Diſconſolate, to raiſe up the Dejected, to encourage the Fearful, confirm the Waver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, reduce the Straying, to ſpur up the Loyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and ſtrengthen the Weak, that they may advance to higher degrees of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Life. The Servants of Chriſt cannot indeed by any vertue of their own, or by the proper force of their Diſpenſations convey life and ſtrength to the Soul: <hi>Paul may plant, and Apollos water, but God gives the increaſe</hi>: He bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes Zion's <hi>Proviſion,</hi> and cloaths her <hi>Prieſts</hi> with Salvation. They therefore are ſaid to feed Chriſt's Family, when they uſe the Means Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained for their Spiritual Nouriſhment. Now there are ſeveral Duties, in the diſcharge where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, this food and nouriſhment is to be afforded to a People.</p>
                  <p>To this end the Word of Truth muſt be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed, and applyed. In which the myſterious methods of <hi>Divine Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> muſt be diſplay'd, and unfolded: By this the knowledge of God and Chriſt is to be propagated, whom to know is Life Eternal. The <hi>Preaching of the Goſpel</hi> is a wiſe and condeſcending method in which Chriſt is pleaſed to carry on a Treaty of Peace with Rebel Sinners. It is a proper
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:001329_0027_0FB27DB8373ADAE0"/>
Remedy for the ſpiritual ignorance and blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the forgetfulneſs and inconſiderateneſs of men. It is admirably adapted to rouze the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure and ſtupid out of their Spiritual Lethargy; to convince them of their ſin and miſery; to turn them from the Error of their wayes, and transform them into the Image of Divine Purity. It is fitted to build up Saints in Faith, Holineſs and Comfort. Agreeably we have this Enco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mium given of this Word of Grace, the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation whereof is committed to the Goſpel Miniſtry: 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15, 16. It is able to make Wiſe to Salvation: <hi>It is profitable for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Correction, for Inſtruction in Righteouſneſs.</hi> This is the <note n="(a)" place="bottom">1 Cor. 4.15.</note> good Seed by which Sinners are begotten, and tranſlated into the Kingdom of Light and Grace. By this Saints are <note n="(b)" place="bottom">1 Pet. 2.2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed, and made to thrive in all the diſpoſitions of Holineſs. In this the Wells of Salvation are open'd, whence the diſconſolate may draw Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with Joy. And in the right diſpenſation of this the Servants of Chriſt are helpers of the Believers Joy <note n="(c)" place="bottom">2 Cor. 1.24.</note>. This Word they are oblig'd to diſpenſe as they have Opportunity in their Private Applications to their People; and in the Publick Service of Gods houſe.</p>
                  <p>Again, they are to Feed the Houſhold of Chriſt by a due Adminiſtration of the <hi>Seals</hi> of
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:001329_0028_0FB27DBA203214A8"/>
the <hi>Covenant,</hi> the <hi>Sacraments</hi> of BAPTISM and the LORD's SUPPER.</p>
                  <p>They are Authorized to <hi>Baptize: Mat.</hi> 28.19. By <hi>Baptiſm</hi> they Enroll Souls in the Number of Chriſts Servants, and acknowledge them as the viſible Subjects of his Kingdom. Hereby they bring them under the Wings and Bonds of the Covenant; under the Care and Government of Gods Family; and intitule them to the proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Domeſticks.</p>
                  <p>By a due Adminiſtration alſo of the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> theſe Shepherds are to Feed the <hi>Flock</hi> of Chriſt. Herein Chriſt himſelf is ſet forth as the proper <hi>Food</hi> of Souls. <hi>His Fleſh is Meat indeed, &amp; his Blood is Drink indeed</hi>; &amp; theſe are here under the ſenſible and lively Symbols of Bread &amp; Wine, Exhibited for the nouriſhment of Grace. Chriſt's Miniſters are to prepare their People for this Spiritual Banquet; lead them to it, that there they may be Royally Entertained with the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Manna, the Bread of Angels; which tho' not ſuited to the Guſt of a Carnal Appetite; yet affords Superiour Satisfaction to the Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Senſes of the Divine Nature in the renew'd; and it is Wiſely deſigned by it's Author to Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, Strengthen, and Perfect the Divine Life. And hereby we are to be ſuſtained in our paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage thro' this Wilderneſs, till we ſhall arrive ſafe at the good Land of Promiſe.</p>
                  <p>Again, Miniſters muſt feed their People by
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:001329_0029_0FB27DBB82B40828"/>
their <hi>Prayers,</hi> both <hi>Publick</hi> and <hi>Private.</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">A Miniſter will do more good, ſayes <hi>Auſtin, Pietate Orationis, quam facultate dicendi.</hi>
                     </note> By their private and ſecret <hi>addreſſes</hi> to God for their Charge, and the ſucceſs of their work. For this they muſt daily bend their Knees before the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and in an holy agony, wreſtle with God to obtain the beſt of Bleſſings for themſelves, and for their Flock.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jacob's</hi> Ladder on which Angels were ſeen to aſcend and deſcend, is thought to be a lively Emblem of a Goſpel Miniſter; who is firſt to aſcend to Heaven in holy Meditation &amp; Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; and then to deſcend in holy Diſpenſations to his people. In this way they are to ſtorm Heaven, and with holy violence wreſt down the Bleſſing; give God no Reſt till he comes and breathes his Holy Spirit upon them.</p>
                  <p>Miniſters are alſo to nouriſh their People by their <hi>Publick Prayers.</hi> But then they muſt ſee that they be proper for nouriſhment: Not dark, myſterious, and unintelligible diſcourſes; but proper addreſſes to Heaven, ſuitable to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, and Purity of the Preſence they approach; and the ſtate, wants and circumſtances of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Souls, whoſe Caſe they are to carry be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Throne of Grace. Their Prayers muſt not be <hi>Doctrinal,</hi> but <hi>Devotional</hi>: Thus there muſt be a care that they do not give their people
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:001329_0030_0FB27DBE2092C690"/>
                     <hi>Stones</hi> inſtead of <hi>Bread.</hi> And by theſe well or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd Prayers, they will afford true food to Souls. And not only as theſe Prayers are Means Sanctify'd, and approved to procure the Dews of Divine Grace: But alſo as they have a natural tendency to refreſh and cheriſh the Souls of Gods People. Theſe have a proper aptitude to inkindle Divine Breathings in their hearts; to inſpire them with the true ſpirit of Devotion, to refine and purifie their carnal af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, to help them to ſome ſpiritual views of the beauty and excellency of Chriſt, and thereby to cheriſh the vital flame of Grace, and make it burn with greater heat and light. The experience of the Faithful will ſet a ſeal to this; that their hearts have been many times by the Prayers of their Paſtors, rapt up to Heaven in Holy ardours, diſſolved in love; their Souls pleaſed, and profited to no common degree.</p>
                  <p>In fine, they are to feed them by their <hi>Good Example.</hi>

The want of this in Miniſters has a fatal tendency to deſtroy Souls; to harden the prophane and diſſolute, to make them think all Religion to be no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then a cheat and fiction; and it tends to
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:001329_0031_0FB27DC3C41F63B0"/>
make the more ſerious to ſtumble, and deſpiſe the Altar of the Lord. The wicked Lives of ſuch will read loud Lectures of Atheiſm and Irreligion; while in their Diſcourſes they talk like Angels of Light. And many will give more credit to the Life they live, than to the Doctrine they Preach. Their good Example will be many ways beneficial: This will inform others in their duty, in their ſpiritual danger, and proper remedy: and Examples are the moſt eaſie and compendious way of Inſtruction: This will afford motive and incentive to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage and inflame perſons to preſs forward in the Service of God, and purſuit of the Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Prize. Hence it is given as the property of the good Shepherd, <hi>that He goes before the Sheep. Joh.</hi> 10.4. They muſt labour to go before them in all parts of the Chriſtian Life, and thereby recommend it to their choice and practice, they muſt be, as far as may be, inſtances of the comforts and joyes of Religion. Thus they are in all things to imitate the Great Shepherd of the Sheep; and this will be a Noble and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine way of feeding the Flock of Chriſt. Theſe are the ſeveral ways in which the Servants of Chriſt are to feed his Houſhold; and if they neglect it, they muſt do it at their <hi>Utmoſt Peril,</hi> and know they muſt anſwer for it at the <hi>Grand Viſitation</hi> of the <hi>Great Shepherd</hi> and <hi>Biſhop of Souls,</hi> which is expected.</p>

                     <pb n="17" facs="unknown:001329_0032_0FB27DC542AFBE80"/>2. We muſt conſider the other part of their work: Which is to <hi>Rule, Inſpect</hi> and <hi>Order</hi> the <hi>Houſhold.</hi> As the Church is a Society diſtinct from the World, ſo it muſt be under a diſtinct Polity. A Government ſuitable to it's Nature, Conſtitution, &amp; End, was undoubtedly appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for it. A Society without Government will be but an Epheſian Rout. There can be no Unity or Harmony between the parts of a Body Politick, if all its Members are in a State of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality,</hi> and of the ſame <hi>Uſe</hi> &amp; <hi>Service</hi>; But Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion &amp; Diſorder will devour all that is good &amp; beautiful without a Miraculous Interpoſition of Heaven. And this can on no terms be allow'd to be the State of the Church; that <hi>Houſe</hi> and <hi>Temple</hi> of the <hi>Living God;</hi> who is a God not of <hi>Confuſion</hi> but of <hi>Order.</hi> Now this Government lyes prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily upon the Shoulders of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; who is <hi>King of Zion,</hi> and Head of his Church. By his governing Providence he preſerves and defends it againſt all the aſſaults of the combined force and malice of Earth &amp; Hell. He has fixed it on a Rock, and the Gates of Hell ſhall never move it. By the Secret Power of his Word, and the unconquerable influence of his Spirit He rules in the Hearts of his People. And as the Great Law-giver of his Church. He has or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained <hi>Laws, Orders, Ordinances, Sacraments</hi> and <hi>Cenſures.</hi> All which are appointed for the due regulation of this Special Society. He does not Adminiſter theſe in his own Perſon, for He is long

ſince with drawn as to Bodily Preſence from his Militant Flock; and appears at the head of his Triumphant People in Glory: And has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Officers, who, during his abſence, are to act in his Name, and to ſee that his Laws, and Orders, made for the Government of his Viſible Kingdom, be obſerved and executed; and the charge of theſe is committed to the Evangelical Paſtors. I ſhall not here diſpute who are the <hi>Firſt Recipients</hi> of the <hi>Keyes</hi> of Chriſt's Kingdom. Thus much ſeems evident beyond contradiction, that it belongs to the Miniſters by <hi>Office</hi> to Exert this Power; that by their hands the <hi>Keyes</hi> are to be turned both in <hi>Opening</hi> and <hi>Shutting</hi> the Kingdom of Heaven; that they act herein under Chriſt, by a power derived from him, what ſubordinate Helps to them, or what concurrence ſoever of others with them, in the Exerciſe of this power, may be thought requiſite. The Paſtor is therefore in our Text ſtyled a Ruler over Chriſt's Houſhold: And ſubmiſſion to Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Guides as ſuch, is an indiſpenſible duty. Heb. 13.17. <hi>Obey them that Rule over you in the Lord; who watch for Souls, as thoſe that muſt give an account.</hi> Their Power is not <hi>Secular</hi> but <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual.</hi> The Rods, Axes and Swords of Civil Government, are not the <hi>Inſtruments</hi> of their <hi>Government.</hi> Their <note n="(a)" place="bottom">2 Cor. 10.4.</note> Weapons are not <hi>Carnal,</hi>

Now this Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity obliges, and diſpoſes to the obſervation of ſuch Rules as theſe, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Fidelity</hi> obliges the Goſpel Miniſter to make the <hi>Honour of Chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>good of Souls,</hi> the <hi>governing deſign</hi> of his Miniſtry: The End is the Rule to direct our judgment and choice of means: A corrupt deſign in Spiritual Guides will corrupt their whole Miniſtry; For that will be correſpondent to that which is their primary intention, and laſt deſign in their work. If a Miniſter be under the governing influence of a worldly or ambitious ſpirit, all his admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations will, in probability, be ſuited to the depraved inclinations of that evil ſpirit: This will prophane his moſt ſolemn and ſacred performances. There will be infinite hazard that his Doctrine, his Converſation, and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline be all proſtituted to baſe ſelfiſh deſigns; and that the whole of his Miniſterial Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations be calculated to the Meridian of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour or Gain; which he makes his ruling In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts.
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:001329_0036_0FB27DD085F6DB00"/>
If it will ſerve this worldly deſign, he will appear like an Angel of Light, all flame and zeal in the Cauſe of God; he will ſpeak like an Apoſtle with <hi>Fiery Tongues,</hi> as if he had been filled with the Holy Ghoſt: But if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother ſcene be open'd; and he perceive that zeal for the purity of Goſpel Truth, for the chaſtity of Divine Worſhip, and beauty of Holineſs, will not advance, but contradict his carnal deſigns; no wonder if we ſhould ſee his zeal chill'd, and a time-ſerving indifferency take its place, and his courage wholly Exſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by a pretended Diſcretion. There will be great danger that ſuch will diſguiſe Truth, varniſh over Error, and rebate the edge of the Word, that <hi>Sword</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> leſt preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous haughty Sinners be too deeply wounded. There is nothing tends more to corrupt the Fidelity of Miniſters, than falſe ends; for this will be a falſe byaſs to diſorder them in their whole Walk: Hence they are ſolemnly charged to take the overſight of Chriſt's Flock, not for <hi>Filthy lucre:</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.3. Such <hi>Buyers</hi> and <hi>Sellers</hi> Chriſt will ere long come and Whip out of his Temple. Neither muſt their own Applauſe and Repute govern them. It was part of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> Litany, for the Church, <hi>A Doctore Glorio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,</hi> Good Lord deliver us. It was the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles profeſſion, that <hi>of men</hi> they ſought not <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.6. And it was the high Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation given by <hi>Paul</hi> of <hi>Timothy,</hi> Phil. 2.20, 21.

                     <hi>I have no man like-minded, who will naturally care for your ſtate. For all ſeek their own, and not the things that are Jeſus Chriſts.</hi> Chriſt's Servants if faithful, muſt be inſpired with purity of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention in their Diſpenſation of the Means of Grace: They muſt imitate the good example of the ancient Stewards of the Myſteries of God; who could ſay, as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.5. <hi>We preach not our ſelves,</hi> but <hi>Jeſus Chriſt the Lord,</hi> and <hi>our ſelves</hi> your <hi>Servants for Chriſts ſake.</hi> Thus Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity requires that they have the Honour of God, and the Eternal Salvation of Souls, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in their <hi>Laſt View</hi>; and then all their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours will be levelled to promote theſe bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed deſigns: and this will not permit them to debaſe their <hi>Heavenly Calling</hi> to mean, earthly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns. If they be faithful, they will be jealous for the Glory of Chriſt; &amp; thirſt after Souls,<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Gal. 4.19.</note> travail in birth with them till Chriſt be formed in them: They will Preach, Pray, Reprove, Exhort, and Perſwade, as thoſe that have a juſt ſence of the value of Souls, and of that weight of ſin and miſery that lies upon them; and as reſolved to do all that they can to reſcue them from Everlaſting Burnings, and lead them to the Kingdom of Unperiſhing Glory. Thus with the Flames of Zeal and Love, and with the ſtrength of unbroken reſolution, they muſt proſecute their Maſters Work; that they may

ſave Sinners from Death, enlarge the Kingdom, and extend the Empire of Chriſt over the loſt Rebel Sons of <hi>Adam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Fidelity</hi> requires the Servants of Chriſt to furniſh their own minds with a ſuitable mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Divine Knowledge. <note n="(a)" place="bottom">Mal. 2.7.</note> 
                     <hi>The Prieſts lips are to preſerve knowledge,</hi> and we <hi>muſt ask the law at his mouth.</hi> Miniſters are appointed Guides to direct loſt Souls to Glory: but if the blind lead the blind, the iſſue will be unſafe; they may both expect to fall into the pit of Everlaſting Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. An Ignorant Miniſter cannot be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: A Sun without Light, is not a greater So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laeciſm, than ſuch an one: He muſt know every part of his duty, otherwiſe He can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do it faithfully. Evangelical Paſtors are to be <hi>Ready Scribes,</hi> well inſtructed for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven; they are to be like the good <hi>Houſholder</hi> that brings out of his treaſure things new and old. <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.52. It is not a ſmall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of knowledge that will be ſufficient to quality a perſon for the faithful diſcharge of the Miniſterial Office. There muſt be a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable acquaintance with the Learned Tongues, and Liberal Arts, which are ſubſervient to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity: And a good Divine will make it his great care to tranſfer the ſpoils of other Arts, to the Service of the Temple. It was a Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Age when there was reaſon of that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint,

It was a Comprehenſive Petition which was once made by a Grave Divine, when taking his farewell, for his bereav'd Flock, <hi>viz.</hi> That God would not leave them under the influence of a <hi>Dark Lanthorn,</hi> nor yet under the falſe light of an <hi>Erratick Fire;</hi> which would bewilder them in the by-paths of ſimplicity.

                  <p>This Knowledge muſt be attained in an ordinary way, by much Study, Meditation and Prayer: For we are not born with it: Nor in this Age can we expect to be qualify'd for this Work by a Miraculous <hi>Deſcent</hi> of the HOLY GHOST in Tongues of fire, which was the priviledge of the Apoſtles on the Day of <hi>Pentecoſt.</hi> We may not without daring preſumption depend on <hi>Extraordinary Viſions,</hi> nor <hi>Immediate Inſpiration;</hi> but on the bleſſing of God on our Endeavours. This Faithfulneſs muſt govern us in our Study, as well as in the Pulpit. And the care any take to accompliſh themſelves with knowledge to an uncommon degree, is to be eſteemed true fidelity to thoſe under their Paſtoral Care;
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:001329_0040_0FB27DD98AD66230"/>
whoſe Service they are thus preparing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for. All Miniſters ſhould labour to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Character of <hi>Apollos,</hi> a man <hi>Eloquent,</hi> and <hi>mighty</hi> in the Scriptures: They ſhould fear to run like <hi>Ahimaaz,</hi> on a Meſſage, without ſuitable tidings to carry to a people.

                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Fidelity</hi> requires that they keep not back any part of the <hi>Counſel of God</hi> from their Flock. A Steward cannot be faithful, if he with-hold any part of that portion, which belongs to the Servants of the Family: What Chriſt has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for them, they muſt give them in due ſeaſon. The Holy Scriptures are a Sacred Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitory of Divine Truths; they are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive of all Articles of Faith, and Rules of Duty; and theſe muſt be open'd. The Truth as it is in JESUS, is perfective of the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Divine Knowledge, and Directive of the Chriſtians practice: And no eſſential part of this can be concealed, without the guilt of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge</hi> to God, and <hi>Injuſtice</hi> to the Souls of men; and both will infer unfaithfulneſs. The great deſign of Divine Revelation, is to retrieve Sinners from their ſtate of ſin and miſery, and advance them to a ſtate of Holineſs, and compleat Bleſſedneſs: The whole Counſel of God is of Service to carry on this deſign of Grace.</p>

                     <pb n="26" facs="unknown:001329_0041_0FB27DDB0F830220"/>It is to this end requiſite that men be informed what was that ſtate of Honour, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and Perfection, in which Man was at firſt Created; How he was placed at the Head of the Viſible Creation as Lord of the Lower World; How bright with the Beauty of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Glory of the Divine Image, and what happineſs he ſtood a Candidate for.

Thus Fidelity requires that Articles of Faith, and Rules of Life, Promiſes and Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, be diſpenſed according to Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation: And this gave the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in making his Appeal to thoſe that had been under his Tuition, and to take his Leave of them with this ſolemn addreſs. <hi>Ye know—How I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you; wherefore I take you to record this day, that I am</hi> PURE <hi>from the</hi> BLOOD <hi>of all men; for I have not ſhunned to declare unto you all the</hi> COUNSEL <hi>of God,</hi> Acts 20.20. and 26, 27.</p>

Their Doctrine muſt contain nothing as Divine, but what can be proved, either by Expreſs Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or by juſt and neceſſary Conſequence there-from. They muſt not make more <hi>Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Faith,</hi> nor <hi>Rules of Duty,</hi> than the Goſpel has made: And what they deliver muſt be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the ſame degree of Certainty, that they ſtand in the Oracles of Heaven: Doubtful things muſt be delivered only as Doubtful; Certain, as Undoubted: What are doubtfully true, or undoubtedly falſe, will but ill become the Mouth of an Ambaſſador of the God of Truth.

World and Devil are joyned in a curſed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cert to ruine their work, and to deface all good impreſſions that at any time are made upon the hearts of their People: And their diligence is equal to their policy and malignity in counter-working Chriſt's Labourers. Worldly cares and carnal pleaſures eaſily divert the thoughts of the awakened Soul, and ſo damp and ſtifle the Convictions, with great difficulty and labour wrought within them: Satan like a <hi>Bird</hi> of <hi>Prey</hi> watches the ſeed of the Word as ſoon as ſown, and picks it up, that it may not take root; and is ready to ſow tares in the room of good Seed. The greateſt diligence and watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is neceſſary to prevent his ill deſigns. By ſloth and negligence there is advantage given to the Evil One: while the Labourer <hi>ſlept, the Enemy ſoweth Tares,</hi> Mat. 13.25. When a Holy Spark is ſtruck into the Soul, either by publick or private addreſſes; and ſeems to have taken hold, how ſoon is it quenched? Good reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are eaſily dampt; devout deſires and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections chill'd; and the Heart that ſeem'd to melt and flow at the Preſence of God in an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, is often by the next Ordinance grown as hard as the adamant: And thus the work of Chriſt's Miniſters is often undone, nay, goes backward, rather than forward.

the work is like to be left undone, unleſs God's Servants are patient, unwearied, &amp; faint not in their labours. Hence the Apoſtle with the greateſt ſolemnity, and authority lays this charge upon them, 2 Tim. 4.1, 2. <hi>I charge thee before the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who ſhall judge the Quick and Dead at his Appearance and Kingdom, Preach the Word, be inſtant in ſeaſon, and out of ſeaſon, reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long-ſuffering and doctrine.</hi> This diligence and application muſt be exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in their preparations for their publick Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations; without which they can't well expect to proſper.

I ſhall only hint
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:001329_0054_0FB27E009490B5A0"/>
at a few <hi>Cardinal points,</hi> to which Miniſterial Prudence muſt always have reſpect, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Miniſterial Wiſdom</hi> muſt be Exerciſed in a ſuitable Care and Caution not to <hi>Expoſe</hi> their <hi>Character</hi> to Contempt. There is a juſt <hi>Reverence</hi> due to the Character of God's Ambaſſadors, which cannot be loſt without Evident dammage to their Maſters Service. Few People are ſo <hi>Metaphyſical</hi> as to abſtract the <hi>Calling</hi> from the <hi>Perſon:</hi> to contemn the Perſon of a Miniſter &amp; yet reverence his Office. It muſt be allowed therefore as a ſtanding Maxim of Wiſdom, that Miniſters muſt be careful to Maintain that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, which is due to them for their Work ſake. Indeed many times Vile and Profligate men will load them with contempt tho they are never ſo circumſpect: Their very Character is enough to Expoſe them to the ſcorn and banter of ſome, whoſe Vices have ſunk them below the vileſt parts of the Creation, who are loſt to all ſenſe of what is virtuous, good and ſacred<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But they muſt be careful not to deſerve ſuch rude treatment. That by their fooliſh anguard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Converſation, they do not invite the Profane to ridicule and inſult them. And it muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged that they are the Criminal Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions too often of that Contempt and Indignity which is caſt on them. Hence we have that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice given to <hi>Titus,</hi> and to every Miniſter in him, Tit. 2.15. <hi>Let no man deſpiſe thee.</hi> Which Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept muſt be obſerved by avoiding every thing
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:001329_0055_0FB27E0218A5FF60"/>
that will make them appear <hi>Vile, Mean</hi> &amp; <hi>Little</hi> in the eye of the World. And this Prudence is to be ſeen in.</p>
                  <p>To this End Prudence directs and requires Miniſters to avoid <hi>Vice</hi> and <hi>Immorality.</hi> For this will wound the beſt Reputation, and Expoſe to Contempt. And renders theſe Servants of God in a peculiar manner <hi>Vile.</hi> Thus <hi>Eli</hi>'s Sons ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred themſelves <hi>Vile.</hi> This will darken the LIGHTS of the World; and render the SALT of the Earth inſipid; and no Wonder then they are of no Account.</p>
                  <p>To this End they muſt take heed of <hi>Ignorance.</hi> Knowledge is a good Medium to preſeve their Character; but Ignorance will render them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible in the Eyes of Good and Bad. This may ſometimes be from want of Natural Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and the defects of Nature are not to be <hi>Expoſed,</hi> but <hi>Pitied.</hi> But this defect ſhould keep them from invading that Office, where Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is neceſſary; and Ignorance challenges Contempt, being Expoſed to open view. There is good inſtruction in that Admonition that dropt from a Witty Pen,
<q>If Owls would not be hooted at, let them keep cloſe within the Tree, and not Perch upon the upper bows.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, To this End Wiſdom directs to avoid every thing that will argue a <hi>Servility</hi> of <hi>Temper</hi>: All Sordid Complyances with men of Corrupt Affections. They muſt take heed not to uſe any mean Acts of flattery to inſinuate themſelves into
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:001329_0056_0FB27E0442503960"/>
the favour of Men. They muſt not ſtoop to any thing below the Dignity of their Station, to gain the Eſteem of the World. All Methods of <hi>Diſſimulation</hi> and <hi>Flattery</hi> argue a mean and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Spirit, which is the proper object of Contempt. Thus they muſt Watch againſt every thing that is contrary to true <hi>Generoſity,</hi> or <hi>Greatneſs</hi> of Soul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which ſhould appear in their whole Deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and which will make them <hi>Venerable</hi> in the Eyes of the World. They muſt avoid all Actions that will argue them to be under the influence of <hi>Narrow</hi> and <hi>Stingy Principles.</hi> Fear and Cowardiſe, an immoderate Opinion of, and Fondneſs for the Pomp and Grandeur of the World; Too nice a regard to circumſtances, &amp; Shadows, and a diſregard of Subſtantial Realities, will Tarniſh the Glory of the brighteſt Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, and invite the Contempt due to a <hi>Little</hi> and <hi>Mean</hi> Soul.</p>
                  <p>To this End they muſt be careful not to go to the <hi>Utmoſt Limits</hi> of what is Lawful. What others may do without Scandal and Reproach, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters many times may not without <hi>Expoſing their Character.</hi> Thus alſo all affectation, affected <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> Modes of Speech, Geſture, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And a Spirit of Popularity are to be ſhun'd, if they would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Rules of true Prudence: For all theſe debaſe the <hi>High Calling</hi> of the Miniſtry, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy that Reſpect and Reverence, which is requiſite to a ſuccesful diſcharge of their Office.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="42" facs="unknown:001329_0057_0FB27E0B50A66BB0"/>2. Prudence muſt be Exerciſed in forming a <hi>Right Judgment</hi> of <hi>Things, Perſons,</hi> and <hi>Seaſons,</hi> for the more Succesful diſcharge of the ſeveral parts of their Truſt. There is a great variety of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances which may have an aſpect upon each of theſe, which muſt be underſtood in order to our carrying on our Work to the beſt advantage.</p>
                  <p>There muſt be a right Judgment of <hi>Actions and Things.</hi> The Apoſtle layes it down as a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary point of true Knowledge and Judgment to <hi>Approve the things that are Excellent,</hi> or which differ, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.10. There is a vaſt difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween things, and without the knowledge here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we can never make a Wiſe choice, which ſhould be made according to the value, and rate that things bear. Some things are <hi>Eſſential</hi> and <hi>Fundamental,</hi> without which neither Grace here, nor Glory hereafter can be Expected; other things are <hi>Circumſtantial</hi>: Some things are Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties by <hi>Divine Inſtitution,</hi> other things are ſo on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from <hi>Principles</hi> of <hi>meer Prudence</hi>: Some things are the <hi>Weightier Matters of the Law,</hi> other things are but as the <hi>Tithings of Mint &amp; Cummin</hi>: Some are <hi>Gnaws,</hi> others <hi>Camels</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Some are <hi>Moats,</hi> and others <hi>Beams,</hi> as our Saviour calls them: Some are indiſpenſibly <hi>Neceſſary,</hi> other things are <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient Pro hic ad nunc.</hi> And moſt frequently the Moral denomination of Actions, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally as to their degree, does depend upon cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, which are Variable. Now Wiſdom muſt diſcern between theſe, and the judgment
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:001329_0058_0FB27E0DC1343A40"/>
muſt conclude and determine accordingly. For things muſt be preſſed, inſiſted on in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to their neceſſity and excellency. The want of Prudence to make this judgment, is many times highly prejudicial to the Work of the Miniſtry.</p>
                  <p>Again, there muſt be a right judgment of <hi>Perſons.</hi> Without this they can never divide e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one his <hi>Portion</hi> aright. All <hi>reſpect to Perſons</hi> is not a <hi>Criminal Partiality</hi>; but there is a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of <hi>Perſons,</hi> and a diſtinguiſhing regard to them, which will argue no common Wiſdom in the diſcharge of their Paſtoral Care. There is a great difference in the <hi>Tempers</hi> of <hi>Perſons</hi> to be treated with; nay a great variety is obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the <hi>Frames</hi> and <hi>Diſpoſitions</hi> of the ſame Perſon at different Seaſons. That addreſs that may be ſuitable to Melt one, may Exaſperate another; that, which may be fit to <hi>Gain</hi> a man at one time, may have a tendency to <hi>Alienate</hi> him at another, and to fill him with prejudice againſt the Truth. Every man has ſome <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> that renders him <hi>Acceſſable,</hi> and capable of perſwaſion, which if underſtood and wiſely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed would afford an happy proſpect of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. And tho' Religion will not allow Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to gratify the Vitious humours of men, yet Wiſdom requires that care be taken to improve their tempers to the beſt advantage, to recover them from the Error of their Wayes. Wiſdom requires a <hi>Diſtinction</hi> to be made between theſe
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:001329_0059_0FB27E0EC7E81028"/>
that are of a different <hi>Growth and Improvement</hi> in the School of Chriſt. <note n="(a)" place="bottom">Heb. 5.12.</note> Some are <hi>Children</hi> and they muſt be fed with <hi>Milk</hi>; Some are <hi>Strong Men,</hi> and they can bear Strong <hi>Meat.</hi>

                  <p>There is a difference to be obſerved between the <hi>Civil Characters</hi> of men, which Miniſterial Wiſdom directs to a due care not to make a breach upon in treating with them. They are not to be ſoothed up in any Evil wayes; Sin muſt not be ſuffer'd to ly upon theſe; the Rich and High are to be charged in the Name of Chriſt to perform the Duties, and ſhun the Sins, of their Station; their Sins are to be reproved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but Prudence directs that all this be done in a way conſiſtent with that diſtinction that Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence has made. <hi>Nathan</hi> in reproving <hi>David</hi> has Set Miniſters a Pattern to Write after. Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors muſt not be inſulted, nor expoſed to the
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:001329_0060_0FB27E111FE28D48"/>
Contempt of thoſe that are under them: The reproofs given them muſt not be <hi>Satyr</hi> which will Sting, but ſuch Wiſe <hi>Remonſtrance</hi> of their reproveable Actions, as ſhall at once convince of their own Error, and the reſpect and love of him that makes it.</p>
                  <p>Again, Wiſdom requires a right <hi>Diſcerning</hi> of <hi>Times,</hi> and to act according to a true judgment of them. It is the Character of the Wiſe man, <hi>That his heart diſcerneth time and judgment,</hi> Eccleſ. 8.5. One ſeaſon may afford an happy Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of favourable Circumſtances, which may promiſe Chriſt's Miniſters greater ſucceſs in one part of their work, than another ſeaſon may. Now a <hi>Word ſpoken in ſeaſon</hi> has its peculiar <hi>beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> and <hi>advantage.</hi> Miniſters are not to be <hi>Time-ſervers</hi> to promote their own ſecular deſigns; but they muſt be <hi>Time-ſervers</hi> in ſuiting their Diſpenſations to the advantages that every ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon may peculiarly afford them to do good to Souls. A word ſeaſonable at one time may not be ſo at another. Providences which are vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, call for that at one time, which they do not at another. And Wiſdom obliges to a right Conſideration, and Application proper to a day of Adverſity, and to what is proper for a day of Proſperity. There are <hi>Truths of the day</hi> to be open'd and defended; <hi>Errors of the day</hi> to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected and confuted; <hi>Sins of the day</hi> to be Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed againſt. And Prudence directs the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God to a regard to theſe. There are
<pb n="46"

<pb n="47" facs="unknown:001329_0062_0FB27E1641AEDCC8"/>
is a fire indeed, but an unhallowed one, not kindled at Gods Altar, that neither came from Heaven, nor aſcends thither. It is therefore requiſite that this affection be under an holy Goverment; which muſt be managed by that true wiſdom <hi>that comes from Above.</hi> Prudence muſt direct it to a <hi>Right Object</hi>; for without that it will be a zeal not according to knowledge: the matter of it muſt be good; it muſt be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced upon true <hi>Catholick Chriſtianity</hi>; and not on the <hi>Religion of a Party.</hi> It muſt be founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on right and durable <hi>Principles,</hi> which right Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and the Holy Word of God will juſtifie; and not built upon unaccountable <hi>Impulſes,</hi> nor deſigned to ſerve the Intereſts of any particular party; <hi>Prudence here is profitable to direct.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, Wiſdom will ſee that it be exerciſed in ways conſiſtent with Charity and Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Compaſſion; and not with the corrupt fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of wrath and bitterneſs to the perſons of any. It muſt alſo <hi>Regulate the Meaſure</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of this affection. It muſt take care that it be only in proportion to the value and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the thing, about which zeal is exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. It muſt not with the ſame heat be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed about <hi>Modes</hi> and diſputable <hi>Rites,</hi> as about the <hi>Eſſentials</hi> of our <hi>Chriſtian Faith,</hi> and <hi>Practice.</hi> The ſame degree of zeal is not due to Tithing Anniſe, Mint and Cummin, as to Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Mercy and Peace, which are the weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier matters of the Law; and the very vitals of
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:001329_0063_0FB27E1D211FC838"/>
and undefiled Religion. Herein therefore Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom teaches them to make a difference in the expreſſions of their zeal; and not to purſue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing with equal heat, earneſtneſs and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. And this zeal, thus attemper'd and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned to the weight of objects, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to theſe rules directed by Prudence, will help Chriſt's Ambaſſadors to carry on the <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Peace</hi> with Sinners to advantage.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Prudence</hi> is to direct them in the right ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of their <hi>addreſſes</hi> to men. And there is a great degree of Prudence neceſſary to the right ordering of the Publick Diſcourſes of Chriſt's Meſſengers: That they may know <hi>what to ſay,</hi> and <hi>what not</hi>; to determine in what <hi>Order, Method</hi> and <hi>Manner</hi> to treat of Divine Truths, that they may have the beſt influence upon their <hi>Audience.</hi> The Underſtanding is the <hi>Leading Faculty</hi> in the Soul, under the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of its Light and Conduct the Will, Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and all the executive powers are to be exerciſed. Hence Religion muſt firſt in order of nature have poſſeſſion of this power; and conſequently this Faculty muſt be firſt informed, and Wiſdom will direct the Servants of God, like wiſe <hi>Maſter Builders</hi> to lay here the Foundation of true Divine Knowledge.</p>
                  <p>It will alſo inſtruct what things are to be taught in the <hi>Firſt Place,</hi> and what <hi>Principally</hi> to be inſiſted on, with greateſt frequency and inculcation. It muſt direct in the <hi>Choice of
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:001329_0064_0FB27E1F457EEFC8"/>
Subjects ſuitable to the ſtate and neceſſities of a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wiſdom muſt teach alſo in what <hi>Manner</hi> the <hi>Truths</hi> and <hi>Laws of Heaven</hi> are to be promulga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. That they be diſpenſed with <hi>Gravity,</hi> without <hi>Affectation;</hi> with <hi>Zeal</hi> and <hi>Courage</hi> without <hi>Temerity;</hi> with <hi>Authority</hi> without <hi>Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation;</hi> with <hi>Tenderneſs</hi> and <hi>Affection</hi> without the <hi>Weakneſs</hi> of humane Paſſion. It muſt direct in the <hi>Dreſs</hi> and <hi>Language</hi> of their Diſcourſes. This muſt be <hi>Intelligible, Pertinent,</hi> neither <hi>too La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured</hi> nor too <hi>Negligent,</hi> moſt expreſſive of the notions to be communicated, and free from that <hi>Pomp of Words</hi> that will obſcure the Matter diſcourſed of: this latter muſt be avoided, left there be reaſon to ſay of a Diſcourſe, as the Philoſopher did of a Tragedy: <hi>It was a good One, if a man could have ſeen it for words.</hi> And as to the <hi>Language of Diſcourſes,</hi> a difference muſt be allow'd, and is proper on ſeveral accounts: One Subject will allow greater Ornament of Language without any oſtentation, than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; an Addreſs to the Affections will admit that Language which may not be ſo proper when the Underſtanding for its information is immediately apply'd to; there is a difference here alſo to be allowed between one Auditory and another; between common Diſcourſes, and ſuch as are made on ſome ſpecial Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and there is a difference between the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and Acquired Gifts of Preachers, ſome
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:001329_0065_0FB27E2246401130"/>
being able to ſpeak with greater <hi>Strength,</hi> others with more of <hi>Ornament</hi> and <hi>Politeneſs.</hi> Now Wiſdom is to conſider theſe different circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, to ſuit the Language to the <hi>Subject, Occaſion,</hi> and <hi>End.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, This muſt direct to the beſt <hi>method</hi> of diſcourſing: This can't be always the ſame, a variety of Subjects to be treated on, will not allow it. But Prudence will teach that Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes be made always in the moſt eaſy, natural, and intelligible method, that the matter will allow. This will be not only helpful to the <hi>Memory</hi> in <hi>retaining,</hi> but to the <hi>Underſtanding</hi> in taking a juſt view of things.</p>
                  <p>In all theſe things the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of the Heralds of the Everlaſting Goſpel is to be diſplayed, to promote the good Entertainment of their Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage.</p>
                  <p>And thus we have finiſhed the Conſideration of their Qualifications. We proceed to the laſt thing.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <hi>IV.</hi> Laſtly, We are to Conſider that <hi>Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing Reward</hi> that will be given them when their work is done. <hi>They ſhall be Bleſſed.</hi> Here two things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They ſhall obtain the <hi>Reward</hi> of <hi>Bleſſedneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. This their Reward ſhall be <hi>diſtinguiſhingly great.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. The <hi>Wiſe</hi> and <hi>Faithful Servant</hi> ſhall obtain the <hi>Reward</hi> of <hi>Bleſſedneſs.</hi> This reward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:001329_0066_0FB27E23C9BCBCA0"/>
in it a perfect freedom from all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieting Evils, and the full poſſeſſion of all Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying Good. The <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Excellency,</hi> of this reward, we are not able in our preſent Embodied State, to take a comprehenſive view of. We have not Faculties enlarged to that <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity,</hi> nor refined to that <hi>Purity,</hi> and <hi>Clearneſs,</hi> nor Exalted to that <hi>Strength</hi> and <hi>Vigour,</hi> which are neceſſary to Entertain, and bear an <hi>Open View</hi> of Future Glory. The Object is too Vaſt and Bright, and our Underſtanding too weak, narrow, and earthy. A Sight of it in its true beauty, brightneſs and fullneſs, would dazle, confound and overpower the mind; &amp; Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality muſt ſink under the very ſight of that weight of Glory. God has ſeen meet in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcention to our Infirmity, to repreſent this under the ſhadow of ſuch Earthly Things which have moſt of <hi>Profit, Pleaſure</hi> and <hi>Honour</hi> in them: But after all, the Reward is Great and Excellent, beyond thought and expreſſion.</p>
                  <p>This however we may be ſure of is contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it, <hi>viz.</hi> That theſe <hi>Bleſſed Ones,</hi> during their State of Separation from the Body, ſhall be ſafely lodged by their Lord, who has the KEYS of the INVISIBLE WORLD, in the <hi>Paradiſe</hi> of God, a place of inconceivable <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment;</hi> a Place ſo bright and ſerene, as not to need either <hi>Sun</hi> or <hi>Moon</hi> to Enlighten it. <hi>Where</hi> they ſhall Enjoy the happy <hi>Society</hi> of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Perfected Spirits; nay, of CHRIST
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:001329_0067_0FB27E2A82130568"/>
himſelf; with whom they ſhall live in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of the wiſeſt acts of Endearment, and in the higheſt Expreſſions of mutual Love and Friendſhip. <hi>There</hi> their Employ will be that of Angels, every way ſuited to the Perfection of Glorify'd Saints. <hi>There</hi> they ſhall be fully freed from all that Sin that here infeſted them; from all thoſe ſufferings that here griev'd them; from all thoſe Labours that here waſted their Spirits; from all thoſe Enemies that were here ſhooting their envenom'd arrows to wound their peace. <hi>There</hi> the <hi>Divine Image</hi> which was here begun, will receive its finiſhing ſtrokes: Their knowledge will be without Error, or faulty Ignorance; their Holineſs without De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; their Love in its Perfection; and their Joy in its Fullneſs: and all their Enjoyments will be agreeable, not to a <hi>State of Tryal,</hi> which is now over, but to a <hi>Life</hi> of <hi>Rewards.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Day</hi> of the <hi>Final Judgment</hi> they ſhall appear as true CHILDREN OF THE RESUR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RECTION: Their Bodies ſhall be <hi>Transfigured</hi> according to the Glory, Purity &amp; Perfection of the Reſurrection Body of the Son of God. They ſhall appear in all circumſtances of Honour before the General Aſſembly of Hell, Earth and Heaven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And when the affairs of this Day are finiſhed, they ſhall aſcend with their Glorify'd Maſter, above the viſible Heavens; and with Him En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in Triumph into the <hi>City of God;</hi> and ſhall Sit down with him upon his Throne, &amp; ſhall
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:001329_0068_0FB27E2C019DC1E0"/>
be FOR EVER WITH HIM to behold and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take in his Glory. But after all, <hi>How ſmall a Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is Known of it!</hi> tho' more than enough to pronounce them <hi>Bleſſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>Reward</hi> of Wiſe and Faithful Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſhall be <hi>Diſtinguiſhingly Great.</hi> I am not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant that the Doctrine of <hi>Degrees of Glory</hi> has been holy diſputed in the <hi>Schools.</hi> The <hi>Affirmative</hi> ſeems ſo agreeable to the Principles of Right Reaſon, and ſo clearly revealed in the infallible Oracles of Truth; that to me it appears more than <hi>Problematical.</hi> The <hi>Schoolmen</hi> indeed and <hi>Doctors</hi> in the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> build this upon a rotten Foundation, <hi>viz.</hi> The different degrees of Merit in Good Works. But their Error ought not to ſhake the true foundation of this Doctrine; which appears with a clear Light in the <hi>Sure Word of Propheſy.</hi> Here we are taught to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh between the <hi>Reward</hi> of a <hi>Prophet,</hi> and the <hi>Reward</hi> of a <hi>Righteous</hi> Man, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.41, 42. The Parable of the Talents appears to aſſert &amp; juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy different degrees of Glory: <hi>Luke</hi> 19.16, 17, 18, 19. Where we find every Servant received from his Lord in proportion to his Improvement of what had been committed to him. And the Truth flows not from a bare <hi>Circumſtance</hi> of the Parable; but from the <hi>Main Scope</hi> of it, which was to Excite Chriſtians to an Improvement of their Talents in proportion to what they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; and the Argument to engage to it is that their <hi>Reward</hi> ſhall be <hi>Proportionable.</hi> He that
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:001329_0069_0FB27E30B58A9AA0"/>
gains ten Pounds ſhall be Ruler over ten Cities; and he that gains five ſhall Rule over five Cities. This Doctrine alſo is aſſerted by the Apoſtle as an Argument to engage the Corinthians to abound in Works of Charity &amp; Liberality, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.6. <hi>He that Soweth Sparingly ſhall reap Sparingly; But he that Soweth Bountifully, ſhall reap Bountifully.</hi> In which there would be no force or motive if there be not a Diſtinction between the Rewards of the bleſſed. And this point ſeems ſtill to be ſet in a fuller Light, in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.41, 42. There is one <hi>Glory</hi> of the <hi>Sun,</hi> another of the <hi>Moon</hi>; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother <hi>Glory</hi> of the <hi>Stars</hi>; for one <hi>Star</hi> differeth from another Star in <hi>Glory: So</hi> alſo is the <hi>Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi> of the <hi>Dead.</hi> Many other places might have been brought to have given in their Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to confirm the Doctrine aſſerted; but it ſeems needleſs, Scripture appears for it, and has nothing, that I know of, againſt it: Nor do any of the pretended Arguments againſt it ſeem to be of any force. This will not infer a real <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection</hi> in the bleſſedneſs of ſuch Saints as En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy a <hi>Leſs Degree</hi> of Glory. A <hi>Star</hi> is as perfect in its order as the <hi>Sun,</hi> yet they ſhine with a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Luſtre. And I do not at preſent ſee any Abſurdity in allowing a different Strength and Capacity in the bleſſed. Every Soul ſhall be full of Glory, but One may be capable to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain more than another. Saints are not Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect when they firſt Enter upon their Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; yet a growth and improvement ſeems
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:001329_0070_0FB27E32CB1F2EE8"/>
reaſonable to be allow'd them. Knowledge is an Eſſential part of their happineſs; and in this undoubtedly they will be always making Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances. The knowledge of Angels to be ſure was improved by the Coming of Chriſt, and the Goſpel Revelation made to the Church, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.10. And yet before that, they were perfectly bleſſed; tho' this their increaſe of knowledge muſt add to their Glory.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Again,</hi> This will not conclude any <hi>Imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> in the <hi>Intereſt</hi> that the Leaſt Saint has in the <hi>Merits of Chriſt,</hi> which purchaſed this Glory, and the higheſt Degrees of it. The <hi>Graces</hi> of <hi>Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi> in this Life are the purchaſe of Chriſts Righteouſneſs; yet there is not an <hi>Equality</hi> of theſe conferred upon believers here. And <hi>Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Degrees of Grace</hi> in this Life ſeem as incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with an Equal Intereſt in the Merits of Chriſt, as <hi>Different Degrees of Glory</hi> in the Next. But the Truth appears to me to lye thus. The Meritorious Obedience and Sufferings of Chriſt were a <hi>Refuſable Price</hi> in themſelves, which God was at Liberty to accept or refuſe, antecedently to his own Promiſe: And ſo was at liberty to accept it for <hi>Whom,</hi> and to <hi>what Degree</hi> He ſaw meet. By free Compact between the Father and Son it was agreed to be accepted for the full Pardon, Juſtification and Happineſs of all God's Choſen and Sanctifyed, and for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe of a greater degree of Glory for ſome, that ſhould diſtinguiſh themſelves in higher degrees of
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:001329_0071_0FB27E344AC80668"/>
Holineſs. And all this may be and yet an <hi>Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> be aſſerted in their <hi>Election, Adoption,</hi> and <hi>Juſtification.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Now,</hi> if there be ſuch a gradual difference in the Glory that ſhall be revealed in the Saints; Doubtleſs, thoſe that have been <hi>Wiſe</hi> and <hi>Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Stewards</hi> in Gods Houſe here, will obtain a proportionable Exaltation in the Kingdom of Glory. Their Lord will diſtinguiſh them by Particular Marks of Honour there, as they have diſtinguiſhed themſelves here in Zeal and Fidelity in his Service. The Service they are now called to is Honourable, Great, and Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult; the Diſcouragements they meet with, the Temptations they conflict with, the Self-denyal they muſt Exerciſe, are all <hi>Peculiarly</hi> great; if therefore under all they maintain their Poſt, are Wiſe and Faithful, their Reward will be as <hi>Pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar.</hi> They are now placed in a Station of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Dignity, if they are Faithful to their Truſt, Chriſt will not <hi>Degrade</hi> them in the other World. And this diſtinguiſhing Glory the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Daniel</hi> refers to, Dan. 12.3. <hi>And they that are Wiſe ſhall ſhine as the Bightneſs of the Firmament; and they that turn many to Righteouſneſs as the Stars for Ever and Ever.</hi>

His <hi>Apprehenſion</hi> was quick, his <hi>Reaſon</hi> bright, and his <hi>Judgment</hi> exact and ſolid: which made him baniſh ſuch things as trivial, as were not capable of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement to advance his Soul, either in its <hi>Intellectual</hi> or <hi>Moral Perfection.</hi> His <hi>Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> was of Great Proſpect: His mind filled with bright Images of things; inricht with a vaſt number of noble Ideas, and knew well their ſeveral Connexions, Relations and Dependen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, how to ſeparate, and how to unite them in deep ſearches after Truth. He had a deep thought, and penetrating <hi>Sagacity</hi> to make a juſt Eſtimate of things on ſudden Emergencies; which made him juſtly Eſteem'd One of the <hi>Wiſeſt Men,</hi> that has been known, of his <hi>Order,</hi> in Our Land.

Knowledge of the moſt Abſtruſe parts of Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy. And a Great Divine muſt of neceſſity be a Great Clerk.</p>
                     <p>He was a <hi>Judicious Textuary.</hi> Like Apollos a Man mighty in the Scripture. His common Publick Diſcourſes were a Demonſtration of this; but eſpecially thoſe <hi>Judicious</hi> and <hi>Elaborate</hi> COMMENTARIES, made in the <hi>School of the Prophets,</hi> upon ſeveral whole Books of the Divine Oracles, remain as a Laſting Monument of this skill.</p>
                     <p>His Knowledge in <hi>Syſtematical Divinity</hi> was celebrated by all. He had a Body of Divinity well digeſted in his head. And was careful to hold faſt the Form of Sound Words. His Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge was not like a Light in a Dark Lanthorn: But out of the Treaſury of his Head and Heart was able to communicate to others. He had a great Dexterity in confirming Truths by Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtible Arguments, and to Set them in an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious Light; to Explain them fully, and Apply them with the greateſt Cloſsneſs and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinency. This was obſervable in the Diſcharge of the Common Duties of his Paſtoral Care: But this his Knowledge appeared with a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Luſtre in his CATECHETICAL LECTURES, which if Publiſhed, would be found One of the beſt Bodies of Divinity, that has been known.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Controverſy</hi> he was a Champion, a Worthy of the Firſt Stength, Skill, and Courage. He
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:001329_0082_0FB27E57A46BB718"/>
was qualifyed for it by a clear Head, a cool Thought, and Inflexible Principles. He was able to weild the Sword of the Spirit to the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of Gainſayers; to their Confutation, tho' not always to their Conviction: And has once and again ſheathed this Sword of the Spirit in the Bowels of Triumphant Errors. And was every way fit to be Set for <hi>the Defence of the Goſpel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He was an <hi>Excellent Caſuiſt.</hi> Where the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed and Scrupulous might have their diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties Eaſed, their doubts reſolved with Safety. When any Caſes of Conſcience came under his thought, he was wont to handle them with Wiſe Caution, and admirable Compaſſion; He deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berated Maturely on all circumſtances, and laid the Whole by the Unerring Rule, and with great judgment determined agreeably.</p>
                     <p>All that knew him, and were Competent judges of his Worth, muſt do him the Honour and Juſtice, to Acknowledge theſe Gifts were Eminent in him. And theſe rendred him as Capable as any man to direct the <hi>Sons of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> and <hi>Young Divines</hi> in their <hi>Theological Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi>; &amp; I believe was as oft as any addreſſed to on this Head.

leſs Eminent in the <hi>Graces of Chriſt.</hi> He had A Sanctifyed Heart as well as a Well-Regulated, Logical Head; and was a Scholar of great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency in the School of Chriſt. His <hi>Graces</hi> Conſecrated his Gifts, and made them appear with a more obſervable luſtre, with Life as well as Light. All the Vertues of the Divine Nature and Life were viſible in his Holy Walk: Which openly diſcover'd his Soul to be A LIVING TEMPLE of the LORD JEHOVAH, where his Throne was prepared, his Image ſet up, and his Spirit dwelt. With what warm Tranſports of Affection and Admiration would he diſcourſe, or hear of the <hi>Wonders</hi> of Divine Grace Unveil'd in the whole Method of the Redemption of man? How low did he bow in profound Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and Adoration of the Spotleſs Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty of God in the Myſterious Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Kingdom both of Grace and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence? How jealous was he in his whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation of the Honour of Sovereign Grace? How fearful leſt any thing ſhould betray it, or cloud its Glory? How thoughtful alſo leaſt Grace ſhould be abuſed unto Wantonneſs? And how careful in all his Diſpenſations to guard againſt this Myſtery of Iniquity, and to ſet out the Glory of Divine Grace, and the Beauty of Holineſs in their proper Luſtre and Admirable Harmony? His <hi>Zeal</hi> was what became an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle; tho' flaming in the Cauſe of Chriſt, yet was temper'd by Love, and guided by Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:001329_0084_0FB27E5B51F2BA00"/>
No pretence could make him tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs his own Line; and from the duties of his own Poſt nothing could move him. His Spirit was truly <hi>Pacifick;</hi> and could ſacrifice every thing but Duty for Peace: And accounted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing too dear, but Truth and Holineſs, for the purchaſe of it. He was a Lively Example of Self-denyal, and ſeperation from the World, of Patience under the reproaches of men, and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings from God, and of Reſignation to the <hi>Abſolute Supremacy</hi> of Heaven under the Darkeſt Diſpenſations. The moſt black and ſorrowful Providence never cauſed him to <hi>hang his Harp</hi> on the Willows, or ſo put him out of <hi>Tune,</hi> as to unfit him to Sing a <hi>Zions Song of Praiſe</hi>: But he could diſcourſe of, nay realize, the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency and Glory, the Majeſty, Righteouſneſs and Grace of his Maſters Kingdom, even when <hi>Clouds and Darkneſs were about his Throne.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>No man had a deeper ſenſe of the Poverty, Impotency and Depravation of Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by the Apoſtacy; nor any a clearer view of the <hi>Fulneſs of that Proviſion</hi> made in <hi>Chriſt</hi> for the Sinners Righteouſneſs and Salvation. The <hi>Body of Sin</hi> was his conſtant Burden, which he bewailed, groaned under, &amp; expreſſed his long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſire to be freed from in ſome of his lateſt hours. <hi>Meditation,</hi> which gives Life and Power to Grace, was his Exerciſe and Delight; and to what good purpoſe he performed this, may be ſeen in many SACRAMENTAL MEDI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TATIONS,
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:001329_0085_0FB27E5F4844D628"/>
penned for his own Uſe, which are left behind him. He undoubtedly lived un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the View of the UNSEEN WORLD, which he is now gone to, &amp; is filled with the Glory of.</p>
                     <p>Theſe <hi>Gifts</hi> and <hi>Graces</hi> in Conjunction made him in a great degree Equal to the <hi>Station</hi> his Lord had fixed him in. And this was the Stage on which they appeared with beauty, and acted their Part with Glory. All that has been ſaid, in deſcribing the <hi>Evangelical Paſtor</hi> under the Doctrine, belong to his Character: whoſe Pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture therein I was deſignedly drawing. And his <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Fidelity</hi> in their moſt comprehenſive ſenſe, in Feeding and Ruling the Houſe of God, are juſtly Celebrated thro' theſe Churches.</p>
                     <p>At <hi>firſt</hi> in his younger Years, his Maſter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to his Paſtoral Care a Flock in a more obſcure part of this Wilderneſs: But ſo great a Light was ſoon obſerved thro' the whole Land: And his Lord did not deſign to bury him in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity, but to place him in a more Eminent Station, which he was qualifyed for. The Providence that occaſioned his Removal to this Place was an <hi>Awful Judgment</hi> upon the whole Land; yet was Eventually a <hi>Mercy</hi> in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, that it made way for the Tranſlation of this Bright Star to a more Conſpicuous Orb; where his Influence was more Extenſive and Beneficial; and in this it was a great <hi>Bleſſing</hi> to this <hi>Congregation,</hi> to this <hi>Town,</hi> nay, to all <hi>New-England.</hi>

In his whole Miniſtry he expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a true love and zeal for Chriſt, and tender compaſſion to Immortal Souls: There was light, heat and life in all his Addreſſes to them, which argued he well underſtood the worth of Souls, and had a juſt ſenſe of their miſerable Apoſtate Circumſtances.</p>
                     <p>His <hi>Diſcourſes</hi> were all Elaborate, Acute and Judicious; Smelt of the Lamp, &amp; had nothing <hi>Mean</hi> in them. His Common Sermons might have been pronounced with Applauſe before an Aſſembly of the Greateſt Divines. The <hi>Matter</hi> of his Publick Diſcourſes was alwayes weighty; His Subjects well Choſen; ſuited to the State of his Flock, and every way adapted to make them Wiſer and Better.

the Stubborn Will, to humble the proudeſt Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and charm the deafeſt Adder. The <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> in which he deliver'd his Diſcourſes was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the Matter. In reſpect of both he Spoke as became the ORACLES of GOD: With Gravity, Courage, Zeal and Prudence, and with tender Bowels to periſhing Souls. His <hi>Language</hi> was always good; His Stile Maſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line, not Perplexed, but Eaſy as well as Strong. And when the Matter required it, no man could ſpeak with a greater <hi>Pathos</hi> and <hi>Pungency.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He applyed himſelf to <hi>Wounded Conſciences</hi> with great Skill, Faithfulneſs and Tenderneſs.

His Righteous Soul will be no more grieved with the impure Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation of the Wicked; nor wounded with his own Infirmities.
