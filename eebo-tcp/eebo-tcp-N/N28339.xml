            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                     <p>God forbid! I am glad the times are paſſed, in which the heart plays the maſter, and throws duſt in the eyes of reaſon. Love is a good ſlave, but a bad maſter. Marrying is a bad cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, which one muſt comply with like the Sieſta in Spain. But woe to the fool that bends her neck, when ſhe is born to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>

                     <p>Is not that running a riſk? but even that is in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor.

His eſtate, to be ſure, is involved, but he is of an old family and a very honeſt fellow. A certain poliſh, a certain fine feeling, we miſs in him; ſo much the better! nature! nature! nothing excels nature!—Liſette, where are my teeth?</p>

                     <p>That will be a difficult matter. Yet I must make the experiment—When a powerful prince has an appetite to a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, he begins, by taking possession of it, and the treaty of peace follows of course. Nannette is in my power, that's the main point:—And if Lady Brumbach was the devil's grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother, her claws shall never tear her from me again.—But what shall I do with myself just now? To my bride I dare not go, sleep, I cannot, and pray, I will not. Nothing is so tedious, as the languor of a lover—The hour creeps, we follow it, we pass it, we wink—all in vain! It creeps the pace of snails.— We want to carry it forwards—Ah! it is as heavy as lead. We put wishes to the carriage, they won't draw; whip it with the nettles of impatience, it won't proceed. Accompanied by prayers and curses, it at last arrives at its des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tination. The lover embraces his bride—and then the next hour runs as if it was mad—No cry of halt can stop it, no wish overtake it! it runs along! along into eternity!—and sometimes it takes love away with it.</p>

                     <p>I heard whispering. When all is quiet in the house, the young gentleman intends to put her into the wardrobe.</p>

                     <p>Into the wardrobe? a fine ambush.</p>

                     <speaker>Fred.</speaker>
                     <p>But the young lady objects to it. She says it was too dark there, too solitary.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Piff.</speaker>
                     <p>Where then does she mean to stay?</p>

                     <speaker>Piff.</speaker>
                     <p>Then we must be in ambush there.</p>

                     <speaker>Fred.</speaker>

                     <speaker>Molk.</speaker>
                     <p>Then we must take our post there.</p>

                     <p>See now, I think so: be attentive. If you both go into the wardrobe, and the young lady does <hi>not</hi> come there—</p>

                     <speaker>Fred.</speaker>
                     <p>Quite right. But if you both go to the dining room, and the young lady goes to the wardrobe—</p>
