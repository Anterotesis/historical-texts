            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>VIRTUE, ≈øay morali≈øts, is ≈øo tran≈øcendently beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, that ≈øhe need but be <hi>≈øeen,</hi> to be univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øally admired: and is not VICE ≈øo hateful, that the more its features are <hi>viewed,</hi> the more it will be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided? The traffic in the human ≈øpecies, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly as carried on by the Europeans on the coa≈øt of Africa, has ≈øo horrible an a≈øpect, that nothing, one ≈øhould think, but the MASK, under which it has been concealed, could have prevented all the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilized nations in the world uniting to drive the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te≈øted Mon≈øter from the face of the earth. This MASK is, however, at length taken away, and the traffic ≈øtands expo≈øed in all its real, unalterable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity. The PEOPLE are now called upon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, to feel, and judge for them≈øelves. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øentations of former writers on this ≈øubject were roundly denied; the facts they ≈øtated were not only contradicted, but deemed impo≈ø≈øible, and the authors them≈øelves were accu≈øed of ≈ølander. Now we have a body of EVIDENCE to which to appeal; of evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øing every e≈ø≈øential of <hi>credibility.</hi> The witne≈ø≈øes have declared before the Select Committee of the Hou≈øe of Commons, what they them≈øelves ≈øaw: they had the be≈øt opportunities of ob≈øervation, and they are di≈øintere≈øted. And now it appears, that one half of the tale of human mi≈øery hath not been told; and that every principle, that can bind a man

                  <p>The Evidence delivered before the Select Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee of the Hou≈øe of Commons is very voluminous, occupying two thou≈øand pages in folio. But a judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Ab≈øtract and Arrangement of the Evidence, on the Part of the Petitioners for the Abolition of the Slave Trade,<note n="‚Ä°" place="bottom">Printed by J. Phillips, George-Yard, Lombard Street.</note> has been publi≈øhed, and in a ≈øhort compa≈øs, contains the evidence of well informed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons on that ≈øubject.</p>
                  <p>In the PREFACE to this important volume of evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence we read of rewards offered for taking run-away negroes <hi>alive or dead</hi>‚Äîof laws being required to be made to prevent the practice of <hi>cutting off ears, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes, and tongues‚Äîof breaking limbs</hi> and <hi>putting out eyes</hi>‚Äîto prevent <hi>di≈øtempered, maimed, and worn out negroes</hi> from infe≈øting towns‚Äîto prevent <hi>aged</hi> and <hi>infirm</hi> negroes being driven from the plantations <hi>to ≈øtarve.</hi> We meet al≈øo with ≈øuch kind of PREAM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BLES to acts as the following, viz.</p>
                  <p>'Whereas the extreme cruelty and inhumanity of the managers, over≈øeers, and book-keepers of e≈øtates, have frequently driven ≈ølaves into the woods, and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca≈øioned rebellions, internal in≈øurrections, &amp;c. And whereas al≈øo it frequently happens, that ≈ølaves come to their deaths by ha≈øty and ≈øevere blows and other improper treatment of over≈øeers and book-keepers, in the heat of pa≈ø≈øion; and when ≈øuch accidents do happen, the victims are entered in the plantation-books
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:024233_0005_0FC57C0E93EC3458"/>books, as having died of convul≈øions, fits, or other cau≈øes not to be accounted for; and to conceal the real truth of the cau≈øe of the death of ≈øuch ≈ølave or ≈ølaves, he or they is or are immediately put under ground, &amp;c. Other preambles of a ≈øimilar complex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, re≈øpecting the lodging, food, and clothes of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes, are here to be met with. We al≈øo find that run-away negroes, when adverti≈øed, are de≈øcribed by the various brands upon their ≈øhoulders, brea≈øts, cheeks, and foreheads. A woman is de≈øcribed with a wooden leg; a man as having both his ears cropt, and another by his no≈øe and ears being cut off.' Cornwall Chronicle, Nov. 7, 1789. Other in≈øtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces occur within the year 1791.</p>
                  <p>The FIRST CHAPTER contains an account of the Enormities committed by the Natives of Africa on the per≈øons of one another, to procure ≈ølaves for the Europeans, proved by the te≈øtimony of ≈øuch as have vi≈øited that continent‚Äîand confirmed by accounts from the ≈ølaves them≈øelves, after their arrival in the We≈øt-Indies.</p>
                  <p>Under this head, we learn that Kidnapping, or as the natives call it, Panyaring, is very common, that war is made on purpo≈øe to procure ≈ølaves. The king's ≈øoldiers ≈øot fire to villages in the night, and ≈øeize the wretched inhabitants as they attempt to e≈øcape from the flames, and many peri≈øh, either by the fire or ≈øword, in the execution of this horrid pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe. A Boy, who was carried away in the night from his father's hou≈øe, ≈øays, he believes both his parents were killed, he is ≈øure that one was, and that many others were killed and ≈øome taken. Various in≈øtances are mentioned of con≈øummate treachery em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in making captives. Kidnapping is profe≈ø≈øion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally followed; large parties go up the country three
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:024233_0006_0FC57C14E74C9F88"/>hundred miles to drive down captives‚Äîthey go a wood ranging, and pick up every one they meet, and ≈øtrip them naked. The purcha≈øers generally ≈øay, they do not care how the ≈øellers come by their ≈ølaves. Many are ≈øold for crimes fal≈øely imputed; the Judges participate the profits of the ≈øale, and are therefore ≈øtrongly induced to condemn the innocent. Crimes are invented and multiplied for the purpo≈øe of traffic. The great men dre≈øs up and employ wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, to entice young men to be connected with them, that they may be convicted of adultery and ≈øold. The ≈ølaves are ≈øeparated without the lea≈øt regard to ties of con≈øanguinity, or the pathetic expo≈øtulations and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon≈øtrances of nature. When ≈ølave-≈øhips are on the Coa≈øt the natives go armed, but are no where ≈øafe. The man, invited to drink with his neighbour, on ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing to go, is ≈øeized by two of them and a large dog: and this mode of ≈øeizure is common.</p>
                  <p>By the Second Chapter it appears that the Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peans, by means of the trade in ≈ølaves, are the occa≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the before-mentioned enormities; that they ≈øometimes u≈øe additional means to excite the natives to practi≈øe them, often attempt them≈øelves to ≈øteal the natives, and ≈øucceed, force trade as they plea≈øe, and are guilty of inju≈øtice in their dealings. In proof of this charge, we learn from the evidence, that Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans receive European goods in exchange for ≈ølaves‚Äî that they declare when ≈øhips cea≈øe to come (as in times of war) ≈ølaves cea≈øe to be taken. African dealers make the Princes drunk, in order to overcome their aver≈øion to unprovoked war: they furni≈øh the natives with arms and ammunition and excite them to pillage.</p>
                  <p>The term war, in Africa, is u≈øed in general to ≈øignify pillage; and when many towns are ≈øeen bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:024233_0007_0FC57C15E70987C0"/>in the night, the natives ≈øay war is carrying on.</p>
                  <p>The Traders advance goods to Chiefs to induce them to ≈øeize their ≈øubjects or neighbours. Capt. Patter≈øon ≈øet two villages at variance, and brought pri≈øoners from both ≈øides. It is not uncommon to make the natives drunk, and then buy them. Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Rooke ≈øays, that it was propo≈øed to him by three Engli≈øh captains of ≈øhips, to kidnap a hundred, or a hundred and fifty men, women, and children, king Damel's ≈øubjects, who had come to Goree in con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the friendly intercour≈øe between him and Damel: He refu≈øed and was much ≈øhocked by the propo≈øition. They ≈øaid ≈øuch things had been done by a former governor. Two men, black traders, were invited on board, intoxicated, and captured when a≈øleep. The Greg≈øon's people, in running down the coa≈øt, kidnapped thirty-two of the natives. The Dob≈øon's boat of Liverpool had ≈øtolen a man and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; the captain on the remon≈øtrance of Capt. Briggs, who told him, there would be no more trade if he did not deliver up his two captives, re≈øtored them; upon which the natives loaded a boat with yams, goats, fowls, honey, and palm wine, and would take nothing for them,‚Äîa ≈øtriking in≈øtance of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givene≈øs of injuries, and of unmerited kindne≈øs!</p>
                  <p>We then meet with as oppo≈øite an exhibition of character as can po≈ø≈øibly be conceived: three or four hundred Africans cruelly ma≈ø≈øacreed or carried off, by means of the treacherous contrivance of ≈øix En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gli≈øh captains in Old Calabar River. But let us "turn our eyes for relief to ≈øome ordinary wickedne≈øs"<note n="*" place="bottom">Wilberforce's Speech in the Hou≈øe of Commons</note>: Some con≈øider frauds as a nece≈ø≈øary part of the traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic; they put fal≈øe heads into powder ca≈øks, cut off two or three yards from the middle of a piece of
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:024233_0008_0FC57C176FEA9A00"/>cloth, adulterate ≈øpirits, and ≈øteal back articles given. Be≈øides the≈øe, there are others who pay in bottles, which hold but half the contents of the ≈øamples ≈øhewn; u≈øe fal≈øe ≈øteel-yards and weights, and ≈øell ≈øuch guns as bur≈øt on firing; ≈øo that many of the natives of the windward coa≈øt, are without their fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and thumbs on this account, and it has become a ≈øaying that the≈øe guns kill more out of the butt man the muzzle.</p>
                  <p>The Third Chapter contains an account of the tran≈øactions of the en≈ølaved Africans, and of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of confining, airing, feeding, and exerci≈øing them; incidents on the pa≈ø≈øage, and the manner of ≈øelling them when arrived at their de≈øtined ports; the deplorable ≈øituation of the refu≈øe or ≈øickly ≈ølaves; ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of relations and friends; mortality on the pa≈ø≈øage, and frequently after ≈øale; and the cau≈øes of this mortality.</p>
                  <p>On being brought on board, ≈øays Dr. Trotter, they ≈øhew ≈øigns of extreme di≈øtre≈øs and de≈øpair, from a feeling of their ≈øituation, and regret at being torn from their friends and connexions. They ≈øometimes dream of being in their own country, and when they awake ≈øhew their de≈øpair by howling and ≈øhrieking in a mo≈øt dreadful manner. The women go into fits. In the cour≈øe of the voyage, the ≈ølaves are chained to the deck every day from eight in the morning to four o'clock in the afternoon. They are fed twice a day with rice, yeams, and hor≈øe-beans, and now and then a little beef and bread: after each of the≈øe two meals they are allowed half a pint of water; and are forced to jump in their irons, which, by the ≈ølave dealers, is called making them dance. This exerci≈øe frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly occa≈øions the fetters to excoriate their limbs; and, when it is very painful to move at all, they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
<pb facs="unknown:024233_0009_0FC57C1DB3F1DA00"/>to dance by a cat-of-nine-tails. The captains order them to ≈øing, and they ≈øing ≈øongs of ≈øorrow, the ≈øubject of which are their wretched ≈øituation, and the idea of never returning home: the witne≈øs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members the very words upon the≈øe occa≈øions.</p>
                  <p>The ≈ølaves are ≈øo crouded below, that it is impo≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to walk among them without treading upon them. Dr. Trotter has ≈øeen the ≈ølaves drawing their breath with all tho≈øe laborious and anxious efforts for life, which are ob≈øerved in expiring animals, ≈øubjected by experiment to foul air, or in the exhau≈øted receiver of an air pump: they cry out‚Äî'we are dying,' and many are irrecoverably lo≈øt by ≈øuffocation, having had no previous ≈øigns of indi≈øpo≈øition. They are clo≈øely wedged together, and have not ≈øo much room as a man in his co≈ø≈øin, either in length or breadth. They ≈øometimes go down well at night, and are found dead in the morning. Alexander Falconbridge was never among them for ten minutes together below, but his ≈øhirt was as wet as if dipped in water. Sometimes the dead and living are found ≈øhackled together. They lie on the bare blanks, and the prominent parts of their bones, about the ≈øhoulder-blade and knees, have frequently been ≈øeen bare. No ≈øituation can be conceived ≈øo dreadful and di≈øgui≈øting as that of ≈ølaves when ill of the flux. In the Alexander (A. Falcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge ≈øays) the deck was covered with blood and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus, and re≈øembled a ≈ølaughter-hou≈øe; the ≈øtench and foul air were intolerable. The ≈ølaves, ≈øhackled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, frequently quarrel, and make a great di≈øturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Some refu≈øe food and medicine, and declare they want to die. In ≈øuch ca≈øes compul≈øion is u≈øed. The ≈øhips are ≈øo fitted up as to prevent, by net-work, the flaves jumping overboard; notwith≈øtanding which they often attempt it, and ≈øometimes ≈øucceed, ≈øhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:024233_0010_0FC57C209A71AB28"/>≈øigns of exultation in the very jaws of death. Some employ other means to de≈øtroy them≈øelves, and others go mad. Some re≈øolve to ≈øtarve, and means are ineffectually u≈øed to wrench open their teeth: they per≈øi≈øt in their re≈øolution, and effect their purpo≈øe, in ≈øpite of the utmo≈øt pains to prevent it. When ≈øeverely cha≈øti≈øed for not taking their food, they have looked up with a ≈ømile and ≈øaid, "pre≈øently we ≈øhall be no more." The thum ≈øcrew is an in≈øtrument of torture, the application of it ≈øometimes occa≈øions mortifications, of which the negroes die. An in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance occurs of the cruelty of a captain to an infant only nine months old, which one would ≈øuppo≈øe too ≈øhocking to be true, were it not corroborated by other ≈øpecimens of as great cruelty in various parts of the evidence. After a ≈øeries of tortures the infant ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired, and its ≈øavage murderer, not yet ≈øatiated, would ≈øuffer none of the people on deck to throw the body overboard, but called the Mother, the wretched Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to perform this la≈øt ≈øad office to her murdered child. Unwilling as it might naturally be ≈øuppo≈øed ≈øhe was, to comply, "he beat her," regardle≈øs of the indignant murmurs of her ≈øettered countrymen, whom in the barbarous plenitude of ≈øecure tyranny, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to be ≈øpectators of this horrible ≈øcene‚Äî"he beat her, until he made her take up the child and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it to the ≈øide of the ve≈ø≈øel, and then ≈øhe dropped it into the ≈øea, turning her head another way, that ≈øhe might not ≈øee it!"<note n="*" place="bottom">Speech by W. Smith in the Hou≈øe of Commons.</note> Another in≈øtance occurs in this chapter, not perhaps of more cruelty, though of greater magnitude.</p>
                  <p>A ≈øhip from Africa, with about four hundred ≈ølaves on board, ≈øtruck upon ≈øome ≈øhoals, called the Morant Keys, di≈øtant eleven leagues, S. S. E. off the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:024233_0011_0FC57C21F0F5B4E8"/>ea≈øt end of Jamaica. The officers and ≈øeamen of the ≈øhip landed in their boats, carrying with them arms and provi≈øions. The ≈ølaves were left on board in their irons and ≈øhackles. This happened in the night time. When morning came, it was di≈øcovered that the negroes had got out of their irons, and were bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øy making rafts, upon which they placed the women and children; the men, who were capable of ≈øwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, attended upon the rafts, whil≈øt they drifted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the wind towards the i≈øland where the ≈øeamen had landed. From an apprehen≈øion that the negroes would con≈øume the water and provi≈øions which the ≈øeamen had landed, they came to the re≈øolution of de≈øtroying them, by means of their fire-arms and other weapons. As the poor wretches approached the ≈øhore they actually de≈øtroyed between three and four hundred of them. Out of the whole cargo only thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty three or thirty four were ≈øaved and brought to King≈øton, where they were ≈øold at public vendue.</p>
                  <p>When the ≈øhips arrive at their de≈øtined ports, the cargo of ≈ølaves is ≈øold, either by ≈øcramble or ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due. The ≈øale by ≈øcramble is de≈øcribed:‚Äî"A great number of people come on board with tallies in their hande (the ≈øhip being fir≈øt darkened with ≈øails and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered round; the men ≈ølaves placed on the main deck, and the women on the quarter deck) and ru≈øh through the barricado door with the the ferocity of brures. Some have three or four handkerchiefs tied together, to encircle as many as they think ≈øit for their purpo≈øe. This is a very general mode of ≈øale, and ≈øo terrifies the poor negroes, that forty or fifty at a time have leaped into the ≈øea; the≈øe, however, the witne≈øs believes, have been taken up again: the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men have got away, and run about the town as if they were mad. The ≈ølaves ≈øold by public auction or ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:024233_0012_0FC57C23675346A8"/>are generally the refu≈øe, or ≈øickly ≈ølaves. The≈øe are in ≈øuch a ≈øtate of health, that they ≈øell greatly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der price. They have been known to be ≈øold for five dollars, a guinea, and even a ≈øingle dollar each. Some that are deemed not worth buying are left to expire in the place of ≈øale, for nobody gives them any thing to eat or drink, and ≈øome of them live three days in that ≈øituation! In the ≈øale no care is taken to prevent the ≈øeparation of relations; they are ≈øeparated (≈øays the evidence) like ≈øheep and lambs by the butcher. Making the ≈ølaves walk the plank, is a term u≈øed for throwing them overboard when provi≈øions are ≈øcarce. Sometimes the ≈øhips lo≈øe more than half their cargoes by the ≈ømall-pox; at others they bury a quarter or one-third on the pa≈ø≈øage, owing to various other cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes of mortality: and it is confe≈ø≈øed by the planters,<note n="*" place="bottom">See Stanley's Speech in the Hou≈øe of Commons.</note> that half the ≈ølaves die in the ≈øea≈øoning, after arrival in the We≈øt-Indies. Surgeon Wil≈øon ≈øays, that of the death of two-thirds of tho≈øe who died in his ≈øhip, the primary cau≈øe was melancholy. The di≈øorders which carry off the ≈ølaves in ≈øuch numbers, are a≈øcribed by Falconbridge to a di≈øea≈øed mind, ≈øudden tran≈øitions from heat to cold, a putrid atmo≈øphere, wallowing in their own excrements, and being ≈øhackled together.</p>
                  <p>The captains, ≈øurgeons, &amp;c. who have quitted the African ≈ølave-trade, uniformly declare the rea≈øon to have been, that they could not con≈øcientiou≈øly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in it: they ≈øay, that it is an unnatural, ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitous, and villainous trade, founded on inju≈øtice and treachery; manife≈øtly carried on by oppre≈ø≈øion and cruelty, and not unfrequently terminating in murder. Capt. Hall ≈øays, he quitted it (in oppo≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to lucrative offers) from a conviction that it was perfectly illegal, and founded in blood.</p>

The Fourth Chapter gives an account of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral e≈øtimation and treatment of the ≈ølaves in the We≈øt-Indies. Dr. Jack≈øon ≈øays, that the negroes are generally e≈øteemed a ≈øpecies of inferior beings, whom the right of purcha≈øe gives the owner a power of u≈øing at his will. T. Wooldrich ≈øays, he never knew the be≈øt ma≈øter in the We≈øt-Indies u≈øe his ≈ølaves ≈øo well, as the wor≈øt ma≈øter his ≈øervants in England: that their ≈øtate is inconceivable‚Äîthat a ≈øight of a gang would convince more than all words.</p>
                  <p>Slaves are either Field Slaves, or in or out Door Slaves.</p>
                  <p>The field-≈ølaves begin their work at break of day. They work in rows, without exception under the whip of drivers, and the weak are made to keep up with the ≈øtrong. They continue their labour (with two intermi≈ø≈øions, half an hour during the morning, and two hours at noon) till ≈øun ≈øet. In the intervals they are made to pick gra≈øs for the cattle. Cook has known pregnant women worked and flogged a few days before their delivery. Some, however, are a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle indulged when in that ≈øtate. After the month they work with the children on their backs. In the crop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øea≈øon the labour is of much longer duration<note n="*" place="bottom">in ≈øome e≈øtates it is u≈øual to dig a hole in the ground, which they put the bellies of pregnant women, while they whip them, that they may not excu≈øe puni≈øhment, nor yet endanger the life of the woman of child.</note>. The ≈ølaves ≈øometimes work ≈øo long that they cannot help ≈øleeping, and then it not unfrequently happens, that their arms are caught in the mill and torn off. They are ≈øaid to be allowed one day in ≈øeven for re≈øt, but this time is nece≈ø≈øarily employed in rai≈øing food for the other days, and gathering gra≈øs for their ma≈øters cattle. The be≈øt allowance of food is at Barbadoes, which is a pint of grain for twenty four hours, and half a rotten herring when to be had. When the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:024233_0014_0FC57C28A528F080"/>herrings are unfit for the whites, they are bought up by planters for the ≈ølaves. Some allow nine pints of corn a week, and about one pound of ≈øalt fi≈øh, which is the greate≈øt allowance mentioned in the whole cour≈øe of the evidence. Some have no provi≈øion but what they rai≈øe them≈øelves, and they are frequently ≈øo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigned by the labour of the re≈øt of the week, as ≈øcarcely to be able to work for their own ≈øupport on the Sunday. And the land allotted them for this purpo≈øe is often at the di≈øtance of three miles from their hou≈øes; it would, however, be quite ample for their ≈øupport, were they allowed time ≈øufficient for its cultivation. Sometimes when they have been at the pains of clearing their land, their ma≈øters take it for canes, and give them wood land in≈øtead of it. This hard≈øhip ≈øome have ≈øo taken to heart as to die. Putrid carca≈øes are burnt; if they were buried, the ≈ølaves would dig them up and eat them, which would breed di≈øtempers among them. They are ≈øometimes driven by extreme hunger to ≈øteal at the hazard of their lives. They are badly clothed; one half of them go almo≈øt naked. The ≈ølaves in general have no bed or bedding at all. Their hou≈øes are built with four poles and thatched. They have little or no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty. All the evidence (to whom the que≈øtion has been propo≈øed) agree in an≈øwering, that they never knew or heard of a field-≈ølave ever ama≈ø≈øing ≈øuch a ≈øum, as enabled him to purcha≈øe his own freedom. The arificers, ≈øuch as hou≈øe carpenters, coopers, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons, the drivers and head ≈ølaves, are better off. The owners of women let them out for pro≈øtitution, and flog them, if they do not bring home full wages.</p>
                  <p>The negroes, when whipped, are ≈øu≈øpended by the arms, with weights at their feet. They are fir≈øt whipped with a whip made of cow-≈økin (which cuts
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:024233_0015_0FC57C2ADC2A8A70"/>out the fle≈øh, whereas the military whips cut only the ≈økin,) and afterwards with ebony bu≈øhes (which are more prickly than thorn bu≈øhes in this country,) in order to let out the congealed blood. Dr. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øon thinks the whipping too ≈øevere to be inflicted on any human being: he could lay two or three fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers into the wounds of a man whipped for not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when he was called. Many receive from one hundred and fifty to two hundred la≈øhes at a time; and in two or three days this is repeated: they wa≈øh the raw parts with pickle; this appears from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vul≈øions it occa≈øions, more cruel than whipping; but it is done to prevent mortification. After ≈øevere whipping, they are worked all day without food, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept what their friends may give them out of their own poor pittance. They are returned to the ≈øtocks at night, and worked next day as before. This cruel treatment has made many commit ≈øuicide. Cook has known fourteen ≈ølaves, who, in con≈øequence thereof, ran into the woods and cut their throats together. The≈øe ≈øevere puni≈øhments are frequent. The ≈øcars made by whipping la≈øt to old age. T. Wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich has ≈øeen their backs one undi≈øtingui≈øhed ma≈øs of lumps, holes, and furrows. They ≈øometimes die of mortification of the wounds. A planter flogged his driver to death, and boa≈øted of having ≈øo done.</p>
                  <p>Under the head of Extraordinary Puni≈øhments (for tho≈øe already named are reckoned only ordinary,) men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made of iron collars with hooks<note n="*" place="bottom">General Tottenham ≈øaw a youth, about nineteen, walking in the ≈øtreets, in a mo≈øt deplorable ≈øituation, entirely naked, and with an iron collar about his neck, with five long pproctig ≈øpikes.

He could not ≈øit down, owing to his breech being in a ≈øtate of mortification, and it was impo≈ø≈øible for him to lie down, from the projection of the prongs. The boy came to the general to a≈øk relief. He was ≈øhocked at his appearance, and a≈øked him what he had done to ≈øuffer ≈øuch a puni≈øhment, and who inflicted it.

<pb n="16" facs="unknown:024233_0016_0FC57C2BA6116C20"/>chains, and a half hundred weight fa≈øtened to them, which the negroes are forced to drag after them, when working in the field, ≈øu≈øpending by the hands 'till the fingers mortify; flogging with ebony bu≈øhes 'till they are forced to go on all fours, unable to get up, being tied up to the branch of a tree, with a heavy weight round the neck, expo≈øed to the noon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day ≈øun‚Äîthumb-≈øcrews; a man was put on the pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, ≈øo long as to occa≈øion a mortification of his foot and hand, on ≈øu≈øpicion of robbing his ma≈øter, a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic officer, of a ≈øum of money, which it afterwards appeared, the ma≈øter had taken him≈øelf. Yet the ma≈øter was privy to the puni≈øhment, and the ≈ølave had no compen≈øation. He was puni≈øhed by order of the ma≈øter, who did not then chu≈øe to make it known that he him≈øelf had made u≈øe of the money. A girl's ears were nailed to a po≈øt, afterwards torn away, and clipt off clo≈øe to her head, with a pair of large ≈øci≈ø≈øars; be≈øides this, ≈øhe was unmercifully flogged, and all for‚ÄîBREAKING A PLATE, OR SPILLING A CUP OF TEA! A negro, impelled by hunger, had ≈øtolen part of a turkey, his ma≈øter cau≈øed him to be held down, and, with his own hands, took a hammar and punch and knocked out four of his teeth. The hand is cut off if lifted up again≈øt a white man, and the leg for running away. A planter ≈øent for a ≈øurgeon to cut off the leg of a negro who had run away. On the ≈øurgeon's refu≈øing to do it, the planter took an iron bar, and broke the leg in pieces, and then the ≈øurge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on took it off. This planter did many ≈øuch acts of cruelty, and all with impunity. The practice of drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping hot lead upon the negroes, is here mentioned. H. Ro≈øs ≈øaw a young female ≈øu≈øpended by her wri≈øts
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:024233_0017_0FC57C2D27000628"/>to a tree, ≈øwinging to and fro, while her ma≈øter appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a lighted torch to the different parts of her writh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing body. It was notorious that Ru≈øhie tortured ≈øo many of his negroes to death, that he was obliged to ≈øell his e≈øtate. Another planter, in the ≈øame I≈øland<note n="¬ß" place="bottom">Jamaica.</note>, de≈øtroyed forty ≈ølaves out of ≈øixty (in three years) by ≈øeverity. The re≈øt of the conduct of this infamous wretch was cancelled by the Committee of the Hou≈øe of Commons, as containing circum≈øtances too hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible to be given to the world. We, however, go on to read of knocking on the head and ≈øtabbing, of a hot iron forced between the teeth, of a ≈ølave thrown into the boiling juice, and killed, of a negro ≈øhot and his head cut off. And it appears, that the women, deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of re≈øpectability and rank, not only order and ≈øuperintend, but ≈øometimes actually inflict with their own hands ≈øevere puni≈øhments on their ≈ølaves.</p>
                  <p>The offences for which the before-mentioned pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhments are inflicted are, not coming into the field in time, not picking a ≈øufficient quantity of gra≈øs, not appearing willing to work, when in fact ≈øick and not able; for ≈øtaying too long on an errand, for not coming immediately when called, for not bringing home (the women) the full weekly ≈øum enjoined by their owners; for running away, and for theft, to which they are often driven by hunger.</p>
                  <p>Under the head of "Extraordinary Puni≈øhments," ≈øome appear to have ≈øuffered for running away, or for lifting up a hand again≈øt a white man, or for break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a plate, or ≈øpilling a cup of tea, or to extort con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈ø≈øion.

The ≈ølaves have little or no redre≈øs again≈øt ill-u≈øage of any ≈øort; the laws to re≈øtrict puni≈øhment are a mere farce, and univer≈øally di≈øregarded, or when pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be ob≈øerved they are in divers ways ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually evaded: be≈øides, the evidence of a Black is in no ca≈øe whatever admitted again≈øt a White Man; which circum≈øtance alone is enough to deprive the negroes of all legal protection whatever, were the laws, in other re≈øpects, ever ≈øo ju≈øt and ≈øalutary. Lieutenant David≈øon was ≈øo hurt at the ≈øevere and frequent whippings of one of the women, that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained to a magi≈øtrate, who ≈øaid, "he had nothing to do with it."</p>
                  <p>The particular in≈øtances mentioned in the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, of ≈ølaves dying in con≈øequence of ≈øevere and cruel treatment from their ma≈øters, were not puni≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, though generally known; nor do the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trators of the≈øe barbaraties appear to have ≈øuffered any di≈øgrace!</p>
                  <p>If you ≈øpeak to a negro of future puni≈øhments, he ≈øays,‚Äî"Why ≈øhould a poor negro be puni≈øhed? he does no wrong? fiery cauldrons, and ≈øuch things, are re≈øerved for white people, as puni≈øhments for the oppre≈ø≈øion of ≈ølaves."</p>
                  <p>In the Fifth Chapter, it is proved, by ≈øuch as have ≈øeen them in their own country, that the natives of Africa are equal to the Europeans in their natural ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parities, feelings, affections, and moral character. They manufacture gold and iron, in ≈øome re≈øpects, equal to the European Arti≈øts‚Äîal≈øo cloth and leather with uncommon neatne≈øs; the former they die blue, yellow, brown and orange. They are ≈økilled in making indigo and ≈øoap, and pottery wares, and prepare ≈øalt for their own u≈øe from the ≈øea water. They al≈øo make ropes with aloes. With re≈øpect to their moral
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:024233_0019_0FC57C33E18B0D28"/>character, they are very hone≈øt and ho≈øpitable: grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and affectionate, harmle≈øs and innocent; punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al in their dealings, and as capable of virtue as the Whites. They are ≈øu≈øceptible of all the ≈øocial virtues: genero≈øity, fidelity, and gratitude, are allowed them by Dr. Stuart. Tho≈øe virtues Dr. Jack≈øon enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, and adds charity to all in di≈øtre≈øs, and a ≈øtrong attachment on the part of parents to their children, T. Woolrich ≈øays, he never knew of an African, who could expre≈øs him≈øelf, that did not believe in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i≈øtence of a ≈øupreme Being.</p>
                  <p>In the Sixth and Seventh Chapters it appears that the natives po≈ø≈øe≈øs indu≈øtry and a ≈øpirit of commerce, ≈øufficient for carrying on a new trade; that their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try abounds with, and might ea≈øily be made ≈øtill more productive of, many and various articles of commerce; but that the traffic in ≈ølaves is an in≈øuperable impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to opening a new trade.</p>
                  <p>In the Eighth Chapter it is inquired, whether the ≈ølave trade be not a grave (in≈øtead of a nur≈øery) of the ≈øeamen employed in it</p>
                  <p>It appears by the mu≈øter-rolls of Liverpool and Bri≈øtol, that in 350 ve≈ø≈øels, 12, 263 men were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, out of whom 2643 were lo≈øt, that is to ≈øay, more than a fifth of the whole number employed, or more than ≈øeven in every ≈øingle voyage, be≈øides near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one half of tho≈øe who go out with the ≈øhips are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtantly left behind.</p>
                  <p>Capt. Hall (of the merchant's ≈øervice) ≈øays that the crews of the African ≈øhips, when they arrive in the We≈øt Indies, are the mo≈øt mi≈øerable objects he ever met with in any country in his life: he does not know a ≈øingle in≈øtance to the contrary. He has frequently ≈øeen them with their toes rotted off, their legs ≈øwelled to the ≈øize of their thighs, and in an ulcerated ≈øtate all
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:024233_0020_0FC57C34C93AE270"/>over, &amp;c. &amp;c. This account is confirmed by Capt. Hall of the navy. Sir W. Young is of opinion, that a trade to Africa in the natural productions of the country, would not be attended with more inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the health of the ≈øeamen employed in it, than the pre≈øent We≈øt-India Trade.</p>
                  <p>In the Ninth Chapter we find that the ≈øeamen em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the ≈ølave trade are in general barbarou≈øly u≈øed. They are wor≈øe fed both in quantity and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of food than the ≈øeamen in other trades. They have little or no ≈øhelter night or day from the incle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency of the weather during the whole of the middle pa≈ø≈øage. They are inhumanly treated when ill, and ≈øubjected to the fury of the impa≈ø≈øioned officers for very trifles. A boy, to avoid the cruel treatment of his officer. jump'd overboard, and was drowned. A man was killed with a hand ≈øpike for being very ill and unable to work. Six men were chained together by their necks, legs, and hands, for making their e≈øcape from the ve≈ø≈øel; they were allowed only a plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a day; they all died in their chains; one of them (Thomas Jones a very good ≈øeaman) raving mad! The evidence proves that in≈øtances of wanton cruelty, and in human treatment in general, are nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, various and frequent. One man, with both his legs in irons and his neck in an iron collar, was chained to the boat for three months, and very often mo≈øt inhumanly beaten for complaining of his ≈øitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, both by the captain and other officers. His al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance of provi≈øions was ≈øo ≈ømall that (after his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lea≈øe from the boat, on account of extreme weakne≈øs) he begged ≈øomething to eat, ≈øaying that if it were not given him he ≈øhould die:‚Äîthe captain reproached him, beat him, and bid him die and be damned. The man died in the night. This was in the Ship Sally,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:024233_0021_0FC57C362BCB9BE0"/>on board of which ill-treatment was common. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man was deliberately, by a ≈øeries of ≈øhocking bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barities, murdered.</p>
                  <p>Sir Geo. Young remarks that a ≈øhip of the line might be pre≈øently manned by the ≈øailors who wi≈øh to e≈øcape from the mi≈øeries of African ≈øhips. One poor young man, when dying in con≈øequence of the ill treatment he had received from the captain, ≈øaid (which were the la≈øt words A. Falconbridge heard him ≈øpeak) "I cannot puni≈øh him (meaning the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain) but God will." The ≈øailors when ≈øick are beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en for being lazy, till they die under the blows!</p>
                  <p>"If this be the real ≈øituation of things, how hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens it (the reader may perhaps a≈øk) that the objects of ≈øuch tyranny and oppre≈ø≈øion ≈øhould not obtain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre≈øs, and that our courts of law ≈øhould not have to decide upon more ca≈øes of this kind, than they have at pre≈øent?" It is an≈øwered, "the≈øe objects are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally without friends and money, without which the injured will ≈øeek for ju≈øtice but in vain; and becau≈øe the peculiarity of their ≈øituation is an impediment to their endeavours for redre≈øs." Whoever wi≈øhes for a more particular an≈øwer to this que≈øtion, may meet with it in "Clark≈øon's E≈ø≈øay on the Impolicy of the African Slave-Trade," (page 52) from which the que≈øtion and the above general reply are quoted.</p>
                  <p>If it ≈øhould ≈øtill be a≈øked, "how it happens that ≈øeamen enter for ≈ølave ve≈ø≈øels, when ≈øuch general ill u≈øage on board of them can hardly fail of being known?" the reply mu≈øt be taken from the evidence, "that whereas ≈øome of them enter voluntarily, the greater part of them are trepanned; for that it is the bu≈øine≈øs of certain landlords to make them intoxicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and get them into debt, after which <hi>their only al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternative is a Guineaman or a Goal.</hi>

In the Tenth Chapter it is proved not to be true, what ≈øome ≈øay, that the natives of Africa are happier in the European colonies than in their own country. They love their own country, but de≈øtroy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves in the colonies, &amp;c. &amp;c. But any compari≈øon between the two ≈øituations is as (H. Ro≈øs ≈øays, tho' on another occa≈øion) <hi>"an in≈øult to common-≈øen≈øe."</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Eleventh, Twelfth, and Thirteenth Chapters are on the ≈øubject of negro population in the colonies, and plainly ≈øhew that the importation of fre≈øh Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans might immediately be ≈øuperceded, by the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of general good treatment, and of ecertain ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutary regulations therein ≈øugge≈øted.</p>
                  <p>The Fourteenth Chapter is employed to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrate, from the evidence before the committee, that the coloni≈øts would be able to carry on the nece≈ø≈øary cultivation of their lands, without a fre≈øh importation of ≈ølaves while the generation immediately ≈øucceeding the regulations propo≈øed, were growing up to ≈øupply the vacancies occa≈øioned by the natural deaths of the ≈ølaves of all ages, now in their po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion.</p>
                  <p>The Fifteenth Chapter inquires, whether there be not a prevailing opinion in the colonies, that it is cheaper to buy or import ≈ølaves than thus to increa≈øe them by population. And whether the very rever≈øe of this opinion be not true: namely, that it is more profitable to breed than to import. The re≈øult of this inquiry is clearly in favour of the <hi>immediate</hi> Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition of the African Slave Trade. The ≈øame may be ≈øaid of the ≈øixteenth <hi>and la≈øt</hi> chapter, in which it is con≈øidered. Whether it be more political to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the cultivation of the colonies by the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the ≈ølave-trade, or wait till the ri≈øing genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ≈øhall be capable of performing it.</p>
                  <p>Having thus taken a general view of the mo≈øt
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:024233_0023_0FC57C3C26A12518"/>≈øtriking features of the evidence for the abolition of the traffic in the human ≈øpecies, as carried on by the Engli≈øh on the coa≈øt of Africa, it might not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper to clo≈øe it with the declaration of a virtuous and wi≈øe Senator, who≈øe indefatigable labours on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the oppre≈ø≈øed Africans, cannot fail to in≈øure him the unfeigned re≈øpect of every lover of freedom and humanity:</p>

It remains now to recommend, as earne≈øtly and as ≈øtrongly as po≈ø≈øible, to the inhabitants of this Land of Freedom individually, a particular and ≈øerious atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to THE ABSOLUTE NECESSITY, ON EVERY CONSIDERATION OF MORALITY AND JUSTICE, OF BUTTING AN END TO A PRACTICE SO PREGNANT WITH CIRCUMSTANCES OF TERROR AND ALARM TO THIS COUNTRY.</p>
                  <p>Much has been lately done, by the united friends of equitable freedom, in circulating throughout the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom important information on this intere≈øting ≈øubject: but much remains yet to be done.

Should the foregoing Short Sketch of the Evidence, awaken the feelings, or quicken the attention, of any, in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of their greatly injured fellow-creatures, the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øed Africans, it is much to be wi≈øhed, that they will not ha≈øtily di≈ømi≈øs the ≈øubject from their recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, or ≈øuffer its painful impre≈ø≈øions to be made in vain: but ≈øeek a further acquaintance with the evidence, which the more they examine, the ≈øtronger will be their inducements to exert every power and faculty they po≈ø≈øe≈øs, for the purpo≈øe of procuring the Abolition of the Slave-Trade. Let no one ≈øay, "my ≈øituation of privacy and ob≈øcurity, precludes all po≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of ≈øerving the cau≈øe"‚Äîfor the greate≈øt numbers con≈øi≈øt of units, and the mo≈øt mighty exertions of ≈øtates and empires are but aggregates of individual ability.

We may certainly conclude, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is not a friend to the liberty of the meane≈øt ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, is not fit to be entru≈øted with that of the ≈øtate: and even tho≈øe who have no vote, are neverthele≈øs comprehended in our idea of the public mind,‚Äînor is any man of ≈øen≈øe and virtue, let his ≈øituation in a free country be what it may, to be deemed of <hi>no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</hi> Upon his judgment, his voice (if not his vote, his example, much may depend.

                  <p>NOtwithtranding the late determination be the Hou≈øe of Commons on the Slave-Trade, we may hope that the di≈øcu≈ø≈øion it has received will not be u≈øele≈øs; and that the public attention has not been excited in vain, to a ≈øy≈øtem of cruelty which it is painful even to recite. It may be hoped that, claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for our≈øelves the mo≈øt perfect freedom, we ≈øhall no longer impo≈øe upon others a ≈ølavery the mo≈øt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øive; and that, enjoying a degree of felicity un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equalled in any age or country, we ≈øhall no longer range the world to increa≈øe the mi≈øery of mankind.</p>
                  <p>The lu≈øt of power, and the pride of conque≈øt, have doubtle≈øs produced in≈øtances far too numerous, of man en≈ølaved by man. But we, in an enlightened age, have greatly ≈øurpa≈ø≈øed, in brutality and inju≈øtice, the mo≈øt ignorant and barbarous ages: and while we are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to the fine≈øt feelings of humanity, are exerci≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unprecedented cruelty. We have planted ≈ølavery in the rank ≈øoil of ≈øordid avarice; and the produce has been mi≈øery in the extreme. We have a≈øcertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by a cour≈øe of experiments in cruelty, the lea≈øt portion of nouri≈øhment requi≈øite to enable man to lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger a few years in mi≈øery; the greate≈øt quantity of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor which, in ≈øuch a ≈øituation, the extreme of puni≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can extort; and the utmo≈øt degree of pain, labor, and hunger united, that the human frame can endure.</p>
                  <p>In vain have ≈øuch ≈øcenes been developed. The wealth derived from the horrid trafric, has created an influence that ≈øecures its continuance, unle≈øs the people at large ≈øhall refu≈øe to receive the produce of robbery and murder.</p>
                  <p>The Legi≈ølature having refu≈øed to interpo≈øe, the people are now nece≈ø≈øarily called on, either to reprobate or approve the mea≈øure; for We≈øt-India ≈ølavery mu≈øt
<pb facs="unknown:024233_0031_0FC57C4E26E40630"/>depend upon their ≈øupport for its exi≈øtence; and it is in the power of every individual to increa≈øe, or to dimini≈øh its extent. The laws of our country may indeed prohibit us the ≈øugar-cane, unle≈øs we will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it through the medium of ≈ølavery. They may hold it to our lips, ≈øteeped in the blood of our fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-creatures; but they cannot compel us to accept the loath≈øome potion. With us it re≈øts, either to receive it and be partners in the crime, or to exone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate our≈øelves from guilt, by ≈øpurning from us the temptation. For let us not think, that the crime re≈øts alone with tho≈øe who conduct the traffic, or the Legi≈ølature by which it is protected. If we purcha≈øe the commodity, we participate in the crime. The ≈ølave-dealer, the ≈ølave-holder, and the ≈ølave-driver, are virtually the agents of the con≈øumer, and may be con≈øidered as employed and hired by him to procure the commodity. For, by holding out the temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he is the original cau≈øe, the fir≈øt mover in the horrid proce≈øs; and every di≈øtinction is done away by the moral maxim, That whatever we do by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we do our≈øelves.</p>
                  <p>Nor are we by any means warranted to con≈øider our individual ≈øhare in producing the≈øe evils in a trivial point of view. The con≈øumption of ≈øugar in this country is ≈øo immen≈øe, that the quantity commonly u≈øed by individuals will have an important effect. A family that u≈øes only 5 lb. of ≈øugar per week, with the proportion of rum, will, by ab≈øtaining from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øumption 21 months, prevent the ≈ølavery or murder of one fellow-creature; eight ≈øuch families in 19 ¬Ω years, prevent the ≈ølavery or murder of 100, and 38,000 would totally prevent the Slave-Trade to ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply our i≈ølands. Nay, ≈øo nece≈ø≈øarily connected are our con≈øumption of the commodity, and the mi≈øery
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:024233_0032_0FC57C4FEF326D90"/>re≈øulting from it, that in every pound of ≈øugar u≈øed, (the produce of ≈ølaves imported from Africa) we may be con≈øidered as con≈øuming two ounces of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man fle≈øh, be≈øides de≈øtroying an alarming number of ≈øeamen by the Slave-Trade, and ≈øpreading incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable angui≈øh, terror and di≈ømay, through an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men≈øe continent, by the burning of their villages, tearing parents from their families, and children from their parents; breaking every bond of ≈øociety, and de≈øtroying every ≈øource of human happine≈øs. A Frouch writer ob≈øerves, "That he cannot look on a piece of ≈øugar, without conceiving it ≈øtained with ≈øpots of human blood:" and Dr. Franklin adds, that had he taken in all the con≈øequences, "he might have ≈øeen the ≈øugar not merely ≈øpotted, but thoroughly dyed ≈øcarlet in grain."</p>
                  <p>Dreadful con≈øideration‚Äîthat our increa≈øing hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine≈øs and pro≈øperity has ≈øpread de≈øolation and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øery over a country as large as all Europe! For it is an indi≈øputable fact, that it is Briti≈øh luxury, the African Slave Trade depends on for ≈øupport: they have increa≈øed, and they would fall together. For our con≈øumption of ≈øugar is now ≈øo immen≈øe, that it nearly equals that of all Europe be≈øides; and Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maica new ≈øupplies more than all our We≈øt-India I≈ølands did at any period prior to 1755.</p>
                  <p>But amazingly exten≈øive as is the increa≈øe of the culture, ≈øo far is it from keeping pace with our lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury, that (before the di≈øturbances in the French I≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, within the≈øe two or three years) ≈øugars have ever ≈øold in the Briti≈øh market 20 or 30, ≈øometimes 50 per cent. dearer than in any other part of the world. Nor is it to ≈øupport the old plantations, as is pretended, but to form new ones, for the ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:024233_0033_0FC57C56A1F46200"/>of this our increa≈øing luxury, that the wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Africans are torn from their native land.</p>
                  <p>Let us then imagine our immen≈øe con≈øumption wholly, or in great part to cea≈øe, and our ≈øugars to be thrown on the foreign markets; would additional ≈ølaves be wanted to ≈øupply an overflowing market at a falling price? No: the African Slave Trade, by whom≈øoever conducted, to ≈øupply ≈øugar colonies, by whatever nation po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed, mu≈øt totally cea≈øe. Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and di≈ømay would give place to peace and civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation, through a coa≈øt of above three thou≈øand miles extent, and above a thou≈øand miles inland: for ≈øo exten≈øive are our depredations, and ≈øo exten≈øive are the benefits which it is in our power to confer. Nor would the beneficial effects cra≈øe, even here. The We≈øt-India i≈ølands, finding le≈øs demand for ≈øugar, mu≈øt appropriate le≈øs ground to the ≈øugar-cane, and leave more for provi≈øions: the ≈ølaves would be le≈øs worked, better fed, and in a few years con≈øi≈øt intirely of native Creoles. Or if the planters appropriate the land to the other productions of the i≈ølands, the frome beneficial effects mu≈øt en≈øue. For M. Onoke tells us, <q>the cultivation of cotton, pimento, and coffee, is ea≈øier than ≈øugar: the ≈ølaves look better, and incrta≈øe fa≈øtens;</q> and in≈øtead of requiring additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal ≈ølaves, they would be able to increa≈øe their plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations with tho≈øe already in the i≈ølands. For Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor Barry ≈øays, <q>one acre of ≈øugar requires as much labour as three of cotten.</q> Thus our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraining from the con≈øumption of the ≈øugar-cane, even for a few years, would de≈øtroy the Slave Trade to the We≈øt-India I≈ølands, bring fre≈øh land into culture, and place the ≈ølaves in ≈øuch a ≈øituation, that they mu≈øt rapidly incroa≈øe.</p>

The diminution of the con≈øumption of We≈øt India produce, would al≈øo have a powerful effect by ≈øink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the price of the commodity; and thereby take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the temptation to import additional ≈ølaves. The effect a ≈ømall variation in the ≈øupply or demand has on the price, we have recently experienced. The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øturbances in the French ≈øugar i≈ølands, has ≈øuddenly rai≈øed ≈øome of the markets, which were 20 or 30 per cent. lower than the Briti≈øh, much above it; and thereby occa≈øioned an exportation from this country to ≈øupply the deficiency: and our exportation, though only amounting to a 10th of our importation, has rai≈øed our ≈øugars 50 per cent. And as a fall in the price would ob≈øtruct the Slave Trade, and meliorate the condition of the ≈ølaves; ≈øo this ri≈øe will produce effects the mo≈øt baneful. The planter, tempted by the high price to get ≈øugar and rum to market while that high price continues, will deprive his ≈ølaves of their provi≈øion grounds, to plant them with canes; and by the energy of the whip, they will be forced to the mo≈øt extreme exertions. The murder, or, in the technical language of the We≈øt-Indies, the <hi>lo≈øs</hi> of his ≈ølaves, will be to him but a ≈øecondary con≈øidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The large crop, and the high price, will am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply compen≈øate him: and the que≈øtion now is, not merely whether we ≈øhall hold out to him and induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to purcha≈øe additional ≈ølaves; but whether we ≈øhall tempt him to murder tho≈øe he already has. We can hardly doubt, but that We≈øt India packets have already borne the murderous di≈øpatches, expre≈ø≈øed in language too dreadfully explicit, and to the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing effect. <q>The price of ≈øugar and ruin ≈øtill continues high. You mu≈øt adopt every mode to forward as large a cargo as po≈ø≈øible. A fortunate cri≈øis now offers it≈øelf for extricating my e≈øtate from the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:024233_0035_0FC57C5A953ACC98"/>in which it is involved. We mu≈øt avail our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves of it: another may never occur. Con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, though di≈øagreeable, mu≈øt at the pre≈øent moment be overlooked. The ≈ølave market is ≈øtill open for a ≈øupply. <hi>New-fangted humanity is no more.</hi>
                     </q> The day hardly dawns when the whip re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øounds through tho≈øe regions of horror; nor cea≈øes, till darkne≈øs clo≈øes the ≈øcene, which day after day is renewed. The mi≈øerable victims, de≈øtitute of every ≈øource of comfort to body or to mind, and ≈øinking under the three endemic di≈øea≈øes of our i≈ølands, hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, torture, and extreme labour; and urged to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertions they are unable to ≈øu≈øtain, at length expire beneath the la≈øh, which in vain endeavours to rou≈øe them to a renewal of their labour.</p>
                  <p>As neither the ≈ølave-dealer, nor the planter, can have any moral right to the per≈øon of him they ≈øtile their ≈ølave, to his labour, or to the produce of it; ≈øo they can convey no right in that produce to us: and whatever number of hands it may pa≈øs thro' if the criminal circum≈øtances appertaining to it be known to them at the time of the transfer, they can only have a criminal po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion: and the money paid, either for the ≈ølave, or for the produce of his labour, is paid to obtain that criminal po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion: and can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer no moral right whatever, So, if the death of the per≈øon called a ≈ølave, be occa≈øioned by the criminal po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, the criminal po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øor is guilty of murder; and we, who have knowingly done any act which might occa≈øion his being in that ≈øituation, are acce≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øaries to the murder before the fact; as by receiving the produce of his labour, we are acce≈ø≈øaries to the robbery, after the fact.</p>
                  <p>If we, as individuals concerned in the Slave Trade either by procuring the ≈ølaves, compelling them to
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:024233_0036_0FC57C5CC84A5850"/>labour, or receiving the produce) imagine that our ≈øhare in the tran≈øaction is ≈øo minute that it cannot perceptibly increa≈øe the injury; let us recollect that, though numbers partaking of a crime may dimini≈øh the ≈øhame, they cannot dimini≈øh its turpitude. Can we ≈øuppo≈øe, that an injury of enormous magnitude can take place, and the criminality be de≈øtroyed merely by the criminals becoming ≈øo numerous as to render their re≈øpective ≈øhares indi≈øtingui≈øhable? Were an hundred a≈ø≈øa≈ø≈øins to plunge their daggers into their victim, though each might plead, that without his a≈ø≈øi≈øtance the crime would have been compleated, and that his poinard neigher occa≈øioned nor accelerated the murder, yet every one of them would be guilty of the intire crime. For into how many parts ≈øoever a criminal action may be divided, the crime it≈øelf refts intire and compleat on every perpetrator.</p>
                  <p>But waving this latter con≈øideration, and even ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øing for a moment, that the evil has an exi≈øtence from cau≈øes totally independent of us, yet it exi≈øts; and as we have it in our power jointly with others, to remedy it, it is undoubtedly our duty to contribute our ≈øhare, in hope that others will theirs; and to act that part from con≈øcience, which we ≈øhould from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination in ≈øimilar ca≈øes that intere≈øted our feelings.</p>
                  <p>For in≈øtance: Let us ≈øuppo≈øe the Algerines to e≈øtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li≈øh ≈øugar plantations, and re≈øort to the banks of the Thames for ≈ølaves, as the only place to be in≈øulted with impunity. Suppo≈øe our wives, our hu≈øbands, our children, our parents, our brethren, ≈øwept away, and the fruit of their labour, produced with agonizing hearts and trembling limbs, landed at the port of London. What would be our conduct? Should we ≈øay, Sugar is a nece≈ø≈øary of life? I cannot do without it. Be≈øides, the quantity I u≈øe is but a ≈ømall propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:024233_0037_0FC57C5F70DCFCC8"/>and though it is very criminal of the Algerines to en≈ølave others, yet I am not bound to look to the nature or con≈øequences of the tran≈øaction; and pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the ≈øugar, I have a right to con≈øume it, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it may have been obtained. If ≈øuch would be our language in that ca≈øe, be it ≈øo on the pre≈øent oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca≈øion. For let us recollect, that the only difference is, that in one ca≈øe our relation to the en≈ølaved is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more remote, but that in both ca≈øes they are our brethren.</p>
                  <p>But it is hardly requi≈øite to ≈øtate ≈øo ≈øtrong a ca≈øe as that ≈øuppo≈øed. For were only one Engli≈øhman to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive injuries, that bore but the ≈ølighte≈øt re≈øemblance to tho≈øe daily committed in our i≈ølands, the nation would be inflamed with re≈øentment, and clamorous to avenge the injury. And can our pride ≈øugge≈øt to us, that the rights of men are limited to any nation, or to any colour? Or, were any one to treat a fellow creature in this country as we do the unhappy Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans in the We≈øt-Indies; ≈øtruck with horror, we ≈øhould be zealous to deliver the oppre≈ø≈øed, and puni≈øh the oppre≈ø≈øor. Are then the offices of humanity and functions of ju≈øtice to be circum≈øcribed by geographi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal boundaries? Can rea≈øon, can con≈øcience ju≈øtify this contra≈øt in our conduct, between our prompti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, in the one ca≈øe, and our torpor in the other? Mr. Addi≈øon ju≈øtly ob≈øerves, that "humanity to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come e≈øtimable mu≈øt be combined with ju≈øtice!" But we ≈øeem to act as if we thought that the relief of our fellow-creatures; protection from injuries, commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of benefits, were works of ≈øupererogation, to be granted or with-held, as caprice, or cu≈øtom, or inclination may ≈øugge≈øt.</p>
                  <p>After the important con≈øiderations adduced, it might be reckoned a degradation of the ≈øubject to
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:024233_0038_0FC57C61BAFBB758"/>mention the national dignity; or even that might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce us to counteract a powerful body of men, who are trampling under foot the dictates of humanity, and the intere≈øt of the nation: men, who have in 50 years received for ≈øugar alone, above 70 millions more than it would have co≈øt at any other market. And from Mr. Botham's evidence it appears, that in Bata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via, where labour is as high as in England, ≈øugar, equal to the be≈øt We≈øt-India, is ≈øold at 1 <abbr>d</abbr> half penny per pound. The≈øe are the men, who are endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to overthrow a plan for ≈øupplying us with ≈øugars, by means of free labour; and have the auda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to tell the Briti≈øh legi≈ølature, "That they cannot aboli≈øh the ≈ølave trade; for that if England refu≈øe to furni≈øh them with ≈ølaves, they will obtain a ≈øupply through other channels." And a governor of Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does admoni≈øhes us, "From policy, to leave the i≈ølands to the quiet management of their own affairs." The≈øe nominal colonies have, it ≈øeems, been taught, that we have no right to controul them; that the acts of their A≈ø≈øembles alone are obligatory; and that tho≈øe of Briti≈øh legi≈ølators, are binding only on tho≈øe whom they repre≈øent. The right of en≈ølaving others, they contend for, as the mo≈øt valuable of their privileges.</p>
                  <p>Thus it appears, that the legi≈ølature is not only unwilling, but perhaps unable, to grant redre≈øs; and therefore it is more peculiarly incumbent on us, <hi>To ob≈øtain from the u≈øe of ≈øugar and rum, until our We≈øt-India Planters them≈øelves have prohibited the importa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of additional ≈ølaves, and commenced as ≈øpeedy and effectual a ≈øubver≈øion of ≈ølavery in their i≈ølands, as the circum≈øtances and ≈øituation of the ≈ølaves will admit: or till we can obtain the produce of the ≈øugar cane in ≈øome other mode, unconnected with ≈ølavery, and unpolluted with blood.</hi>

For ≈øurely it may be hoped that we ≈øhall not lamit our views merely to the abolition of the African ≈ølave trade, as the colonial ≈ølavery formed on it, is in its principle equally unju≈øt. For if it be iniquitous to force the Africans from their native land; equally iniquitous mu≈øt it be, to retain them and their po≈øte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in perpetual bondage. Though the African ≈ølave trade be the mo≈øt Prominent feature in this wickedne≈øs, yet it is but a feature: and where it aboli≈øhed, the We≈øt India ≈ølavery would ≈øtill exi≈øt. Our planters would breed, in≈øtead of importing ≈ølaves; and ≈øhall we ≈øuffer half a million of fellow ≈øubjects, and their po≈øterity, to be held in ≈ølavery for ever? I ≈øay, fellow ≈øubjects. For undoubtedly, every per≈øon born in the dominions of Great Britain is a ≈øubject, bound to obey and entitled to the protection of the common law of England; and in oppo≈øition to which the acts of A≈ø≈øemblies, exi≈øting merely by grant from the crown, can be of no authority.</p>
                  <p>In demanding liberty then for the per≈øons called ≈ølaves in our i≈ølands, we demand no more then they are entitled to by the common law of the land. The mo≈øt eligible mode of putting them in po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of their legal and natural right, may be a que≈øtion of difficulty; but it is a que≈øtion that ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øidered with no other view, but to their happine≈øs. The plan to be adopted, ought to be certain and ≈øpeedy in its operation; without any con≈øideration of the ≈øuppo≈øed, or even real intere≈øt, of their oppre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øors: and let it be remembered, that it is in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of a ≈ømall proportion of the people of England to effect it, by refu≈øing to receive the produce. For the planters them≈øelves would adopt the plan, were that the only condition on which we would con≈øume the produce of their i≈ølands: nor would the legi≈ølature be
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:024233_0040_0FC57C66EE186270"/>then harra≈ø≈øed with prepo≈øterous claims for compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øation; which, however unfounded in ju≈øtice or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon, will be ≈øupported by influence, and enforced with clamour.</p>
                  <p>The ca≈øe now fully lies before us; and we have to make our choice, either to join our≈øelves with the≈øe manufacturers of human woe, or to renounce the horrid a≈ø≈øociation. If we adopt the former, let us at lea≈øt have the candour to avow our conduct in its real deformity. Let us no longer affect to deplore the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities attendant on the Slave Trade, of which we are the primary cau≈øe: nor let us pretend to execrate the conduct of the ≈ølave-dealer, the ≈ølave-holder, or the ≈ølave-driver; but apologize for them as our part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in iniquity: and be a≈ø≈øured, that if we now take <hi>our</hi> ≈øhare in the tran≈øaction, we ≈øhould, were we plac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a ≈øimilar ≈øituation with them, with as little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punction take <hi>theirs;</hi> unle≈øs we can ≈øuppo≈øe the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of nature would be ≈øo far inverted, as that we ≈øhould become virtuous, in proportion as the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to vice increa≈øed. Nor ≈øhould we then, any more then now, be de≈øtitute of ≈øubterfuges to de≈øtroy the feelings of our minds, and the convictions of our con≈øciences.</p>
                  <p>If ignorance and inattention may be pleaded as our excu≈øe hitherto, yet that can be the ca≈øe no longer. The ≈øubject has been four years before the public. Its dreadful wickedne≈øs has been fully proved. Every fal≈øhood, every deception with which it has been di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui≈øed, has been compleatly done away; and it ≈øtands before us in all its native horrors. No longer can it be pretended, that Africa is a barbarous, uncultivated land, inhabited by a race of ≈øavages inferior to the re≈øt of the human ≈øpecies. Mr. How, who was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed by government to go up the country, depo≈øes,

                  <p>If the≈øe be the deductions from the mo≈øt obvious principles of rea≈øon, ju≈øtice, and humanity; what mu≈øt be the re≈øult if we extend our views to religious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øiderations?

                  <p>We will therefore a≈øk, if it be meant to in≈øult the God we pretend to wor≈øhip, by ≈øupplicating him to "have mercy upon all pri≈øoners and captives," and to <q>defend and provide for the fatherle≈øs, widows, and children, and all that are de≈øolate and oppre≈ø≈øed.</q> But, if the national religion be a mere matter of form, yet ≈øurely we may expect that the various denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of di≈ø≈øenters, will think it at the lea≈øt as requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øite to di≈ø≈øent from the national crimes, as the nation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al religion; unle≈øs they mean to exhibit con≈øciences of ≈øo peculiar a texture, as to take offence at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of their country, while they can conform with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ≈øcruple, to its mo≈øt criminal practices. If indeed they are ≈øatisfied, after an impartial examination, that the traffic alluded to is fair and hone≈øt, and that the produce ought to be con≈øidered as the re≈øult of lawful commerce, it will become them to encourage it; it will become them to reprobate this work as an attempt to ≈ølander hone≈øt men, and to injure their property, by holding it out to the public, as the produce of rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery and murder. But, if the arguments be valid, will they pre≈øume to treat the ≈øubject with cool indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, and continue a criminal practice? May we not al≈øo hope that the Methodi≈øts, who appear to feel forcibly their principles, will ≈øeriou≈øly con≈øider it?
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:024233_0043_0FC57C6EA0102CF8"/>They are ≈øo numerous, as to be able of them≈øelves to de≈øtroy that dreadful traffic, which is the ≈øole ob≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle to their mini≈øters ≈øpreading the go≈øpel in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten≈øive continent of Africa; and, however others may affect to degrade the Negroes, they are bound to con≈øider thou≈øands of them as their brethren in Chri≈øt.</p>
                  <p>But there is one cla≈øs of diffenters who ju≈øtly ≈øtand high in the public e≈øtimation, for their ≈øteady, manly and uniform oppo≈øition to our colonial ≈ølavery. And can it be ≈øuppo≈øed that, after having awakened the public attention, they can refu≈øe to contribute what is in their own power to remedy the evil? The plan propo≈øed, is a plain and obvious deduction from their uniform principle, of having no concern in what they di≈øapprove. Thus, con≈øidering war as unlawful, they con≈øider goods obtained through that medium as cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minally obtained; and will not ≈øuffer any of their members to purcha≈øe prize-goods: and ≈øurely they mu≈øt con≈øider the ≈øeizure of a man's goods, as a crime far inferior to the ≈øeizing his per≈øon.</p>
                  <p>However obvious the duty, yet the mind hardened by habit, admits with difficulty the conviction of guilt; and ≈øanctioned by a common practice, we may commit the gro≈ø≈øe≈øt violations of duty without remor≈øe. It is therefore more peculiarly incumbent on us in ≈øuch ≈øituations, to examine our conduct with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øt ≈øu≈øpicion, and to fortify our minds with moral principles, or the ≈øanctions of religion. In propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as we are under their influence, we ≈øhall exert our≈øelves to remedy the≈øe evils, knowing that our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, our admonitions, our influence, may produce remote effects, of which we can form no e≈øtimate; and which, after having done our duty, mu≈øt be left to <hi>Him who governs all things after the coun≈øel of his own <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                  <head type="sub">Containing Extracts from an E≈ø≈øay, intitled, an impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Enquiry into the State and Utility of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of Georgia; printed in London in <hi>1741.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>WHEN Georgia was fir≈øt ≈øettled, be≈øides other u≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful regulations, the inhabitants were not allowed to have Negro Slaves. No doubt their objections to them, were founded partly in civil policy, and partly from a ≈øea≈øe of the inju≈øtice and cruelty of that inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man practice, which did not operate, with equal force, upon the minds of all the inhabitants; ≈øome of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing de≈øirous of having the benefit of their labour, whith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out looking into con≈øequences, in a remote degree, either as it re≈øpected their own per≈øonal ≈øafety, or had an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence on the morals and happine≈øs of their immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate offspring, and their po≈øterity: with views ≈øo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, ≈øome ≈øoon grew di≈øcontented with this ≈øalutary re≈øtraint, and petitioned the Governor for liberty to have ≈ølaves. This produced counter petitions, which leaves a favourable opinion of the wi≈ødom and virtue of ≈øome of the fir≈øt ≈øettlers of that ≈øtate, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly of the Saltzburghers who ≈øettled at Ebenezer: the≈øe, to the number of <hi>49</hi> men, with their two mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øters, John Martin Bolzius, and I≈ørael Chri≈øtian Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan, in a petition "be≈øeech the honourable tru≈øtees (of that ≈øettlement) not to allow that any Negroes might be brought to their place, or in their neighbourhood." And with re≈øpect to its being "impo≈ø≈øible and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
<pb facs="unknown:024233_0045_0FC57C734B215998"/>for white people to plant and manufacture rice" in that climate, "as being a work only for Negroes, not for European people," they ≈øay, "having experience to the contrary, we laugh at ≈øuch talking, ≈øeeing that ≈øeveral of us have had a greater crop of rice la≈øt year, than we wanted for our own con≈øumption." And the inhabitants of Frederica, upon the ≈øame occa≈øion, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioned again≈øt having Negroes introduced among≈øt them, "but de≈øi≈øted from ≈øending it, upon an a≈ø≈øurance that their apprehen≈øions of it were needle≈øs."</p>
                  <p>But the following petition of the Highlanders from Scotland, who had ≈øettled at New-Inverne≈øs in Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia, is de≈øerving of particular attention, as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains ≈øentiments congenial with tho≈øe advanced in the fir≈øt of the≈øe treati≈øes; and does credit to the di≈øcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, probity and humanity of the ance≈øtors of that ≈øet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement. In this petition they remon≈øtrate to their then Governor Oglethorpe, that they <q>were informed, that their neighbours of Savannah had petitioned for the liberty of having ≈ølaves;</q> in con≈øequence of which they ≈øay, <q>We hope, and earne≈øtly entreat, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ≈øuch propo≈øals are hearkened unto, your Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency will con≈øider our ≈øituation, and of what dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and bad con≈øequences ≈øuch liberty would be of to us.</q> Then after reciting ≈øome of the≈øe they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed:</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>It is ≈øhocking to human nature, that any race of mankind, and their po≈øterity, ≈øhould be ≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced to perpetual ≈ølavery; nor in ju≈øtice can we think otherwi≈øe of it, than that they are thrown among≈øt us to be our ≈øcourge, one day or other, for our ≈øins: and as freedom mu≈øt be as dear to them as to us, what a ≈øcene of horror mu≈øt it bring about! And the longer it is unexecuted, the bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ≈øcene mu≈øt be the greater: We therefore, for our
<pb facs="unknown:024233_0046_0FC57C76AEC00480"/>own ≈øakes our wives and children, and our po≈øte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, beg your con≈øideration, and intreat, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtead of introducing ≈ølaves, you will put us in the way to get ≈øome of our own countrymen, who with their labour in time of peace, and our vigilance, if we are invaded (with the help of the≈øe) will ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it a difficult thing to hurt us, or that part of the province we po≈ø≈øe≈øs.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Dated <q>New-Inverne≈øs, January <hi>3, 1738-9,</hi>
                     </q> and ≈øigned by <hi>18</hi> freeholders.</p>
                  <p>As the ≈øentiments contained in the above petitions are expre≈ø≈øed with a con≈øiderable degree of energy, and are peculiarly favourable to the cau≈øe of humanity, with an explicit and clear declaration of their di≈øapprobation of holding Negroes in a ≈øtate of ≈ølavery on account of its impolicy and inju≈øtice, as well as from other alarming con≈øiderations; and as they have proceeded from the ance≈øtors of a people, who≈øe repre≈øentative in a former Congre≈øs, was a di≈øtingui≈øhed advocate for continuing the ≈ølave trade, they are added; hoping, that the vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration they may entertain, for characters ≈øo truly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerving as the≈øe Inverne≈øs petitioners and Saltzburghers of Ebenezer were, may induce a more candid reception of the foregoing pamphlets in that and other Southern ≈øtates.</p>
