            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>VIRTUE, ſay moraliſts, is ſo tranſcendently beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, that ſhe need but be <hi>ſeen,</hi> to be univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally admired: and is not VICE ſo hateful, that the more its features are <hi>viewed,</hi> the more it will be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided? The traffic in the human ſpecies, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly as carried on by the Europeans on the coaſt of Africa, has ſo horrible an aſpect, that nothing, one ſhould think, but the MASK, under which it has been concealed, could have prevented all the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilized nations in the world uniting to drive the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted Monſter from the face of the earth. This MASK is, however, at length taken away, and the traffic ſtands expoſed in all its real, unalterable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity. The PEOPLE are now called upon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, to feel, and judge for themſelves. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations of former writers on this ſubject were roundly denied; the facts they ſtated were not only contradicted, but deemed impoſſible, and the authors themſelves were accuſed of ſlander. Now we have a body of EVIDENCE to which to appeal; of evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, poſſeſſing every eſſential of <hi>credibility.</hi> The witneſſes have declared before the Select Committee of the Houſe of Commons, what they themſelves ſaw: they had the beſt opportunities of obſervation, and they are diſintereſted. And now it appears, that one half of the tale of human miſery hath not been told; and that every principle, that can bind a man
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:024233_0004_0FC57C0CE7F2C6B0"/>of honour and conſcience,<note n="*" place="bottom">Speech of the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the the Houſe of Commons.</note> loudly calls for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition of the iniquitous traffic. Hard indeed muſt thoſe hearts be, and inacceſſible thoſe underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.<note n="†" place="bottom">Fox's ditto.</note> which ſuch evidence cannot reach!</p>
                  <p>The Evidence delivered before the Select Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee of the Houſe of Commons is very voluminous, occupying two thouſand pages in folio. But a judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Abſtract and Arrangement of the Evidence, on the Part of the Petitioners for the Abolition of the Slave Trade,<note n="‡" place="bottom">Printed by J. Phillips, George-Yard, Lombard Street.</note> has been publiſhed, and in a ſhort compaſs, contains the evidence of well informed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons on that ſubject.</p>
                  <p>In the PREFACE to this important volume of evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence we read of rewards offered for taking run-away negroes <hi>alive or dead</hi>—of laws being required to be made to prevent the practice of <hi>cutting off ears, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and tongues—of breaking limbs</hi> and <hi>putting out eyes</hi>—to prevent <hi>diſtempered, maimed, and worn out negroes</hi> from infeſting towns—to prevent <hi>aged</hi> and <hi>infirm</hi> negroes being driven from the plantations <hi>to ſtarve.</hi> We meet alſo with ſuch kind of PREAM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BLES to acts as the following, viz.</p>
                  <p>'Whereas the extreme cruelty and inhumanity of the managers, overſeers, and book-keepers of eſtates, have frequently driven ſlaves into the woods, and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned rebellions, internal inſurrections, &amp;c. And whereas alſo it frequently happens, that ſlaves come to their deaths by haſty and ſevere blows and other improper treatment of overſeers and book-keepers, in the heat of paſſion; and when ſuch accidents do happen, the victims are entered in the plantation-books
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:024233_0005_0FC57C0E93EC3458"/>books, as having died of convulſions, fits, or other cauſes not to be accounted for; and to conceal the real truth of the cauſe of the death of ſuch ſlave or ſlaves, he or they is or are immediately put under ground, &amp;c. Other preambles of a ſimilar complex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, reſpecting the lodging, food, and clothes of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes, are here to be met with. We alſo find that run-away negroes, when advertiſed, are deſcribed by the various brands upon their ſhoulders, breaſts, cheeks, and foreheads. A woman is deſcribed with a wooden leg; a man as having both his ears cropt, and another by his noſe and ears being cut off.' Cornwall Chronicle, Nov. 7, 1789. Other inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces occur within the year 1791.</p>
                  <p>The FIRST CHAPTER contains an account of the Enormities committed by the Natives of Africa on the perſons of one another, to procure ſlaves for the Europeans, proved by the teſtimony of ſuch as have viſited that continent—and confirmed by accounts from the ſlaves themſelves, after their arrival in the Weſt-Indies.</p>
                  <p>Under this head, we learn that Kidnapping, or as the natives call it, Panyaring, is very common, that war is made on purpoſe to procure ſlaves. The king's ſoldiers ſot fire to villages in the night, and ſeize the wretched inhabitants as they attempt to eſcape from the flames, and many periſh, either by the fire or ſword, in the execution of this horrid pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. A Boy, who was carried away in the night from his father's houſe, ſays, he believes both his parents were killed, he is ſure that one was, and that many others were killed and ſome taken. Various inſtances are mentioned of conſummate treachery em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in making captives. Kidnapping is profeſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally followed; large parties go up the country three
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:024233_0006_0FC57C14E74C9F88"/>hundred miles to drive down captives—they go a wood ranging, and pick up every one they meet, and ſtrip them naked. The purchaſers generally ſay, they do not care how the ſellers come by their ſlaves. Many are ſold for crimes falſely imputed; the Judges participate the profits of the ſale, and are therefore ſtrongly induced to condemn the innocent. Crimes are invented and multiplied for the purpoſe of traffic. The great men dreſs up and employ wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, to entice young men to be connected with them, that they may be convicted of adultery and ſold. The ſlaves are ſeparated without the leaſt regard to ties of conſanguinity, or the pathetic expoſtulations and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances of nature. When ſlave-ſhips are on the Coaſt the natives go armed, but are no where ſafe. The man, invited to drink with his neighbour, on ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to go, is ſeized by two of them and a large dog: and this mode of ſeizure is common.</p>
                  <p>By the Second Chapter it appears that the Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peans, by means of the trade in ſlaves, are the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the before-mentioned enormities; that they ſometimes uſe additional means to excite the natives to practiſe them, often attempt themſelves to ſteal the natives, and ſucceed, force trade as they pleaſe, and are guilty of injuſtice in their dealings. In proof of this charge, we learn from the evidence, that Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans receive European goods in exchange for ſlaves— that they declare when ſhips ceaſe to come (as in times of war) ſlaves ceaſe to be taken. African dealers make the Princes drunk, in order to overcome their averſion to unprovoked war: they furniſh the natives with arms and ammunition and excite them to pillage.</p>
                  <p>The term war, in Africa, is uſed in general to ſignify pillage; and when many towns are ſeen bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:024233_0007_0FC57C15E70987C0"/>in the night, the natives ſay war is carrying on.</p>
                  <p>The Traders advance goods to Chiefs to induce them to ſeize their ſubjects or neighbours. Capt. Patterſon ſet two villages at variance, and brought priſoners from both ſides. It is not uncommon to make the natives drunk, and then buy them. Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Rooke ſays, that it was propoſed to him by three Engliſh captains of ſhips, to kidnap a hundred, or a hundred and fifty men, women, and children, king Damel's ſubjects, who had come to Goree in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the friendly intercourſe between him and Damel: He refuſed and was much ſhocked by the propoſition. They ſaid ſuch things had been done by a former governor. Two men, black traders, were invited on board, intoxicated, and captured when aſleep. The Gregſon's people, in running down the coaſt, kidnapped thirty-two of the natives. The Dobſon's boat of Liverpool had ſtolen a man and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; the captain on the remonſtrance of Capt. Briggs, who told him, there would be no more trade if he did not deliver up his two captives, reſtored them; upon which the natives loaded a boat with yams, goats, fowls, honey, and palm wine, and would take nothing for them,—a ſtriking inſtance of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of injuries, and of unmerited kindneſs!</p>
                  <p>We then meet with as oppoſite an exhibition of character as can poſſibly be conceived: three or four hundred Africans cruelly maſſacreed or carried off, by means of the treacherous contrivance of ſix En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh captains in Old Calabar River. But let us "turn our eyes for relief to ſome ordinary wickedneſs"<note n="*" place="bottom">Wilberforce's Speech in the Houſe of Commons</note>: Some conſider frauds as a neceſſary part of the traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic; they put falſe heads into powder caſks, cut off two or three yards from the middle of a piece of
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:024233_0008_0FC57C176FEA9A00"/>cloth, adulterate ſpirits, and ſteal back articles given. Beſides theſe, there are others who pay in bottles, which hold but half the contents of the ſamples ſhewn; uſe falſe ſteel-yards and weights, and ſell ſuch guns as burſt on firing; ſo that many of the natives of the windward coaſt, are without their fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and thumbs on this account, and it has become a ſaying that theſe guns kill more out of the butt man the muzzle.</p>
                  <p>The Third Chapter contains an account of the tranſactions of the enſlaved Africans, and of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of confining, airing, feeding, and exerciſing them; incidents on the paſſage, and the manner of ſelling them when arrived at their deſtined ports; the deplorable ſituation of the refuſe or ſickly ſlaves; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of relations and friends; mortality on the paſſage, and frequently after ſale; and the cauſes of this mortality.</p>
                  <p>On being brought on board, ſays Dr. Trotter, they ſhew ſigns of extreme diſtreſs and deſpair, from a feeling of their ſituation, and regret at being torn from their friends and connexions. They ſometimes dream of being in their own country, and when they awake ſhew their deſpair by howling and ſhrieking in a moſt dreadful manner. The women go into fits. In the courſe of the voyage, the ſlaves are chained to the deck every day from eight in the morning to four o'clock in the afternoon. They are fed twice a day with rice, yeams, and horſe-beans, and now and then a little beef and bread: after each of theſe two meals they are allowed half a pint of water; and are forced to jump in their irons, which, by the ſlave dealers, is called making them dance. This exerciſe frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly occaſions the fetters to excoriate their limbs; and, when it is very painful to move at all, they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
<pb facs="unknown:024233_0009_0FC57C1DB3F1DA00"/>to dance by a cat-of-nine-tails. The captains order them to ſing, and they ſing ſongs of ſorrow, the ſubject of which are their wretched ſituation, and the idea of never returning home: the witneſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members the very words upon theſe occaſions.</p>
                  <p>The ſlaves are ſo crouded below, that it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to walk among them without treading upon them. Dr. Trotter has ſeen the ſlaves drawing their breath with all thoſe laborious and anxious efforts for life, which are obſerved in expiring animals, ſubjected by experiment to foul air, or in the exhauſted receiver of an air pump: they cry out—'we are dying,' and many are irrecoverably loſt by ſuffocation, having had no previous ſigns of indiſpoſition. They are cloſely wedged together, and have not ſo much room as a man in his coſſin, either in length or breadth. They ſometimes go down well at night, and are found dead in the morning. Alexander Falconbridge was never among them for ten minutes together below, but his ſhirt was as wet as if dipped in water. Sometimes the dead and living are found ſhackled together. They lie on the bare blanks, and the prominent parts of their bones, about the ſhoulder-blade and knees, have frequently been ſeen bare. No ſituation can be conceived ſo dreadful and diſguiſting as that of ſlaves when ill of the flux. In the Alexander (A. Falcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge ſays) the deck was covered with blood and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus, and reſembled a ſlaughter-houſe; the ſtench and foul air were intolerable. The ſlaves, ſhackled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, frequently quarrel, and make a great diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Some refuſe food and medicine, and declare they want to die. In ſuch caſes compulſion is uſed. The ſhips are ſo fitted up as to prevent, by net-work, the flaves jumping overboard; notwithſtanding which they often attempt it, and ſometimes ſucceed, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:024233_0010_0FC57C209A71AB28"/>ſigns of exultation in the very jaws of death. Some employ other means to deſtroy themſelves, and others go mad. Some reſolve to ſtarve, and means are ineffectually uſed to wrench open their teeth: they perſiſt in their reſolution, and effect their purpoſe, in ſpite of the utmoſt pains to prevent it. When ſeverely chaſtiſed for not taking their food, they have looked up with a ſmile and ſaid, "preſently we ſhall be no more." The thum ſcrew is an inſtrument of torture, the application of it ſometimes occaſions mortifications, of which the negroes die. An in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance occurs of the cruelty of a captain to an infant only nine months old, which one would ſuppoſe too ſhocking to be true, were it not corroborated by other ſpecimens of as great cruelty in various parts of the evidence. After a ſeries of tortures the infant ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired, and its ſavage murderer, not yet ſatiated, would ſuffer none of the people on deck to throw the body overboard, but called the Mother, the wretched Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to perform this laſt ſad office to her murdered child. Unwilling as it might naturally be ſuppoſed ſhe was, to comply, "he beat her," regardleſs of the indignant murmurs of her ſettered countrymen, whom in the barbarous plenitude of ſecure tyranny, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to be ſpectators of this horrible ſcene—"he beat her, until he made her take up the child and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it to the ſide of the veſſel, and then ſhe dropped it into the ſea, turning her head another way, that ſhe might not ſee it!"<note n="*" place="bottom">Speech by W. Smith in the Houſe of Commons.</note> Another inſtance occurs in this chapter, not perhaps of more cruelty, though of greater magnitude.</p>
                  <p>A ſhip from Africa, with about four hundred ſlaves on board, ſtruck upon ſome ſhoals, called the Morant Keys, diſtant eleven leagues, S. S. E. off the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:024233_0011_0FC57C21F0F5B4E8"/>eaſt end of Jamaica. The officers and ſeamen of the ſhip landed in their boats, carrying with them arms and proviſions. The ſlaves were left on board in their irons and ſhackles. This happened in the night time. When morning came, it was diſcovered that the negroes had got out of their irons, and were bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy making rafts, upon which they placed the women and children; the men, who were capable of ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, attended upon the rafts, whilſt they drifted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the wind towards the iſland where the ſeamen had landed. From an apprehenſion that the negroes would conſume the water and proviſions which the ſeamen had landed, they came to the reſolution of deſtroying them, by means of their fire-arms and other weapons. As the poor wretches approached the ſhore they actually deſtroyed between three and four hundred of them. Out of the whole cargo only thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty three or thirty four were ſaved and brought to Kingſton, where they were ſold at public vendue.</p>
                  <p>When the ſhips arrive at their deſtined ports, the cargo of ſlaves is ſold, either by ſcramble or ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due. The ſale by ſcramble is deſcribed:—"A great number of people come on board with tallies in their hande (the ſhip being firſt darkened with ſails and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered round; the men ſlaves placed on the main deck, and the women on the quarter deck) and ruſh through the barricado door with the the ferocity of brures. Some have three or four handkerchiefs tied together, to encircle as many as they think ſit for their purpoſe. This is a very general mode of ſale, and ſo terrifies the poor negroes, that forty or fifty at a time have leaped into the ſea; theſe, however, the witneſs believes, have been taken up again: the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men have got away, and run about the town as if they were mad. The ſlaves ſold by public auction or ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:024233_0012_0FC57C23675346A8"/>are generally the refuſe, or ſickly ſlaves. Theſe are in ſuch a ſtate of health, that they ſell greatly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der price. They have been known to be ſold for five dollars, a guinea, and even a ſingle dollar each. Some that are deemed not worth buying are left to expire in the place of ſale, for nobody gives them any thing to eat or drink, and ſome of them live three days in that ſituation! In the ſale no care is taken to prevent the ſeparation of relations; they are ſeparated (ſays the evidence) like ſheep and lambs by the butcher. Making the ſlaves walk the plank, is a term uſed for throwing them overboard when proviſions are ſcarce. Sometimes the ſhips loſe more than half their cargoes by the ſmall-pox; at others they bury a quarter or one-third on the paſſage, owing to various other cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of mortality: and it is confeſſed by the planters,<note n="*" place="bottom">See Stanley's Speech in the Houſe of Commons.</note> that half the ſlaves die in the ſeaſoning, after arrival in the Weſt-Indies. Surgeon Wilſon ſays, that of the death of two-thirds of thoſe who died in his ſhip, the primary cauſe was melancholy. The diſorders which carry off the ſlaves in ſuch numbers, are aſcribed by Falconbridge to a diſeaſed mind, ſudden tranſitions from heat to cold, a putrid atmoſphere, wallowing in their own excrements, and being ſhackled together.</p>
                  <p>The captains, ſurgeons, &amp;c. who have quitted the African ſlave-trade, uniformly declare the reaſon to have been, that they could not conſcientiouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in it: they ſay, that it is an unnatural, ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitous, and villainous trade, founded on injuſtice and treachery; manifeſtly carried on by oppreſſion and cruelty, and not unfrequently terminating in murder. Capt. Hall ſays, he quitted it (in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to lucrative offers) from a conviction that it was perfectly illegal, and founded in blood.</p>

The Fourth Chapter gives an account of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral eſtimation and treatment of the ſlaves in the Weſt-Indies. Dr. Jackſon ſays, that the negroes are generally eſteemed a ſpecies of inferior beings, whom the right of purchaſe gives the owner a power of uſing at his will. T. Wooldrich ſays, he never knew the beſt maſter in the Weſt-Indies uſe his ſlaves ſo well, as the worſt maſter his ſervants in England: that their ſtate is inconceivable—that a ſight of a gang would convince more than all words.</p>
                  <p>Slaves are either Field Slaves, or in or out Door Slaves.</p>
                  <p>The field-ſlaves begin their work at break of day. They work in rows, without exception under the whip of drivers, and the weak are made to keep up with the ſtrong. They continue their labour (with two intermiſſions, half an hour during the morning, and two hours at noon) till ſun ſet. In the intervals they are made to pick graſs for the cattle. Cook has known pregnant women worked and flogged a few days before their delivery. Some, however, are a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle indulged when in that ſtate. After the month they work with the children on their backs. In the crop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſon the labour is of much longer duration<note n="*" place="bottom">in ſome eſtates it is uſual to dig a hole in the ground, which they put the bellies of pregnant women, while they whip them, that they may not excuſe puniſhment, nor yet endanger the life of the woman of child.</note>. The ſlaves ſometimes work ſo long that they cannot help ſleeping, and then it not unfrequently happens, that their arms are caught in the mill and torn off. They are ſaid to be allowed one day in ſeven for reſt, but this time is neceſſarily employed in raiſing food for the other days, and gathering graſs for their maſters cattle. The beſt allowance of food is at Barbadoes, which is a pint of grain for twenty four hours, and half a rotten herring when to be had. When the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:024233_0014_0FC57C28A528F080"/>herrings are unfit for the whites, they are bought up by planters for the ſlaves. Some allow nine pints of corn a week, and about one pound of ſalt fiſh, which is the greateſt allowance mentioned in the whole courſe of the evidence. Some have no proviſion but what they raiſe themſelves, and they are frequently ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigned by the labour of the reſt of the week, as ſcarcely to be able to work for their own ſupport on the Sunday. And the land allotted them for this purpoſe is often at the diſtance of three miles from their houſes; it would, however, be quite ample for their ſupport, were they allowed time ſufficient for its cultivation. Sometimes when they have been at the pains of clearing their land, their maſters take it for canes, and give them wood land inſtead of it. This hardſhip ſome have ſo taken to heart as to die. Putrid carcaſes are burnt; if they were buried, the ſlaves would dig them up and eat them, which would breed diſtempers among them. They are ſometimes driven by extreme hunger to ſteal at the hazard of their lives. They are badly clothed; one half of them go almoſt naked. The ſlaves in general have no bed or bedding at all. Their houſes are built with four poles and thatched. They have little or no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty. All the evidence (to whom the queſtion has been propoſed) agree in anſwering, that they never knew or heard of a field-ſlave ever amaſſing ſuch a ſum, as enabled him to purchaſe his own freedom. The arificers, ſuch as houſe carpenters, coopers, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, the drivers and head ſlaves, are better off. The owners of women let them out for proſtitution, and flog them, if they do not bring home full wages.</p>
                  <p>The negroes, when whipped, are ſuſpended by the arms, with weights at their feet. They are firſt whipped with a whip made of cow-ſkin (which cuts
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:024233_0015_0FC57C2ADC2A8A70"/>out the fleſh, whereas the military whips cut only the ſkin,) and afterwards with ebony buſhes (which are more prickly than thorn buſhes in this country,) in order to let out the congealed blood. Dr. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon thinks the whipping too ſevere to be inflicted on any human being: he could lay two or three fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers into the wounds of a man whipped for not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when he was called. Many receive from one hundred and fifty to two hundred laſhes at a time; and in two or three days this is repeated: they waſh the raw parts with pickle; this appears from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions it occaſions, more cruel than whipping; but it is done to prevent mortification. After ſevere whipping, they are worked all day without food, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept what their friends may give them out of their own poor pittance. They are returned to the ſtocks at night, and worked next day as before. This cruel treatment has made many commit ſuicide. Cook has known fourteen ſlaves, who, in conſequence thereof, ran into the woods and cut their throats together. Theſe ſevere puniſhments are frequent. The ſcars made by whipping laſt to old age. T. Wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich has ſeen their backs one undiſtinguiſhed maſs of lumps, holes, and furrows. They ſometimes die of mortification of the wounds. A planter flogged his driver to death, and boaſted of having ſo done.</p>
                  <p>Under the head of Extraordinary Puniſhments (for thoſe already named are reckoned only ordinary,) men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made of iron collars with hooks<note n="*" place="bottom">General Tottenham ſaw a youth, about nineteen, walking in the ſtreets, in a moſt deplorable ſituation, entirely naked, and with an iron collar about his neck, with five long pproctig ſpikes. His body, before and behind, his breech, belly and thighs, were almoſt cut to pieces, and with running ſores all over them, and you might put your finger in ſome of the wheals. He could not ſit down, owing to his breech being in a ſtate of mortification, and it was impoſſible for him to lie down, from the projection of the prongs. The boy came to the general to aſk relief. He was ſhocked at his appearance, and aſked him what he had done to ſuffer ſuch a puniſhment, and who inflicted it. He ſaid it was his maſter, who lived about two miles from town, and that as he could not work, he would give him nothing to eat.</note>, heavy cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:024233_0016_0FC57C2BA6116C20"/>chains, and a half hundred weight faſtened to them, which the negroes are forced to drag after them, when working in the field, ſuſpending by the hands 'till the fingers mortify; flogging with ebony buſhes 'till they are forced to go on all fours, unable to get up, being tied up to the branch of a tree, with a heavy weight round the neck, expoſed to the noon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day ſun—thumb-ſcrews; a man was put on the pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, ſo long as to occaſion a mortification of his foot and hand, on ſuſpicion of robbing his maſter, a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic officer, of a ſum of money, which it afterwards appeared, the maſter had taken himſelf. Yet the maſter was privy to the puniſhment, and the ſlave had no compenſation. He was puniſhed by order of the maſter, who did not then chuſe to make it known that he himſelf had made uſe of the money. A girl's ears were nailed to a poſt, afterwards torn away, and clipt off cloſe to her head, with a pair of large ſciſſars; beſides this, ſhe was unmercifully flogged, and all for—BREAKING A PLATE, OR SPILLING A CUP OF TEA! A negro, impelled by hunger, had ſtolen part of a turkey, his maſter cauſed him to be held down, and, with his own hands, took a hammar and punch and knocked out four of his teeth. The hand is cut off if lifted up againſt a white man, and the leg for running away. A planter ſent for a ſurgeon to cut off the leg of a negro who had run away. On the ſurgeon's refuſing to do it, the planter took an iron bar, and broke the leg in pieces, and then the ſurge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on took it off. This planter did many ſuch acts of cruelty, and all with impunity. The practice of drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping hot lead upon the negroes, is here mentioned. H. Roſs ſaw a young female ſuſpended by her wriſts
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:024233_0017_0FC57C2D27000628"/>to a tree, ſwinging to and fro, while her maſter appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a lighted torch to the different parts of her writh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing body. It was notorious that Ruſhie tortured ſo many of his negroes to death, that he was obliged to ſell his eſtate. Another planter, in the ſame Iſland<note n="§" place="bottom">Jamaica.</note>, deſtroyed forty ſlaves out of ſixty (in three years) by ſeverity. The reſt of the conduct of this infamous wretch was cancelled by the Committee of the Houſe of Commons, as containing circumſtances too hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible to be given to the world. We, however, go on to read of knocking on the head and ſtabbing, of a hot iron forced between the teeth, of a ſlave thrown into the boiling juice, and killed, of a negro ſhot and his head cut off. And it appears, that the women, deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of reſpectability and rank, not only order and ſuperintend, but ſometimes actually inflict with their own hands ſevere puniſhments on their ſlaves.</p>
                  <p>The offences for which the before-mentioned pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments are inflicted are, not coming into the field in time, not picking a ſufficient quantity of graſs, not appearing willing to work, when in fact ſick and not able; for ſtaying too long on an errand, for not coming immediately when called, for not bringing home (the women) the full weekly ſum enjoined by their owners; for running away, and for theft, to which they are often driven by hunger.</p>
                  <p>Under the head of "Extraordinary Puniſhments," ſome appear to have ſuffered for running away, or for lifting up a hand againſt a white man, or for break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a plate, or ſpilling a cup of tea, or to extort con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. Others again, in the moments of ſudden re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment, and one on a diabolical pretext, which the maſter held out to the world to conceal his own vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany, and which he <hi>knew</hi> to be <hi>falſe.</hi>

The ſlaves have little or no redreſs againſt ill-uſage of any ſort; the laws to reſtrict puniſhment are a mere farce, and univerſally diſregarded, or when pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be obſerved they are in divers ways ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually evaded: beſides, the evidence of a Black is in no caſe whatever admitted againſt a White Man; which circumſtance alone is enough to deprive the negroes of all legal protection whatever, were the laws, in other reſpects, ever ſo juſt and ſalutary. Lieutenant Davidſon was ſo hurt at the ſevere and frequent whippings of one of the women, that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained to a magiſtrate, who ſaid, "he had nothing to do with it."</p>
                  <p>The particular inſtances mentioned in the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, of ſlaves dying in conſequence of ſevere and cruel treatment from their maſters, were not puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, though generally known; nor do the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trators of theſe barbaraties appear to have ſuffered any diſgrace!</p>
                  <p>If you ſpeak to a negro of future puniſhments, he ſays,—"Why ſhould a poor negro be puniſhed? he does no wrong? fiery cauldrons, and ſuch things, are reſerved for white people, as puniſhments for the oppreſſion of ſlaves."</p>
                  <p>In the Fifth Chapter, it is proved, by ſuch as have ſeen them in their own country, that the natives of Africa are equal to the Europeans in their natural ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parities, feelings, affections, and moral character. They manufacture gold and iron, in ſome reſpects, equal to the European Artiſts—alſo cloth and leather with uncommon neatneſs; the former they die blue, yellow, brown and orange. They are ſkilled in making indigo and ſoap, and pottery wares, and prepare ſalt for their own uſe from the ſea water. They alſo make ropes with aloes. With reſpect to their moral
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:024233_0019_0FC57C33E18B0D28"/>character, they are very honeſt and hoſpitable: grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and affectionate, harmleſs and innocent; punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al in their dealings, and as capable of virtue as the Whites. They are ſuſceptible of all the ſocial virtues: generoſity, fidelity, and gratitude, are allowed them by Dr. Stuart. Thoſe virtues Dr. Jackſon enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, and adds charity to all in diſtreſs, and a ſtrong attachment on the part of parents to their children, T. Woolrich ſays, he never knew of an African, who could expreſs himſelf, that did not believe in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence of a ſupreme Being.</p>
                  <p>In the Sixth and Seventh Chapters it appears that the natives poſſeſs induſtry and a ſpirit of commerce, ſufficient for carrying on a new trade; that their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try abounds with, and might eaſily be made ſtill more productive of, many and various articles of commerce; but that the traffic in ſlaves is an inſuperable impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to opening a new trade.</p>
                  <p>In the Eighth Chapter it is inquired, whether the ſlave trade be not a grave (inſtead of a nurſery) of the ſeamen employed in it</p>
                  <p>It appears by the muſter-rolls of Liverpool and Briſtol, that in 350 veſſels, 12, 263 men were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, out of whom 2643 were loſt, that is to ſay, more than a fifth of the whole number employed, or more than ſeven in every ſingle voyage, beſides near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one half of thoſe who go out with the ſhips are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly left behind.</p>
                  <p>Capt. Hall (of the merchant's ſervice) ſays that the crews of the African ſhips, when they arrive in the Weſt Indies, are the moſt miſerable objects he ever met with in any country in his life: he does not know a ſingle inſtance to the contrary. He has frequently ſeen them with their toes rotted off, their legs ſwelled to the ſize of their thighs, and in an ulcerated ſtate all
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:024233_0020_0FC57C34C93AE270"/>over, &amp;c. &amp;c. This account is confirmed by Capt. Hall of the navy. Sir W. Young is of opinion, that a trade to Africa in the natural productions of the country, would not be attended with more inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the health of the ſeamen employed in it, than the preſent Weſt-India Trade.</p>
                  <p>In the Ninth Chapter we find that the ſeamen em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the ſlave trade are in general barbarouſly uſed. They are worſe fed both in quantity and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of food than the ſeamen in other trades. They have little or no ſhelter night or day from the incle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency of the weather during the whole of the middle paſſage. They are inhumanly treated when ill, and ſubjected to the fury of the impaſſioned officers for very trifles. A boy, to avoid the cruel treatment of his officer. jump'd overboard, and was drowned. A man was killed with a hand ſpike for being very ill and unable to work. Six men were chained together by their necks, legs, and hands, for making their eſcape from the veſſel; they were allowed only a plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a day; they all died in their chains; one of them (Thomas Jones a very good ſeaman) raving mad! The evidence proves that inſtances of wanton cruelty, and in human treatment in general, are nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, various and frequent. One man, with both his legs in irons and his neck in an iron collar, was chained to the boat for three months, and very often moſt inhumanly beaten for complaining of his ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, both by the captain and other officers. His al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance of proviſions was ſo ſmall that (after his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe from the boat, on account of extreme weakneſs) he begged ſomething to eat, ſaying that if it were not given him he ſhould die:—the captain reproached him, beat him, and bid him die and be damned. The man died in the night. This was in the Ship Sally,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:024233_0021_0FC57C362BCB9BE0"/>on board of which ill-treatment was common. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man was deliberately, by a ſeries of ſhocking bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barities, murdered.</p>
                  <p>Sir Geo. Young remarks that a ſhip of the line might be preſently manned by the ſailors who wiſh to eſcape from the miſeries of African ſhips. One poor young man, when dying in conſequence of the ill treatment he had received from the captain, ſaid (which were the laſt words A. Falconbridge heard him ſpeak) "I cannot puniſh him (meaning the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain) but God will." The ſailors when ſick are beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en for being lazy, till they die under the blows!</p>
                  <p>"If this be the real ſituation of things, how hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens it (the reader may perhaps aſk) that the objects of ſuch tyranny and oppreſſion ſhould not obtain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, and that our courts of law ſhould not have to decide upon more caſes of this kind, than they have at preſent?" It is anſwered, "theſe objects are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally without friends and money, without which the injured will ſeek for juſtice but in vain; and becauſe the peculiarity of their ſituation is an impediment to their endeavours for redreſs." Whoever wiſhes for a more particular anſwer to this queſtion, may meet with it in "Clarkſon's Eſſay on the Impolicy of the African Slave-Trade," (page 52) from which the queſtion and the above general reply are quoted.</p>
                  <p>If it ſhould ſtill be aſked, "how it happens that ſeamen enter for ſlave veſſels, when ſuch general ill uſage on board of them can hardly fail of being known?" the reply muſt be taken from the evidence, "that whereas ſome of them enter voluntarily, the greater part of them are trepanned; for that it is the buſineſs of certain landlords to make them intoxicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and get them into debt, after which <hi>their only al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternative is a Guineaman or a Goal.</hi>

In the Tenth Chapter it is proved not to be true, what ſome ſay, that the natives of Africa are happier in the European colonies than in their own country. They love their own country, but deſtroy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the colonies, &amp;c. &amp;c. But any compariſon between the two ſituations is as (H. Roſs ſays, tho' on another occaſion) <hi>"an inſult to common-ſenſe."</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Eleventh, Twelfth, and Thirteenth Chapters are on the ſubject of negro population in the colonies, and plainly ſhew that the importation of freſh Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans might immediately be ſuperceded, by the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of general good treatment, and of ecertain ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutary regulations therein ſuggeſted.</p>
                  <p>The Fourteenth Chapter is employed to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, from the evidence before the committee, that the coloniſts would be able to carry on the neceſſary cultivation of their lands, without a freſh importation of ſlaves while the generation immediately ſucceeding the regulations propoſed, were growing up to ſupply the vacancies occaſioned by the natural deaths of the ſlaves of all ages, now in their poſſeſſion.</p>
                  <p>The Fifteenth Chapter inquires, whether there be not a prevailing opinion in the colonies, that it is cheaper to buy or import ſlaves than thus to increaſe them by population. And whether the very reverſe of this opinion be not true: namely, that it is more profitable to breed than to import. The reſult of this inquiry is clearly in favour of the <hi>immediate</hi> Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition of the African Slave Trade. The ſame may be ſaid of the ſixteenth <hi>and laſt</hi> chapter, in which it is conſidered. Whether it be more political to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the cultivation of the colonies by the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the ſlave-trade, or wait till the riſing genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhall be capable of performing it.</p>
                  <p>Having thus taken a general view of the moſt
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:024233_0023_0FC57C3C26A12518"/>ſtriking features of the evidence for the abolition of the traffic in the human ſpecies, as carried on by the Engliſh on the coaſt of Africa, it might not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper to cloſe it with the declaration of a virtuous and wiſe Senator, whoſe indefatigable labours on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the oppreſſed Africans, cannot fail to inſure him the unfeigned reſpect of every lover of freedom and humanity:</p>
                  <p>"THE ABOLITION OF THE SLAVE TRADE <hi>(ſays he)</hi> IS INDISPENSIBLY REQUIRED OF US, NOT ONLY BY RELIGION AND MORALITY, BUT BY EVERY PRINCIPLE OF SOUND POLICY<note n="*" place="bottom">Speech of W. Wilberforce in the Houſe of Commons.</note>."</p>
                  <p>The noble exordium of another able advocate of the ſame righteous cauſe, muſt not however be omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in this place: The Houſe of Commons being now apprized of the nature of this trade, having received evidence, having had the facts undeniably eſtabliſhed, knowing, in ſhort, <hi>what the Slave-Trade was,</hi> he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that if they did not, by the vote of that night, mark to all mankind their abhorrence of a practice ſo enormous, ſo ſavage, ſo repugnant to all laws, human and divine, it would be more ſcandalous, and more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faming, in the eyes of the country, and of the world, than any vote which any Houſe of Commons had ever given. He deſired them ſeriouſly to reflect, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they gave their votes, what they were about to do that evening. If they voted that the Slave Trade ſhould not be aboliſhed, they would, by their vote that night, give a <hi>Parliamentary ſanction</hi> to RAPINE, ROB<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BERY and MURDER; for a ſyſtem of rapine, robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and murder, the Slave Trade had now <hi>moſt clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> been proved to be<note n="†" place="bottom">Speech of C.

                     <pb n="24" facs="unknown:024233_0024_0FC57C3EA346BF18"/>
It remains now to recommend, as earneſtly and as ſtrongly as poſſible, to the inhabitants of this Land of Freedom individually, a particular and ſerious atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to THE ABSOLUTE NECESSITY, ON EVERY CONSIDERATION OF MORALITY AND JUSTICE, OF BUTTING AN END TO A PRACTICE SO PREGNANT WITH CIRCUMSTANCES OF TERROR AND ALARM TO THIS COUNTRY.</p>
                  <p>Much has been lately done, by the united friends of equitable freedom, in circulating throughout the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom important information on this intereſting ſubject: but much remains yet to be done. The minds of many have been informed, and their indignation juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kindled by the hiſtory of a commerce "<hi>written throughout in characters of blood</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">Speech of W. Wilberforce <abbr>Eſq</abbr> in the Houſe of Commons.</note>." But the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings it is to be feard, of a great majority of the people of England, are ſtill unenlightened. Should the foregoing Short Sketch of the Evidence, awaken the feelings, or quicken the attention, of any, in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of their greatly injured fellow-creatures, the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed Africans, it is much to be wiſhed, that they will not haſtily diſmiſs the ſubject from their recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, or ſuffer its painful impreſſions to be made in vain: but ſeek a further acquaintance with the evidence, which the more they examine, the ſtronger will be their inducements to exert every power and faculty they poſſeſs, for the purpoſe of procuring the Abolition of the Slave-Trade. Let no one ſay, "my ſituation of privacy and obſcurity, precludes all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of ſerving the cauſe"—for the greateſt numbers conſiſt of units, and the moſt mighty exertions of ſtates and empires are but aggregates of individual ability. Next to Members of Parliament, all who have any juſt influence in the election of them, are parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:024233_0025_0FC57C3FF0D9C878"/>concerned to conſider, how far the attainment of the great end we have in view may depend upon their conduct. We may certainly conclude, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is not a friend to the liberty of the meaneſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, is not fit to be entruſted with that of the ſtate: and even thoſe who have no vote, are nevertheleſs comprehended in our idea of the public mind,—nor is any man of ſenſe and virtue, let his ſituation in a free country be what it may, to be deemed of <hi>no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</hi> Upon his judgment, his voice (if not his vote, his example, much may depend. The diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of truth, the communication of uſeful knowledge, and the exemplary recommendation of virtuous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, may dignify a plebeian, as well as add luſtre to a crown. Even a negro ſlave, amidſt the horrors of a middle paſſage, and debaſed by every external cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of degradation and miſery that the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can conceive, ſhall divide his meagre morſel<note n="‡" place="bottom">In one of the ſhips we find the ſlaves privately and voluntarily feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the hungry ſailors with a part of their own ſcanty allowance.</note> with the inhuman monſter in diſtreſs, who ſtole him from his native country, and his neareſt connexions, thereby returning all the GOOD in his power, for all the EVIL his mercileſs enemy could inflict, and giving an example of true benevolence of heart and real greatneſs of mind, unſurpaſſed in the hiſtory of civil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ized nations, and worthy of the beſt and pureſt of all religions:—"<hi>if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirſt, give him drink</hi>
                     <note n="‖" place="bottom">Rom. xii. chap. 20. ver.</note>." Let no one, therefore, think too meanly of himſelf when called upon to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in a good cauſe, ſeeing, that from the moſt abject ſtate of human wretchedneſs a leſſon may ſometimes be learnt, and an influence imparted which the proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt philoſophy need not bluſh to own. The abolition
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:024233_0026_0FC57C42A523E770"/>of the ſlave trade is an object of ſuch high importance, and ſo nearly concerns every one who has a mind to comprehend, and a heart to feel, that no communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation or aſſiſtance is too <hi>ſmall,</hi> nor any too <hi>great,</hi> to be exerted upon this occaſion.</p>
                  <p>Some people ſeem inclined to lend an ear to tales of human woe, and feel a certain gratification in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the exhibitions of tragedy, or in the peruſal of pathetic poetry, and the like. Even the caſe of the oppreſſed Africans, when repreſented by their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite bards, or appearing in the form of the <hi>"Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Slave,"</hi> or the <hi>"Negro's Complaint,"</hi> ſeem to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs, if not charms to pleaſe, at leaſt powers forcibly to attract their willing attention, and to win their ſympathetic regard. Yet the evidence delivered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Houſe of Commons, containing a true and faithful account of the miſeries and wickedneſs at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant upon the traffic in their fellow-creatures, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>embelliſhed by flouriſhes of rhetoric, undecorated with the ſplendid habiliments of poetry, is almoſt in vain recommended to their notice. Should they be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon to caſt their eye over a few pages of the ſhocking hiſtory, they preſently ſhut up the book— it makes them ſhudder—they have read enough— ſuch horrid barbarities, ſuch complicated ſufferings, are not to be endured even in imagination! But let ſuch remember—" that humanity conſiſts not in a ſqueamiſh ear—it conſiſts not in a ſtarting or ſhrink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at ſuch tales as theſe, but in a diſpoſition of heart to relieve miſery, and to prevent the repetition of cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty:—Humanity appertains rather to the mind than to the nerves, and prompts men to real, diſintereſted endeavours to give happineſs to their fellow-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures<note n="§" place="bottom">Fox's Speech in the Houſe of Commons.</note>." It is therefore to be wiſhed that no affection
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:024233_0027_0FC57C43B5910B10"/>of extreme ſenſibility, or real effiminacy of manners, may diſincline, or diſqualify, for the ſervice of huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. That extreme DELICACY which deprives us, if not of the diſpoſition, yet of the ability to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſuffering for the ſake of, and in order to help our brethren in affliction, and under the ſevereſt oppeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is detrimental to its poſſeſſor, and injurious to the community; it renders compaſſion a painful, uſeleſs thing, and makes beneficence fruitleſs.</p>
                  <p>To the buſy and the gay <hi>"a great book is a great evil."</hi> TWO THOUSAND PAGES IN FOLIC, written (like Ezskiel's roll) within and without,—lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, mourning and woe, ſtand but little chance of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining <hi>their</hi> notice—even THE ABSTRACT OF THE EVIDENCE, would detain ſome of them too long from their eager purſuits of buſineſs, or their favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ite ſchemes of pleaſure. This HASTY SKETCH will not, however, it may be preſumed, encroach too much upon their time; and well rewarded will the compiler of it be, if it ſhould prove a ſtimulus to further inveſtigation of the Evidence. No one knows what opportunities he may have, or how far his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence may extend, to aſſiſt the endeavours now uſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the abolition of a trade, the continued carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on of which, after being ſo fully apprized of its dreadful enormity, may be expected (without the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt tincture of ſuperſtions fear) to expoſe this nation to the juſt puniſhment of PROVIDENCE.</p>
                  <p>Three nations, Juvan, Tubal, and Meſhech, are mentioned in Scripture<note n="‖" place="bottom">Ezel. xxvii. 13.</note> as having their principal trade at Tyre in the <hi>ſelling of men.</hi> This circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance has been appealed to in vindication of the African Slave-Trade:—but mark the ſequel. In the following chapter, verſe 18, the Prophet addreſſes
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:024233_0028_0FC57C4567C76920"/>the Prince of Tyre thus:—"Thou haſt defiled thy ſanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities, by the iniquity of thy traffic: <hi>therefore</hi> will I bring forth a fire from the midſt of thee, it ſhall devour thee, and I will bring thee to aſhes upon the earth." A prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy which has been remarkably fulfilled.</p>
                  <p>The great leader in the Debates of the Houſe of Commons on this momentous ſubject has declared— "That intereſted as he may be ſuppoſed to be in the final event of the queſtion, he was comparatively in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different as to the then deciſion of the Houſe. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they might do, the people of Great Britain, he was confident, would aboliſh the ſlave-trade, when, as would now ſoon happen, its injuſtice and cruelty ſhould be fairly laid before them. It was (ſaid he) a neſt of ſerpents, which would never have endured ſo long, but for the darkneſs in which they lay hid. The light of day would now be let in upon them, and they would vaniſh from the ſight."</p>

                  <p>NOtwithtranding the late determination be the Houſe of Commons on the Slave-Trade, we may hope that the diſcuſſion it has received will not be uſeleſs; and that the public attention has not been excited in vain, to a ſyſtem of cruelty which it is painful even to recite. It may be hoped that, claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for ourſelves the moſt perfect freedom, we ſhall no longer impoſe upon others a ſlavery the moſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive; and that, enjoying a degree of felicity un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equalled in any age or country, we ſhall no longer range the world to increaſe the miſery of mankind.</p>
                  <p>The luſt of power, and the pride of conqueſt, have doubtleſs produced inſtances far too numerous, of man enſlaved by man. But we, in an enlightened age, have greatly ſurpaſſed, in brutality and injuſtice, the moſt ignorant and barbarous ages: and while we are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to the fineſt feelings of humanity, are exerciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unprecedented cruelty. We have planted ſlavery in the rank ſoil of ſordid avarice; and the produce has been miſery in the extreme. We have aſcertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by a courſe of experiments in cruelty, the leaſt portion of nouriſhment requiſite to enable man to lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger a few years in miſery; the greateſt quantity of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor which, in ſuch a ſituation, the extreme of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can extort; and the utmoſt degree of pain, labor, and hunger united, that the human frame can endure.</p>
                  <p>In vain have ſuch ſcenes been developed. The wealth derived from the horrid trafric, has created an influence that ſecures its continuance, unleſs the people at large ſhall refuſe to receive the produce of robbery and murder.</p>
                  <p>The Legiſlature having refuſed to interpoſe, the people are now neceſſarily called on, either to reprobate or approve the meaſure; for Weſt-India ſlavery muſt
<pb facs="unknown:024233_0031_0FC57C4E26E40630"/>depend upon their ſupport for its exiſtence; and it is in the power of every individual to increaſe, or to diminiſh its extent. The laws of our country may indeed prohibit us the ſugar-cane, unleſs we will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it through the medium of ſlavery. They may hold it to our lips, ſteeped in the blood of our fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-creatures; but they cannot compel us to accept the loathſome potion. With us it reſts, either to receive it and be partners in the crime, or to exone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ourſelves from guilt, by ſpurning from us the temptation. For let us not think, that the crime reſts alone with thoſe who conduct the traffic, or the Legiſlature by which it is protected. If we purchaſe the commodity, we participate in the crime. The ſlave-dealer, the ſlave-holder, and the ſlave-driver, are virtually the agents of the conſumer, and may be conſidered as employed and hired by him to procure the commodity. For, by holding out the temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he is the original cauſe, the firſt mover in the horrid proceſs; and every diſtinction is done away by the moral maxim, That whatever we do by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we do ourſelves.</p>
                  <p>Nor are we by any means warranted to conſider our individual ſhare in producing theſe evils in a trivial point of view. The conſumption of ſugar in this country is ſo immenſe, that the quantity commonly uſed by individuals will have an important effect. A family that uſes only 5 lb. of ſugar per week, with the proportion of rum, will, by abſtaining from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption 21 months, prevent the ſlavery or murder of one fellow-creature; eight ſuch families in 19 ½ years, prevent the ſlavery or murder of 100, and 38,000 would totally prevent the Slave-Trade to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply our iſlands. Nay, ſo neceſſarily connected are our conſumption of the commodity, and the miſery
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:024233_0032_0FC57C4FEF326D90"/>reſulting from it, that in every pound of ſugar uſed, (the produce of ſlaves imported from Africa) we may be conſidered as conſuming two ounces of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man fleſh, beſides deſtroying an alarming number of ſeamen by the Slave-Trade, and ſpreading incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable anguiſh, terror and diſmay, through an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe continent, by the burning of their villages, tearing parents from their families, and children from their parents; breaking every bond of ſociety, and deſtroying every ſource of human happineſs. A Frouch writer obſerves, "That he cannot look on a piece of ſugar, without conceiving it ſtained with ſpots of human blood:" and Dr. Franklin adds, that had he taken in all the conſequences, "he might have ſeen the ſugar not merely ſpotted, but thoroughly dyed ſcarlet in grain."</p>
                  <p>Dreadful conſideration—that our increaſing hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs and proſperity has ſpread deſolation and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery over a country as large as all Europe! For it is an indiſputable fact, that it is Britiſh luxury, the African Slave Trade depends on for ſupport: they have increaſed, and they would fall together. For our conſumption of ſugar is now ſo immenſe, that it nearly equals that of all Europe beſides; and Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maica new ſupplies more than all our Weſt-India Iſlands did at any period prior to 1755.</p>
                  <p>But amazingly extenſive as is the increaſe of the culture, ſo far is it from keeping pace with our lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury, that (before the diſturbances in the French Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, within theſe two or three years) ſugars have ever ſold in the Britiſh market 20 or 30, ſometimes 50 per cent. dearer than in any other part of the world. Nor is it to ſupport the old plantations, as is pretended, but to form new ones, for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:024233_0033_0FC57C56A1F46200"/>of this our increaſing luxury, that the wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Africans are torn from their native land.</p>
                  <p>Let us then imagine our immenſe conſumption wholly, or in great part to ceaſe, and our ſugars to be thrown on the foreign markets; would additional ſlaves be wanted to ſupply an overflowing market at a falling price? No: the African Slave Trade, by whomſoever conducted, to ſupply ſugar colonies, by whatever nation poſſeſſed, muſt totally ceaſe. Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and diſmay would give place to peace and civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation, through a coaſt of above three thouſand miles extent, and above a thouſand miles inland: for ſo extenſive are our depredations, and ſo extenſive are the benefits which it is in our power to confer. Nor would the beneficial effects craſe, even here. The Weſt-India iſlands, finding leſs demand for ſugar, muſt appropriate leſs ground to the ſugar-cane, and leave more for proviſions: the ſlaves would be leſs worked, better fed, and in a few years conſiſt intirely of native Creoles. Or if the planters appropriate the land to the other productions of the iſlands, the frome beneficial effects muſt enſue. For M. Onoke tells us, <q>the cultivation of cotton, pimento, and coffee, is eaſier than ſugar: the ſlaves look better, and incrtaſe faſtens;</q> and inſtead of requiring additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal ſlaves, they would be able to increaſe their plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations with thoſe already in the iſlands. For Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor Barry ſays, <q>one acre of ſugar requires as much labour as three of cotten.</q> Thus our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraining from the conſumption of the ſugar-cane, even for a few years, would deſtroy the Slave Trade to the Weſt-India Iſlands, bring freſh land into culture, and place the ſlaves in ſuch a ſituation, that they muſt rapidly incroaſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="7" facs="unknown:024233_0034_0FC57C57E6549770"/>
The diminution of the conſumption of Weſt India produce, would alſo have a powerful effect by ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the price of the commodity; and thereby take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the temptation to import additional ſlaves. The effect a ſmall variation in the ſupply or demand has on the price, we have recently experienced. The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbances in the French ſugar iſlands, has ſuddenly raiſed ſome of the markets, which were 20 or 30 per cent. lower than the Britiſh, much above it; and thereby occaſioned an exportation from this country to ſupply the deficiency: and our exportation, though only amounting to a 10th of our importation, has raiſed our ſugars 50 per cent. And as a fall in the price would obſtruct the Slave Trade, and meliorate the condition of the ſlaves; ſo this riſe will produce effects the moſt baneful. The planter, tempted by the high price to get ſugar and rum to market while that high price continues, will deprive his ſlaves of their proviſion grounds, to plant them with canes; and by the energy of the whip, they will be forced to the moſt extreme exertions. The murder, or, in the technical language of the Weſt-Indies, the <hi>loſs</hi> of his ſlaves, will be to him but a ſecondary conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The large crop, and the high price, will am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply compenſate him: and the queſtion now is, not merely whether we ſhall hold out to him and induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to purchaſe additional ſlaves; but whether we ſhall tempt him to murder thoſe he already has. We can hardly doubt, but that Weſt India packets have already borne the murderous diſpatches, expreſſed in language too dreadfully explicit, and to the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing effect. <q>The price of ſugar and ruin ſtill continues high. You muſt adopt every mode to forward as large a cargo as poſſible. A fortunate criſis now offers itſelf for extricating my eſtate from the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:024233_0035_0FC57C5A953ACC98"/>in which it is involved. We muſt avail our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of it: another may never occur. Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, though diſagreeable, muſt at the preſent moment be overlooked. The ſlave market is ſtill open for a ſupply. <hi>New-fangted humanity is no more.</hi>
                     </q> The day hardly dawns when the whip re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſounds through thoſe regions of horror; nor ceaſes, till darkneſs cloſes the ſcene, which day after day is renewed. The miſerable victims, deſtitute of every ſource of comfort to body or to mind, and ſinking under the three endemic diſeaſes of our iſlands, hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, torture, and extreme labour; and urged to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertions they are unable to ſuſtain, at length expire beneath the laſh, which in vain endeavours to rouſe them to a renewal of their labour.</p>
                  <p>As neither the ſlave-dealer, nor the planter, can have any moral right to the perſon of him they ſtile their ſlave, to his labour, or to the produce of it; ſo they can convey no right in that produce to us: and whatever number of hands it may paſs thro' if the criminal circumſtances appertaining to it be known to them at the time of the transfer, they can only have a criminal poſſeſſion: and the money paid, either for the ſlave, or for the produce of his labour, is paid to obtain that criminal poſſeſſion: and can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer no moral right whatever, So, if the death of the perſon called a ſlave, be occaſioned by the criminal poſſeſſion, the criminal poſſeſſor is guilty of murder; and we, who have knowingly done any act which might occaſion his being in that ſituation, are acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries to the murder before the fact; as by receiving the produce of his labour, we are acceſſaries to the robbery, after the fact.</p>
                  <p>If we, as individuals concerned in the Slave Trade either by procuring the ſlaves, compelling them to
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:024233_0036_0FC57C5CC84A5850"/>labour, or receiving the produce) imagine that our ſhare in the tranſaction is ſo minute that it cannot perceptibly increaſe the injury; let us recollect that, though numbers partaking of a crime may diminiſh the ſhame, they cannot diminiſh its turpitude. Can we ſuppoſe, that an injury of enormous magnitude can take place, and the criminality be deſtroyed merely by the criminals becoming ſo numerous as to render their reſpective ſhares indiſtinguiſhable? Were an hundred aſſaſſins to plunge their daggers into their victim, though each might plead, that without his aſſiſtance the crime would have been compleated, and that his poinard neigher occaſioned nor accelerated the murder, yet every one of them would be guilty of the intire crime. For into how many parts ſoever a criminal action may be divided, the crime itſelf refts intire and compleat on every perpetrator.</p>
                  <p>But waving this latter conſideration, and even ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing for a moment, that the evil has an exiſtence from cauſes totally independent of us, yet it exiſts; and as we have it in our power jointly with others, to remedy it, it is undoubtedly our duty to contribute our ſhare, in hope that others will theirs; and to act that part from conſcience, which we ſhould from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination in ſimilar caſes that intereſted our feelings.</p>
                  <p>For inſtance: Let us ſuppoſe the Algerines to eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh ſugar plantations, and reſort to the banks of the Thames for ſlaves, as the only place to be inſulted with impunity. Suppoſe our wives, our huſbands, our children, our parents, our brethren, ſwept away, and the fruit of their labour, produced with agonizing hearts and trembling limbs, landed at the port of London. What would be our conduct? Should we ſay, Sugar is a neceſſary of life? I cannot do without it. Beſides, the quantity I uſe is but a ſmall propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:024233_0037_0FC57C5F70DCFCC8"/>and though it is very criminal of the Algerines to enſlave others, yet I am not bound to look to the nature or conſequences of the tranſaction; and pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the ſugar, I have a right to conſume it, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it may have been obtained. If ſuch would be our language in that caſe, be it ſo on the preſent oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion. For let us recollect, that the only difference is, that in one caſe our relation to the enſlaved is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more remote, but that in both caſes they are our brethren.</p>
                  <p>But it is hardly requiſite to ſtate ſo ſtrong a caſe as that ſuppoſed. For were only one Engliſhman to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive injuries, that bore but the ſlighteſt reſemblance to thoſe daily committed in our iſlands, the nation would be inflamed with reſentment, and clamorous to avenge the injury. And can our pride ſuggeſt to us, that the rights of men are limited to any nation, or to any colour? Or, were any one to treat a fellow creature in this country as we do the unhappy Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans in the Weſt-Indies; ſtruck with horror, we ſhould be zealous to deliver the oppreſſed, and puniſh the oppreſſor. Are then the offices of humanity and functions of juſtice to be circumſcribed by geographi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal boundaries? Can reaſon, can conſcience juſtify this contraſt in our conduct, between our prompti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, in the one caſe, and our torpor in the other? Mr. Addiſon juſtly obſerves, that "humanity to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come eſtimable muſt be combined with juſtice!" But we ſeem to act as if we thought that the relief of our fellow-creatures; protection from injuries, commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of benefits, were works of ſupererogation, to be granted or with-held, as caprice, or cuſtom, or inclination may ſuggeſt.</p>
                  <p>After the important conſiderations adduced, it might be reckoned a degradation of the ſubject to
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:024233_0038_0FC57C61BAFBB758"/>mention the national dignity; or even that might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce us to counteract a powerful body of men, who are trampling under foot the dictates of humanity, and the intereſt of the nation: men, who have in 50 years received for ſugar alone, above 70 millions more than it would have coſt at any other market. And from Mr. Botham's evidence it appears, that in Bata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via, where labour is as high as in England, ſugar, equal to the beſt Weſt-India, is ſold at 1 <abbr>d</abbr> half penny per pound. Theſe are the men, who are endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to overthrow a plan for ſupplying us with ſugars, by means of free labour; and have the auda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to tell the Britiſh legiſlature, "That they cannot aboliſh the ſlave trade; for that if England refuſe to furniſh them with ſlaves, they will obtain a ſupply through other channels." And a governor of Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does admoniſhes us, "From policy, to leave the iſlands to the quiet management of their own affairs." Theſe nominal colonies have, it ſeems, been taught, that we have no right to controul them; that the acts of their Aſſembles alone are obligatory; and that thoſe of Britiſh legiſlators, are binding only on thoſe whom they repreſent. The right of enſlaving others, they contend for, as the moſt valuable of their privileges.</p>
                  <p>Thus it appears, that the legiſlature is not only unwilling, but perhaps unable, to grant redreſs; and therefore it is more peculiarly incumbent on us, <hi>To obſtain from the uſe of ſugar and rum, until our Weſt-India Planters themſelves have prohibited the importa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of additional ſlaves, and commenced as ſpeedy and effectual a ſubverſion of ſlavery in their iſlands, as the circumſtances and ſituation of the ſlaves will admit: or till we can obtain the produce of the ſugar cane in ſome other mode, unconnected with ſlavery, and unpolluted with blood.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="12" facs="unknown:024233_0039_0FC57C65A40AE208"/>
For ſurely it may be hoped that we ſhall not lamit our views merely to the abolition of the African ſlave trade, as the colonial ſlavery formed on it, is in its principle equally unjuſt. For if it be iniquitous to force the Africans from their native land; equally iniquitous muſt it be, to retain them and their poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in perpetual bondage. Though the African ſlave trade be the moſt Prominent feature in this wickedneſs, yet it is but a feature: and where it aboliſhed, the Weſt India ſlavery would ſtill exiſt. Our planters would breed, inſtead of importing ſlaves; and ſhall we ſuffer half a million of fellow ſubjects, and their poſterity, to be held in ſlavery for ever? I ſay, fellow ſubjects. For undoubtedly, every perſon born in the dominions of Great Britain is a ſubject, bound to obey and entitled to the protection of the common law of England; and in oppoſition to which the acts of Aſſemblies, exiſting merely by grant from the crown, can be of no authority.</p>
                  <p>In demanding liberty then for the perſons called ſlaves in our iſlands, we demand no more then they are entitled to by the common law of the land. The moſt eligible mode of putting them in poſſeſſion of their legal and natural right, may be a queſtion of difficulty; but it is a queſtion that ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered with no other view, but to their happineſs. The plan to be adopted, ought to be certain and ſpeedy in its operation; without any conſideration of the ſuppoſed, or even real intereſt, of their oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors: and let it be remembered, that it is in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of a ſmall proportion of the people of England to effect it, by refuſing to receive the produce. For the planters themſelves would adopt the plan, were that the only condition on which we would conſume the produce of their iſlands: nor would the legiſlature be
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:024233_0040_0FC57C66EE186270"/>then harraſſed with prepoſterous claims for compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation; which, however unfounded in juſtice or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, will be ſupported by influence, and enforced with clamour.</p>
                  <p>The caſe now fully lies before us; and we have to make our choice, either to join ourſelves with theſe manufacturers of human woe, or to renounce the horrid aſſociation. If we adopt the former, let us at leaſt have the candour to avow our conduct in its real deformity. Let us no longer affect to deplore the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities attendant on the Slave Trade, of which we are the primary cauſe: nor let us pretend to execrate the conduct of the ſlave-dealer, the ſlave-holder, or the ſlave-driver; but apologize for them as our part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in iniquity: and be aſſured, that if we now take <hi>our</hi> ſhare in the tranſaction, we ſhould, were we plac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a ſimilar ſituation with them, with as little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punction take <hi>theirs;</hi> unleſs we can ſuppoſe the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of nature would be ſo far inverted, as that we ſhould become virtuous, in proportion as the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to vice increaſed. Nor ſhould we then, any more then now, be deſtitute of ſubterfuges to deſtroy the feelings of our minds, and the convictions of our conſciences.</p>
                  <p>If ignorance and inattention may be pleaded as our excuſe hitherto, yet that can be the caſe no longer. The ſubject has been four years before the public. Its dreadful wickedneſs has been fully proved. Every falſhood, every deception with which it has been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed, has been compleatly done away; and it ſtands before us in all its native horrors. No longer can it be pretended, that Africa is a barbarous, uncultivated land, inhabited by a race of ſavages inferior to the reſt of the human ſpecies. Mr. How, who was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed by government to go up the country, depoſes,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:024233_0041_0FC57C6932042B30"/>that in land it is every where well cultivated, abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with rice, millet, potatoes, cotton and indigo plantations; and that the inhabitants are quick in learning languages, and remarkably induſtrious, hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitable and obliging. It appears that they poſſeſs no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and heroic minds, diſdaining ſlavery, and frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeeking refuge from it in the arms of death. Nor ſhall we be again told, of the ſuperior happineſs they enjoy under the benevolent care of the planters; Mr. Coor having depoſed, that <q>ſetting ſlaves to work in the morning, is attended with loud peals of whipping;</q>—and General Tottenham, <q>that there is no compariſon between regimental flogging, which only cuts the ſkin, and the plantation, which cuts out the fleſh;</q>—Capt. Hall, <q>that the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are very ſhocking, much more ſo then in men of war;</q> Capt. Smith, <q>that at every ſtroke of the whip a piece of fleſh is cut out,</q>—and Mr. Roſs, <q>that he conſiders a compariſon between Weſt-India ſlaves, and the Britiſh peaſantry, as an inſult to common ſenſe.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>We are now called on to redreſs evils, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with which, all that exiſt in this nation ſink be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath our notice; and the only ſacrifice we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to make in order to effect it, is the abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a luxury, which habit alone can have rendered of importance. If we refuſe, can we form the leaſt pretence to a moral character? May it not be juſtly inferred, that thoſe numerous diſplays <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap>, of which this kingdom boaſts, have not their foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation in any virtuous or valuable principle; but that to cuſtom and oſtetation they owe their origin? And if our execration of the ſlave trade be any more than mere declaration againſt crimes we are not in a ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation to commit, we ſhall, inſtead of being ſolicit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:024233_0042_0FC57C6ABA30BE68"/>to find deſpicable diſtinctions to juſtify our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, abhor the idea of contributing, in he leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, to ſuch ſeenes of miſery.</p>
                  <p>If theſe be the deductions from the moſt obvious principles of reaſon, juſtice, and humanity; what muſt be the reſult if we extend our views to religious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations? It will hardly be ſaid, that we aſſume a religious profeſſion to diminiſh the extent of our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral duties, or to weaken the force of our obligation to obſerve them.</p>
                  <p>We will therefore aſk, if it be meant to inſult the God we pretend to worſhip, by ſupplicating him to "have mercy upon all priſoners and captives," and to <q>defend and provide for the fatherleſs, widows, and children, and all that are deſolate and oppreſſed.</q> But, if the national religion be a mere matter of form, yet ſurely we may expect that the various denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of diſſenters, will think it at the leaſt as requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to diſſent from the national crimes, as the nation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al religion; unleſs they mean to exhibit conſciences of ſo peculiar a texture, as to take offence at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of their country, while they can conform with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſcruple, to its moſt criminal practices. If indeed they are ſatisfied, after an impartial examination, that the traffic alluded to is fair and honeſt, and that the produce ought to be conſidered as the reſult of lawful commerce, it will become them to encourage it; it will become them to reprobate this work as an attempt to ſlander honeſt men, and to injure their property, by holding it out to the public, as the produce of rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery and murder. But, if the arguments be valid, will they preſume to treat the ſubject with cool indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, and continue a criminal practice? May we not alſo hope that the Methodiſts, who appear to feel forcibly their principles, will ſeriouſly conſider it?
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:024233_0043_0FC57C6EA0102CF8"/>They are ſo numerous, as to be able of themſelves to deſtroy that dreadful traffic, which is the ſole obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle to their miniſters ſpreading the goſpel in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive continent of Africa; and, however others may affect to degrade the Negroes, they are bound to conſider thouſands of them as their brethren in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>But there is one claſs of diffenters who juſtly ſtand high in the public eſtimation, for their ſteady, manly and uniform oppoſition to our colonial ſlavery. And can it be ſuppoſed that, after having awakened the public attention, they can refuſe to contribute what is in their own power to remedy the evil? The plan propoſed, is a plain and obvious deduction from their uniform principle, of having no concern in what they diſapprove. Thus, conſidering war as unlawful, they conſider goods obtained through that medium as cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minally obtained; and will not ſuffer any of their members to purchaſe prize-goods: and ſurely they muſt conſider the ſeizure of a man's goods, as a crime far inferior to the ſeizing his perſon.</p>
                  <p>However obvious the duty, yet the mind hardened by habit, admits with difficulty the conviction of guilt; and ſanctioned by a common practice, we may commit the groſſeſt violations of duty without remorſe. It is therefore more peculiarly incumbent on us in ſuch ſituations, to examine our conduct with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſuſpicion, and to fortify our minds with moral principles, or the ſanctions of religion. In propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as we are under their influence, we ſhall exert ourſelves to remedy theſe evils, knowing that our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, our admonitions, our influence, may produce remote effects, of which we can form no eſtimate; and which, after having done our duty, muſt be left to <hi>Him who governs all things after the counſel of his own <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                  <head type="sub">Containing Extracts from an Eſſay, intitled, an impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Enquiry into the State and Utility of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of Georgia; printed in London in <hi>1741.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>WHEN Georgia was firſt ſettled, beſides other uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful regulations, the inhabitants were not allowed to have Negro Slaves. No doubt their objections to them, were founded partly in civil policy, and partly from a ſeaſe of the injuſtice and cruelty of that inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man practice, which did not operate, with equal force, upon the minds of all the inhabitants; ſome of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſirous of having the benefit of their labour, whith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out looking into conſequences, in a remote degree, either as it reſpected their own perſonal ſafety, or had an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence on the morals and happineſs of their immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate offspring, and their poſterity: with views ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, ſome ſoon grew diſcontented with this ſalutary reſtraint, and petitioned the Governor for liberty to have ſlaves. This produced counter petitions, which leaves a favourable opinion of the wiſdom and virtue of ſome of the firſt ſettlers of that ſtate, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly of the Saltzburghers who ſettled at Ebenezer: theſe, to the number of <hi>49</hi> men, with their two mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, John Martin Bolzius, and Iſrael Chriſtian Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan, in a petition "beſeech the honourable truſtees (of that ſettlement) not to allow that any Negroes might be brought to their place, or in their neighbourhood." And with reſpect to its being "impoſſible and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
<pb facs="unknown:024233_0045_0FC57C734B215998"/>for white people to plant and manufacture rice" in that climate, "as being a work only for Negroes, not for European people," they ſay, "having experience to the contrary, we laugh at ſuch talking, ſeeing that ſeveral of us have had a greater crop of rice laſt year, than we wanted for our own conſumption." And the inhabitants of Frederica, upon the ſame occaſion, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioned againſt having Negroes introduced amongſt them, "but deſiſted from ſending it, upon an aſſurance that their apprehenſions of it were needleſs."</p>
                  <p>But the following petition of the Highlanders from Scotland, who had ſettled at New-Inverneſs in Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia, is deſerving of particular attention, as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains ſentiments congenial with thoſe advanced in the firſt of theſe treatiſes; and does credit to the diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, probity and humanity of the anceſtors of that ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement. In this petition they remonſtrate to their then Governor Oglethorpe, that they <q>were informed, that their neighbours of Savannah had petitioned for the liberty of having ſlaves;</q> in conſequence of which they ſay, <q>We hope, and earneſtly entreat, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch propoſals are hearkened unto, your Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency will conſider our ſituation, and of what dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and bad conſequences ſuch liberty would be of to us.</q> Then after reciting ſome of theſe they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed:</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>It is ſhocking to human nature, that any race of mankind, and their poſterity, ſhould be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced to perpetual ſlavery; nor in juſtice can we think otherwiſe of it, than that they are thrown amongſt us to be our ſcourge, one day or other, for our ſins: and as freedom muſt be as dear to them as to us, what a ſcene of horror muſt it bring about! And the longer it is unexecuted, the bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſcene muſt be the greater: We therefore, for our
<pb facs="unknown:024233_0046_0FC57C76AEC00480"/>own ſakes our wives and children, and our poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, beg your conſideration, and intreat, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of introducing ſlaves, you will put us in the way to get ſome of our own countrymen, who with their labour in time of peace, and our vigilance, if we are invaded (with the help of theſe) will ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it a difficult thing to hurt us, or that part of the province we poſſeſs.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Dated <q>New-Inverneſs, January <hi>3, 1738-9,</hi>
                     </q> and ſigned by <hi>18</hi> freeholders.</p>
                  <p>As the ſentiments contained in the above petitions are expreſſed with a conſiderable degree of energy, and are peculiarly favourable to the cauſe of humanity, with an explicit and clear declaration of their diſapprobation of holding Negroes in a ſtate of ſlavery on account of its impolicy and injuſtice, as well as from other alarming conſiderations; and as they have proceeded from the anceſtors of a people, whoſe repreſentative in a former Congreſs, was a diſtinguiſhed advocate for continuing the ſlave trade, they are added; hoping, that the vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration they may entertain, for characters ſo truly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving as theſe Inverneſs petitioners and Saltzburghers of Ebenezer were, may induce a more candid reception of the foregoing pamphlets in that and other Southern ſtates.</p>
