            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <q>
                  <hi>STRIVE to enter in at the ſtrait gate.—</hi>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THESE are the words of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, occaſioned by a queſtion that was propoſed to him in the following terms: "Lord, are there few that be ſaved?" Who it was that aſked this queſtion, or what his views therein were, we are not particularly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. However, it ſeems probable, by his addreſſing our Saviour under the title of "Lord," that this was one of his profeſſed diſciples. But whoever he were, and whatever his particular views, this was certainly rather a queſtion of
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:008926_0004_103089AAA230B368"/>
curioſity, than of real importance to the inquirer. Our Lord therefore, inſtead of returning a direct anſwer to him, gave him, in common with others that were preſent, this admonition; the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of which could not but be of ſolid advantage to them, as tending to their own ſalvation reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively. <q>And he ſaid unto them, Strive [Strive ye] to enter,</q> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>THE words, it is humbly conceived, may, without any impropriety, be conſidered as an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, admonition or precept, given to all thoſe in general, who hear the goſpel of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom preached; the duty enjoined therein being common to all; to high and low, rich and poor, male and female: And, it may be added, both to thoſe who are, and who are not, already in a regenerate ſtate: For, be they in that happy eſtate or not, ſtill they ought to uſe their utmoſt dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to obtain the ſalvation revealed in the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; or, which is the ſame thing, to enter in at the ſtrait gate.</p>
            <p>BUT it may be proper to be a little more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular in explaining the phraſeology of the text; what is meant by the "ſtrait gate," and what by "ſtriving" to enter in thereat.</p>
            <p>BY the "ſtrait gate," our Lord doubtleſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends in general, the gate of eternal life and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. This is put beyond all doubt by his own
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:008926_0005_103089B38E18B808"/>
words in his ſermon on the mount; where he mentions the ſtrait gate, and the narrow way, as that which "leadeth unto life," and which "few find;" in oppoſition to the wide gate, and the broad way, that "leadeth to deſtruction; and many there be," ſays he, "that go in thereat." Our Lord, in this manner of expreſſion, ſeems to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the happineſs of the heavenly ſtate, under the notion of a glorious manſion, or city; to which there lies one certain road, and the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into which, is by a door or gate. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to which manner of conception, he ſays in the verſe immediately following the text—<q>When once the maſter of the <hi>houſe</hi> is riſen up, and hath ſhut to the <hi>door,</hi> and ye begin to ſtand without, and to knock at the <hi>door,</hi>
               </q> &amp;c. And, in the revelation of St. John, it is ſaid, <q>Bleſſed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may <hi>enter in thro' the gates</hi> into the city.</q> You ſee from hence, to what our Saviour alludes in the text, and why he uſes this metaphor.</p>
            <p>BUT why is this called a "ſtrait" gate? Doubtleſs it is in reſpect of the many obſtructions and difficulties which attend the working out our ſalvation, or finally gaining admiſſion into the paradiſe of God. The way of error and vice is ſaid to be wide, and the gate of deſtruction broad; becauſe it is ſo natural and eaſy to walk in the one, and to enter in at the other. But the way
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:008926_0006_103089B567B8CAF0"/>
of truth, righteouſneſs and life, is walked in, and the gate of heaven entered, with difficulty: Whence it is, that they are deſcribed as narrow and ſtrait, in oppoſition to the former.</p>
            <p>BY "ſtriving" to enter in at the ſtrait gate, is meant in general, exerting ourſelves with vigour, or uſing our earneſt endeavours to that end; to obtain the ſalvation of our ſouls, or finally to gain admiſſion into the kingdom of heaven. This is the proper notion and idea of ſtriving.<note n="*" place="bottom">Agonizeſthe.</note> It is oppoſed to indifference, negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and ſloth; and implies an intenſe applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the mind and faculties, in order to effect what we have in view. And ſtriving thus, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes two things. One is, that there is difficulty in the way, or oppoſition to be overcome, which requires a vigorous effort. For if a thing may be performed with great eaſe, there is no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, nor indeed any room, for ſtriving in order thereto. As, for example, a man in his full ſtrength can, with no propriety of language, be ſaid to ſtrive to lift a ſtraw, or a ſmall pebble-ſtone; or to do any thing elſe, which may be done with facility. But this is far from being the caſe, with reſpect to the matter now before us. There are numerous and great difficulties in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as before obſerved; with reference to which, the gate of life is ſaid to be ſtrait: So that in this reſpect there is abundant occaſion for ſtriving.
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:008926_0007_103089B835AC2490"/>
The world, the fleſh and the devil; principalities and powers, and ſpiritual wickedneſſes in high places, are not to be overcome, but by great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution and vigor on our own part, even tho' aided by Him, who is ſtronger than "the ſtrong man armed."—The other thing ſuppoſed in ſtriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, unleſs it be an irrational ſtriving, is, that the object thereof is a matter of importance. For the difficulty of a thing, if it be of no conſequence, is no proper reaſon for ſtriving to accompliſh it: So far from it, that this will be a good reaſon for not ſtriving, or giving ourſelves any trouble or concern about it. Men do indeed often take great pains, without having any thing in view, really worthy of them. In the language of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, they "ſpend their money for that which is not bread, and their labor for that which ſatisfieth not." Theſe are certainly ill-placed endeavours; ſtriving to no good purpoſe, even tho' the ends aimed at are attained. But when our Lord ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhes us to ſtrive, that we may enter in at the ſtrait gate, this is a matter of infinite, eternal im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to us; and ſo juſtly demands our utmoſt care and endeavours.</p>
            <p>SOME may perhaps think, that ſtriving to enter in at the ſtrait gate, farther implies ſome uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty as to the ſucceſs of our endeavours; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they ſhall be effectual or not: And that our Lord deſigned to ſuggeſt this to us, by ſuch a manner of expreſſion. But this is improbable
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:008926_0008_103089BC29A1D258"/>
for ſeveral reaſons; and particularly becauſe, in his ſermon on the mount, the precept is expreſſed abſolutely: "Enter in at the ſtrait gate:" Not as it is here, "Strive," &amp;c. Which former manner of expreſſion ſeems a much better argument for the certain poſſibility of the thing, than the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is for the doubtfulneſs of it.</p>
            <p>BUT enough has been ſaid to explain the phraſeology, and general ſcope of this precept. In farther diſcourſing upon the ſubject, it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, by divine aſſiſtance, more particularly to repreſent to you, What this ſtriving implies in it: The fatal conſequences of not ſtriving; together with the happineſs and glory which will accrue to us, if we ſtrive effectually, or ſo as finally to enter in at the ſtrait gate: And laſtly, What con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion there is, according to the word of God, between ſtriving in the manner we may and ought to do, and actually obtaining what we aim at therein, the ſalvation of our ſouls. It is propoſed to enlarge much more upon the laſt of theſe points, than upon any of the others. In the firſt place it will be proper,</p>
            <p>I. MORE particularly and diſtinctly to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to you, what this ſtriving implies in it. For this is a very comprehenſive duty, which preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes ſome things, and directly contains ſeveral others. And,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:008926_0009_103089BF1B932C70"/>
1ſt. IT preſuppoſes a man to be at leaſt a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative believer of the goſpel, or of the chriſtian revelation. For ſtriving to enter in at the ſtrait gate, is the ſame thing, in other words, with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to obtain that ſalvation which the goſpel reveals. And it is evident, that no man can conſiſtently be ſuppoſed to do this, unleſs he is firſt convinced of the truth of the goſpel in general. So that whatever a mere heathen, one who has never heard of, or who rejects the chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian revelation, as an impoſture, may be ſuppoſed to do with a view to his future happineſs; yet this does not come up to the proper notion and idea of ſtriving to enter in at the ſtrait gate. But more particularly,</p>
            <p>2dly. THIS ſtriving preſuppoſes a man to be awakened into ſome ſenſe of his ſin, guilt, and miſery; and into a ſerious concern for the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of his ſoul. The ſalvation revealed thro' Jeſus Chriſt, reſpects, or has for its object, not the righteous, but ſinners; not men, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in a ſtate of innocency, who would need no ſuch ſalvation, but apoſtate, degenerate and guilty creatures, juſtly obnoxious to the wrath of God. It is in this view that mankind are conſidered in the goſpel; the very foundation of which is laid in, and the whole ſuperſtructure built upon, the ſuppoſition that mankind in general are in ſuch a ſtate of ſin, condemnation and ruin. And no one can be ſuppoſed to uſe his endeavours
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:008926_0010_103089C1160734B8"/>
to obtain deliverance from this ſtate, or to have a part in that ſalvation which the goſpel reveals, while he remains in a ſtate of carnal ſecurity; or has not an awakened ſenſe of his miſery, as lying under guilt, and being in a ſtate of alienation from God. The doing any thing at all, how little ſoever it may be, with a view to obtain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from ſin and wrath, ſuppoſes a perſon to be convinced, that he is really a ſinner, and, as ſuch, liable to wrath.</p>
            <p>3dly. THIS ſtriving preſuppoſes a perſon earneſtly to deſire the ſalvation revealed thro' Chriſt; or to have his heart engaged in this matter, as a thing of the laſt importance to him. Deſires always preceed endeavours, or go before ſtriving, both in our ſpiritual and temporal concerns. A man's ſtriving, or uſing his endeavours, to obtain worldly riches, pleaſures, power and preferment, ſuppoſes his heart to be ſet upon theſe things: For if it were not, he would not certainly be at any great pains to acquire them, or give himſelf much concern about them. This is ſtrictly and evidently true of all our endeavours in religion, or ſtriving to enter in at the ſtrait gate. All exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, efforts and ſtrivings to this end, ſuppoſe that we ſincerely deſire to obtain ſalvation. Nor will any one ſtrive as he ought to do, in order to this, unleſs his deſires are ſtrong and vigorous, in ſome proportion to the importance of it; at leaſt, unleſs he conſiders this as a thing of more
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:008926_0011_103089C2C8150BC8"/>
conſequence to him, than all worldly riches, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and honors. For he that poſtpones the ſalvation of his ſoul to any thing in this world, can, with no propriety, be ſaid to ſtrive to enter in at the ſtrait gate.</p>
            <p>4thly. THIS ſtriving implies in it, the uſe of proper care and diligence to be rightly informed concerning the way of ſalvation, and to guard againſt error in this reſpect. For ſurely, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not properly ſtrive to enter in at the gate of life, or of the kingdom of heaven, if we are unſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous to find that "narrow way" that leadeth to it. And here there are two things to be parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly obſerved. One is, that there is really but one way of life and ſalvation revealed do us. The other is, that this is ſo narrow, that it may be fatally miſtaken, or not found, by thoſe that are careleſs and negligent in their inquiries after it. From whence ariſes the neceſſity of taking pains to this end: For if the way of truth and life were ſo plain and wide, that it could not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be miſapprehended, all care and caution leſt we ſhould err from it, would be ſuperſeded.</p>
            <p>THERE is, as was juſt now obſerved, really but one way of life and ſalvation, revealed in the goſpel; and that is, the way which Jeſus Chriſt himſelf taught; the new and living way, which was both opened and pointed out by him. With reference to which he ſays, "I am the way, the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:008926_0012_103089C5A1B81C50"/>
truth and the life: No man cometh unto the Father, but by me." His inſpired apoſtles alſo taught the way of life: Concerning whom it is ſaid in the acts of the apoſtles, "Theſe men are the ſervants of the moſt high God, which ſhew unto us the way of ſalvation." And that which they declared, was not a different way, but the ſame which Chriſt himſelf taught; as is manifeſt by comparing their doctrine with his. So that there is certainly a way, or one way of ſalvation, revealed. But is there any more than one? If any perſon ſays, there are two, or more, it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent upon him to point them out; ſhewing the difference which there is betwixt them; and yet, that both are true and right, the ways of God's revealing. But this, it is preſumed, no man will attempt to do. It is in reference to the unity of the way of life, that the apoſtle ſays, there is "one faith."—"There is one body and one ſpirit," ſaith he, <q>even as ye are called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, <hi>one faith,</hi> one baptiſm, one God and Father of all, who is above all,</q> &amp;c.<note n="*" place="bottom">Eph. IV. 4. 5. 6.</note> There is therefore as certainly but one true faith, or one goſpel, in the faith of which we can be ſaved, as there is but one hope of our calling, but one Lord or Chriſt, but one God and Father of all. And we might as well ſuppoſe two Fathers of all, two Redeemers, and two goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels, as two ways of ſalvation, that differ eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially from each other: And the ſame apoſtle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:008926_0013_103089CB1BCFA8D0"/>
a curſe againſt whomſoever ſhould preach another goſpel, or another way of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, even tho' it were himſelf, or an angel from heaven.</p>
            <p>IT was farther obſerved above, that this one way of ſalvation may be fatally miſtaken by thoſe, who are careleſs and negligent in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries after it. To which purpoſe it may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for the preſent, to remind you of two paſſages of ſcripture only. One is in the 2 Epiſ. of Peter, chap. iii. "And account that the long-ſuffering of our Lord is ſalvation, even as our beloved bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Paul, according to the wiſdom given unto him, hath written unto you: As alſo in all his epiſtles, ſpeaking of theſe things; in which are ſome things hard to be underſtood, which they that are unlearned and unſtable" [men of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teachable, light and wavering mind] <hi>wreſt, as they do alſo the other ſcriptures, unto their own deſtruction</hi>—Beware leſt ye alſo, being led away with <hi>the error of the wicked,</hi> &amp;c." The other paſſage of ſcripture alluded to above, is in the 2 Theſſ. chap. ii. where the apoſtle ſpeaks of ſome, who "received not the love of the truth, that they might be ſaved." He immediately ſubjoins: "And for this cauſe God ſhall ſend them ſtrong deluſion, that they ſhould <hi>believe a lie; that they all might be damned, who believed not the truth,</hi> &amp;c." Now, if perſons may wreſt the ſcriptures; not only thoſe which are really
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:008926_0014_103089CD047C25C8"/>
"hard to be underſtood," but alſo the "other ſcriptures," to their own deſtruction; and if there are ſome, who are given over to "ſtrong delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion," and believe a lie, to their own damnation; then it is certain, that men may err fatally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the way of life. If there be any funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental truths, there muſt of conſequence be fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental errors; or ſuch as ſhall be fatal in their conſequences. And this is evidently ſuppoſed, not only in theſe, but in many other paſſages of ſcripture. From whence ariſes the neceſſity of great care in inquiring after the way of life, and caution againſt deception with reference thereto. Nor can any man be ſuppoſed heartily to deſire, and earneſtly to ſtrive, that he may enter in at the ſtrait gate, unleſs he exerciſeth care and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in this reſpect.</p>
            <p>IF it ſhould be demanded here, What errors are fatal? this, it is conceived, ought to be left to the judgment of God. No man can preſume, without arogance, pride and impiety, particularly to run the line between eſſential and non-eſſential articles of faith; or, which comes to the ſame thing, between ſuch errors as ſhall be abſolutely fatal, and ſuch as ſhall not. If God himſelf has not explicitly determined theſe queſtions, as he has not, what unwarrantable preſumption is it in men to do it; as the manner of ſome is! Tho' the way of ſalvation revealed, be but one; tho' this may be fatally miſapprehended by the care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:008926_0015_103089CFDD7828B0"/>
and negligent; and tho', for this reaſon, we ought to uſe diligence that we may be rightly informed; yet it is certain, that all miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes and errors reſpecting the way of life, are not fatal: For who then could be ſaved! It may be ſubjoined here, that tho' the careleſs and ſlothful may err fatally; yet it will by no means follow from hence, that thoſe may alſo err thus, who are ſeriouſly inquiſitive; thoſe who take Jeſus Chriſt for their guide, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily deſire to know the truth as it is in him. It would be a great reflexion on the goodneſs and mercy of God, and on the holy ſcriptures, to ſuppoſe, either that every miſtake in ſuch fallible creatures reſpecting the way of life, ſhould be damning; or, that we might ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and earneſtly endeavour, in the uſe of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per means, to learn the way of ſalvation from Jeſus Chriſt, or the ſcriptures of truth, and yet not find it, but err from it in any eſſential point. The former of theſe ſuppoſitions would in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect diveſt God of his mercy; and the latter of them would infer the ſcriptures to be inade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate to the declared deſign of them, which is, to guide our feet into the way of peace, and make us "wiſe unto ſalvation;" which the apoſtle aſſerts, they are "able" to do. And whoſoever denies this proteſtant, and truly apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolic doctrine, ought to go to Rome for a liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, viſible and infallible guide; unleſs, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, he had rather ſet up to be one himſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:008926_0016_103089D4F0A1FB50"/>
IN fine here: Striving to enter into life, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly implies great care in ſeeking the way that leadeth thereto. In all the concerns of this mortal life, when we are heartily engaged in any purſuit, or endeavour to accompliſh any end, we are careful leſt we ſhould take ſome wrong ſtep to our prejudice; except in ſuch caſes as we apprehend admit of no doubt or uncertainty. And we do, or at leaſt we ought to, act from the ſame general principle in the infinitely higher concerns of religion. Neither can we be ſuppoſed really to ſtrive, that we may enter in at the ſtrait gate, unleſs we are ſollicitous to know the truth as it is in Jeſus, in ſome proportion to the importance of it, as it relates to our eternal ſalvation.</p>
            <p>5thly. THIS ſtriving implies in it, earneſt prayer to God for the illumination of his holy ſpirit; for his guidance and direction in the way of life; for the pardon of our ſins; for a new heart, and right ſpirit; and that he would purge our conſciences from dead works, to ſerve him in newneſs of life. Prayer is one, and indeed a moſt important way, of ſtriving; to the uſe of which means, there are ſo many exhortations and injunctions in the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and which are ſo generally known, that it ſeems unneceſſary at preſent to refer you to any in particular. And certainly no perſon who neglects this, can be ſuppoſed to ſtrive as he ought to do.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:008926_0017_103089D6F4A43240"/>
6thly. THIS undoubtedly implies in it, ſtriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt ſin; watchfulneſs againſt tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; a reſolute oppoſition to the luſts and corruptions of our own hearts; and an endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to forſake and avoid all thoſe evil prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices which God has forbidden in his word; and for the ſake of which, his wrath cometh on the children of diſobedience. For ſurely that man cannot be ſaid to ſtrive to obtain ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, who does not endeavour to avoid thoſe ſins, and unrighteous deeds, againſt which he knows the wrath of God is revealed from heaven.</p>
            <p>7thly. THIS implies a real endeavour, not only to abſtain from what God has forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; but to do whatſoever he has required, or to obey all his known commandments. For our bleſſed Saviour has ſaid, "Not every one that ſaith unto me, Lord, Lord, ſhall enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven." And one would think it hardly poſſible for any man to deceive himſelf ſo much, as to imagine that he really ſtrives to enter in at the ſtrait gate, without endeavouring to comply with the known will of God. This ſtriving plainly implies a ſincere deſire to avoid every thing in general that may obſtruct, and to do every thing in general which may promote, a man's future well-being.—It is, however, very far
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:008926_0018_103089D8AF7F9B60"/>
from being the deſign of what is here ſaid, that we ſhould do thus under the notion of merit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſalvation thereby; or performing ſuch a righteouſneſs as God is obliged in juſtice to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept. This were the greateſt folly. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we do, we are unprofitable ſervants; yea, worſe than unprofitable; for we are ſtill ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful creatures: And being ſuch, can reaſonably hope for eternal life, only as the gift of God thro' Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, who hath redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us from the curſe of the law. And a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence upon him, as the mediator between God and men, is implied in the very notion of ſtriving to obtain ſalvation thro' him.</p>
            <p>8thly. THE ſtriving here enjoined, muſt be ſuppoſed to intend ſtriving with perſeverance; not for a month, a year, or any definite, given time; but as long as it ſhall pleaſe God to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue us in the world. For if any, after ſtriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus for a time, and in ſome meaſure eſcap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the pollutions of the world, relapſe into their former careleſs and ſinful way of life, the apoſtle compares them to a "dog that return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to his vomit, and a ſow that was waſhed, to her wallowing in the mire." Yea, he ſaith of ſuch perſons that it "had been better for them not to have known the way of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, than thus to turn from the holy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment delivered unto them."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:008926_0019_103089DCABC89E40"/>
IF it ſhould be asked, Whether any unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate ſinner can be ſuppoſed to ſtrive in the manner repreſented above? I anſwer, Yes; at leaſt in general. There is very little, if any thing, in this account of ſtriving, &amp;c. which would neceſſarily ſuppoſe a perſon to be already born of the Spirit. But if it ſhould be farther demanded, Whether a ſinner can be ſuppoſed to ſtrive thus, antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to <hi>any</hi> influence or operation of the good ſpirit of God upon his heart? The anſwer is, By no means. God undoubtedly ſtrives with ſinful men, by his word, his ſpirit, and the diſpenſations of his providence; awakening them to a ſenſe of their guilt, miſery and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, antecedently to their ſtriving, or doing any thing tending to their ſalvation: So that when any are finally brought to love him, it is "be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he firſt loved them." But yet ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of the word and ſpirit of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the hearts of men, as ſerve to awaken in them a ſerious concern about their ſalvation, and excite them to ſtrive in order thereto, do not infer them to be new creatures in Chriſt Jeſus. My meaning is, that there may be, and always are, ſuch awakenings and ſtrivings, prior to that thorough change of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and affections, which the ſcriptures expreſs by a new heart, the new creature, and being born of God.—It may be ſubjoined here, to prevent miſconſtruction, that tho' no
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:008926_0020_103089DE5847D200"/>
ſinner ſtrives, but with whom God ſtrives firſt; yet it will not from hence follow, that God ſtrives with none, beſides thoſe who ſtrive in conſequence thereof. God is repreſented as ſtriving with many, who, inſtead of yielding to the impreſſions of his grace, reſiſt, grieve and quench his good ſpirit; till they are utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forſaken of him, and given over to a repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate mind: In conformity to his own threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that his "Spirit ſhall not always ſtrive with man."<note n="†" place="bottom">Tho' the ſcriptures ſpeak of God as ſtriving; yet this ſeems not literally and ſtrictly aſcribed to him. For ſtriving, in the ordinary import of the word, connotes weakneſs, or a limited power, which meets with oppoſition, obſtructions and difficulties: Whereas God is almighty; a being, to whom nothing is hard, nothing difficult, which he reſolves to do.</note>
            </p>
            <p>II. I WAS, in the next place, to ſhew you the fatal conſequences of not ſtriving to enter in at the ſtrait gate: Or, in other words, of not uſing your endeavours to obtain eternal life, in the manner repreſented above. And here it is to be obſerved in general, that ſtriving is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſably neceſſary; ſo neceſſary, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it we can never ſee the kingdom of God. It is not now aſſerted, that if we ſtrive aright, we ſhall certainly be ſucceeded in our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours: But let the ſucceſs of our endeavours be ever ſo uncertain; let it be ſuppoſed alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether doubtful, whether our ſtriving ſhall iſſue in our ſalvation, or not; yet it is certain, on
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:008926_0021_103089E168BBC3D0"/>
the other hand, that if we do not ſtrive, we ſhall never obtain eternal life. This is no doubtful point, whatever the other may be. That the conſequences of our negligence in this reſpect, will be fatal, is infallibly certain, though the happy conſequences of uſing our endeavours, ſhould be ever ſo problemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, or precarious. However free the grace of God is, it is manifeſt that he has required ſomething of us in order to our ſalvation. And our Lord here enjoins us to ſtrive to this end: Which is a general command, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending various things in it, as we have ſeen above. And can we ſuppoſe that our Saviour would have commanded us to ſtrive, if ſtriving were unneceſſary to the end propoſed? or, if we might finally enter in at the ſtrait gate without ſtriving? This cannot be reaſonably ſuppoſed.</p>
            <p>BESIDES: If any ſhould imagine that ſtriving is unneceſſary, this would be to ſuppoſe that every thing is unneceſſary, which properly comes under the head of ſtriving; every thing which is preſuppoſed and implied therein, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the account already given of it, ſuppoſing that to be a juſt one. For example: It would be to ſuppoſe that ſinners, to whom the goſpel is preached, may inherit eternal life without giving any credit thereto; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being awakened into a ſenſe of their guilt
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:008926_0022_103089E47791FF78"/>
and miſery; without deſiring to be ſaved; without endeavouring to learn the way of life; without prayer to God; without endeavouring to forſake their ſins; and without endeavouring to do the will of God. All theſe things are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſed and implied in ſtriving; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, if ſtriving be unneceſſary, theſe are unneceſſary. But can any man who believes the holy ſcriptures to be the word of God, (and to ſuch only I am ſpeaking) poſſibly imagine that theſe things are unneceſſary!—That a man may finally obtain the ſalvation revealed thro' Chriſt, altho' he rejects the revelation thereof; altho' he continues hardened in his ſins; altho' he has no deſire to obtain eternal life; altho' he never ſeriouſly enquires the way that leadeth thereto; altho' he never prays to God for his pardon, Spirit and grace; altho' he freely indulges, inſtead of mortifying his luſts; and in fine, tho' he takes no pains, uſes no endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, to keep God's commandments, but wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully violates them from day to day; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues ſo to do to the end of his life! It is ſo manifeſt from the whole tenor of ſcripture, that ſuch a man cannot be ſaved, but muſt periſh in his ſins, that it were a miſ-ſpence of time to prove it, by an induction of particular paſſages.</p>
            <p>IT being certain then, and moſt manifeſt from the holy ſcriptures, that we cannot finally enter in at the ſtrait gate, unleſs we exert our
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:008926_0023_103089E74BC91318"/>
ſelves, and ſtrive in order thereto; from hence appear the fatal conſequences of negligence in this reſpect. I ſay conſequences, and fatal conſequences; for theſe three things are evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently contained, or implied, in being excluded from the kingdom of heaven: The loſs, or falling ſhort of eternal life, glory and happineſs; ſuffering the puniſhment, to which we are juſtly liable as ſinners; and an additional weight of woe and miſery due to us, as deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers of the mercy and grace of God.</p>
            <p>BEING excluded from the kingdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, implies in it the loſs, or falling ſhort of eternal life, glory and happineſs. The ſtrait gate is the gate of life, of joy, of glory, honor and immortality: So that, not to enter in there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at, is to be forever excluded from theſe bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings; from the favour of God, and from the everlaſting joys that are in his preſence; an inheritance incorruptible, undefiled, and that fadeth not away; for it is in heaven, that this inheritance is reſerved; and it can be enjoyed only by thoſe, who ſhall finally enter in at the ſtrait gate.</p>
            <p>THIS farther implies, the ſuffering of that puniſhment, to which we are juſtly liable as ſinners. For, to be excluded from heaven, is in effect to be thruſt down to hell, where the worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched;
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:008926_0024_103089EB3A4A0710"/>
there being no medium, no middle way for us, between being ſaved and damned. As ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful creatures, we are already expoſed to perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the avenging juſtice of God: yea, we are actually under a ſentence of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and death, till ſuch time as we are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered therefrom, by having an intereſt in the redemption wrought out by Chriſt. For, it is to them only that are in Chriſt Jeſus, and ſo in him as to walk, not after the fleſh, but after the ſpirit, that there is no condemnation. Now, how terrible a thing is it to lie forever under guilt, the condemnation of God? How holy a being is he? how great his hatred of ſin? how unlimited his power to puniſh it? how awful his threatnings, and how ſure the execution of them upon finally-hardened and irreclaimable tranſgreſſors? Is it not a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God! Is not deſtruction from the Almighty a terror to us!—eſpecially ſuch an everlaſting deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from his preſence, and the glory of his power, as is threatned in his word! And whatever, fooliſh, falſe-hearted men may ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, or however flatter themſelves with the hopes of impunity, "God is not a man that he ſhould lie, or the ſon of man that he ſhould repent."</p>
            <p>IT is farther to be obſerved here, that thoſe who are favoured with the goſpel, and yet neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:008926_0025_103089EE65975638"/>
to ſtrive after the ſalvation revealed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, will incur an additional weight of woe and miſery, as deſpiſers of the grace and mercy of God. He has provided and revealed a way of ſalvation, for ſinful, guilty and loſt creatures, thro' the mediation, the ſufferings and death of his own dear Son; and ſaith, "Whoſoever will, let him come," &amp;c. God exerciſeth pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and forbearance towards his ſinful crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; thereby giving them time and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity for repentance, and working out their ſalvation. Now, if you ſhould neglect this method of deliverance from condemnation, and think everlaſting life not worth your ſtriving after; you will not only remain under the guilt of your other ſins, but will be juſtly chargeable alſo with deſpiſing the goodneſs of God; even the "riches of his goodneſs, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance and long-ſuffering": And if you do ſo, you muſt needs "treaſure up unto your ſelves wrath againſt the day of wrath, and revelation of the righteous judgment of God." Your guilt and puniſhment will be greatly aggravated in this reſpect. You will not only be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as ſinners in the day of judgment; but as the moſt heinous ſinners: you will not only be caſt into the place of torments; but have your part amongſt the moſt wretched that ſuffer there. In conformity hereto, our Lord himſelf denounced a peculiar woe againſt the inhabitants of Corazin, Bethſaida and Caper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naum,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:008926_0026_103089F02D54F330"/>
where he had preached the goſpel of the kingdom, becauſe they repented not; aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring them, that it ſhould be more tolerable for thoſe of Tyre and Sydon, for Sodom and Gomorrha, in the day of judgment, than for them. Thus alſo it is ſaid in the epiſtle to the Hebrews: "If the word ſpoken by angels was ſtedfaſt, and every tranſgreſſion and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience received a juſt recompence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; how ſhall we eſcape, if we neglect ſo great ſalvation, which at the firſt began to be ſpoken by the Lord," &amp;c.? And again: "If he that deſpiſed Moſes' law, died without mercy,—of how much ſorer puniſhment ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ye, ſhall they be thought worthy, who have trodden under foot the Son of God," &amp;c.?</p>
            <p>YOU ſee then, what is to be the portion of thoſe who neglect, inſtead of ſtriving to obtain, the ſalvation revealed in the goſpel. They will not only be excluded from eternal glory and happineſs in the kingdom of God, continue under wrath, and ſuffer as tranſgreſſors of God's law; but alſo incur a peculiarly aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated condemnation, as deſpiſers of that mercy, which provided and revealed a method of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation for ſinners. Such will be the fatal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of not ſtriving. And I am, in the next place,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:008926_0027_103089F3015E3840"/>
III. To repreſent to you the happy and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious conſequences of ſtriving ſucceſsfully, or ſo as finally to enter in at the ſtrait gate; without pretending to determine at preſent, whether your endeavours to this end will certainly be effectual, or not. But this is at leaſt a poſſible ſuppoſition: And, O! what would you gain, if your endeavours ſhould actually be crowned with ſucceſs! This appears, in ſome meaſure, from what has been ſaid under the preceeding head of diſcourſe; ſo that there will be the leſs occaſion, as indeed there is not time, for much enlargement here. Succeſs in theſe endeavors will be abundantly ſufficient, yea, infinitely more than ſufficient, to reward all the pains you take, or can take, even tho' you ſhould ſpend a thouſand, or ten million years, in the moſt intenſe application; and allow yourſelves no reſt day or night. For, on this ſuppoſition, you will obtain eternal deliverance from guilt, condemnation and wrath: And not only ſo, but be compleatly and everlaſtingly bleſſed.</p>
            <p>YOU will obtain eternal deliverance from guilt, condemnation and wrath. The wages of ſin, you know, is death; or everlaſting de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction from the preſence of the Lord. Now a primary, or main end of the ſtriving enjoined upon us in the text, is, obtaining delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from a ſtate of guilt, miſery and ruin; or from the wrath which is to come upon the
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:008926_0028_103089F6F7406CA8"/>
world of the ungodly; as appears from what has been diſcourſed above. So that ſucceſs in theſe endeavours, or in this ſtriving, implies in the very notion of it, obtaining a full and final releaſe from all our ſins, and from the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment due to them. And how glorious a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge is this! Bleſſed indeed is he, whoſe tranſgreſſions are thus forgiven, and whoſe ſin is covered; yea, thrice bleſſed is that man, unto whom the Lord will not impute iniquity!—who ſhall never come into condemnation! If it ſhould be ſaid, that to be exempted from puniſhment, is but a negative happineſs; or that it implies no poſitive good in it; be it ſo. Yet ſurely, deliverance from evil is worth ſtriving for; eſpecially, from ſo great an evil, as the damnation of hell. Tho' this were <hi>all</hi> that we could hope to obtain by ſtriving; yet, doubtleſs, our endeavours to this end would be well beſtowed.</p>
            <p>BUT, as was before obſerved, if you ſtrive effectually, you will not only obtain delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from ſin and death; but be the heirs of eternal life and glory. That narrow gate, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which you ſtrive to enter, is the gate of life, the gate of heaven. And conſequently, if you ſtrive effectually, you will gain admiſſion into the manſions of everlaſting joy. "Eye hath not indeed ſeen, nor ear heard, neither have ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into the heart of man, the things which
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:008926_0029_103089F9D21209A0"/>
God hath prepared for them that love him." But, from what he hath revealed unto us by his Spirit, we know in general that the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtate is a ſtate of perfect holineſs and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; an happineſs adapted to the rational na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man; adequate to his moſt exalted wiſhes; yea, far ſurpaſſing all his preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions; an happineſs which will never be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted or diminiſhed; but conſtant, immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and eternal. And if there were but a bare poſſibility of obtaining ſuch an happineſs as this, what reaſonable man would not ſtrive in order to it? eſpecially when the certain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of neglecting to do ſo, are taken into conſideration!</p>
            <p>WHAT connexion there is between our ſtriving, and actually obtaining the ſalvation of our ſouls, according to the holy ſcriptures, is, by divine permiſſion and aſſiſtance, to be conſidered in another diſcourſe. But the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent muſt not be concluded without ſome ſhort reflexions on what has been ſaid already.</p>
            <p>And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. IT appears, that there is ſomething re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of, and to be <hi>done</hi> by ſinful men, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to their ſalvation. Our Lord commands us to ſtrive to enter in at the ſtrait gate; and certainly this implies the doing ſomething;
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:008926_0030_103089FBDD531868"/>
yea, of many things, with a view to obtaining eternal life. Nor is there a ſingle command of Chriſt in the goſpel, but what ought to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed, partly with this view; though not indeed, under the notion of meriting ſalvation thereby. How ſtrange? how unnaccountable is it then, that any ſhould aſſert, as ſome have done, that there is nothing to be done by ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, in order to their ſalvation; or at leaſt, nothing beſides believing! And ſome there are, who have gone ſo far as to ſay, that the very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, What men are to do to obtain eternal life, is an indication of a ſelf-righteous ſpirit; and a proof, that the perſon who makes it, knows nothing of the goſpel-diſpenſation! What ſtrange infatuation is this! And with how much truth and propriety might it be retorted, that thoſe who have ſuch a conception of the goſpel, are themſelves groſly ignorant of it; and need to be taught, even the firſt principles of the oracles of God?</p>
            <p n="2">2. IT farther appears, how much thoſe are miſtaken, who ſuppoſe that the working out their ſalvation is an <hi>eaſy</hi> matter; attended with few or no difficulties; and rather a matter of amuſement, than of great pains, labor and ſelf-denial; of the moſt intenſe application, and vigorous exertions. Our Saviour, who cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly knew every thing relating to this affair, enjoins us to "ſtrive;" or, if the word may
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:008926_0031_103089FEC4E55390"/>
may be allowed, to "agonize," that we may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into life: Plainly importing, that the buſineſs of religion is at once of ſuch vaſt importance, and attended with ſuch difficulties, as to call for the moſt anxious concern, the moſt fixed reſolutions, and unwearied endeavours. And there are divers metaphors uſed in ſcripture, relative to this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which naturally ſuggeſt the ſame thing to us: Particularly thoſe of "wreſtling," "running," and "fighting;" which expreſs efforts of ſtrength and activity, joined with warineſs and circumſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Theſe are all applied to the exerciſes, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and employments of the chriſtian life; as if a man were to be almoſt continually exerting himſelf, and upon his guard, as in a race, a fight, or ſome other exerciſe, which at once requires care, dexterity, and a vigorous exertion of ſtrength: And ſurely heaven is not prepared as a receptacle, or mighty hive, for the drones of the earth! But if we were to judge by the conduct of ſome profeſſed chriſtians, and thoſe, perhaps, not the worſt that the world affords, we ſhould be apt to think, that to be, and to live the life of, a chriſtian, was a thing of the greateſt eaſe: and, as was intimated before, rather a matter of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſement, than of habitual care, pains and labor. For how many are there, who apparently, inſtead of making the ſalvation of their ſouls their grand concern, the object of their moſt earneſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, conſider it rather as ſomething which is beſide the main buſineſs of life; ſomething ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:008926_0032_10308A02B4A422A0"/>
not only to the getting riches or power, but even to their <hi>other</hi> diverſions and paſtimes? There are many perſons of this character in the world; who may yet think themſelves in the way of ſalvation, becauſe they make a profeſſion of religion; becauſe they attend the public wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip—when it ſuits their <hi>humour;</hi> and are not openly vicious in their lives. But ſuch perſons will be certainly diſappointed, if they expect, in this way, ever to get admiſſion into the kingdom of heaven. For can they, with any propriety of language, be ſaid to ſtrive to enter in at the ſtrait gate? or can they enter there, without ſtriving? What they really ſtrive for, is to obtain wealth, worldly honors, worldly pleaſures, and the meat that periſheth; not the pearl of great price, not that honor that cometh from God, not thoſe pleaſures that are at his right hand, not the meat that endureth unto everlaſting life. Let none delude themſelves with an imagination, that they are in that "narrow way" that leadeth unto life everlaſting, while they live after this thoughtleſs, negligent and looſe manner; nor unleſs they ſtrive in earneſt to enter in at the ſtrait gate, as a matter of infinite concernment to them; in compariſon of which, all other things are of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial conſequence, hardly worth a ſerious thought. This is indeed, what our Lord intends when he ſays, "one thing is needful." And bleſſed are they, who are ſo wiſe as, with Mary, to "chooſe that good part, that ſhall not be taken away from them."</p>

3. YOU may ſee, by what has been ſaid, not only that ſtriving is neceſſary in order to entering into life; but alſo, that the <hi>manner</hi> of ſtriving is of great importance. People may take conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able pains in religion, with a view to their future happineſs; and yet, thro' criminal inattention, not "ſtrive lawfully," or in the manner they ought to do; and ſo never enter into life. To ſtrive to enter in at the ſtrait gate, is an injunction of Jeſus Chriſt; and therefore muſt be ſuppoſed to mean, ſtriving in a way that is in general a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the plan of the goſpel, the doctrine of our redemption. And if, thro' vicious prejudice, or even thro' want of ſuch attention as might be reaſonably expected of us, we ſhould wholly miſtake in this matter; whatever we do, muſt, on the moſt favourable ſuppoſition, go for noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Unleſs we ſtrive, in general, in the manner we ought to do, allowing for involuntary miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes, we are not in the way that leadeth unto life. And if we are not in that narrow way, we are of conſequence travelling towards the wide gate of deſtruction; and ſhall unqueſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, unleſs we alter our courſe, increaſe the vaſt and wretched number of thoſe, that go in there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at!—Of this, however, there is no real danger, if we earneſtly endeavour to be rightly informed: For, of thoſe who are favoured with the goſpel, if there be few that find the way of life, it muſt be, becauſe there are but few who ſeaſonably and diligently inquire after it: Tho' this is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly one thing implied in ſtriving.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="36" facs="unknown:008926_0034_10308A07975436B8"/>
4. LET me earneſtly exhort all to ſtrive. Tho' your endeavours ſhould prove ineffectual; yet, as that is ſuppoſed at preſent to be an uncertainty, you are obliged in all reaſon to do your beſt, leaving the event with God. For this is the ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, the dilemma you are in, as guilty creatures: If you do not ſtrive to obtain deliverance from condemnation, you will, you <hi>muſt,</hi> continue un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, and be miſerable hereafter. But if you ſtrive, it is at leaſt poſſible that you <hi>may</hi> obtain deliverance from the wrath to come, and be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally happy. And can you heſitate, in this ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, which is the wiſer part to take! Do you not ſtrive, in your worldly concernments, when at as great uncertainty about the ſucceſs of your endeavours? And yet thoſe are matters of no importance, in compariſon with this: "For what is a man profited, if he gain the whole world, and loſe his own ſoul?" In <hi>thoſe</hi> affairs, tho' you did not exert yourſelves with vigor, the damage could be but ſmall, comparatively ſpeaking; and the gain is but ſmall and temporary, when your en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours are ſucceſsful. But in <hi>this,</hi> if you are careleſs and negligent, you periſh in your ſins, and are ruined forever: And if you ſtrive ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully, as perhaps you may, your gain is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite; a treaſure that faileth not, a kingdom that hath foundations, a crown of glory that fadeth not away.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="unknown:008926_0035_10308A0CD3A15078"/>
BUT to conclude: If there are any who will not ſtrive to enter in at the ſtrait gate of life, let them be perſuaded at leaſt, not to take pains to go in at that which leadeth to deſtruction; which is altogether needleſs. For this gate is wide, ready to receive all that come; the way thereto is broad, ſo that it can hardly be miſſed; and there are many who, even without taking pains for it, go in thereat. But yet there are ſome perſons, who ſeem to ſtrive, and take great pains, to enter in at this wide gate: I mean all ſuch as endeavour to ſtifle the convictions of their own conſciences; to perſuade themſelves, that the chriſtian revelation is a fable, and to quench the Spirit of God, that ſtriveth with them. There are undoubtedly ſome, who really take pains to rid themſelves of every religious and moral prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple; of all the reſtraints of conſcience, which they find troubleſome to them; which is no eaſy thing, eſpecially for thoſe who have had a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous education. Some there are, who ſeem to endeavour to excel in wickedneſs; who pride themſelves in impiety and vice; in profane curſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſwearing, in drinking, wantonneſs and riot: Who even "weary themſelves to do ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity;" and afterwards glory in their ſhame. Now, all ſuch perſons may be ſaid to ſtrive, not to ſave, but to deſtroy their own ſouls. But how unneceſſary a labor is this! And if even the righteous ſcarcely are ſaved, where ſhall ſuch ungodly ſinners appear!—"Wo unto him that
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:008926_0036_10308A0E79F9FEC8"/>
               <hi>ſtriveth</hi> [thus] <hi>with his</hi> MAKER: Let the pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſherd ſtrive with the potſherds of the earth."—Do not, I beſeech you, ſo fooliſhly, ſo wickedly, as to "ſeek death in the error of your life!" Our Lord ſays, in alluſion to the taking a city by ſtorm, that the "kingdom of heaven ſuffereth violence, and the violent take it by force." The kingdom of heaven is thus to be taken; and there is at once glory and gain in ſuch a conqueſt. But what occaſion is there, ſo to expreſs it, for ſtorming hell, whoſe gates are ever wide extended, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive every comer! There is no occaſion for any formal ſiege, for any aſſault or violence, in order to get admittance into that place of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: And tho' there were, yet there would be neither honor nor advantage to reward the exploit.—But why do I ſpeak thus to you, my friends and brethren? I hope in God, there are no ſuch abandoned ſinners amongſt my hearers; tho' there may probably be ſome perſons, who take little or no pains to obtain ſalvation; and who are therefore particularly concerned in this admonition:—"Strive to enter in at the ſtrait gate; for many, I ſay unto you, ſhall ſeek to enter in, and ſhall not be able."</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>BY the ſtrait gate is intended, the gate of life, or of the kingdom of heaven. It is called ſtrait, in reſpect of the difficulties which attend gaining admiſſion into thoſe bleſſed man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. By ſtriving to enter at this gate, is meant in general, uſing our ſincere endeavours to obtain eternal life. But, more particularly, this ſtriving preſuppoſes and comprehends in it, a ſpeculative belief of the chriſtian revelation; a ſenſe of our ſinful, periſhing condition; an earneſt deſire to obtain the ſalvation revealed thro' Chriſt; ſerious and diligent inquiry after the way of life; prayer to God for the pardon of ſin, for his ſpirit and grace; ſtriving againſt ſin, with an endeavour to keep all God's commandments; ſtill relying,
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:008926_0038_10308A1341EA47B8"/>
not on any ſuppoſed merit in what we do, but on the mercy of God in Chriſt, for acceptance with him. All which implies a partial refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, or a good work begun in the ſinner, by the word and ſpirit of God; tho' it does not neceſſarily imply <hi>that</hi> thorough change, which the ſcriptures expreſs by a new and clean heart, by the new creature, and by being born of the Spirit.—Striving to enter in at the ſtrait gate, is indiſpenſably neceſſary in order to our ſalvation. Without it we ſhall certainly fall ſhort of eternal life, continue under condemnation, and incur an additional degree of guilt and miſery, as deſpiſers of the grace of God. Such will be the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of not ſtriving. On the other hand, if we ſtrive effectually, we ſhall obtain deliverance from the wrath to come; and be inexpreſſibly and eternally happy in the kingdom, preſence and enjoyment of God, the ſupreme good. So that we have great reaſon to ſtrive, tho' there were but a bare poſſibility, that our endeavours may be crowned with ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>THE ſeveral things here mentioned in a curſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry manner, were enlarged on in the preceding diſcourſe, under three general heads. And there now remains only one point to be conſidered, in order to finiſh the deſign which I had, when I entered on this ſubject. And that is,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="unknown:008926_0039_10308A185DF72098"/>
IV. WHAT connexion there is, according to the word of God, betwixt our ſtriving, and finally obtaining what is the grand one and object of our endeavours, the ſalvation of our ſouls.</p>
            <p>SOME perſons, and indeed not a few, have ſuppoſed that there is no certain connexion between any ſtrivings or endeavours of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and their obtaining eternal life: While others have ſuppoſed that our ſucceſs is certain, provided we ſtrive as we may and ought to do, to enter in at the ſtrait gate. To conſider this matter, by the light of God's holy word, and by his aſſiſtance, is propoſed as the buſineſs of this diſcourſe. And I ſhall beg leave to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce what I have to offer upon it, with ſome ſhort remarks, tending to a juſt and clear ſtating of the point. The firſt of which is,</p>
            <p n="1">1. THAT the queſtion does not relate to the ſtriving, or endeavours, of the regenerate; of thoſe that are already born of God, or ſuch as are, in the moſt proper ſenſe, true believers and real chriſtians. The queſtion is not, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the endeavours of ſuch, to obtain ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhall be effectual or not? For it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed on all hands, that they ſhall infallibly be ſo. All acknowledge, that the goſpel plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and directly promiſes eternal life to perſons of this character. So that the preſent inquiry
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:008926_0040_10308A1A0AA88BD0"/>
has no relation to ſuch. And conſequently, it muſt relate wholly to the endeavours of the unregenerate.</p>
            <p>2dly. THE queſtion is not, Whether ſinners can be finally ſaved, without becoming true believers, or real chriſtians, in the moſt proper ſenſe? Concerning this matter, there is no more controverſy, than there is about the point laſt mentioned. For it is allowed on all hands, that without holineſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord; or ever gain admiſſion into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven. This is therefore no part of the queſtion before us. Neither,</p>
            <p>3dly. Is the queſtion, Whether a ſinful crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can attain to true holineſs, and ſo be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to eternal life, merely by any endeavours of his own, or without the renewing and ſanctifying influences of the Spirit of God? It is generally, if not univerſally, agreed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt profeſſed chriſtians, that repentance unto life, and evangelical holineſs, are not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable without the gracious operations of God's holy Spirit; and conſequently, that without theſe divine influences, all the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of ſinners to attain to holineſs, and ſo to eternal life, muſt be ineffectual. Which indeed amounts to neither more nor leſs, than what our Lord himſelf declares,—That "except a man be born again, he cannot ſee the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:008926_0041_10308A1BD7138FF0"/>
of God." Chriſtians do indeed differ con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably in their manner of explaining them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon this ſubject: But there are few or none, but what do in general aſſert the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of divine grace, or the influences of God's Spirit, in order to a ſaving converſion; or in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to a ſinner's attaining to holineſs here, and happineſs hereafter. And this is now taken for granted, as a certain and important truth. So that it is no part of the preſent queſtion, whether the endeavours of ſinners will be effectual to their ſalvation, without the grace of God vouchſafed to them, ſo as to create in them clean hearts, and right ſpirits? For it is certain, they will not. Neither,</p>
            <p>4thly. Is the preſent queſtion, Whether God is obliged, in juſtice, to renew or change the heart of a ſinner, in conſequence of his endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, prayers, or any thing which he can be ſuppoſed to do? Or, in other words, is obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, in point of juſtice, to ſucceed the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of ſinners, in order to their attaining to holineſs and eternal life? It is generally al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, that God is not bound in juſtice thus to ſucceed a ſinner's endeavours; at leaſt, this is now taken for granted. And to ſuppoſe that God is obliged, in point of equity, to do this, would be moſt abſurd, not to ſay impious. For, as ſinners, we have forfeited all right to God's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; to any good whatſoever; and are juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:008926_0042_10308A1D8A1C7870"/>
liable to wrath and puniſhment. And if ſo, it is a manifeſt inconſiſtency to ſuppoſe, that any thing which a ſinner does, or can do, ſhould merit his favourable regards; or juſtly entitle him to thoſe influences of the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which are neceſſary, and which will be effectual, to the ſinner's ſalvation. This would be, to ſuppoſe him juſtly liable to wrath for his ſins, and at the ſame time to have a juſt claim to ſalvation on account of his endeavours: For to have a juſt claim to ſalvation, and to have a claim of right to thoſe renewing influences of God's Spirit, which have ſalvation connected with them, amount to the ſame thing at laſt; And ſo the ſuppoſitions are equally irrational, From whence it follows,</p>
            <p>5thly. THAT if there be any certain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion between the endeavours of ſinful crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to obtain eternal life, and their actually obtaining it, this is a connexion which the free grace, or unmerited goodneſs of God, has made and eſtabliſhed: And ſo can be known, only by the gracious promiſes or declarations of his word: For, between God's juſtice and his grace there is no medium. If there be ſuch a connexion, which does not ariſe from the former, as certainly it cannot; it muſt of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence flow from the latter. And this can be known only from divine revelation: For it is only from the word, declarations and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:008926_0043_10308A206849DF90"/>
of God, that we can certainly know, to what particular objects, in what manner and meaſure, when, and under what circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, God will exerciſe grace, or ſhew mercy to the guilty. Wherefore,</p>
            <p>6thly. UPON laying theſe ſeveral things to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, you will pleaſe to obſerve, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry before us really comes to this at laſt, <abbr>viz.</abbr> Whether there are in the word of God, any gracious promiſes, invitations, or declarations, reſpecting unregenerate ſinners, to whom the goſpel is preached, from whence it may be clearly inferred, that if they ſtrive in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner they may and ought to do, to attain to holineſs and eternal life, God will certainly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford them all the influences of his Spirit and grace, which are neceſſary to that end: So that their endeavours ſhall not be in vain, but ſucceeded by him, and rendered effectual to their ſalvation? This, it is humbly conceived, is a fair, juſt and plain ſtate of the important queſtion propoſed.—It may, however, be ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſomewhat differently thus, without altering the true import of it, <abbr>viz.</abbr> Whether the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious declarations and promiſes of God in his word, are ſuch as will in any meaſure admit of the ſuppoſition, that unregenerate ſinners, to whom the goſpel is preached, may deſire, ſtrive, and earneſtly endeavour, in the uſe of proper means, to obtain the ſalvation revealed
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:008926_0044_10308A26A7836310"/>
therein, ſeeking to God for his grace and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance; and yet poſſibly fall ſhort of eternal life, and periſh in their ſins, by reaſon that God with-holds his Spirit and grace from them? The queſtion thus ſtated, comes preciſely to the ſame thing, as in the former way. Or it may be reduced to another form, and ſtill nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower compaſs, thus: <abbr>viz.</abbr> Whether unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate ſinners, under the diſpenſation of the Goſpel, have <hi>any</hi> day of grace and ſalvation afforded to them; in ſuch a ſenſe, that they ſhall certainly obtain eternal life, provided they heartily deſire it, and ſtrive to that end?—I have expreſſed the true point in queſtion, in theſe ſeveral ways, not merely for the ſake of having it clearly underſtood; but partly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I ſuppoſed, that the bare ſtating it thus, would go a conſiderable ways towards a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per reſolution of it, with thoſe that are tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably acquainted with the general tenor of holy ſcripture; unleſs their minds are unhappily prepoſſeſſed in favor of ſome unſcriptural ſcheme of ſyſtematical divinity.</p>
            <p>HAVING prepared the way by theſe previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous remarks, I ſhall now proceed more directly to what I had principally in view; which was to prove, by arguments drawn from the holy ſcriptures, That there is a certain connexion between ſinners ſtriving to obtain the ſalvation which God has revealed, and their actually
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:008926_0045_10308A2867176A70"/>
obtaining it.<note n="*" place="bottom">To avoid unneceſſary repetitions, the reader is deſired to remember, (1.) That, in this diſcourſe, by ſinners, unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate ſinners are always meant. And (2.) That when their ſtrivings, or endeavoure, are ſpoken of, this muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in general of ſuch ſtrivings, or endeavours, as are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in the preceeding diſcourſe. I ſay, in general: for poſſibly one or two expreſſions uſed in that deſcription, are in ſtrictneſs applicable to the endeavours of the regenerate only; tho' I am not at preſent ſenſible of any ſuch.</note> By arguments drawn from holy ſcripture, are not, however, intended, only ſuch as are drawn from ſcripture-promiſes; but alſo from any doctrine or declaration of ſcripture: For if arguments are fairly and juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deduced from the word of God, or are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive, it is immaterial from what particular topic they are taken. And you are deſired to obſerve, that I do not put the intire deciſion of this point, upon the abſolute concluſiveneſs of every ſingle argument, or paſſage of ſcripture, that ſhall be alledged; but upon the joint force, the concurring evidence, and reſult of all. For it will be ſufficient, if the concluſion fairly reſults from them all, conſidered collectively, altho' it ſhould not, from any one of them ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately taken. Accordingly, it is to be obſerved here,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) THAT mankind being conſidered in ſcripture, as in a ſtate of ſin and death, it is declared that Jeſus Chriſt came into the world to ſave them; to "ſave ſinners" to "ſeek and to ſave that which was loſt."
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:008926_0046_10308A2A5C11BEC8"/>
In conformity whereto, the angel that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to the terrified ſhepherds on the night of his nativity, comforted them with the following words:—"Behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which ſhall be to <hi>all people:</hi> For unto you is born—a Saviour, which is Chriſt the Lord." "And ſuddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly hoſt, praiſing God, and ſaying, Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to God in the higheſt, and on earth peace, <hi>good will towards men"</hi> [indefinitely.] Agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly hereto it is declared, that Chriſt "gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a ranſom for all"; that he "died for all;" and that he "taſted death for every man." And our Lord commanded his apoſtles to preach the goſpel, or theſe glad tidings, to "every creature." This is called the "goſpel of the grace of God;" and profeſſes to point out a method of ſalvation for ſinners. The apoſtle Paul ſays, with reference hereto: "The grace of God that <hi>bringeth ſalvation,</hi> hath appeared unto <hi>all men</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Tit. II. 11. THE original words might, perhaps, be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated with more propriety—"The grace of God <hi>that bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſalvation to all men,</hi> hath appeared; teaching us," &amp;c. So they are rendered in the margin of ſome of our bibles. And being thus underſtood, they will be rather more direct and full to the point in view.</note>; teaching us," &amp;c. Now, from ſuch declarations of holy ſcripture, we may fairly infer, that all thoſe, to whom the goſpel is preached, have therein an offer of ſalvation made to them. For in what other view can
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:008926_0047_10308A2D34195B48"/>
it be conſidered, as glad tidings of great joy to all that hear In what other view can it be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly called, the grace of God that bringeth ſalvation to all men? And if it really makes an offer, or points out a method of ſalvation to all; can it be ſuppoſed that any ſinner, who is willing, and deſirous, and ſtrives, to obtain the ſalvation thus revealed, ſhould yet be rejected of God, and finally periſh? Certainly it cannot.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) GOD hath declared in the moſt ſolemn manner, that he hath no pleaſure in the death of ſinners: "As I live, ſaith the Lord, I have no pleaſure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live." Yea, it is declared, that God "will have all men to be ſaved." Now, if what theſe declarations moſt obviouſly and ſtrongly import, be true; ſurely all who really deſire and ſtrive to obtain eternal life, will certainly obtain it. For if God himſelf hath no pleaſure in their death, but the contrary; and if they themſelves deſire life, and endeavour to obtain it, what ſhould hinder their ſalvation? Can the devil be ſuppoſed to prevent it, on theſe ſuppoſitions? He cannot, unleſs he is ſtronger, not only than man, but than God himſelf!</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) ACCORDING to the repreſentations of ſcripture, God affords to ſinners a ſpace for repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, a day of grace and ſalvation; or a ſeaſon for making their peace with him; during which time,
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:008926_0048_10308A300A7B9BE8"/>
he is ſaid to be "near", ſo that he "may be found" by them that ſeek him. Yea, God is repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as long-ſuffering towards them, being unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that they ſhould periſh. To which purpoſe are the following paſſages, amongſt innumerable others. "Seek ye the Lord <hi>while he may be found;</hi> call ye upon him <hi>while he is near.</hi> Let the wicked forſake his way;"<note n="*" place="bottom">Iſai. LV. 7</note> &amp;c. <hi>"To day,</hi> if ye will hear his voice, harden not your heart, as in the day of temptation—Forty years was I grieved with this generation,"<note n="§" place="bottom">Pſal. XCV. 7.</note> &amp;c. "Agree with thine adverſary quickly, <hi>whiles thou art in the way with him;</hi> leſt," &amp;c. "He beheld the city, and wept over it, ſaying, If thou hadſt known, even thou, at leaſt <hi>in this thy day,</hi> the things which belong unto thy peace! but now,"<note n="‡" place="bottom">Luke XIX. 41. 42.</note> &amp;c. "I gave her <hi>a ſpace to repent</hi>—and ſhe repented not"<note n="†" place="bottom">Rev. 11. 21.</note>.—"Receive not the grace of God in vain—For he ſaith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of ſalvation have I ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coured thee: Behold now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of ſalvation<note n="‡§" place="bottom">2 Cor. VI. 1, 2.</note>". "The Lord is not ſlack concerning his promiſe, as ſome men count ſlackneſs; but is <hi>long-ſuffering to us<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, not willing that</hi> ANY <hi>ſhould periſh,</hi> but that ALL ſhould come to repentance<note n="†§" place="bottom">2 Pet. III. 9.</note>." Now, is it conſiſtent with theſe repeated declarations, to ſuppoſe that ſinners, during this time of their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation, may really deſire and ſtrive to enter in
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:008926_0049_10308A34040BA500"/>
at the ſtrait gate; and yet fall ſhort of ſalvation? If God is long-ſuffering, "not willing that any" of thoſe ſinners, to whom the goſpel is preached, ſhould periſh, but that "all" ſhould come to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; certainly he puts them all into a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity for attaining ſalvation. To ſuppoſe that any are left in ſuch a ſtate, that they cannot avoid periſhing, tho' they deſire it; or in ſuch a ſtate, as renders repentance impoſſible for them; mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly ſuppoſes, that God <hi>wills them to periſh,</hi> that he <hi>would not</hi> have them come to repentance; not really allows them a ſpace for it, in any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſenſe: And ſo is directly contrary to the doctrine of ſcripture—But let the unbiaſſed judge.</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) IT is farther to be remarked, that during this ſpace given for repentance, or that day of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, which the ſcriptures ſo plainly aſſert; ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are earneſtly admoniſhed, exhorted and commanded, to ſeek God, to be reconciled to him, and to work out their ſalvation. Thus in ſome of the paſſages but juſt now quoted—"Seek the Lord while he may be found," &amp;c. "To day, if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts." So in Prov I. "Wiſdom crieth without—How long. ye ſimple ones, will ye love ſimplicity? and the ſcorners delight in ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and fools hate knowledge? Turn you at my reproof," &amp;c. And ſtill more emphatical are the words of the apoſtle, in his ſecond epiſtle to the Corinthians; a part of which paſſage was
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:008926_0050_10308A35D22D7528"/>
quoted before. But you may pleaſe to conſider it more at large, as it here follows. "All things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himſelf by Jeſus Chriſt, and hath given to us the miniſtry of reconciliation: To wit, that God was in Chriſt reconciling THE WORLD unto himſelf, not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting their treſpaſſes unto them; and hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto us the word of reconciliation. Now then we are embaſſadors for Chriſt, <hi>as tho' God did beſeech you by us;</hi> we pray you in Chriſt's ſtead, be ye reconciled to God. For he hath made him to be ſin for us, who knew no ſin; that we might be made the righteouſneſs of God in him. We then as workers together with him, beſeech you alſo, that ye receive not the grace" [the goſpel] "of God in vain. For he ſaith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of ſalvation have I ſuccoured thee: behold, now is the accepted time," &amp;c. Theſe exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and commands, are all directed more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to ſinners; to "the wicked"; to "ſimple ones, "ſcorners", and "fools"; to ſuch as were not yet "reconciled to God". And can any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced man think it conſiſtent with them, to ſuppoſe, that ſinners may be awakened to ſuch a ſenſe of their miſery in being in a ſtate of aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from God, as to deſire to be reconciled to him, and really ſtrive to obtain a part in the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation thus revealed; and yet fail of it! Judge for yourſelves—</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="53" facs="unknown:008926_0051_10308A377A19DB08"/>
(5.) CONFORMABLY hereto, life and death, bleſſing and curſing, are ſaid to be ſet before ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, in the word of God; and they are admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed to chooſe life—"I call heaven and earth to record this day—that I have ſet before you life and death, bleſſing and curſing; therefore chooſe life",<note n="*" place="bottom">Deut. XXX. 19.</note> &amp;c. But, with what truth or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety could life and death be ſaid to be ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſinners, if tho' they deſired life, and heartily endeavour'd to obtain it, they might yet fail thereof? On this ſuppoſition, it is only death that is really ſet before them, in any proper, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent ſenſe; without any life or bleſſing, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition thereto—It were but a cavil to ſay, that Moſes, or God by him, here addreſſes himſelf to the people of Iſrael upon the footing of mere law; enjoining upon them perfect obedience thereto, as the condition of their attaining life; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing death againſt them in caſe of the leaſt failure. They were already ſinners, tranſgreſſors of the law, and are ſpoken of as ſuch, in the verſe immediately foregoing. So that in reſpect of mere law, they were under a curſe already; and were utterly incapacitated to obtain life on the footing of law. Nothing but death was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them in that reſpect, tho' they had deſired life. And yet life and bleſſing are ſaid that day to have been ſet before them, as well as death and curſing: And they are admoniſhed to chooſe life, as what was, at that time, attainable, if cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen;
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:008926_0052_10308A3926AD69B8"/>
for it is added,—that thou and thy ſeed may live." It is manifeſt therefore, that they were not here treated with upon the footing of mere law; life being offered to, or ſet before them, for their choice, conſidered as ſinners. And if ſo, the obtaining it depended on their choice, or was connected therewith. And doubtleſs, it is not leſs truly and properly ſet before ſinners now, under the goſpel diſpenſation, that it was before the Iſ<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>lites in the time of Moſes. From whence we may conclude, that if we really de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and ſtrive to enter into life, we ſhall not fall ſhort of it.</p>
            <p n="6">(6.) THE ſcriptures ſpeak of ſome ſinners as wholly left, and forſaken of God, in this world; given up to their own heart's luſt, to incureable blindneſs, to ſtrong deluſion, &amp;c. that they "might be damned." Now if there is any ſuch thing as ſuch-like paſſages of ſcripture ſeem to aſſert, and as they are uſually underſtood; it will even from hence follow, that the perſons thus given up of God, were, antecedently hereto, in a ſalvable ſtate; that they had in ſome meaſure the reſtraints and ſtrivings of God's ſpirit; that they were really put into a capacity for obtaining ſalvation, had they deſired it; and that their not doing ſo, was the reaſon of their being thus for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken. And this is agreeable to the repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſcripture, in thoſe very paſſages, which are here alluded to—"My people <hi>would</hi> not hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:008926_0053_10308A3AD16DDA60"/>
to my voice, and Iſrael <hi>would</hi> none of me: So I gave them up," &amp;c.—"If thou hadſt known, even thou, in this thy day, the things that belong to thy peace! but <hi>now</hi> they are hidden from thine eyes"—"They received not the love of the truth, that they might be ſaved: And for this cauſe God ſhall ſend them ſtrong deluſion—that they all might be damned." Their caſe is repreſented as being made deſperate, by their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus given up of God; and this is aſcribed to their neglect of a former opportunity, in which they were in a capacity for attaining ſalvation. And indeed, if they were not, the "things which belonged unto their peace", were really hid from their eyes before, as truly as afterwards. If God gave them up, becauſe they would not hearken to his voice; then they were not given up before they refuſed to do ſo; but might have obtained life, had they ſought after it: without which ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, there ſeems to be no ground for any ſuch diſtinction as is apparently made between their ſtate before, and their ſtate after, God thus gave them over.</p>
            <p n="7">(7.) THE ſcriptures ſpeak plainly and directly of ſinners neglecting the opportunity allowed them for obtaining life, as the real cauſe of their death or deſtruction.—"Becauſe I have called, and ye refuſed; I have ſtretched out my hand, and no man regarded; but ye have ſet at nought all my counſel—I alſo will laugh at your calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

XCV. 10. 11</note> "How ſhall we eſcape, if we neglect ſo great ſalvation,"<note n="‡" place="bottom">Heb. 11. 3.</note> &amp;c. "Ye <hi>will not</hi> come unto me, that ye might have life."<note n="§" place="bottom">John V. 40.</note> "O Jeruſalem—how often would I have gathered thy children—and ye <hi>would</hi> not!"<note n="§§" place="bottom">Matt. XXIII 37.</note> Theſe, with innumerable other paſſages of ſcripture, moſt clearly and ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expreſs this ſentiment; That the true and only reaſon why ſinners periſh, is, that they do not "regard" the hand of God, ſtretched out to ſave them; that they "grieve" him by their obduracy in ſin; that they "neglect" the great ſalvation offered to them; and "will not" come to Jeſus Chriſt for life. But neither of theſe things can be truly and properly ſaid of thoſe perſons, who are awakened to ſuch a ſenſe of their ſins, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to deſire the ſalvation revealed, and to ſtrive in order thereto; even tho' they are not (which is very ſuppoſeable) already in a regenerate ſtate. And therefore all ſuch perſons, unleſs they ceaſe to deſire and ſtrive thus, ſhall be ſaved; not, to be ſure, without being born of God; but they
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:008926_0055_10308A44D07D9690"/>
ſhall be "renewed in the ſpirit of their minds;" and conſequently enter into life.</p>
            <p n="8">(8.) SINNERS have a promiſe of the ſpirit of wiſdom, or of ſpiritual wiſdom, with which eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life is connected, if they hearken to God's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, and diligently ſeek it. "Turn you at my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof: behold, I will pour out my ſpirit unto you I will make known my words unto you."<note n="*" place="bottom">Prov. 1. 23.</note> "Hear inſtruction and be wiſe, and refuſe it not. Bleſſed is the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the poſts of my doors."<note n="†" place="bottom">Chap. VII 33. 34.</note> That what is here promiſed, is ſpiritual wiſdom and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſuch as ſhall be ſaving, is not, I ſuppoſe, denied by any. But it will perhaps be ſaid, that none but a regenerate man, can be ſuppoſed to "turn at God's, or wiſdom's, reproof," or to "wait at the poſts of her doors," in the ſenſe here intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and conſequently, that none but ſuch can be entitled to the promiſe, or bleſſing. But this were an arbitrary aſſertion; one, for which there is not the leaſt colour or foundation. For the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons here addreſſed, are ſpoken to under the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of "ſimple ones," "ſcorners," and "fools"; who certainly need wiſdom the moſt of any. And the promiſe is apparently made for the encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of ſuch, to turn at her reproof, and to watch daily at her gates; that they might find her, and thereby "find life." This was therefore to be done by them, antecedently to their obtaining
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:008926_0056_10308A4677378F20"/>
ſpiritual wiſdom; not in the actual exerciſe of it, as the regenerate, who are already wiſe unto ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, are to ſeek for more wiſdom. And un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs theſe paſſages are ſo underſtood, the promiſe will really amount to this, and no more than this; <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> "If ye who are now fools, and cannot be truly wiſe, but by turning at my reproof, ſhall firſt attain this wiſdom ſome other way, and then turn in the exerciſe thereof, being actually poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of wiſdom; <hi>then</hi> ſhall you find it, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of ſuch a turning, waiting and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: behold, <hi>then</hi> will I pour out my ſpirit unto you; <hi>then</hi> will I make known my words unto you." This muſt really be the whole amount of this promiſe, unleſs it is ſuppoſed to be made to the turning, waiting and watching of an unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate man: But I may venture to appeal to any wiſe man, whether ſuch a promiſe would be agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the <hi>wiſdom of God!</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">(9.) IN Ezekiel [chap. xxxvi.] God declares his purpoſe to do many things for the people of Iſrael; and, amongſt the reſt, to give them a "new heart" and a "new ſpirit".<note n="†" place="bottom">Ver. 26.</note> But he adds af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, "I will yet for this be enquired of by the houſe of Iſrael, to do it for them<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ver. 37.</note>": which unqueſtionably relates in part, to the new heart and new ſpirit, ſpoken of before. Upon which we may briefly remark, That eternal life, or ſalvation, is connected in ſcripture with the hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:008926_0057_10308A4823272D10"/>
a new heart: That ſuch an heart is the gift of God: That he gives ſuch an heart, not prior to, but in conſequence of, being inquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of, or ſought to, for it: And conſequently, That the inquiring of God, here intended, is the act, not of the regenerate, but the unregenerate; who are awakened to deſire, and ſeek after it. So that althô this is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the <hi>form</hi> of a conditional promiſe; yet it amounts to one: at leaſt it implies, that the obtaining a new heart, has <hi>ſome</hi> connection with inquiring after it; and that, in a manner in which an unregenerate man may be ſuppoſed to do. For it were highly abſurd to ſuppoſe, that a man muſt have a new heart, in order to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring of, or ſeeking God, in ſuch a manner as to obtain ſuch an heart of him!</p>
            <p n="10">(10.) OUR Saviour pronounces a bleſſing on thoſe that "hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſs;" adding, that "they ſhall be filled."<note n="*" place="bottom">Matt. V. 6.</note> By which metaphors of hungring and thirſting after righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, our Lord unqueſtionably deſigned to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the ſtrong and ardent deſires of ſinful crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to attain the righteouſneſs, and ſo the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, revealed in the goſpel; deſires ariſing from a ſenſe of their miſery without it; ſuch deſires as put them upon uſing their endeavours after it: Even as men who are ready to periſh with hunger and thirſt in a literal ſenſe, will of courſe endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:008926_0058_10308A4C535226D8"/>
to obtain meat and drink. All ſuch perſons our Lord pronounces bleſſed: "for," ſays he, "they ſhall be filled." Which promiſe, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, can intend nothing leſs, than that they ſhall actually attain to that righteouſneſs and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, which they deſire, and ſtrive after. Now, there is not the leaſt ground to doubt, but that convinced, awakened ſinners, may and do often, thus hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſs. And if any ſhould ſay, that the regenerate only, or ſuch as have already attained unto righteouſneſs, can be ſuppoſed to do ſo; this were altogether as contrary to reaſon and good ſenſe, as to ſay, that a man muſt eat a <hi>good meal,</hi> in order to be hungry in a literal ſenſe; and that he muſt drink an <hi>hearty draught,</hi> in order to be a-thirſt—This benediction and promiſe, more eſpecially reſpect unregenerate, heavy-laden ſinners: as do alſo ſuch gracious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitations and promiſes as theſe—"Ho, every one that thirſteth, come ye to the waters—Wherefore do ye ſpend your money for that which is not bread? and your labour for that which ſatisfieth not? hearken diligently unto me, and eat ye that which is good, and let your ſoul delight itſelf in fatneſs."<note n="§" place="bottom">Iſa.

"I am the bread of life; he that cometh unto me ſhall <hi>never hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;</hi>—ſhall <hi>never thirſt.</hi>" Can any man read this, and yet ſuppoſe, that hungring and thirſting after righteouſneſs, in the ſenſe of our ſaviour, to which the promiſe is made, is always ſubſequent, never prior, to coming to him, or to regeneration? If he can, however good his heart may be, no one has much reaſon to envy him his head.</p>
            <p n="11">(11.) TO this promiſe of our Lord, another may be ſubjoined, which is alſo found in his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon on the mount. "Aſk, and it ſhall be given you; ſeek, and ye ſhall find; knock, and it ſhall be opened unto you. For every one that aſketh, receiveth, &amp;c. What man is there of you, whom if his ſon aſk bread, will he give him a ſtone?—If ye then being evil, know how to give good

gifts unto your children, how much more ſhall your Father which is in heaven, give good things to them that aſk him"<note n="*" place="bottom">Matt. VII. 7—11.</note>? Here you will obſerve, that the "good things" promiſed, are ſpiritual bleſſings; ſuch as have eternal life connected with them; as is manifeſt from a parallel place in another evangeliſt, where theſe good things are explained to mean, the Holy Spirit—"How much more ſhall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that aſk him?" You will farther obſerve, that the obtaining theſe ſpiritual bleſſings is expreſly connected with, and promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to, aſking, ſeeking, knocking. But then it will perhaps be ſaid, that this muſt be ſuppoſed to mean, the aſking, &amp;c. of the regenerate; and that it cannot be intended of the deſires, prayers and endeavours of the unregenerate. But does there appear any good reaſon for limiting the promiſe in this manner? It is humbly conceived, there is none: But that it ought to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood conformably to what our Lord had ſaid before—that they who hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſs, ſhall be filled. The words were ſpoken by him to the promiſcuous multitude of his profeſſed followers: and there is no reaſon to ſuppoſe, that all theſe were then in a regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſtate. That any of them were ſo, cannot be inferred merely from God's being ſpoken of in this paſſage, under the character, or title, of their "Father" in heaven. For he is ſaid to be the
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:008926_0061_10308A572D85FDE0"/>
"God and Father of ALL"; not only of the rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, tho' they are in a peculiar ſenſe his child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, his ſons and daughters. This common Father has many evil and diſobedient, as well as good and obedient children. And the perſons here ſpoken to, are ſpoken to as <hi>evil.</hi> "If ye then, being <hi>evil",</hi> &amp;c. From whence it might be at leaſt as fairly argued, that they were not in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate ſtate, as it could, that they were, from God's being ſtiled their Father. For where do you find thoſe that are born of God, his ſons by adoption, and ſpiritual renovation, called <hi>evil</hi> in ſcripture? However, no great ſtreſs ought to be laid upon this: for even ſuch perſons may doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs be ſtiled <hi>evil</hi> in a comparative ſenſe; as our Lord ſays, "There is none <hi>good</hi> but One, that is God." But there is ſtill leſs reaſon to conclude theſe perſons were born of God, from his being ſpoken of as their Father: For, as before obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, he is the Father of ALL: And all in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon are directed to pray to him under this very character—"Our Father which art in heaven"—Had not this cavil been produced as a ſerious ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, and much inſiſted on by ſome, it would have been a ſhame to ſay ſo much about it: which muſt be my apology—I would farther obſerve here, that theſe promiſes of our Saviour to ſuch as aſk, ſeek and knock, ſeem to be more eſpecially deſigned and calculated for the encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of the unregenerate to ſeek God, and ſpiritual bleſſings. For the "good things" pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed,
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:008926_0062_10308A58F238AC98"/>
as explained by St. Luke, are ſuch as are comprehended in the "gift of the holy ſpirit:" The promiſe of which, in conſequence of aſking, ſeeking and knocking, is ſo far from ſuppoſing that the perſons who do ſo, are already regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, or that the ſpirit is given to them prior to their aſking; that it rather implies the direct con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; <abbr>viz.</abbr> that they had not the ſpirit, in the ſenſe here intended by our Saviour. For if they are ſuppoſed, at the time of their aſking, to have the ſpirit of God dwelling in them, to "abide with them for ever," as all the ſons of God by regeneration and adoption have, what becomes of the promiſe? What are they to have in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of aſking, &amp;c? Is it only the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the ſpirit, or larger meaſures of it?—But theſe are, I think, never called, <hi>giving the ſpirit,</hi> in the language of ſcripture: which means the <hi>original</hi> beſtowment of it [or him] on ſuch as were deſtitute of it; in conſequence of which, they are ſaid to be born of the ſpirit, or of God. As a man is but <hi>once</hi> born of God, or of the Spirit, ſo the Spirit is, properly ſpeaking, never <hi>given more</hi> than <hi>once:</hi> For being once given, he is to "be in, and to abide with believers for ever." So that to ſay, as ſome have done, that they who have already the ſpirit of God, have indeed here a promiſe of his continuance, or of larger meaſures thereof; but that thoſe who aſk, being deſtitute of the ſpirit, have no promiſe of him made to them, is a moſt arbitrary, irrational

conſtruction of this promiſe: A promiſe, which our bleſſed and merciful Redeemer particularly deſigned for the encouragement of thoſe to aſk, who moſt need the Spirit;—"hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy-laden" ſinners; that ſo, applying themſelves to God in their extremity, "they may be made free from the law of ſin and death, by the law of the Spirit of life in Chriſt Jeſus; and for the future walk, not after the fleſh, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Spirit."<note n="*" place="bottom">Rom.

            </p>
            <p>IT will greatly confirm what has been ſaid upon this point, if we conſider,</p>
            <p n="12">(12.) THAT the apoſtle Peter ſpeaks of God, as having "given unto us all things pertaining unto life and godlineſs," by calling us to the knowledge of the goſpel; and particularly, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain "great and precious promiſes, that by theſe, "ſays he, "you might be partakers of the divine nature, having eſcaped the corruption that is in the world thro' luſt."<note n="‡" place="bottom">2 Pet. 1. 3, 4.</note> Where you will obſerve, That <hi>all</hi> things pertaining to "godlineſs," are given in and by the goſpel: That there are in it more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, "great and precious promiſes:" That the end of theſe promiſes, is, our being made "partakers of the divine nature"; by which is doubtleſs meant, the Spirit of God, with a new heart: That thoſe who are
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:008926_0064_10308A5D81483770"/>
made partakers of this divine nature, are not unconvinced, hardened ſinners, going on with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out check or reſtraint in their evil courſes; but ſuch as are in ſome degree reformed; or ſuch as "have eſcaped the [groſs] corruptions that are in the world thro' luſt:" By whom we may fairly underſtand, ſuch as ſtrive to enter in at the ſtrait gate. And laſtly, That this divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or new heart, is given in the way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, or in fulfilment of the promiſes—So that this exactly coincides with what our Lord ſays in the paſſages conſidered above, reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe that hunger and thirſt after righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; that aſk, &amp;c. Nor is it unlikely, that the apoſtle Peter had theſe, and ſuch-like promiſes of our Saviour, particularly in his mind, when he ſpeaks of the great and precious promiſes given to us, <hi>that by theſe we might be partakers of the divine nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="13">(13.) IT is very generally allowed (though denied by ſome men of a diſordered mind, hardly fit to be reaſoned with,) that all thoſe in general, who hear the goſpel, are invited and required, not only to believe it, but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of their ſins, and to become the <hi>true diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt. It is moreover univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally acknowledged, that the goſpel promiſes eternal life to all who do thus, or to all <hi>real chriſtians:</hi> And it is repreſented as a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful manifeſtation of the goodneſs of God
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:008926_0065_10308A62AB5264A0"/>
to men, that he ſhould, in this way, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe ſalvation to them. Now, if theſe concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and repreſentations are juſt, as they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionably are; it may from hence be clearly inferred, that there is grace accompanying the diſpenſation of the goſpel, ſufficient to render it effectual to the ſalvation of thoſe who hear it, provided they are really deſirous of, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour after it: Or, in other words, that God will certainly afford to ſuch perſons, all need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful influences of his Spirit to this end; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, for their renovation and ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: For unleſs there is ſuch grace attending this diſpenſation, or actually attainable by all in general who hear the goſpel, and deſire the ſalvation therein revealed, where is the goodneſs of God to them in this diſpenſation? What becomes of theſe "good tidings of great joy to all people?" or how can this revelation, with any propriety, be called good tidings to all? Is there any real kindneſs, mercy or good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in offering ſalvation to guilty creatures, and inviting them to accept it, on ſuch terms as are to them impracticable, tho' they deſire it, and ſtrive to this end?—impracticable, I mean, with all the helps and advantages that God af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords, or will afford to them, tho' they ſeek them in the beſt manner their circumſtances will admit of? I muſt confeſs, I cannot ſee any goodneſs herein. There ſeems to be no real difference between, not offering them ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:008926_0066_10308A6458901600"/>
to all, and offering it on ſuch terms as theſe; unleſs it be in this reſpect, <abbr>viz.</abbr> That, upon the former ſuppoſition, ſinners would have no juſt cauſe for complaint; They could only ſay, that God had dealt in a way of ſtrict juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice with them; not ſhewing, nor even ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſhew, any mercy to them. Whereas, on the latter ſuppoſition, that the terms pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed are really impracticable, by any who deſire, and endeavour to obtain ſalvation, they would ſeem to have ſome ground to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, that they were inſulted in their miſery, under the fallacious pretext of "rich good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, forbearance and long-ſuffering".—God might, indeed, have juſtly left guilty mankind to periſh in their ſins, without providing a Redeemer for them, or propoſing any terms of reconciliation with them. But if he is pleaſed as it were to enter into a treaty with them; to make overtures of peace to them; and ſends ambaſſadors to beſeech them in his name to be reconciled to him; not only goodneſs, but even natural juſtice, ſeems <hi>then</hi> to require, that the terms propoſed ſhould be ſuch, as creatures in their ſituation, all things conſidered, may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with, and ſo receive the benefit offered, provided they really deſire it. For otherwiſe, as was intimated before, ſuch propoſals ſeem a real inſult on the miſerable, under the pretext of wonderful goodneſs and grace. We may from hence therefore clearly infer, that God
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:008926_0067_10308A660A008818"/>
will give his holy Spirit to thoſe who, ſenſible of their need thereof, have recourſe to him; and really ſtrive to obtain life;—unleſs you will ſuppoſe, that we may ſee the kingdom of God, or finally enter in at the ſtrait gate, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being born of the Spirit.</p>
            <p n="14">(14.) IT is very generally allowed, that thoſe who, having had the goſpel preached to them, do not actually comply with the method of ſalvation revealed therein, and ſo finally obtain eternal life, will have an aggravated condemnation at the laſt day. This is agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the repreſentations of ſcripture in many places. But what reaſon? what juſtice, would there be in this, if theſe ſinful and unhappy men were never really put into a capacity for obtaining this ſalvation? or never had it made poſſible to them, tho' they deſired and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to become partakers of it? Are men, even tho' guilty, and deſerving of wrath, to be firſt mocked with the offers of ſalvation by Jeſus Chriſt, upon terms really impracticable to them, tho' they deſire to comply with them; and afterwards to receive a condemnation pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly aggravated, on account of their non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliance with theſe offers!—"Far be it from God that he ſhould do wickedly; and from the Almighty, that he ſhould pervert judgment"! Are not his ways equal!—But this were contrary to our cleareſt ideas of
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:008926_0068_10308A6C4FDC7C60"/>
equity, of juſt and fair dealing: It were not only void of all goodneſs; but ſo cruel and tyrannical, that it would be highly blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous to attribute ſuch a conduct to God; who is not only infinitely removed from all unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, but "good unto all, and his tender mercies over all his works." And yet ſuch a conduct muſt be aſcribed to him, unleſs we ſuppoſe, that the ſalvation revealed is actually attainable, (and conſequently the gift of the holy Spirit) by all thoſe who deſire, and uſe their endeavours to this end—I ſpeak upon the ſuppoſition mentioned above, in which chriſtians are very generally agreed; <abbr>viz.</abbr> that all thoſe who do not actually comply with this method of ſalvation, ſo as at laſt to obtain eternal life, are, for ſuch non-compliance, to receive a very aggravated condemnation. And thoſe who pretend to reconcile ſuch a method of conduct with juſtice, ſeem properly to fall under the cenſure of "ſpeaking wickedly for God."</p>
            <p>I HUMBLY conceive, that there is not one of the above arguments, but what is ſtrictly concluſive, even when taken ſeparately. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, as was intimated before, the abſolute deciſion of this queſtion is not reſted upon any one of them, excluſively of the reſt; but upon the joint force and reſult of all. And being thus conſidered, there appears to me, not only
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:008926_0069_10308A6E24A46EA0"/>
ſatisfactory and concluſive evidence in favour of the doctrine propoſed to be proved: but a full blaze of it, ſo as to take away even the poſſibility of doubt, from any perſon of a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable comprehenſion of mind, who ſeriouſly attends to it;—unleſs he is under the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of ſome very unhappy, tho' I do not ſay, criminal prejudices—But you are to judge for your ſelves.</p>
            <p>IF it ſhould be ſaid, that ſome difficulty ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes from the latter part of the ſame verſe, of which my text is a part;—"For many, I ſay unto you, ſhall <hi>ſeek to enter in, and ſhall not be able":</hi> a clear and full ſolution of this, is contained in the verſes following. From whence it is manifeſt, that our Lord does not mean, that they "ſhall not be able", tho' they ſtrive during the time of their viſitation; but after it is elapſed. For he proceeds thus: "When once the maſter of the houſe is <hi>riſen up,</hi> and hath <hi>ſhut to the door,</hi> and ye begin to ſtand without, and to knock at the door, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Lord, Lord, open to us; and he ſhall anſwer and ſay unto you, I know you not whence you are: Then ſhall ye begin to ſay, We have eaten and drunk in thy preſence," &amp;c. Here you ſee, when it is that many ſhall ſeek to enter in, and ſhall not be able; <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> when the maſter of the houſe is riſen up, and hath <hi>ſhut to the door:</hi> Which, by the way, is
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:008926_0070_10308A70217A09B0"/>
ſo far from implying, that they ſhall not be able to enter in, tho' they ſtrive during the day of their viſitation, that it implies the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect contrary, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> that the door is not then <hi>ſhut,</hi> but <hi>open;</hi> and that they are <hi>able,</hi> all things being conſidered, to enter in thereat, if they really ſtrive to this end. So that theſe words are plainly parallel with thoſe in Proverbs—"Becauſe I have called, and ye refuſed;—I alſo will laugh at your calamity—when your fear cometh as deſolation, and your deſtruction cometh as a whirlwind; when diſtreſs and anguiſh cometh upon you. THEN ſhall they call upon me, but I will not anſwer; they ſhall ſeek me early, but they ſhall not find me." In which words it is alſo clearly implied, that if ſinners ſtrive, call on God, and ſeek him dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, before that time cometh, he will ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anſwer, and be found of them.</p>
            <p>IF it ſhould be farther ſaid, that an unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate man cannot be ſuppoſed to ſtrive, ſeek, or do any thing elſe, in a truly holy manner, ſo as to be pleaſing to God; and conſequently, that God cannot be ſuppoſed to have connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the attaining of eternal life with their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours: It is anſwered, That what God has connected eternal life with, can be known only from his own word. To <hi>that</hi> we have been appealing; and have found, that he has therein actually connected ſalvation with the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:008926_0071_10308A71D43E2100"/>
of ſinners. And there is ſome real dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the temper and actions of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened ſinners;—awakened by God's own word and ſpirit; hungring and thirſting after righteouſneſs, and ſtriving to enter in at the ſtrait gate; and the temper and actions of thoſe, who are proceeding headlong in their criminal courſes. Tho' the actions of the former are no ways me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious, yet they are certainly, to ſay the leaſt, not ſo diſpleaſing to God, as thoſe of the latter. Yea; ſince God has commanded the unregenerate, while and as ſuch, to ſtrive, ſeek, &amp;c. it muſt be ſuppoſed, that he requires them to ſtrive in the exerciſe of ſuch faculties as they have, not of ſuch as they have not. Their ſtriving in the exerciſe of theſe powers, may therefore properly be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led obedience to him, or ſaid to partake of the nature thereof. And if there be in it <hi>any thing</hi> of the nature of obedience, it has alſo <hi>ſomething</hi> of the nature of good; and ſo cannot be <hi>wholly</hi> unpleaſing to God. It muſt therefore render thoſe who perform it, more ſuitable objects of his favour and mercy than thoſe are, who do not ſtrive; but commit iniquity with greadineſs. And if ſuch ſinners are in the leaſt degree more ſuitable objects of mercy, than the thoughtleſs and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, this affords an intelligible reaſon why God, willing to ſhew his mercy, ſhould connect eternal life with the <hi>ſtriving</hi> of the former; at leaſt in preference to the <hi>crimes</hi> of the latter:—Tho' it is by no means under the notion of any
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:008926_0072_10308A74AA271B70"/>
real merit, or good deſert in thoſe who ſtrive, that God has promiſed his holy Spirit, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, eternal life to them. Beſides: In the way of objecting above-mentioned, it might be thought irrational to ſuppoſe, that God had connected eternal ſalvation with any thing in, or done by, the regenerate themſelves. For is there not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection and ſin attending even them, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they do? And yet it is acknowledged, that God has connected eternal life with their ſaith, love, &amp;c. tho' it is for Chriſt's ſake, that theſe promiſes are made to them; not on account of any merit in themſelves. To ſum up all in a word: Thoſe who object in this manner, ſeem to forget, that in the goſpel God is profeſſedly treating with us <hi>as</hi> degenerate, ſinful creatures, who can do noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that is perfectly holy, and who deſerve wrath;—that he is treating with us about our eternal happineſs, upon quite another footing than that of law or juſtice, for the manifeſtation of his goodneſs and grace;—upon the footing of a new covenant eſtabliſhed in a Mediator, who died for all, the juſt for the unjuſt; in whom, all the promiſes of God to ſinners are made, and in whom they are all "yea and amen." Had theſe things been duly conſidered, ſurely we ſhould not have had this objection ſo much inſiſted on as it has been, That no actions of the unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate are truly good and holy; and therefore, that no promiſes of good can be ſuppoſed annexed to their endeavours; to any thing that they
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:008926_0073_10308A79D84F0D90"/>
can do. Which objection is intirely grounded on a falſe hypotheſis; a feeble ſupport, which being taken away, the objection falls of courſe; and appears, as it really is, weak and unſolid, tho' inſiſted on by ſome worthy men.</p>
            <p>IF it ſhould be farther objected, that this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of a certain connexion between ſtriving, and obtaining ſalvation, has a tendency to give eaſe to the minds of ſinners; and to make them reſt ſatisfied with ſomething ſhort of regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, under a notion that they are already in a ſafe eſtate, in reſpect of their endeavours; and ſo may be a means of deſtroying, inſtead of ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their ſouls: It is anſwered, That if it mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters hope to awakened ſinners, and no more than the goſpel affords; ſo much the better: and, that it really affords them no more, has been ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhown. Our merciful Redeemer deſigned that ſuch perſons ſhould have comfort and hope; he gives it to them himſelf; in which reſpect they have a right to it: And what the Lord <hi>giveth,</hi> his ſervants ſhould not <hi>take away.</hi>—As to the tendency of this doctrine to lull ſinners into a ſtate of ſecurity, or to make them ceaſe ſtriving; this is quite remote from good ſenſe. What! does telling them, that they muſt ſtrive with perſeverance; that this is abſolutely neceſſary; and that if they continue to ſtrive, it ſhall not be in vain; does this tend to make them remiſs, and think themſelves ſafe without ſtriving! How ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:008926_0074_10308A7BD4BDA1A0"/>
is this! But this objection may be retorted with unanſwerable force, againſt the contrary doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine. For if ſinners are told, that there is no ſort of connexion between any of their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, and obtaining eternal life; but that they may periſh after all; this has a direct and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt tendency to diſhearten them; and make them give over thoſe endeavours, which, they ſuppoſe, may be thus fruitleſs. For hope is one of the moſt powerful ſprings of action; and endeavours are incompatible with deſpair.—In ſhort: the doctrine of this diſcourſe, which affords ſo much conſolation to heavy-laden ſinners, is no other than the good tidings of great joy, which were to be unto all people; the very doctrine of Him who ſaid—<q>The Spirit of the Lord God is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, becauſe the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath ſent me to bind up the broken-hearted, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the priſon to them that are bound: To pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim the acceptable year of the Lord—to comfort all that mourn: To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion; to give unto them beauty for aſhes, the oil of joy for mourning, the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of praiſe for the ſpirit of heavineſs: that they might be called trees of righteouſneſs, the planting of the Lord, that he might be glorified.<note n="*" place="bottom">Iſai. LXI. 1, 2, 3.</note>

THIS ſubject ſuggeſts numerous, and very important reflexions; but there is time only for the few which follow.</p>
            <p>1ſt. WE ſee from hence the wonderful good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and mercy of God; inaſmuch as he has given us the ſtrongeſt aſſurances of pardon and eternal life, on ſuch terms as, by his offered grace, we may all comply with, if we really deſire to do it: Which ought to be acknowledged with the warmeſt gratitude, to the glory of his name. And how juſtly is the revelation which diſcovers this grace, and unfolds the myſteries of it; which diſpels our anxious fears, and raiſes guilty worms to the hopes of glory, honor and immortality: How juſtly is this called, "good tidings of great joy!"—What manner of love hath the Father beſtowed upon us!</p>
            <p>2dly. IT appears, that tho' the ſalvation of thoſe that are ſaved, is intirely of grace; yet the deſtruction of all who periſh under the diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the goſpel, will be entirely of themſelves; as being owing, not ſo properly to this, that they were ſinful creatures, (for that is common to them with thoſe that are ſaved) as to their neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect and contempt of that method of ſalvation from ſin, which was revealed to them. Nor will one of theſe miſerable men be able to plead in the judgment of the great day—"Lord, I care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully attended to thy goſpel, and heartily ſtrove,
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:008926_0076_10308A8293E05930"/>
according to thy command, to enter in at the ſtrait gate: Do not therefore, I beſeech thee by the bowels of thy mercy, now ſhut it againſt me!—Lord, Lord, open unto me; for I believed thy words; and earneſtly endeavoured to walk in that path of life, which was marked out by thee."—Many, we know, will be able to plead, "We have eaten and drunk in thy preſence; and thou haſt taught in our ſtreets." But this is a very different thing; a plea of no real force, as the other would evidently be. And if none will be able to make the former, as they certainly will not; what can they ſay againſt the righteouſneſs of ſuch a ſentence as this?—"Depart from me, ye curſed, into everlaſting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels."</p>
            <p>3dly. LET all therefore be exhorted to ſtrive, now they are "able" to enter in at the ſtrait gate; leſt they ſhould thus ſeek to enter in here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, and "not be able." Is it not worth while, my brethren, to ſtrive, that you may eſcape the wrath to come? that you may receive a crown of righteouſneſs and glory from the Lord's hand; and be admitted to "ſit down with Abraham, Iſaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God?" Is it not, that you may be admitted to ſit with Chriſt on his throne, "even as he alſo overcame, and is ſet down with his Father on his throne!" What great pains do you take to avoid ſome inconſiderable evil, and
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:008926_0077_10308A8564BA7358"/>
to obtain ſome inconſiderable good, even when the ſucceſs of your endeavours is uncertain? And will you not endeavour to avoid ſo great an evil as "everlaſting deſtruction?" and to obtain ſo ineſtimable a prize as is now ſet before you;—"the prize of our high calling of God in Chriſt Jeſus?"—eſpecially when you are aſſured by the word and promiſe of God, that he will render your endeavours effectual to theſe important ends? Will you not ſtrive, when He invites? when He commands, who hath both "the key of David," of the kingdom of heaven; and the "keys of hell and of death!"—who openeth and no man ſhutteth; and ſhutteth, and no man openeth! Do not, I beſeech you, delay: For human life is precarious; and altho' your own ſhould be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed, yet if you go on to provoke God by your ſins, he may perhaps give you over to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate mind; ſo that you will only live to fill up the meaſure of your ſins. "To day then, if you will hear his voice!"—</p>
            <p>4thly. LET me exhort all thoſe, who may imagine that they ſtrive to enter in at the ſtrait gate; and ſo, that they are in the way that lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unto life, to examine themſelves ſeriouſly as to this point. There are many perſons who think of this matter, and do ſomething with a view to their future happineſs; who cannot yet be ſaid to ſtrive in the ſenſe of our Saviour. Have you ever been awakened to a ſenſe of your
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:008926_0078_10308A872D9E7780"/>
ſins? Are your deſires to obtain the "great ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion," ſtrong in ſome proportion to its impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance? ſtronger than, to obtain any worldly good? Do you diligently inquire after the way of life, which God has revealed? Do you make it your practice to pray to him? Do you endeavour to mortify your luſts? Do you ſtrive to keep his known commandments; ſtill acknowledging that you are unprofitable ſervants; and ſaying with the publican, "God be merciful to me a a ſinner?" If you do not ſtrive, after ſome ſuch manner as this, you cannot be thought to ſtrive in the way which Chriſt commands: And you know the conſequence.—But if you do thus, I may ſafely tell you at leaſt, that you are not far from the kingdom of God; that you are in the way of his bleſſing; and that "in due time you ſhall reap, if you faint not."</p>
            <p>5thly. IT appears, I think, that the main point which I have endeavoured to eſtabliſh in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, is not only a certain truth, but a very important one. It is ſo, particularly in two reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects. It is a clear and full vindication, both of the juſtice and goodneſs of God, in his dealings with men: As it ſhews, that he has actually put thoſe who live under the goſpel, into a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of obtaining ſalvation, if they deſire it; and conſequently, that thoſe who periſh, will be, in a ſtrictly proper ſenſe, their own deſtroyers. Whereas, if this doctrine is denied, it will not be
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:008926_0079_10308A8A008018F8"/>
ſo eaſy to make theſe things appear. Such a denial will bear hard on the veracity and ſincerity of God in his word, wherein he declareth his great love and compaſſion to ſinful men: And it will be impoſſible on this ſuppoſition, (that we may ſtrive, and yet not obtain) to ſhew the juſtice of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing all ſuch as fall ſhort of this ſalvation, in a ſignal, exemplary manner, as deſpiſers of God's grace. But all this will be clear and manifeſt, if eternal life is really connected with ſtriving—This is an important doctrine in another reſpect: Sinners ought to have all the encouragement to ſtrive, which can be given them according to the word of God. We know, alas! how backward men generally are to take pains in religion; how difficultly they are perſwaded to forſake their wicked practices; and to <hi>labour</hi> here, that they may finally enter into <hi>reſt.</hi> All poſſible encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, therefore, ought to be given them, in order to overcome this reluctance. And it is plain, that there is far greater encouragement, on the ſuppoſition that there is a certain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion between their ſtriving and obtaining, than on the contrary, that all their endeavours, however diligent, uninterrupted, and of long continuance, may perhaps be in vain. Be the ſalvation of their ſouls of ever ſo much impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; yet if they ſuppoſe that this may be the caſe, it muſt needs prove a great diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to them. Such doubt, or uncertainty,
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:008926_0080_10308A8E086A3C60"/>
has a direct tendency to diſhearten them; to damp their endeavours: Tho' it is allowed, that we ought in reaſon to ſtrive, even upon the ſuppoſition of ſuch uncertainty.</p>
            <p>WE ſee then, my brethren, how much thoſe who deny, there is any ſort of connexion between the moſt earneſt endeavours of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and their obtaining eternal life, diſhonor God, by denying his grace in one material point; we ſee how their doctrine tends to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage thoſe, who are really "ſeeking the way to Zion;" how, to "break the bruiſed reed, and quench the ſmoaking flax"; and, in fine, how it tends rather to excuſe thoſe who fall ſhort of ſalvation, than to juſtify the ways of God to men. All this is manifeſt: Tho', by the way, I am far from charging any ill intention on thoſe who deny ſuch a connexion as has been ſpoken of. But their doctrine is certainly bad, however good their deſigns be; of which God is the only proper judge—But ſome there are, who go much further: They not only deny any certain connexion; but aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert that a perſon, going on in his ſins without remorſe, is altogether as <hi>likely</hi> to obtain ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at laſt, as one who is convinced of his ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſtate, and uſes his utmoſt endeavours to obtain eternal life! Yea, there are, who go beyond this; aſſerting that all an unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate man does, or can do, is ſo far from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any real tendency to promote his ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:008926_0081_10308A90DFF745F8"/>
that it is but rebellion againſt God, and ſo ſets him at a ſtill greater diſtance from Him! To ſuch lengths as theſe, ſome men have gone, in purſuance of certain falſe principles which they have unhappily imbibed, as principles of chriſtianity: Yea, and have repreſented the belief of theſe impious notions, as eſſential ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of faith; as if thoſe who denied them, were both ſtrangers and enemies to the grace of God! Now, if only the denial of any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain connexion between the endeavours of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and their obtaining eternal life, is in ſome meaſure to diſhonor God; to throw need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs diſcouragements in the way of thoſe who ſtrive to obtain ſalvation, and to prevent others from ſtriving; what ſhall we ſay of this other doctrine, which ſuppoſes all the endeavours of the unregenerate, rather to aggravate their guilt, and ſo, their damnation, than to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote their future well-being! What is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of ſuch doctrine as this, but that ſinners ſhould keep themſelves as ſecure and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned as poſſible, inſtead of ſtriving to enter in at the ſtrait gate? the former being, of the two, more likely to iſſue in their ſalvation, than the latter. Whatever apology may be made for thoſe, who only deny a connexion; it is extremely difficult to make any tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable one, for theſe other perſons mentioned, unleſs it be this, that they are beſide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and know not what they ſay. For theſe notions are ſo oppoſite to reaſon, and the
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:008926_0082_10308A92C1DBA5A0"/>
whole tenor of ſcripture; they tend ſo directly to make, or to keep men, wicked; that if any one, in his ſenſes, <hi>could</hi> be ſuppoſed to advance them, we could hardly put any other conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon his doing ſo, than that he deſigned to repreſent the ever good and glorious God in the moſt odious light poſſible; to bring a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach upon the chriſtian religion; to diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage ſinners from endeavouring to obtain the ſalvation revealed therein; and even to fill the world with all manner of impiety and vice. Which God forbid any man ſhould really de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign! And rather than believe, any are ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned, we ought charitably to hope that thoſe who teach ſuch doctrines, are <hi>only out of their wits</hi>—</p>
            <p>
               <q>How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publiſheth peace, that bringeth good tidings of good, that publiſheth ſalvation!</q>—But what if one of thoſe, who ſhould be the bearers of theſe tidings, ſhould bring only ſuch as theſe?—<q>Men and brethren! You are all in a ſtate of ſin and death; juſtly liable to the damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of hell. But God, who is rich in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, hath provided a way of ſalvation for ſinners: He hath ſent his Son into the world, not to condemn the world, but that the world thro' him might be ſaved. O un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable goodneſs! Grace! Grace! Glory to God in the higheſt, on earth peace, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:008926_0083_10308A946C7FCCC8"/>
will towards men;—ſinful, guilty, miſerable men!—However, do not miſtake me, my friends, as if I ſuppoſed you were all, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed any of you, really put into a capacity for obtaining ſalvation by Chriſt, altho' you ſhould deſire it, and uſe your utmoſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to that end. No! in order to your eſcaping eternal damnation, and entering in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the kingdom of heaven, it is neceſſary that you ſhould become true chriſtians, or new creatures. But this is as much out of your power, as to create new worlds, or to annihilate the old: Neither may you depend on the grace of God to renew and ſanctify you, tho' you ſhould cry day and night unto him, and ſtrive to put yourſelves in the way of his bleſſing. All this may prove in vain. Yea, thoſe perſons who are going on in their ſins without any remorſe, are at leaſt as likely (if not more ſo) to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſubjects of the ſpecial, ſaving grace of God, as you will be with all your ſtrivings, while in an unregenerate ſtate. You need ſpiritual wiſdom; and are indeed directed to pray for it: but unleſs this wiſdom is firſt given to you, you cannot pray for it ſo as to obtain it. You need a new heart; but you muſt firſt have ſuch an heart, before you can "inquire" of God aright, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow it on you. You need the pardon of ſin, for which you are alſo to pray; but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs you are firſt in a regenerate, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:008926_0084_10308A9AA5A50A08"/>
fore in a pardoned ſtate, God may not hear your prayers, and pardon your ſins. You need a principle of ſpiritual life; for which you are to apply yourſelves to God in Chriſt; but then you are to remember, that you are to carry this ſame principle with you, in going to God for it; or to pray in the actual exerciſe of it, when you pray for it: Otherwiſe you cannot expect that God will give it to you—You ſee plainly then, that all your prayers and endeavours, while unregenerate, may be to no purpoſe—Yea, farther: To deal plainly and ſincerely with you, I muſt tell you, that all ſuch prayers and ſtrivings, inſtead of having the leaſt tendency to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote your ſalvation, are but rebellion againſt God; and ſo may, not improbably, be a means of increaſing your damnation.—Such duties are more to be feared than your <hi>other ſins</hi>—It is, however, poſſible that God may ſave ſome of you, by a ſovereign, irreſiſtable act of his grace, inſtantaneouſly changing your hearts; whether you do, or do not ſeek him.—Theſe are the good ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of great joy, which I bring you in the name of my divine MASTER. And now, O what marvellous love is manifeſted to a guilty world, in the redemption there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of by Jeſus Chriſt! How rich, how abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant is this goodneſs! Take heed therefore, that you do not receive the grace of God in vain. For as to thoſe of you, (perhaps
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:008926_0085_10308A9C68B62268"/>
the far greater number) who ſhall not final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be made partakers of this great ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; how juſtly will you be thought wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of an aggravated condemnation, as deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſers of it? even tho' you have deſired it, and endeavoured to obtain it; <hi>ſtriving to enter in at the ſtrait gate!</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Now, would this be <hi>goſpel-preaching?</hi> Would a ſermon in this ſtrain, be really "good ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of great joy to all people"? Are wande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring prodigals, periſhing in a ſtrange land, to be brought home to their Father's houſe? is the body of Chriſt to be edified? are Jews, Mahometans and Pagans, to be taught to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive highly of the wiſdom, goodneſs and grace of the chriſtian diſpenſation, by ſuch repreſentations as this? Are the "feet" of thoſe who bring ſuch tidings, really "ſhod with the preparation of the goſpel; of peace"; or are they "beautiful on the mountains"? Notwithſtanding the cry of, "Grace! Grace!" does not this doctrine favour much more of <hi>Ebal,</hi> the mount of curſing, than of <hi>Gerizzim,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Deut. Chap. XXVII. 12, 13. "Theſe ſhall ſtand upon mount Gerizzim to bleſs the people—and <hi>theſe ſhall ſtand upon mount Ebal</hi> TO CURSE"—</note> the mount of bleſſing?—but more eſpecially, than of that "holy mount," to which HE, who came to ſeek and to ſave that which was loſt, uſed to reſort with his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; and where ſuch truly "gracious words"
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:008926_0086_10308A9E59C58CA8"/>
as theſe, uſed to proceed out of his ſacred mouth?—<q>Bleſſed are they which do hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſs; for they ſhall be filled—Aſk, and ye ſhall receive; ſeek, and ye ſhall find; knock, and it ſhall be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened unto you: For EVERY ONE that aſketh, receiveth; and he that ſeeketh, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; and to him that knocketh, IT SHALL BE OPENED.</q>—AMEN!</p>
