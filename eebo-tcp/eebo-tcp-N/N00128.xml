            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>BE pleased to understand, That the Text that I have now read un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, is not of mine own choosing, but was chosen by him (a little before he left us) who is now in another World. It was his earnest desire about two or three dayes before his death (being apprehensive that his <hi>change</hi> was at hand) that I would Preach a Sermon for him upon this Text: His surviving Friend and Companion, who held him very dear, and with whom he left it to prosecute this his desire, hath been unsatisfiedly urgent with me in this behalf, That the earnest desire of the <hi>dying,</hi> and the will of the <hi>dead</hi> as to this matter might be fulfilled; which seconded by others, hath drawn me to this, which it may be I have been too loth to attend. I would not reluct or deny, when mans will and desire carrieth with it any signification or intimation of the will of God, or shun any occasion or opportunity of doing any the least good which his Providence is commending to me, and such I dare not say but this is. You may look upon this Sermon then as the <hi>Request of the Deceased,</hi> as <hi>The Legacy which this Young man hath left by his last Will to the Rising Generation.</hi> Me-thinks it seems to me, that our business with this Text at this time (mine and yours) is from the becknings of <hi>Divine Providence</hi> thereunto directing: for not onely the desire of the deceased (calling us as it were with his last breath to the consideration of this Subject) but <hi>his Death,</hi> nor his alone, but that of <hi>others,</hi> lately taken away (both among our selves, and in Neighbour-Plantations) whose

            <p n="1">1. <hi>That the Chief Good of the sons of men is not to be found in all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures under the Sun, nor in mens labours and travails about them</hi>; all the good that by the greatest industry can be gotten out of them, being but <hi>vanity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and vexation of spirit,</hi> as he after a thorow tedious search had found by woful experience.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That mans Happiness is to be found onely in God, and in the being unto Him.</hi> This is that great Conclusion that he is laying down as the sum and issue of all, in the 13<hi>th</hi> Verse of this 12<hi>th</hi> Chapter; <hi>Let us hear the Conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his Commandments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for this is the whole of man.</hi> Upon these grounds we have him throughout this Discourse, as cautioning men against Creature-pursuances, and seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing happiness where it is not to be had, and nothing can be extracted by the most skilful Chymistry but <hi>vanity and vexation of spirit</hi>; so, calling them to the Creator, and the remembrance of him, in whom, and wherein, their Happiness doth indeed consist.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The first Inference or Duty exhorted to in the last Verse of the former Chapter is, <hi>Therefore remove sorrow from thy heart, and put away evil from thy flesh:</hi> so I do, may the young man think, while I rejoyce in my youth, and my heart chears me, while I walk in the wayes of my hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>art, and put away evil from my flesh, what is? Such indeed is the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the flesh touching sensual pleasures, but sure the judgement of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n, according to the truth of that which he is elswhere speaking, <hi>Prov</hi> 14.13. <hi>Even in laughter the heart is sorrowful, and the end of that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="6" facs="unknown:000183_0005_0FA3156506C8CD18"/>
that puts not away the evil of sin from his flesh, cannot long put away the evil of smart and suffering: whatever vain sensual men may imagine, the winding up will prove that of the Wise-man true, <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.29. <hi>As righteousness tendeth to life, so he that pursueth evil, pursueth it to his own death</hi>: and the Reason backing it is bottomed upon the same main Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the <hi>flittingness, brevity,</hi> and <hi>uncertainty of Life,</hi> even in the young and lusty; <hi>for Childhood and Youth is vanity,</hi> i. e. are fading, passing, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, soon spent· Young men may bear and behave themselves as if imagining their hot blood, lusty bodies, activity, beauty, would last al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, and their youthful pleasures never be at an end; but, <hi>Childhood and Youth are vanity:</hi> Death may not wait till they be gray-headed; or however, the earliest Morning hastens apace to Noon, and then to Night.</p>
            <p>The second Inference or Duty exhorted to, you have in the words of the Text, <hi>Remember thy Creator in the dayes of thy youth.</hi> As in the former he was calling off from sin, vanity, the empty pursuance of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, so in this he is calling to, and putting upon the remembrance of the Creator, <hi>q. d.</hi> relinquish your vanities, and your sensual pleasures and contentments, which will be bitterness in the latter end, and set your hearts seriously God-ward, turn your thoughts toward the minding him. And this Exhortation of young men to the <hi>now remembring of their Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> is urged upon them by the same main Argument still, The flittingness and vanity of Life, and the approaching certainty, and the evil and dark dayes of old Age and Death, <hi>While the evil dayes come not,</hi> &amp;c. as in this and the following Verses; <hi>q. d.</hi> old Age and Death are hastening upon you, and will certainly and soon overtake you. It is the former part of the Verse, <hi>Remember now thy Creator in the dayes of thy youth,</hi> that I shall insist upon, taking no further notice of the latter, but as it may be an Argument to enforce this. And here because I study expedition, and the <hi>Explication</hi> will necessarily take up some room and time, as also that the <hi>Reason</hi> of the duty here required of us, is couched in the expressions wherein it is commended to us, We shall first lay down the <hi>Conclusion</hi> or <hi>Point of Doctrine</hi> from the words, and then open it to you, and fetch the Reasons out of its own bowels. The <hi>Observation</hi> then (according to the terms of the <hi>Text,</hi> which we shall after more fully unfold) is this:
<q>
                  <hi>Doct.</hi> That it is every mans Duty, every young mans Duty, now in the dayes of his youth, to Remember his Creator. Remember now thy Creator in the dayes of thy youth.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It is every mans duty to <hi>remember God,</hi> it is every young mans duty
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:000183_0006_0FA31565CDCC6CC8"/>
to do it <hi>now</hi> in the dayes of his youth. For the clearing up of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>king way for the Application and Improvement of it, we have three things to handle and unfold: (1.) What this <hi>Remembring our Creator</hi> (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he duty which the Text and Doctrine calls for) is importing. (2) The Reasons of our <hi>so doing,</hi> which the term of <hi>Creator</hi> is imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. (3.) Why the Younger may not put it off, but it must be <hi>now done, now in the dayes of their youth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. What this <hi>remembring God, remembring our Creator</hi> is importing. <hi>Remembring,</hi> commonly in Scripture acceptation, is not strictly taken for the simple act of memory, the meer retaining a thing in our heads, nor is so here to be taken for any one simple act of the Soul, nor yet divers and continued acts of one and the same Faculty; but it is taken for the compleat, entire motion of the whole Soul, the whole man towards God. It is the common saying of Divines, That words of knowledge of sense in Scripture, imply affection and action, cogitation and practice, take in both the head and heart, include the whole Soul: by one word of <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, remembring,</hi> and the like, is included the compleat, entire motion of the whole Soul, the whole man towards God. Such is the combination and concatenation of all the Faculties of the Soul, as of Links in a Chain, that draw one and draw all, break one and break all; upon this account any one act, or the act of any one single Faculty, as <hi>knowing, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring,</hi> &amp;c. is usually in Scripture put for the compleat, entire motion of the whole Soul. The term of <hi>our remembring God,</hi> so of <hi>his remembring us,</hi> is used ordinarily not strictly, but in such a latitude as we have been speaking, if you consult <hi>Neh</hi> 4.14. <hi>Judg.</hi> 8.34. <hi>Lev.</hi> 26.42. <hi>Luke</hi> 23.42. and a number of Texts more that might be named and recited (but I fear to be tedious) you will finde the sense of the phrase to run according to the breadth which we have been saying. In a word, we then <hi>remember God,</hi> not when we barely think of him, but when as such we affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately and practically acknowledge him, when we really own, and bear our selves toward him as our Creator; in sum, when the whole entire motion of the whole Soul is Godward.</p>
            <p>Thus briefly and in general. But because the burthen of the Duty of the Text hangs upon this word <hi>Remember,</hi> we shall yet a little further unfold it, and shew you yet somewhat more fully, distinctly, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, what the <hi>remembring God</hi> is implying and inferring, briefly.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Remembring God,</hi> is implying and inferring <hi>converting, turning unto God,</hi> Psal. 22.27. <hi>All the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the Lord:</hi> All men naturally are forgetting God, and turning from him, and men then <hi>remember God,</hi> when they convert and turn unto him: men na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally

To <hi>Remember God,</hi> is then to convert and turn unto him, Know and own him, To set him up, delight, rest in, and trust and depend upon him, To serve and obey him, Thankfully to acknowledge and ascribe unto him. This, and whatsoever else of knowledge, acknowledgement, esteem, homage, love, delight, trust, dependance, service, obedience, thankfulness, and ascribing, is due from the Creature to the Creator, is implied and wrapt up in this, <hi>Remember thy Creator:</hi> We may say of this, as the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.8, 9. <hi>He that loveth another, hath fulfilled the Law: for this, Thou shalt not commit Adultery, Thou shalt not Kill, Thou shalt not Steal, Thou shalt not be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

shalt know him, Thou shalt own him, Thou shalt love him, Thou shalt trust in him, Thou shalt serve him, Thou shalt ascribe unto him: or if there be any other Commandment, if there be ought else that is matter of duty from man to his Maker, it is briefly comprehended in this saying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> namely, <hi>Remember thy Creator.</hi> Now of the things which we have spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, this is the sum; That to remember God, is really, heartily, affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionately, practically to own and agnize God for God, and to honour and glorifie him as God; and this is to be indeed godly, to be really re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, Religion being nothing else but a Doctrine of remembring God, knowing and owning God. But so much what this <hi>Remembring God</hi> is importing.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The second thing to be spoken to is, the <hi>Reasons</hi> and <hi>Grounds</hi> of our so doing, which the very term of <hi>Creator</hi> is implying. It is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usual in Scripture for men bespeaking God in Prayer and Thanksgiving, to present God under such sutable Notions, such Titles and Attributes, as may most fitly set him forth as the Author and Bestower of the desired or obtained good, as you may see <hi>Gen.</hi> 43.14. <hi>Jer.</hi> 14.8. <hi>Psal.</hi> 28.1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 144.1, 2. so God speak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ng to us, and requiring duty from us, is clothed with such Considerations, presented under such Notions and Titles as may carry with them the ground and reason of, and motive to the duty called for, as in <hi>Isa.</hi> 8 13, 14. <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.22. and elswhere. So here, there is Reason, Ground, Motive enough, in the Notion and Title of <hi>our Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> that God is set forth by, to put us upon the duty required, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring of him: <hi>O come</hi> (say they, <hi>Psal.</hi> 95 6.) <hi>let us worship and bow down, and kneel before the Lord our Maker.</hi> And this is their Motive, <hi>Psal.</hi> 100.1, 2, 3. <hi>Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all ye lands: serve the Lord with gladness, and come before his presence with singing. Know ye that the Lord he is God, it is he that hath made us, and not we our selves; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture. At that day</hi> (saith the Prophet, <hi>Isa.</hi> 17.7) <hi>a man shall look to his Maker, and his eyes shall have respect to the Holy One of Israel.</hi> To whom should the Creature have a respect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ul eye, whiche should he look, but to his Maker? whom should man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, but his Creator? But that we may more fully see this, we must know, that the term of <hi>Creator</hi> here used, sets forth God as the Author of our Being out of nothing, so of all our Being and well being, our bringing into Being, our continuance in Being, our preserva<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ion, our well-being; all the administrations of God about us as to this, are wrapped up in his being set forth as our Creator; nor onely so, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently, the Right that he hath in us, the Regiment and Dominion that he hath over us, and the Disposure that he hath of us, are here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded.
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:000183_0010_0FA31568C48F1D40"/>
These things considered, <hi>Why we should Remember our Creator,</hi> is most evident, and the Reason runneth very strong. But to touch some things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Because God being our Creator, the Author and Fountain of our Being, is the End of our Being: the <hi>first Cause</hi> must needs be the <hi>last End</hi>; he that made all of himself, made all for himself, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16 4. <hi>The Lord made all things for himself</hi>: Rom. 11.36. <hi>For of him, and through him, and to him are all things</hi>: Of whom, and through whom are all things, to him are all things; he that primarily made all things of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, made all things ultimately for himself.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Because God is not onely bringing us into, but continuing us in Being, preserving, and administring to our well-being: we must all of us bespeak God in <hi>Job</hi>'s language, <hi>Job.</hi> 10.12. <hi>Thou hast granted me life and favour, and thy visitation hath preserved my spirit,</hi> i. e. Being and well-being, and continuation of both: He is styled, <hi>The preserver of men,</hi> Job 7.20. <hi>He holdeth our soul in life,</hi> Psal. 66.9. <hi>In him we live, and move, and have our being,</hi> Acts 17.18. He maintaineth, and bloweth up the spark of his own kindling; <hi>He giveth to us life, and breath, and all things, ver.</hi> 25. of the same Chapter: It is from his careful Providence, that is continually exercised about us, that such frail needy creatures are sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported and supplied, having a subsistence, and a comfortable one. God is not like the Carpenter or Mason, that buildeth the House, and then leaveth it to it self, or the care of others, but he keepeth up what he set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth up: we should quickly lose all, and sink into our nothing again, did not the same hand that brought us out of nothing, keep us where we are. And to whom then do we owe our service? whose are we? whom should we remember? to whom should we be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but his, to him, from whom we have our maintenance and preservation, who is not our Maker onely, but our continual Upholder, and most bountiful Benefacto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Because God being our Creator, is our Proprietor, Possessor, Owner, Lord, Governour. As the Lord builds the house, and keepeth it in repair, so he holdeth it himself; as he built it for himself, so he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth to be the Proprietor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Owner, Lord, Governour, Possessor of it; as he putteth not man out of his own hands in respect of preservation, so neither in respect of possession and dominion, <hi>Isa.</hi> 43.1. <hi>But now thus saith the Lord that created thee, O Jacob, and that formed thee, O Israel — thou art mine.</hi> To whom God saith, <hi>I have created, I have formed thee,</hi> he saith also, <hi>Thou art mine</hi> It is most probable indeed that the Prophe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

God then challengeth us, and layeth claim to us in the most <hi>Absolute Right,</hi> for it is beyond us to imagine, nor indeed can there be a more full and undoubted Right and Title, then Creation giveth; he being our Creator then, is in the most unquestionable Right our Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessor, Proprietor, Lord, Owner, Disposer, and we are his possession, for his use, at his dispose, bound thereunto in the highest and most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionable Right— More might be added, from the <hi>knowledge</hi> God hath of us, as being our Maker, and intimately acquainted with us; <hi>He that made man, knoweth what is in man</hi>; he that <hi>formed the heart</hi> soundeth it, <hi>John</hi> 2.25. <hi>Psal.</hi> 33.15. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.13. <hi>Acts</hi> 15.18. <hi>Psal.</hi> 139.1, and the following Verses: and from the <hi>power</hi> that he hath over us, being easily able to reach us, and punish us at pleasure, for all our forgetfulness of him, and neglects of duty towards himself, the same hand that made can break us, he that built can easily pull us down, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 5 7. <hi>J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="1">1. Because young men now in the dayes of their youth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> owe th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Is God the God of the Jews only?</hi> saith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, <hi>is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also.</hi> Is God the Creator, Preserver, Proprietor of the old man onely? is he not also of

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Because as it is young mens <hi>now duty,</hi> Gods <hi>now due,</hi> that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member him, so God calleth for it <hi>now,</hi> it is Gods due from young men that they remember him <hi>now in the dayes of their youth,</hi> and God gives not day for payment, he requireth it out of hand of the Youngest.

One would think that whatsoever men forget, or were unmindful about, it should be rather of any thing, rather of every thing, then his <hi>Creator,</hi> the God that made him, the God that is (as you have heard) the <hi>Author</hi> and <hi>End</hi> of his Being, that is his Upholder, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>server, and gracious visitant every moment; that is his Proprietor, Owner, Possessor, Lord, Governour, that challengeth him in the most Absolute and unquestionable Right; that is throughly acquainted with him, and as throughly able to reach and punish him for all his neglects of duty towards himself: yet alas, what doth many a man less remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, more forget then his Maker? <hi>At that day</hi> (saith the Prophet in the place before-mentioned, <hi>Isa.</hi> 17.7) <hi>shall a man look to his Maker, and his eyes shall have respect to the holy One of Israel:</hi> but at this day the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in sad experience is to be seen, and said of most men, They look not to their Maker, and their eyes have no respect to the holy One of <hi>Israel.</hi> Oh how little God-ward, their Maker-ward, do most men look? how little respect have they for him? they have enough, and more then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for the Creature, but they have little or none for the Creator. Alas, how do men gad up and down the world, setting <hi>their eyes upon

Oh! to look with an awakened understanding upon rational Creatures, men of Gods own making, and made for, and made able and meet for this end and purpose, to remember, know, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, own him their Creator, and then consider how little they do it, how mindless, regardless, forgetful of God they are, How astonishing is it, and yet alas how common! O it is a strange sinful doleful world, wherein it is so rare to finde a man seriously mindful of his Maker: Alas Sirs, men mindless of God, are mindless too what it is to be mindless of him; but to an enlightened, to an awakened minde, what doth a sinful, thoughtless, God fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Bethink thy self, man, is it indeed nothing or next to nothing, a small matter with thee, to love and serve the creature more then the Creator, to remember too much every vanity, and forget the God that made thee? O that men were sensible, that they did but know how dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and provoking a thing this is, and of how dangerous consequence unto themselves! We shall say something (though we must be brief in either) both of the <hi>greatness,</hi> and of the <hi>danger</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>First, The <hi>greatness of the sin of forgetting God,</hi> may appear:</p>
            <p n="1">1. From <hi>the deep obligation that lyes upon you to remember him as he is your Creator.</hi> Look back upon what hath been said before, and consider what obligation Gods being your Maker layes upon you to remember him; you are wholly God's in all that you are and have from first to last; you are, and have nothing, but what you are and have from him and for him. To forget, disacknowledge him therefore (being every way as deeply bound as is possible or imaginable) must needs be a great wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, a transcendent evil. O Sirs, do but seriously consider how much you are indebted unto God for all things, and all along from your first Being untill this now, and sure it will appear a strange, horrible, unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable, unthankful, vile, inexcusable thing, to forget and disacknowledge h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

O think, I beseech you, how can it but be a sin of the <hi>first Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi> to forget, disown God, who hath not onely done so much upon a <hi>Creation account,</hi> but is doing so much every day upon a <hi>Providential account,</hi> to make himself remembred by you? sure there can be no room to think it a light thing to forget and disacknowledge God, while his daily, hou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

That man should be mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less of God, forget, disown him, what a wonder is it? That God should be thoughtful of and about us, is a wonder of mercy and condescention; that we should be thoughtless and unmindful of God, is a wonder of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable and unthankfulness, for the friend to forget his friend, any

               </gap>y remembrancers of God. O that you would think your lives are filled up with mercies, you are daily laden with benefits, and there is not one blessing which any of you have, but it hath from God this written upon it, <hi>Remember me.</hi> When God puts Bread into thy hands, he saith, <hi>Here, eat and remember me</hi>; when he fills thy Cup, he bids, <hi>Remember me</hi>; when he puts Clothes upon thy back, he saith, <hi>Remember me:</hi> God gives thee all, and he gives thee all to lead thee to himself, the remembrance and acknowledgement of himself. And, O man, is it nothing for all this to forget and disown God, to whom thou art so obliged and indebted? That <hi>God</hi> that hath as it were studied so many wayes to fasten himself in thy remembrance, canst thou make a light matter of it, or how canst thou look upon it otherwise then an intolerable inexcusable evil, to sin against such merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full multiplied, and obliged remembrances of him? How canst thou but say, <hi>How shall I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?</hi> O how wilt thou ever be able to hold up thy head, that God that thus deeply and dearly deserved to be remembred by thee, shall question thee for thy forgetfulness of him? wilt thou then be able thinkest thou, to make as light a matter of it as thou now dost, when he himself shall reason out the case with thee, when he shall say, <hi>Did I indeed make and maintain thee? did I house, and lodge, and feed, and clothe, and deliver thee? did I visit thee every morning, and take care of thee every moment, and all to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get me?</hi> Sinner, God forgetting sinner, can thy heart endure, or can thy hands be strong in the day that God shall thus deal with thee? <hi>Now consider this ye that forget God, lest be tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. (I see I must but name things) This <hi>forgetting God</hi> must needs be no light sin, nor a little provoking, having in it, carrying with it, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing, and too evidently holding forth <hi>much contempt, a low and light esteem of him.</hi> That which a man esteems he keeps in memory, he trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures it up there, is mindful, thoughtful of and about it: <hi>remembrance</hi> and <hi>esteem</hi> run together, as you may see in that of the Psalmist, <hi>Psal.</hi> 137.5.6. <hi>If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning; if I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth</hi>: why, whence was this? you may see in the next words, <hi>If I prefer not

Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what would have been spoken more generally unto all (but time scanting upon us) we shall especially urge the Exhortation upon such as are the persons to whom the Text is directing it.

To thee young man it is spoken, and to thee young woman; to thee <hi>John,</hi> and to thee <hi>Thomas,</hi> to thee <hi>Mary,</hi> and to thee <hi>Sarah,</hi> the Exhortation as much, as particularly concerns thee, as if thy Name were written in the Text: and, Oh that I might be a poor Instrument in the hand of God, to bring home this word to thy heart! Oh that I might be thy effectual Remembrancer upon the account! Oh that I might perswade, prevalently perswade thee, <hi>now in the dayes of thy youth to remember thy Creator!</hi> Oh that <hi>now</hi> man, <hi>now in the dayes of thy youth,</hi> while it is yet morning with thee, thou wouldest take time at ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, and improve this present, precious, peerless season, which will be but for a little while, in the serious applying thy self hereunto, and minding the God, and thy duty towards the God that made thee, <hi>now while the evil dayes come not.</hi> Remember and turn unto him <hi>now,</hi> set up, and acknowledge, and love, and fear, and serve him <hi>now</hi>: Do not think there is no such haste, if any man may put it off for a while I may, there can be no great danger or damage in deferring it a little: There is such haste, no man may put it off, no not a while, neither mayest thou, the danger, the damage of deferring but a little, a week, a day, may be thy eternal undoing. O do not think it is <hi>duty</hi> indeed to remember God, 'tis matter of <hi>importance,</hi> 'tis what must be done, I will do it, I will do it more, I will be more serious in it hereafter; but look upon it as thy <hi>now duty,</hi> as matter of importance and necessity to be done, and to be done to purpose, to be seriously dealt in <hi>now</hi>: truly <hi>hic labor,</hi> here is the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty; to perswade men that it is duty to remember God, to convince men of the necessity of it, that it must be done, is not hard, but alas to prevail with men to do it <hi>now,</hi> instantly, presently to attend it, here is the d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Questionless that is duty, that it is of necessity, and that it shall be done, they will finde a time for it, is with most men: Sure thou art saying in thy heart (thou that at present art most remiss, negligent and forgetful of God) I will remember and turn unto the Lord sometime or other before I die: thou art intending, purposing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> promising thy self, that though at present thou art too neglective, yet it shall not be alwayes thus, hereafter thou wilt be more serious, and if it be done at <hi>any time,</hi> it will be as well as if thou didst it <hi>now.</hi> Hast thou not some such reasonings of heart as these? To which I answer, That though such indeed be the bottomless Mercy of God, and the boundless Merits of the precious Blood-shed of the Lord Jesus, that upon a sound and soaking Repentance, and serious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring of him at last, those that have long, ever so long neglected it, shall be graciously forgiven, yet it is not otherwise all one to forget, neglect God this day, week, moneth, year, though thou shouldst remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber him the next. Man, it is thy duty <hi>now,</hi> it is Gods due <hi>now,</hi> thou mayest not think it is well enough, or it is all one, if thou remember and turn unto him any time hereafter; the duty of <hi>to day</hi> cannot be done <hi>to morrow,</hi> thy <hi>now duty,</hi> the duty of thy youth, cannot be done hereafter and in thy Age, though the neglect may be repented of and pardoned, which how seldome it is we shall hereafter shew.

            <p n="3">3. And lastly, consider, as thou owest thy Creator this present debt of <hi>Remembrance,</hi> and he calleth for, and makes demand of it <hi>now,</hi> so <hi>now</hi> is the fittest time for payment, thou art <hi>now</hi> in the best capacity to do it, <hi>now in the dayes of thy youth, while the evill dayes come not,</hi> before those times of less advantage, of greater disadvantage overtake thee, no time to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent time, no age to the dayes of youth, thou hast <hi>now</hi> such a price in hand, as thou wilt never enioy more; it is the argument which <hi>David</hi> by his messengers improves with <hi>Nabal</hi> (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.8) <hi>We come in a good day give I pray thee,</hi> &amp;c.

then now it is? or will thy hindrances be fewer, thy helpes and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages more, then now they are? if not, why shouldst thou put it off, why shouldest thou not make use of this present time? Sure thou judgest it requisite, indispensibly requisite, to remember, turn to God, seek him, serve him, and that in good earnest, thou canst not but, know it is what must be done, or thou art for ever undone; And why may not what must be done be as well done, yea better done now then put off longer. O think seriously of it, if thou ever meanest to remember God, <hi>now</hi> is the time, <hi>now in the dayes of thy youth</hi> is the fittest, fairest opportunity.

But this is so; for, (1.) Thy delaying, deferring, putting off, doth dispose thee more and more still to delay, defer, put off: the longer thou art putting off, the stronger will thy disposition be to be putting off still; the old Saying is full true here, <hi>Qui non vult hodie cras minus aptus erit,</hi> He that will not to day, shall be less fit to morrow; he that puts off now, will be more prone to put off hereafter; he that defers for the present, will do it much more for the future. Let me ask thee, (and I beseech thee seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously consider of it) Dost thou finde thy self more disposed to take the present time that now is, by all thy past puttings off? nay, dost thou not finde that the more thou delayest and puttest off, the more thou mayest, and that thou art so much the readier to do it still, by how much the longer thou hast done it already? and if this be the effect of <hi>former put offs</hi> as to the present, thou mayest easily gather what will be the fruit of <hi>present put offs</hi> as to the future. O believe it, every dayes procrastina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, every weeks, and moneths, and years proroguing and putting off, sets thee further off upon this account. Alas man, thou goest on from day to day, from one time to another, feeding thy self with future hopes, promises, purposes and intendments, while every day a greater indispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, dilatory dangerous death threatning temper is growing upon thee. And (2.) Consider, as thy indisposition, disaffection is strengthned by thy delaying, so every day the letts and hindrances, and blocks and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties in thy way are heightned. Dost thou not think thou wouldest
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:000183_0032_0FA3157946A0ABA8"/>
finde enough to do of it now to turn over a new leaf, forget thy vanities, forsake thy sins, shake off thy loose Companions, and set thy self to a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious remembring, converting and turning to the Lord, and will not custome in sin th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Alas, the work is difficult, the hindrances many, thy heart so averse and indisposed, that thou knowest not how to perswade and overcome thy self to set upon it presently, and yet art thou bold to delay it, presumptuously promising thy self the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, when thy indisposition will be more, and the difficulties greater then now they are. Thou mayest flatter thy self while thou art putting off <hi>now,</hi> and putting off <hi>then,</hi> with the hopes of a future repentance and conversion, but certainly Satan who is labouring thy ruine, upon a more probable ground promiseth himself his prey, while putting off to deliver thy self, thou art every day more entangled in his snares, and the way of thy repentance blocked up, and rendred more difficult and unlikely every day then other. Do but seriously think of this, and sure thou wilt see little reason to be delaying and putting off any longer; thou wilt see great reason to set thy self to a present <hi>remembring thy Creator,</hi> to a now converting and turning unto God. Did thy delay advantage thee, it were somewhat; did it facilitate thy work, did it wear out the hindrances it were somewhat, nay did it not disadvantage thee it were more tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; but when such is the evident and apparent disadvantage of delay, O that ever thou shouldst be guilty of this manifest folly, yea madness, as to put it off full. And (3) Consider, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

His writing Sermons at Meeting was commendable and mutable, as also the after-improvement that he made of them; his Notes were not laid by as useless, or served to put under Pies, but they were overlook'd and repeated by himself, and to others as occasion offered. The Sermons that he took here the last Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (as I am informed) have been since called over in his Fathers Family. That he was ready and forward upon such accounts, is the account that such give of him that best knew him; and as to this, there is one thing more that would not be omitted, That when he came now lately out of the <hi>Bay,</hi> a little before his last Sickness, that being at Sea upon the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, and seeing the Morning well spent, and nothing going forward of a Sabbath dayes work, he began to minde them (though the youngest of the Company) of the Day, and Duty thereunto belonging, desiring they might go to Prayer, and he would repeat a Sermon to them, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly he did both Forenoon and Afternoon.
