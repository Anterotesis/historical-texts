            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>MANY ſelections of excellent matter have lately been made for the benefit of young perſons. Perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of this kind are of ſo great utility, that freſh pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of them, and new attempts to improve the young mind, will ſcarcely be deemed ſuperfluous, if the writer make his compilation inſtructive and intereſting, and ſufficiently diſtinct from others.</p>
            <p>THE preſent work, as the title expreſſes, aims at the attainment of three objects: to improve youth in the art of reading; to meliorate their language and ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and to inculcate ſome of the moſt important prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of piety and virtue.</p>
            <p>THE pieces ſelected, not only give exerciſe to a great variety of emotions, and the correſpondent tones and variations of voice, but contain ſentences, and members of ſentences, which are diverſified, proportioned, and pointed with accuracy. Exerciſes of this nature are, it is preſumed, well calculated to teach youth to read with propriety and effect. A ſelection of ſentences, in which variety and proportion, with exact punctuation, have been carefully obſerved, in all their parts as well as with reſpect to one another, will probably have a much great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er effect, in properly teaching the art of reading, than is commonly imagined. In ſuch conſtructions, every thing
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:038017_0004_1010D2F6EF5B3AE0"/>
is accommodated to the underſtanding and the voice; and the common difficulties in learning to read well, are obviated. When the learner has acquired a habit of reading ſuch ſentences, with juſtneſs and facility, he will readily apply that habit, and the improvements he has made, to ſentences more complicated and irregular, and of a conſtruction entirely different.</p>
            <p>THE language of the pieces choſen for this collection, has been carefully regarded. Purity, propriety, perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuity, and, in many inſtances, elegance of diction, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh them. They are extracted from the works of the moſt correct and elegant writers. From the ſources whence the ſentiments are drawn, the reader may expect to find them connected and regular, ſufficiently important and impreſſive, and diveſted of every thing that is either trite or eccentric. The frequent peruſal of ſuch compoſition, naturally tends to infuſe a taſte for this ſpecies of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; and to produce a habit of thinking, and of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing, with judgment and accuracy<note n="*" place="bottom">The Grammatical Student, in his progreſs through this work, will meet with numerous inſtances of compoſition, in ſtrict conformity to the rules for promoting perſpicuous and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant writing contained in the Appendix to the Author's Engliſh Grammar. By occaſionally examining this conformity, he will be confirmed in the utility of thoſe rules; and be enabled to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply them with eaſe and dexterity.</note>.</p>
            <p>THAT this collection may alſo ſerve the purpoſe of promoting piety and virtue, the Compiler has introduced
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:038017_0005_1010D2F8B8B30F78"/>
many extracts, which place religion in the moſt amiable light; and which recommend a great variety of moral duties, by the excellence of their nature, and the happy effects which they produce. Theſe ſubjects are exhibited in a ſtyle and manner, which are calculated to arreſt the attention of youth; and to make ſtrong and durable im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions on their minds<note n="†" place="bottom">In ſome of the pieces, the Compiler has made a few altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, chiefly verbal, to adapt them the better to the deſign of his work.</note>.</p>
            <p>THE Compiler has been careful to avoid every ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion and ſentiment, that might gratify a corrupt mind, or, in the leaſt degree, offend the eye or ear of innocence. This he conceives to be peculiarly incumbent on every perſon who writes for the benefit of youth. It would, indeed, be a great and happy improvement in education, if no writings were allowed to come under their notice, but ſuch as are perfectly innocent; and if, on all proper occaſions, they were encouraged to peruſe thoſe which tend to inſpire a due reverence for virtue, and an abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of vice, as well as to animate them with ſentiments of piety and goodneſs. Such impreſſions deeply engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven on their minds, and connected with all their attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, could ſcarcely fail of attending them through life; and of producing a ſolidity of principle and character, that would be able to reſiſt the danger ariſing from fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture intercourſe with the world.</p>
            <p>THE Author has endeavoured to relieve the grave and ſerious parts of his collection, by the occaſional ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:038017_0006_1010D2FBCAB16570"/>
of pieces which amuſe as well as inſtruct. If, however, any of his readers ſhould think it contains too great a proportion of the former, it may be ſome apology to obſerve that, in the exiſting publications deſigned for the peruſal of young perſons, the preponderance is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the ſide of gay and amuſing productions. Too much attention may be paid to this medium of improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. When the imagination, of youth eſpecially, is much entertained, the ſober dictates of the underſtanding are regarded with indifference; and the influence of the good affections, is either feeble, or tranſient. A tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate uſe of ſuch entertainment ſeems therefore requiſite, to afford proper ſcope for the operations of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and the heart.</p>
            <p>THE reader will perceive, that the Compiler has been ſolicitous to recommend to young perſons, the peruſal of the ſacred Scriptures, by interſperſing through his work, ſome of the moſt beautiful and intereſting paſſages of thoſe invaluable writings. To excite an early taſte and veneration for this great rule of life, is a point of ſo high importance, as to warrant the attempt to promote it on every proper occaſion.</p>
            <p>TO improve the young mind, and to afford ſome aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance to tutors, in the arduous and important work of education, were the motives which led to this production. If the Author ſhould be ſo ſucceſsful as to accompliſh theſe ends, even in a ſmall degree, he will think his time and pains well employed, and himſelf amply rewarded.</p>

            <head type="sub">OBSERVATIONS ON THE PRINCIPLES OF GOOD READING.</head>
            <p>TO read with propriety is a pleaſing and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant attainment; productive of improvement both to the underſtanding and the heart. It is eſſential to a complete reader, that he minutely perceive the ideas, and enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the feelings of the author, whoſe ſentiments he profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to repeat: for how is it poſſible to repreſent clearly to others, what we have but faint or inaccurate concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ourſelves? If there were no other benefits re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting from the art of reading well, than the neceſſity it lays us under, of preciſely aſcertaining the meaning of what we read; and the habit thence required, of doing this with facility, both when reading ſilently and aloud, they would conſtitute a ſufficient compenſation for all the labour we can beſtow upon the ſubject. But the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure derived to ourſelves and others, from a clear commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of ideas and feelings; and the ſtrong and dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble impreſſions made thereby on the minds of the reader and the audience, are conſiderations, which give an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional importance to the ſtudy of this neceſſary and uſeful art. The perfect attainment of it doubtleſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires great attention and practice, joined to extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary

natural powers; but as there are many degrees of excellence in the art, the ſtudent whoſe aims fall ſhort of perfection, will find himſelf amply rewarded for every exertion he may think proper to make.</p>
            <p>To give rules for the management of the voice in reading, by which the neceſſary pauſes, emphaſis, and tones, may be diſcovered and put in practice, is not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. After all the directions that can be offered on theſe points, much will remain to be taught by the living inſtructor: much will be attainable by no other means, than the force of example influencing the imitative pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the learner. Some rules and principles on theſe heads will, however, be found uſeful, to prevent erroneous and vicious modes of utterance; to give the young rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſome taſte of the ſubject; and to aſſiſt him in acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a juſt and accurate mode of delivery. The obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations which we have to make, for theſe purpoſes, may be compriſed under the following heads: PROPER LOUD<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NESS OF VOICE; DISTINCTNESS; SLOWNESS; PROPRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ETY OF PRONUNCIATION; EMPHASIS; TONES; PAU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SES; and MODE OF READING VERSE.</p>
            <div n="1" type="section">
               <head>SECTION I. Proper Loudneſs of Voice.</head>
               <p>THE firſt attention of every perſon who reads to others, doubtleſs, muſt be, to make himſelf be heard by all thoſe to whom he reads. He muſt endeavour to fill with his voice the ſpace occupied by the company. This power of voice, it may be thought, is wholly a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural talent. It is, in a good meaſure, the gift of nature; but it may receive conſiderable aſſiſtance from art. Much depends, for this purpoſe, on the proper pitch and manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the voice. Every perſon has three pitches in
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:038017_0009_1010D305A059DC40"/>
his voice; the HIGH, the MIDDLE, and the LOW one. The high, is that which he uſes in calling aloud to ſome perſon at a diſtance. The low is, when he approaches to a whiſper. The middle is, that which he employs in common converſation, and which he ſhould generally uſe in reading to others. For it is a great miſtake, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agine that one muſt take the higheſt pitch of his voice, in order to be well heard in a large company. This is confounding two things which are different, loudneſs or ſtrength of ſound, with the key or note on which we ſpeak. There is a variety of ſound within the compaſs of each key. A ſpeaker may therefore render his voice louder, without altering the key: and we ſhall always be able to give moſt body, moſt perſevering force of ſound, to that pitch of voice, to which in converſation we are accuſtomed. Whereas, by ſetting out on our higheſt pitch or key, we certainly allow ourſelves leſs compaſs, and are likely to ſtrain our voice before we have done. We ſhall fatigue ourſelves, and read with pain; and whenever a perſon ſpeaks with pain to himſelf, he is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways heard with pain by his audience. Let us therefore give the voice full ſtrength and ſwell of ſound; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways pitch it on our ordinary ſpeaking key. It ſhould be a conſtant rule, never to utter a greater quantity of voice, than we can afford without pain to ourſelves, and without any extraordinary effort. As long as we keep within theſe bounds, the other organs of ſpeech will be at liberty to diſcharge their ſeveral offices with eaſe; and we ſhall always have our voice under command. But whenever we tranſgreſs theſe bounds, we give up the reins, and have no longer any management of it. It is a uſeful rule too, in order to be well heard, to caſt our eye
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:038017_0010_1010D30729A82388"/>
on ſome of the moſt diſtant perſons in the company, and to conſider ourſelves as reading to them. We naturally and mechanically utter our words with ſuch a degree of ſtrength, as to make ourſelves be heard by the perſon whom we addreſs, provided he is within the reach of our voice. As this is the caſe in converſation, it will hold alſo in reading to others. But let us remember, that in reading, as well as in converſation, it is poſſible to offend by ſpeaking too loud. This extreme hurts the ear, by making the voice come upon it in rumbling indiſtinct maſſes.</p>
               <p>By the habit of reading, when young, in a loud and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement manner, the voice becomes fixed in a ſtrained and unnatural key; and is rendered incapable of that variety of elevation and depreſſion which conſtitutes the true harmony of utterance, and affords eaſe to the reader, and pleaſure to the audience. This unnatural pitch of the voice, and diſagreeable monotony, are moſt obſervable in perſons who were taught to read in large rooms; who were accuſtomed to ſtand at too great diſtance, when reading to their teachers; whoſe inſtructors were very imperfect in their hearing; or who were taught by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that conſidered loud expreſſion as the chief requiſite in forming a good reader. Theſe are circumſtances which demand the ſerious attention of every one to whom the education of youth is committed.</p>

               <p>IN the next place, to being well heard and clearly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, diſtinctneſs of articulation contributes more than mere loudneſs of ſound. The quantity of ſound neceſſary to fill even a large ſpace, is ſmaller than is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly

imagined; and, with diſtinct articulation, a perſon with a weak voice will make it reach farther, than the ſtrongeſt voice can reach without it. To this, therefore, every reader ought to pay great attention. He muſt give every ſound which he utters, its due proportion; and make every ſyllable, and even every letter in the word which he pronounces, be heard diſtinctly; without ſlur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, whiſpering, or ſuppreſſing any of the proper ſounds.</p>
               <p>An accurate knowledge of the ſimple, elementary ſounds of the language, and a facility in expreſſing them, are ſo neceſſary to diſtinctneſs of expreſſion, that if the learner's attainments are, in this reſpect, imperfect, (and many there are in this ſituation,) it will be incumbent on his teacher, to carry him back to theſe primary articula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and to ſuſpend his progreſs, till he become per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly maſter of them. It will be in vain to preſs him forward, with the hope of forming a good reader, if he cannot completely articulate every elementary ſound of the language.</p>

               <p>IN order to expreſs ourſelves diſtinctly, moderation is requiſite with regard to the ſpeed of pronouncing. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitancy of ſpeech confounds all articulation, and all meaning. It is ſcarcely neceſſary to obſerve, that there may be alſo an extreme on the oppoſite ſide. It is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious that a lifeleſs drawling manner of reading, which allows the minds of the hearers to be always outrunning the ſpeaker, muſt render every ſuch performance inſipid and fatiguing. But the extreme of reading too faſt is much more common; and requires the more to be guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt, becauſe, when it has grown into a habit, few

errors are more difficult to be corrected. To pronounce with a proper degree of ſlowneſs, and with full and clear articulation, is neceſſary to be ſtudied by all, who wiſh to become good readers; and it cannot be too much recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to them. Such a pronunciation gives weight and dignity to the ſubject. It is a great aſſiſtance to the voice, by the pauſes and reſts which it allows it more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily to make; and it enables the reader to ſwell all his ſounds, both with more force and more harmony.</p>

               <head>SECTION IV. Propriety of Pronunciation.</head>
               <p>AFTER the fundamental attentions to the pitch and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of the voice, to diſtinct articulation, and to a proper degree of ſlowneſs of ſpeech, what the young reader muſt, in the next place, ſtudy, is propriety of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation; or, giving to every word which he utters, that ſound which the beſt uſage of the language appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priates to it; in oppoſition to broad, vulgar, or provincial pronunciation. This is requiſite both for reading intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligibly, and for reading with correctneſs and eaſe. Inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions concerning this article may beſt be given by the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing teacher. But there is one obſervation, which it may not be improper here to make. In the Engliſh language, every word which conſiſts of more ſyllables than one, has one accented ſyllable. The accent reſts ſometimes on the vowel, ſometimes on the conſonant. The genius of the language, requires the voice to mark that ſyllable by a ſtronger percuſſion, and to paſs more ſlightly over the reſt. Now, after we have learned the proper ſeats of thoſe accents, it is an important rule, to give every word juſt the ſame accent in reading, as in common diſcourſe. Many perſons err in this reſpect. When they read to
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:038017_0013_1010D30FF851D8C0"/>
others, and with ſolemnity, they pronounce the ſyllables in a different manner from what they do at other times. They dwell upon them, and protract them; they multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply accents on the ſame word; from a miſtaken notion, that it gives gravity and importance to their ſubject, and adds to the energy of their delivery. Whereas this is one of the greateſt faults that can be committed in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation: it makes what is called a pompous or mouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manner; and gives an artificial affected air to read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which detracts greatly both from its agreeableneſs, and its impreſſion.</p>
               <p>Sheridan and Walker have publiſhed dictionaries, for aſcertaining the true and beſt pronunciation of the words of our language. By attentively conſulting them, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly "Walker's Pronouncing Dictionary," the young reader will be much aſſiſted, in his endeavours to attain a correct pronunciation of the words belonging to the Engliſh language.</p>

               <head>SECTION V. Emphaſis.</head>
               <p>BY Emphaſis is meant a ſtronger and fuller ſound of voice, by which we diſtinguiſh ſome word or words, on which we deſign to lay particular ſtreſs, and to ſhow how they affect the reſt of the ſentence. Sometimes the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatic words muſt be diſtinguiſhed by a particular tone of voice, as well as by a particular ſtreſs. On the right ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of the emphaſis depends the life of pronunciati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. If no emphaſis be placed on any words, not only is diſcourſe rendered heavy and lifeleſs, but the meaning left often ambiguous. If the emphaſis be placed wrong, we pervert and confound the meaning wholly.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="unknown:038017_0014_1010D314606E2790"/>Emphaſis may be divided into the SUPERIOR and the INFERIOR emphaſis. The ſuperior emphaſis determines the meaning of a ſentence, with reference to ſomething ſaid before, preſuppoſed by the author as general know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or removes an ambiguity, where a paſſage may have more ſenſes than one. The inferior emphaſis <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forces, graces,</hi> and <hi>enlivens,</hi> but does not <hi>fix,</hi> the meaning of any paſſage. The words to which this latter emphaſis is given, are in general, such as ſeem the moſt important in the ſentence, or, on other accounts, to merit this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction. The following paſſage will ſerve to exemplify the ſuperior emphaſis.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>"Of man's firſt diſobedience, and the fruit</l>
                  <l>"Of that forbidden tree, whoſe mortal taſte</l>
                  <l>"Brought death into the world, and all our woe," &amp;c.</l>
                  <l>"Sing heav'nly Muſe!"</l>
               </q>
               <p>Suppoſing that originally other beings, beſides men, had diſobeyed the commands of the Almighty, and that the circumſtance were well known to us, there would fall an emphaſis upon the word <hi>man's</hi> in the firſt line; and hence it would be read thus:
<q>"Of <hi>man's</hi> firſt diſobedience, and the fruit," &amp;c.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But if it were a notorious truth that mankind had tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed in a peculiar manner more than once, the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaſis would fall on <hi>firſt</hi>; and the line be read,
<q>"Of man's <hi>firſt</hi> diſobedience," &amp;c.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Again, admitting death (as was really the caſe) to have been an unheard-of and dreadful puniſhment, brought upon man in conſequence of his tranſgreſſion; on that ſuppoſition the third line would be read,
<q>"Brought <hi>death</hi> into the world, &amp;c.</q>
               </p>

                  <pb n="15" facs="unknown:038017_0015_1010D315E90CE558"/>But if we were to ſuppoſe, that mankind knew there was ſuch an evil as death in other regions, though the place they inhabited had been free from it till their tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, the line would run thus:
<q>"Brought death into the <hi>world,</hi>" &amp;c.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The ſuperior emphaſis finds place in the following ſhort ſentence, which admits of four diſtinct meanings, each of which is aſcertained by the emphaſis only.</p>
               <q>"Do you ride to town to-day?"</q>
               <p>The following examples illuſtrate the nature and uſe of the inferior emphaſis.</p>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The ſuperior emphaſis, in reading as in ſpeaking, muſt be determined entirely by the <hi>ſenſe</hi> of the paſſage, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways made <hi>alike:</hi> but as to the inferior emphaſis, <hi>taſte</hi> alone ſeems to have the right of fixing its ſituation and quantity.</p>
               <p>Among a number of perſons, who have had proper op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of learning to read, in the beſt manner it is now taught, very few could be ſelected, who, in a given in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:038017_0016_1010D3199B4AE870"/>
would uſe the inferior emphaſis alike, either as to place or quantity. Some perſons, indeed, uſe ſcarcely any degree of it: and others do not ſcruple to carry it much beyond any thing to be found in common diſcourſe; and even ſometimes throw it upon words ſo very trifling in themſelves, that it is evidently done with no other view, than to give greater variety to the modulation<note n="*" place="bottom">By modulation is meant that pleaſing variety of voice, which is perceived in uttering a ſentence, and which, in its nature, is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly diſtinct from emphaſis, and the tones of emotion and paſſion. The young reader ſhould be careful to render his modulation cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and eaſy; and, for this purpoſe, ſhould form it upon the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del of the moſt judicious and correct ſpeakers.</note>. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this diverſity of practice, there are certainly proper boundaries, within which this emphaſis muſt be reſtrained, in order to make it meet the approbation of ſound judgment and correct taſte. It will doubtleſs have different degrees of exertion, according to the greater or leſs degree of importance of the words upon which it operates; and there may be very properly ſome variety in the uſe of it: but its application is not arbitary, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending on the caprice of readers.</p>
               <p>As emphaſis often falls on words in different parts of the ſame ſentence, ſo it is frequently required to be continued, with a little variation, on two, and ſometimes more words together. The following ſentences exemplify both the parts of this poſition:
<q>If you ſeek to make one <hi>rich,</hi> ſtudy not to <hi>increaſe his ſtores,</hi> but to <hi>diminiſh his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <q>The Mexican figures, or picture-writing, repreſents <hi>things</hi> not <hi>words:</hi> they exhibit <hi>images to the eye,</hi> not <hi>ideas to the underſtanding.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="unknown:038017_0017_1010D31E8643D220"/>Some ſentences are ſo full and comprehenſive, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every word is emphatical: as
<q>Ye hills and dales ye rivers, woods, and plains!</q>
or, as that pathetic expoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation in the prophecy of Ezekiel, "Why will ye die!"</p>
               <p>Emphaſis, beſides its other offices, is the great regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lator of quantity. Though the quantity of our ſyllables is fixed, in words ſeparately pronounced, yet it is mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, when theſe words are ranged in ſentences; the long being changed into ſhort, the ſhort into long, according to the importance of the words with regard to meaning. Emphaſis alſo, in particular caſes, alters the ſeat of the accent. This is demonſtrable from the following exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. "He ſhall increaſe, but I ſhall decreaſe."
<q>There is a difference betwen giving and forgiving.</q>
                  <q>In this ſpecies of compoſition, plausibility is much more eſſential than probability.</q>
In theſe examples, the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaſis requires the accent to be placed on ſyllables, to which it does not commonly belong.</p>
               <p>In order to acquire the proper management of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaſis, the great rule to be given, is, that the reader ſtudy to attain a juſt conception of the force and ſpirit of the ſentiments which he is to pronounce. For to lay the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaſis with exact propriety, is a conſtant exerciſe of good ſenſe and attention. It is far from being an inconſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able attainment. It is one of the moſt deciſive trials of a true and juſt taſte; and muſt ariſe from feeling deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cately ourſelves, and from judging accurately of what is fitteſt to ſtrike the feeling of others.</p>
               <p>There is one error, againſt which it is particularly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to caution the learner; namely, that of multiplying emphatical words too much, and uſing the emphaſis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcriminately. It is only by a prudent reſerve and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:038017_0018_1010D32014080D40"/>
in the uſe of them, that we can give them any weight. If they recur too often; if a reader attemps to render every thing he expreſſes of high importance, by a multitude of ſtrong emphaſis, we ſoon learn to pay little regard to them. To crowd every ſentence with empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical words, is like crowding all the pages of a book with Italic characters; which, as to the effect, is juſt the ſame as to uſe no ſuch diſtinctions at all.</p>

               <head>SECTION VI. Tones.</head>
               <p>TONES are different both from emphaſis and pauſes; conſiſting in the notes or varia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ions of ſound which we employ, in the expreſſion of our ſentiments. Emphaſis affects particular words and phraſes, with a degree of tone or inflexion of voice; but tones, peculiarly ſo call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, affect ſentences, paragraphs, and ſometimes even the whole of a diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>To ſhow the uſe and neceſſity of tones, we need only obſerve, that the mind, in communicating its ideas, is in a conſtant ſtate of activity, emotion, or agitation, from the different effects which thoſe ideas produce in the ſpeaker. Now the end of ſuch communication be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, not merely to lay open the ideas, but alſo the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent feelings whieh they excite in him who utters them, there muſt be other ſigns than words, to manifeſt thoſe feelings; as words uttered in a monotonous manner, can repreſent only a ſimilar ſtate of mind, perfectly free from all activity or emotion. As the communication of theſe internal feelings was of much more conſequence in our ſocial intercourſe, than the mere conveyance of ideas, the Author of our being did not, as in that conveyance,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:038017_0019_1010D322F6AE2B40"/>
leave the invention of the language of emotion, to man; but impreſsed it himſelf upon our nature, in the ſame manner as he has done with regard to the reſt of the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal world; all of which expreſs their various feelings, by various tones. Ours, indeed, from the ſuperior rank that we hold, are in a high degree more comprehenſive; as there is not an act of the mind, an exertion of the fancy, or an emotion of the heart, which has not its pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar tone, or note of the voice, by which it is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed; and which is ſuited exactly to the degree of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal feeling. It is chiefly in the proper uſe of theſe tones, that the life, ſpirit, beauty, and harmony of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very conſiſt.</p>
               <p>The limits of this introduction, do not admit of exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, to illuſtrate the variety of tones belonging to the different paſſions and emotions. We ſhall, however, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect one, which is extracted from the beautiful lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of David over Saul and Jonathan, and which will, in ſome degree, elucidate what has been ſaid on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.
<q>The beauty of Iſrael is ſlain upon thy high places: how are the mighty fallen! Tell it not in Gath; pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh it not in the ſtreets of Aſkelon:</q>
left the daughters of the Philiſtines rejoice; leſt the daughters of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſed
<q>triumph. Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew nor rain upon you, nor fields of offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; for there the ſhields of the mighty was vilely caſt away; the ſhield of Saul, as though he had not been anointed with oyl!</q>
Th firſt of theſe diviſions ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes ſorrow and lamentation; therefore the note is low. The next contains a ſpirited command, and ſhould be pronounced much higher. The other ſentence, in which he makes a pathetic addreſs to the mountains where his friends had been ſlain, muſt be expreſsed in a note quite
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:038017_0020_1010C7174DBD74C0"/>
different from the two former; not ſo low as the firſt, nor ſo high as the ſecond, in a manly, firm, and yet plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive tone.</p>
               <p>The correct and natural language of the emotions, is not ſo difficult to be attained, as moſt readers ſeem to imagine. If we enter into the ſpirit of the author's ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, as well as into the meaning of his words, we ſhall not fail to deliver the words in properly varied tones. For there are few people, who ſpeak Engliſh without a provincial note, that have not an accurate uſe of tones, when they utter their ſentiments in earneſt diſcourſe. And the reaſon that they have not the ſame uſe of them, in reading aloud the ſentiment<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of others, may be traced to the very defective and erroneous method, in which the art of reading is taught; whereby all the various, natural, expreſſive tones of ſpeech, are ſuppreſſed; and a few arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial, unmeaning reading notes, are ſubſtituted for them.</p>
               <p>But when we recommend to readers, an attention to the tone and language of emotions, we muſt be underſtood to do it with proper limitation. Moderation is neceſſary in this point, as it is in other things. For when reading becomes ſtrictly imitative, it aſſumes a theatrical manner, and muſt be highly improper, as well as give offence to the hearers; becauſe it is inconſiſtent with that delicacy and modeſty, which are indiſpenſable on ſuch occaſions. The ſpeaker who delivers his own emotions, muſt be ſuppoſed to be more vivid and animated, than would be proper in the perſon who relates them at ſecond hand.</p>
               <p>We ſhall conclude this ſection with the following rule, for the tones that indicate the paſſions and emotions.
<q>In reading, let all your tones of expreſſion be borrowed from thoſe of common ſpeech, but, in ſome degree, more
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:038017_0021_1010D32A44BD93C8"/>
faintly characterized. Let thoſe tones which ſignify any diſagreeable paſſion of the mind, be ſtill more faint than thoſe which indicate agreeable emotions: and, on all occaſions, preſerve yourſelves ſo far from being affected with the ſubject, as to be able to proceed through it, with that eaſy and maſterly manner, which has its good effects in this, as well as in every other art.</q>

               <head>SECTION VII. Pauſes.</head>
               <p>PAUSES or reſts, in ſpeaking or reading, are a total ceſſation of the voice, during a perceptible, and, in many caſes, a meaſurable ſpace of time. Pauſes are equally neceſſary to the ſpeaker, and the hearer. To the ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that he may take breath, without which he cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed far in delivery; and that he may, by theſe tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary reſts, relieve the organs of ſpeech, which otherwiſe would be ſoon tired by continued action: to the hearer, that the ear alſo may be relieved form the fatigue, which it would otherwiſe endure from a continuity of ſound; and that the underſtanding may have ſufficient time to mark the diſtinction of ſentences, and their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral members.</p>
               <p>There are two kinds of pauſes; firſt, emphatical pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; and next, ſuch as mark the diſtinctions of ſenſe. An emphatical pauſe is generally made, <hi>after</hi> ſomething has been ſaid of peculiar moment, and on which we deſire to fix the hearer's attention. Sometimes, <hi>before</hi> ſuch a thing is ſaid, we uſher it in with a pauſe of this nature. Such pauſes have the ſame effect as a ſtrong empaſis; and are ſubject to the ſame rules; eſpecially to the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of not repeating them too frequently. For as they
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:038017_0022_1010D32D55629FE8"/>
excite uncommon attention, and of courſe raiſe expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, if the importance of the matter be not fully an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to ſuch expectation, they occaſion diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and diſguſt.</p>
               <p>But the moſt frequent and the principal uſe of pauſes, is, to mark the diviſions of the ſenſe, and at the ſame time to allow the reader to draw his breath; and the proper and delicate adjuſtment of ſuch pauſes, is one of the moſt nice and difficult articles of delivery. In all reading, the management of the breath requires a good deal of care, ſo as not to oblige us to divide words from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which have ſo intimate a connexion, that they ought to be pronounced with the ſame breath, and without the leaſt ſeparation. Many a ſentence is miſerably mangled, and the force of the emphaſis totally loſt, by diviſions being made in the wrong place. To avoid this, every one, while he is reading, ſhould be very careful to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide a full ſupply of breath, for what he is to utter. It is a great miſtake to imagine, that the breath muſt be drawn only at the end of a period, when the voice is allowed to fall. It may eaſily be gathered at the intervals of the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, when the voice is ſuſpended only for a moment; and, by this management, one may always have a ſufficient ſtock for carrying on the longeſt ſentence, without im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper interruptions.</p>
               <p>Pauſes in reading muſt generally be formed upon the manner in which we utter ourſelves in ordinary, ſenſible converſation; and not upon the ſtiff artificial manner, which is acquired from reading books according to the common punctuation. It will by no means be ſufficient to attend to the point uſed in printing; for theſe are far from marking all the pauſes, which ought to be made in
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:038017_0023_1010D32EDF970558"/>
reading. A mechanical attention to theſe reſting places, has perhaps been one cauſe of monotony, by leading the reader to a ſimilar tone at every ſtop, and a uniform ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence at every period. The primary uſe of points, is to aſſiſt the reader in diſcerning the grammatical conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and it is only as a ſecondary object, that they regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late his pronunciation. On this head, the following di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection may be of uſe:
<q>Though in reading great at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention ſhould be paid to the ſtops, yet a greater ſhould be given to the ſenſe; and their correſpondent times oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally lengthened beyond what is uſual in common ſpeech.</q>
               </p>
               <p>To render pauſes pleaſing and expreſſive, they muſt not only be made in the right place, but alſo accompanied with a proper tone of voice, by which the nature of theſe pauſes is intimated; much more than by the length of them, which can ſeldom be exactly meaſured. Sometimes it is only a ſlight and ſimple ſuſpenſion of voice that is proper; ſometimes a degree of cadence in the voice is required; and ſometimes that peculiar tone and cadence which denote the ſentence to be finiſhed. In all theſe caſes, we are to regulate ourſelves by attending to the manner in which Nature teaches us to ſpeak, when en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in real and earneſt diſcourſe with others. The following ſentence exemplifies the <hi>ſuſpending</hi> and the <hi>cloſing</hi> pauſes:
<q>Hope, the balm of life, ſooths us under every misfortune.</q>
The firſt and ſecond pauſes are accompanied by an inflection of voice, that gives the hearer an expectation of ſomething further to complete the ſenſe: the inflection attending the third pauſe, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies that the ſenſe is completed.</p>
               <p>The preceding example is an illuſtration of the ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending pauſe, in its ſimple ſtate: the following inſtance
<pb n="24"
                      facs="unknown:038017_0024_1010D331F1E60088"
                      rendition="simple:additions"/>
exhibits that pauſe with a degree of cadence in the voice:
<q>If content cannot remove the diſquietudes of mankind, it will at leaſt alleviate them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The ſuſpending pauſe is often, in the ſame ſentence, attended with both the riſing and the falling inflection of voice; as will be ſeen in this example:
<q>Moderate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe`, and habitual temperance´, ſtrengthen the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution<note n="*" place="bottom">The riſing inflection is denoted by the acute, the falling, by the grave accent.</note>.</q>
               </p>
               <p>As the ſuſpending pauſe may be thus attended with both the riſing and the falling inflection, it is the ſame with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the cloſing pauſe: it admits of both. The falling inflection generally accompanies it; but it is not unfre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently connected with the riſing inflection. Interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſentences, for inſtance, are often terminated in this manner: as, "Am I ungrateful´?" "Is he in earneſt´?"</p>
               <p>But where a ſentence is begun by an interrogative pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noun or adverb, it is commonly terminated by the falling inflection: as, "What has he gained by his folly`?" "Who will aſſiſt him`?" "Where is the meſſenger`?" "When did he arrive`?"</p>
               <p>Where two queſtions are united in one ſentence, and connected by the conjunction <hi>or,</hi> the firſt takes the riſing, the ſecond the falling inflection: as,
<q>Does his conduct ſupport diſcipline´, or deſtroy it`?</q>
               </p>
               <p>The riſing and falling inflections muſt not be confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with emphaſis. Though they may often coincide, they are, in their nature, perfectly diſtinct. Emphaſis ſometimes controls thoſe inflections.</p>
               <p>The regular application of the riſing and falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections, confers ſo much beauty on expreſſion, and is ſo

               <head>SECTION VIII. Manner of reading Verſe.</head>
               <p>WHEN we are reading verſe, there is a peculiar diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in making the pauſes juſtly. The difficulty ariſes from the melody of verſe, which dictates to the ear pauſes or reſts of its own; and to adjuſt and compound theſe properly with the pauſes of the ſenſe, ſo as neither to hurt the ear, nor offend the underſtanding, is ſo very nice a matter, that it is no wonder we ſo ſeldom meet with good readers of poetry. There are two kinds of pauſes that belong to the melody of verſe: one is, the pauſe at the end of the line; and the other, the caeſural pauſe in or near the middle of it. With regard to the pauſe at the end of the line, which marks that ſtrain or verſe to be finiſhed, rhyme renders this always ſenſible; and in ſome meaſure compels us to obſerve it in our pronunciation. In reſpect to blank verſe, we ought alſo to read it ſo as to make every line ſenſible to the ear: for, what is the uſe of melody, or for what end has the poet compoſed in verſe, if, in reading his lines, we ſuppreſs his numbers, by omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the final pauſe; and degrade them, by our pronun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation, into mere proſe? At the ſame time that we at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to this pauſe, every appearance of ſing-ſong and tone muſt be carefully guarded againſt. The cloſe of the line, where it makes no pauſe in the meaning, ought not to be marked by ſuch a tone as is uſed in finiſhing a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence; but, without either fall or elevation of the voice, it ſhould be denoted only by ſuch a ſlight ſuſpenſion of ſound, as may diſtinguiſh the paſſage from one line to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, without injuring the meaning.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27"
                      facs="unknown:038017_0027_1010D33D5AA749B8"
                      rendition="simple:additions"/>The other kind of melodious pauſe, is that which falls ſomewhere about the middle of the verſe, and divides it into two hemiſtichs; a pauſe, not ſo great as that which belongs to the cloſe of the line, but ſtill ſenſible to an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary ear. This, which is called the caeſural pauſe, may fall, in Engliſh heroic verſe, after the 4th, 5th, 6th, or 7th ſyllables in the line. Where the verſe is ſo conſtructed, that this caeſural pauſe coincides with the ſlighteſt pauſe or diviſion in the ſenſe, the line can be read eaſily; as in the two firſt verſes of Pope's Meſſiah:
<q>
                     <l>"Ye nymphs of Solyma´´! begin the ſong;</l>
                     <l>"To heav'nly themes´´, ſublimer ſtrains belong."</l>
                  </q>
But if it ſhould happen that words which have ſuch a ſtrict and intimate connexion, as not to bear even a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary ſeparation, are divided from one another by this caeſural pauſe, we then feel a ſort of ſtruggle between the ſenſe and the ſound, which renders it difficult to read ſuch lines harmoniouſly. The rule of proper pronunciation in ſuch caſes, is to regard only the pauſe which the ſenſe forms; and to read the line accordingly. The neglect of the caeſural pauſe may make the line ſound ſomewhat unharmoniouſly; but the effect would be much worſe, if the ſenſe were ſacrificed to the ſound. For inſtance, in the following line of Milton,
<q>
                     <l>—"What in me is dark,</l>
                     <l>"Illumine; what is low, raiſe and ſupport."</l>
                  </q>
the ſenſe clearly dictates the pauſe after <hi>illumine,</hi> at the end of the third ſyllable, which, in reading, ought to be made accordingly; though, if the melody only were to be regarded, <hi>illumine</hi> ſhould be connected with what follows, and the pauſe not made till the fourth or ſixth ſyllable. So
<pb n="28"
                      facs="unknown:038017_0028_1010D33F3AB45DB8"
                      rendition="simple:additions"/>
in the following line of Pope's Epiſtle to Dr. Arbuthnot,
<q>"I ſit, with ſad civility I read."</q>
The ear plainly points out the caeſural pauſe as falling af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>ſad,</hi> the fourth ſyllable. But it would be very bad reading to make any pauſe there, ſo as to ſeparate <hi>ſad</hi> and <hi>civility.</hi> The ſenſe admits of no other pauſe than after the ſecond ſyllable <hi>ſit,</hi> which therefore muſt be the only pauſe made in reading this part of the ſentence.</p>
               <p>There is another mode of dividing ſome verſes, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing what may be called demi-caeſuras, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire very ſlight pauſes; and which the reader ſhould manage with judgment, or he will be apt to fall into an affected ſing-ſong mode of pronouncing verſes of this kind. The following lines exemplify the demi-caeſura.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>"Warms´ in the ſun´´, refreſhes´ in the breeze,</l>
                  <l>"Glows´ in the ſtars´´, and bloſſoms´ in the trees;</l>
                  <l>"Lives´ through all life´´, extends´ through all extent,</l>
                  <l>"Spreads´ undivided´´, operates´ unſpent."</l>
               </q>
               <p>Before the concluſion of this introduction, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piler takes the liberty to recommend to thoſe teachers, who may favour his compilation, to exerciſe their pupils in diſcovering and explaining the emphatic words, and the proper tones and pauſes, of every portion aſſigned them to read, previouſly to their being called out to the performance. Theſe preparatory leſſons, in which they ſhould be regularly examined, will improve their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and taſte; prevent the practice of reading without attention to the ſubject; and eſtabliſh a habit of readily diſcovering the meaning, force, and beauty, of every ſen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tence they peruſe.</p>

                     <p>The houſe of feaſting too often becomes an avenue to the houſe of mourning. Short, to the licentious, is the interval between them.</p>

                     <p>Among all our corrupt paſſions, there is a ſtrong and intimate connexion. When any one of them is adopted into our family, it ſeldom quits us until it has fathered upon us all its kindred.</p>

                     <p>The man of true fortitude may be compared to the caſtle built on a rock, which defies the attacks of ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding waters: the man of a feeble and timourous ſpirit to a hut placed on the ſhore, which every wind ſhakes, and every wave overflows.</p>
                     <p>Nothing is ſo inconſiſtent with ſelf-poſſeſſion as violent anger. It overpowers reaſon; confounds our ideas; diſtorts the appearance, and blackens the appearance of every object. By the ſtorm which it raiſes within, and by the miſchiefs which it occaſions without, it generally brings on the paſſionate and revengeful man, greater miſery than he can bring on the object of his reſentment.</p>
                     <p>The palace of virtue has, in all ages, been repreſented as placed on the ſummit of a hill; in the aſcent of which, labour is requiſite, and difficulties are to be ſurmounted; and where a conductor is needed, to direct our way, and to aid our ſteps.</p>
                     <p>In judging of others, let us always think the beſt, and employ the ſpirit of charity and candour. But in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ourſelves, we ought to be exact and ſevere.</p>
                     <p>Let him that deſires to ſee others happy, make haſte to give while his gift can be enjoyed; and remember, that every moment of delay, takes away ſomething from the value of his benefaction. And let him who propoſes his own happineſs reflect, that while he forms his purpoſe, the day rolls on, and "the night cometh when no man can work.</p>
                     <p>To ſenſual perſons, hardly any thing is what it appears to be: and what flatters moſt, is always fartheſt from the reality. There are voices which ſing around them; but

whoſe ſtrains allure to ruin. There is a banquet ſpread, where poiſon is in every diſh. There is a couch which invites to repoſe; but to ſlumber upon it, is death.</p>
                     <p>If we would judge whether a man is really happy, it is not ſolely to his houſes and lands, to his equipage and his retinue, we are to look. Unleſs we could ſee farther, and diſcern what joy, or what bitterneſs, his heart feels, we can pronounce nothing concerning him.</p>

                     <p>There is certainly no greater felicity, than to be able to look back on a life uſefully and virtuouſly employed; to trace our own progreſs in exiſtence, by ſuch tokens as excite neither ſhame nor ſorrow.

How little can the greateſt proſperity add to ſuch a ſtate? Will any future ſituation ever make us happy, if now, with ſo few cauſes of grief, we imagine ourſelves miſerable?

                     <p>When the love of unwarrantable pleaſures, and of vicious companions, is allowed to amuſe young perſons, to ingroſs their time, and to ſtir up their paſſions; the day of ruin,—let them take heed, and beware! the day of irrecoverable ruin, begins to draw nigh. Fortune is ſquandered; health is broken; friends are offended, affronted, eſtranged; aged parents, perhaps, ſent afflicted and mourning, to the duſt.</p>

Inſtead of producing tranquility, indolence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces a fretful reſtleſſneſs of mind; gives riſe to cravings which are never ſatisfied; nouriſhes a ſickly effeminate delicacy, which ſours and corrupts every pleaſure.</p>

                     <p>Socrates, though primarily attentive to the culture of his mind, was not negligent of his external appearance.

                     <p>Sir Philip Sidney, at the battle near Zutphen, was wounded by a muſket-ball, which broke the bone of his thigh.

                     <p>The love of praiſe ſhould be preſerved under proper ſubordination to the principle of duty.

                     <p>When we reflect on the many diſtreſſes which abound in human life; on the ſcanty proportion of happineſs which any man is here allowed to enjoy; on the ſmall difference which the diverſity of fortune makes on that ſcanty proportion; it is ſurpriſing, that envy ſhould ever have been a prevalent paſſion among men, much more that ſhould have prevailed among Chriſtians. Where ſo much is ſuffered in common, little room is left for envy. There is more occaſion for pity and ſympathy, and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to aſſiſt each other.</p>

If we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low any paſſion, even though it be eſteemed innocent, to acquire an abſolute aſcendant, our inward peace will be impaired.

                     <p>While the vain and the licentious are revelling in the midſt of extravagance and riot, how little do they think of thoſe ſcenes of ſore diſtreſs which are paſſing at that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment throughout the world; multitudes ſtruggling for a poor ſubſiſtence, to ſupport the wife and the children whom they love, and who look up to them with eager eyes for that bread which they can hardly procure; multitudes groaning under ſickneſs in deſolate cottages, untended and unmourned; many, apparently in a better ſituation of life, pining away in ſecret with concealed griefs; families weeping over the beloved friends whom they have loſt, or, in all the bitterneſs of anguiſh, bidding thoſe who are juſt expiring the laſt adieu.</p>

Familiariſe not yourſelves with it, in the ſlighteſt inſtances, without fear. Liſten with reverence to every reprehenſion of conſcience; and preſerve the moſt quick and accurate ſenſibility to right and wrong. If ever your moral impreſſions begin to decay, and your natural abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of guilt to leſſen, you have ground to dread that the ruin of virtue is faſt approaching.</p>
                     <p>By diſappointments and trials the violence of our paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions is tamed, and our minds are formed to ſobriety and reflection. In the varieties of life, occaſioned by the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſitudes of worldly fortune, we are inured to habits both of the active and the ſuffering virtues. How much ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we complain of the vanity of the world, facts plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhow, that if its vanity were leſs, it could not anſwer the purpoſe of ſalutary diſcipline. Unſatisfactory as it is, its pleaſures are ſtill too apt to corrupt our hearts. How fatal then muſt the conſequences have been, had it yielded us more complete enjoyment? If, with all its troubles, we are in danger of being too much attached to it, how entirely would it have ſeduced our affections, if no troubles had been mingled with its pleaſures?</p>
                     <p>In ſeaſons of diſtreſs or difficulty, to abandon ourſelves to dejection, carries no mark of a great or a worthy mind. Inſtead of ſinking under trouble, and declaring "that his ſoul is weary of life," it becomes a wiſe and a good man, in the evil day, with firmneſs to maintain his poſt; to bear up againſt the ſtorm; to have recourſe to thoſe advantages which, in the worſt of times, are always left to integrity and virtue; and never to give up the hope that better days may yet ariſe.</p>

And yet, how often have we ſeen all thoſe fair appearances unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily blaſted in the progreſs of life, merely through the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of looſe and corrupting pleaſures; and thoſe very perſons, who promiſed once to be bleſſings to the world, ſunk down, in the end, to be the burden and nuiſance of ſociety!</p>
                     <p>The moſt common propenſity of mankind, is, to ſtore futurity with whatever is agreeable to them; eſpecially in thoſe periods of life, when imagination is lively, and hope is ardent.

Alas! how deceitful do all theſe dreams of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs often prove!

                     <p>DIONYSIUS, the tyrant Sicily, was far from being happy, though he poſſeſſed great riches, and all the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures which wealth and power could procure. Damocles, one of his flatterers, deceived by theſe ſpecious appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of happineſs, took occaſion to compliment him on the extent of his power, his treaſures, and royal magnificence; and declared that no monarch had ever been greater or happier than Dionyſius. "Haſt thou a mind, Damocles," ſays the King, "to taſte this happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and to know, by experience, what the enjoyments are, of which thou haſt ſo high an idea?" Damocles, with joy, accepted the offer. The King ordered that a royal banquet ſhould be prepared, and a gilded ſofa, cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with rich embroidery, placed for his favourite. Side<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boards, loaded with gold and ſilver plate of immenſe value, were arranged in the apartment. Pages of extraordinary beauty were ordered to attend his table, and to obey his commands with the utmoſt readineſs, and the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found ſubmiſſion. Fragrant ointments, chaplets of flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and rich perfumes, were added to the entertainment. The table was loaded with the moſt exquiſite delicacies of every kind.

But in the midſt of all this happineſs, as he lay indulging himſelf in ſtate, he ſees let down from the ceiling, exactly over his head, a glittering ſword hung by a ſingle hair. The ſight of impending deſtruction put a ſpeedy end to his joy and revelling. The pomp of his attendance, the glitter of the carved plate, and the delicacy of the viands, ceaſe to afford him any pleaſure. He dreads to ſtretch forth his hand to the table. He throws off the garland of roſes. He haſtens to remove from his dangerous ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation; and earneſtly entreats the king to reſtore him to his former humble condition, having no deſire to enjoy any longer a happineſs ſo terrible.</p>
                     <p>By this device, Dionyſius intimated to Damocles, how miſerable he was in the midſt of all his treaſures; and in poſſeſſion of all the honours and enjoyments which royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty could beſtow.</p>

                     <p>IN the days of Joram, King of Iſrael, flouriſhed the prophet Eliſha. His character was ſo eminent, and his fame ſo widely ſpread, that Benhadad the King of Syria, though an idolater, ſent to conſult him, concerning the iſſue of a diſtemper which threatened his life. The meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger employed on this occaſion was Hazael, who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to have been one of the princes, or chief men, of the Syrian court. Charged with rich gifts from the king, he preſents himſelf before the prophet; and accoſts him in terms of the higheſt reſpect. During the conference which they held together, Eliſha fixed his eye ſtedfaſtly
<pb n="63"

on the countenance of Hazael; and diſcerning, by a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetic ſpirit, his future tyranny and cruelty, he could not contain himſelf from burſting into a flood of tears. When Hazael, in ſurpriſe, inquired into the cauſe of this ſudden emotion, the prophet plainly informed him of the crimes and barbarities, which he foreſaw that he would after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards commit. The ſoul of Hazael abhorred, at this time, the thoughts of cruelty. Uncorrupted, as yet, by ambition or greatneſs, his indignation roſe at being thought capable of ſuch ſavage actions, as the prophet had men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; and, with much warmth, he replies: "But what? is thy ſervant a dog, that he ſhould do this great thing?" Eliſha makes no return, but to point out a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable change, which was to take place in his condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; "The Lord hath ſhown me that thou ſhalt be king over Syria." In courſe of time, all that had been predicted came to paſs. Hazael aſcended the throne, and ambition took poſſeſſion of his heart. "He ſmote the children of Iſrael in all their coaſts. He oppreſſed them during all the days of king Jehoahaz:" and, from what is left on record of his actions, he plainly appears to have proved, what the prophet foreſaw him to be, a man of violence, cruelty, and blood.</p>
                     <p>In this paſſage of hiſtory, an object is preſented, which deſerves our ſerious attention.

                     <p>AHASUERUS, who is ſuppoſed to be the prince known among the Greek hiſtorians by the name of Artaxerxes, had advanced to the chief dignity in his kingdom, Haman, an Amalekite, who inherited all the ancient enmity of his race to the Jewiſh nation. He appears, from what is recorded of him, to have been a very wicked miniſter. Raiſed to greatneſs without merit, he employed his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſolely for the gratification of his paſſions. As the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours which he poſſeſſed were next to royal, his pride was every day fed with that ſervile homage, which is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to Aſiatic courts; and all the ſervants of the king proſtrated themſelves before him. In the midſt of this general adulation, one perſon only ſtooped not to Haman. This was Mordecai the Jew; who, knowing this Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alekite to be an enemy to the people of God, and, with virtuous indignation, deſpiſing that inſolence of proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with which he ſaw him lifted up, "bowed not, nor did him reverence." On this appearance of diſreſpect from Mordecai, Haman "was full of wrath: but he thought ſcorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone." Perſonal revenge was not ſufficient to ſatisfy him. So violent and black were his paſſions, that he reſolved to exterminate the whole nation to which Mordecai belonged. Abuſing, for this cruel purpoſe, the favour of his credulous ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, he obtained a decre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

ſhould be put to the ſword. Meanwhile, confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of ſucceſs, and blind to approaching ruin, he continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed exulting in his proſperity. Invited by Ahaſuerus to a royal banquet, which Eſther the queen had prepared, "he went forth that day joyful, and with a glad heart." But behold how ſlight an incident was ſufficient to poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon his joy! As he went forth, he ſaw Mordecai in the king's gate; and obſerved, that he ſtill refuſed to do him homage: "He ſtood not up, nor was moved for him;" although he well knew the formidable deſigns, which Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was preparing to execute. One private man, who deſpiſed his greatneſs, and diſdained ſubmiſſion, while a whole kingdom trembled before him; one ſpirit, which the utmoſt ſtretch of his power could neither ſubdue nor humble, blaſted his triumphs. His whole ſoul was ſhak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en with a ſtorm of paſſion. Wrath, pride, and deſire of revenge, roſe into fury. With difficulty he reſtrained himſelf in public; but as ſoon as he came to his own houſe, he was forced to diſcloſe the agony of his mind. He gathered together his friends and family, with Zereſh his wife. "He told them of the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and of all the things wherein the king had promoted him; and how he had advanced him above the princes and ſervants of the king. He ſaid, moreover, Yea, Eſther the queen ſuffered no man to come in with the king, to the banquet that ſhe had prepared, but myſelf; and to-morrow alſo am I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to her with the king." After all this preamble, what is the concluſion?—"Yet all this availeth me no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, ſo long as I ſee Mordecai the Jew ſitting at the king's gate."</p>

                     <p>AS Ortogrul of Baſra was one day wandering along the ſtreets of Bagdat, muſing on the varieties of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe which the ſhops offered to his view; and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the different occupations which buſied the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes on every ſide, he was awakened from the tranquili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of meditation, by a crowd that obſtruſted his paſſage.

                     <p>Ortogrul mingled with the attendants; and being ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to have ſome petition for the vizier, was permitted to enter.

Whatever na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has provided for the delight of ſenſe, is here ſpread forth to be enjoyed. What can mortals hope or imagine, which the maſter of this palace has not obtained? The diſhes of luxury cover his table; the voice of harmony lulls him in his bowers; he breathes the fragrance of the groves of Java, and ſleeps upon the down of the cygnets of Ganges. He ſpeaks, and his mandate is obeyed; he wiſhes, and his wiſh is gratified; all whom he ſees obey him, and all whom he hears flatter him. How different, Ortogrul, is thy condition, who art doomed to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual torments of unſatisfied deſire; and who haſt no amuſement in thy power, that can withhold thee from thy own reflections!

"Ortogrul," ſaid the old man, "I know thy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity; liſten to thy father; turn thine eye to the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite mountain." Ortogrul looked, and ſaw a torrent tumbling down the racks, roaring with the noiſe of thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and ſcattering its foam on the impending woods. "Now," ſaid his father, "behold the valley that lies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the hills." Ortogrul looked, and eſpied a little well, out of which iſſued a ſmall rivulet. "Tell me now," ſaid his father, "doſt thou wiſh for ſudden affluence, that may pour upon thee like the mountain-torrent; or for a ſlow and gradual increaſe, reſembling the rill gliding from the well? "Let me be quickly rich," ſaid Ortogrul; "let the golden ſtream be quick and violent." "Look round thee," ſaid his father, "once again." Ortogrul looked, and perceived the channel of the torrent dry and duſty; but following the rivulet from the well, he traced it to a wide lake, which the ſupply, ſlow and conſtant, kept always full. He awoke, and determined to grow rich, by ſilent profit, and perſevering induſtry.</p>
                     <p>Having ſold his patrimony, he engaged in merchandiſe; and in twenty years purchaſed lands, on which he raiſed a houſe, equal in ſumptuouſneſs to that of the vizier, to which he invited all the miniſters of Pleaſure, expecting to enjoy all the felicity which he had imagined riches able to afford. Leiſure ſoon made him weary of himſelf, and he longed to be perſuaded that he was great and happy. He was courteous and liberal; he gave all that approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him hopes of pleaſing him, and all who ſhould pleaſe

Ortogrul heard his flatterers without delight, becauſe he found himſelf unable to believe them. His own heart told him its frailties; his own underſtanding reproached him with its faults. "How long," ſaid he, with a deep ſigh, "have I been labouring in vain to amaſs wealth, which at laſt is uſeleſs! Let no man hereafter wiſh to be rich, who is already too wiſe to be flattered!"</p>

                     <p>She was carefully educated in the principles of the Reformation; and her wiſdom and virtue rendered her a ſhining example to her ſex. But it was her lot to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue only a ſhort period on this ſtage of being; for, in early life, ſhe fell a ſacrifice to the wild ambition of the Duke of Northumberland; who promoted a marriage between her and his ſon, Lord Guilford Dudley; and raiſed her to the throne of England, in oppoſition to the rights of Mary and Elizabeth. At the time of their marriage, ſhe was only about eighteen years of age, and her huſband was alſo very young: a ſeaſon of life very unequal to oppoſe the intereſted views of artful and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring men; who, inſtead of expoſing them to danger, ſhould have been the protectors of their innocence and youth.</p>

She had attained a knowledge of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and Greek languages, as well as of ſeveral modern tongues; had paſſed moſt of her time in an application to learning; and expreſſed a great indifference for other oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupations and amuſements uſual with her ſex and ſtation. Roger Aſcham, tutor to the Lady Elizabeth, having at one time paid her a viſit, found her employed in reading Plato, while the reſt of the family were engaged in a party of hunting in the park; and upon his admiring the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity of her choice, ſhe told him, that ſhe "received more pleaſure from that author, than the others could reap from all their ſport and gaiety."—Her heart, replete with this love of literature and ſerious ſtudies, and with ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs towards her huſband, who was deſerving of her affection, had never opened itſelf to the flattering allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ambition; and the information of her advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the throne was by no means agreeable to her. She even refuſed to accept of the crown; pleaded the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable right of the two princeſſes; expreſſed her dread of the conſequences attending an enterpiſe ſo dangerous, not to ſay ſo criminal; and deſired to remain in that pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate ſtation in which ſhe was born. Overcome at laſt with the entreaties, rather than reaſons, of her father and father-in-law, and above all, of her huſband, ſhe ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to their will, and was prevailed on to relinquiſh her

own judgment. But this honour was of very ſhort con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance. The nation declared for Queen Mary; and the Lady Jane, after wearing the vain pageantry of a crown during ten days, returned to a private life, with much more ſatisfaction than ſhe felt when the royalty was ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to her.</p>
                     <p>Queen Mary, who appears to have been incapable of generoſity or clemency, determined to remove every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, from whom the leaſt danger could be apprehended. Warning was, therefore, given the Lady Jane to prepare for death; a doom which ſhe had expected, and which the innocence of her life, as well as the misfortunes to which ſhe had been expoſed, rendered no unwelcome news to her. The Queen's bigotted zeal, under colour of tender mercy to the priſoner's ſoul, induced her to ſend prieſts, who moleſted her with perpetual diſputation; and even a reprieve of three days was granted her, in hopes that ſhe would be perſuaded, during that time, to pay, by a timely converſion to Popery, ſome regard to her eternal welfare. The Lady Jane had preſence of mind, in thoſe melancholy circumſtances, not only to defend her religion by ſolid arguments, but alſo to write a letter to her ſiſter, in the Greek language; in which, beſides ſending her a copy of the Scriptures in that tongue, ſhe exhorted her to maintain, in every fortune, a like ſteady perſeverance. On the day of her execution, her huſband, Lord Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, deſired permiſſion to ſee her; but ſhe refuſed her conſent, and ſent him word, that the tenderneſs of their parting would overcome the fortitude of both; and would too much unbend their minds from that conſtancy, which their approaching end required of them.—Their ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhe ſaid, would be only for a moment; and they
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:038017_0072_1010D3CA827F8AA8"/>
would ſoon rejoin each other in a ſcene, where their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections would be for ever united; and where death, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and misfortunes, could no longer have acceſs to them, or diſturb their eternal felicity.</p>
                     <p>It had been intended to execute the Lady Jane and Lord Guilford together on the ſame ſcaffold, at Tower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill; but the council, dreading the compaſſion of the people for their youth, beauty, innocence, and noble birth, changed their orders, and gave directions that ſhe ſhould be beheaded within the verge of the Tower. She ſaw her huſband led to execution; and having given him from the window ſome token of her remembrance, ſhe waited with tranquility till her own appointed hour ſhould bring her to a like fate. She even ſaw his head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs body carried back in a cart; and found herſelf more confirmed by the reports, which ſhe heard of the conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of his end, than ſhaken by ſo tender and melancholy a ſpectacle. Sir John Gage, conſtable of the Tower, when he led her to execution, deſired her to beſtow on him ſome ſmall preſent, which he might keep as a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual memorial of her. She gave him her table-book, in which ſhe had juſt written three ſentences, on ſeeing her huſband's dead body; one in Greek, another in Latin, a third in Engliſh. The purport of them was, "that human juſtice was againſt his body, but the Divine Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy would be favourable to his ſoul: and that if her fault deſerved puniſhment, her youth, at leaſt, and her impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, were worthy of excuſe; and that God and poſterity, ſhe truſted, would ſhow her favour." On the ſcaffold, ſhe made a ſpeech to the bye-ſtanders, in which the mildneſs of her diſpoſition led her to take the blame entirely on herſelf, without uttering one complaint
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:038017_0073_1010D3CC329FFDD0"/>
againſt the ſeverity with which ſhe had been treated. She ſaid, that her offence was, not having laid her hand upon the crown, but not rejecting it with ſufficient con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy: that ſhe had leſs erred through ambition than through reverence to her parents, whom ſhe had been taught to reſpect and obey: that ſhe willingly received death, as the only ſatisfaction which ſhe could now make to the injured ſtate; and though her infringement of the laws had been conſtrained, ſhe would ſhew, by her volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary ſubmiſſion to their ſentence, that ſhe was deſirous to atone for that diſobedience, into which too much filial piety had betrayed her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that ſhe had juſtly deſerved this puniſhment for being made the inſtrument, though the unwilling inſtrument, of the ambition of others: and that the ſtory of her life, ſhe hoped, might at leaſt be uſeful, by proving that innocence excuſes not great miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeds, if they tend any way to the deſtruction of the commonwealth.—After uttering theſe words, ſhe cauſed herſelf to be diſrobed by her women, and with a ſteady, ſerene countenance ſubmitted herſelf to the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner.</p>

benevolence, and diſpoſe it for contemplation, I was wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering in a beautiful and romantic country, till curioſity began to give way to wearineſs; and I ſat down on the fragment of a rock overgrown with moſs; where the ruſtling of the falling leaves, the daſhing of waters, and the hum of the diſtant city, ſoothed my mind into the moſt perfect tranquility; and ſleep inſenſibly ſtole upon me, as I was indulging the agreeable reveries, which the objects around me naturally inſpired.</p>
                     <p>I immediately found myſelf in a vaſt extended plain, in the middle of which aroſe a mountain higher than I had before any conception of. It was covered with a multitude of people, chiefly youth; many of whom preſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forwards with the livelieſt expreſſions of ardour in their countenance, though the way was in many places ſteep and difficult. I obſerved, that thoſe who had but juſt begun to climb the hill, thought themſelves not far from the top; but as they proceeded, new hills were continually riſing to their view; and the ſummit of the higheſt they could before diſcern ſeemed but the foot of another, till the mountain at length appeared to loſe it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the clouds. As I was gazing on theſe things with aſtoniſhment, a friendly inſtructor ſuddenly appeared: "The mountain before thee," ſaid he, "is the Hill of Science. On the top is the temple of Truth, whoſe head is above the clouds, and a veil of pure light covers her face. Obſerve the progreſs of her votaries; be ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and attentive."</p>
                     <p>After I had noticed a variety of objects, I turned my eye towards the multitudes who were climbing the ſteep aſcent; and obſerved amongſt them a youth of a lively look, a piercing eye, and ſomething fiery and irregular

in all his motions. His name was Genius. He dart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed like an eagle up to the mountain; and left his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions gazing after him with envy and admiration: but his progreſs was unequal, and interrupted by a thouſand caprices. When Pleaſure warbled in the valley, he min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled in her train. When Pride beckoned towards the precipice, he ventured to the tottering edge. He delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in devious and untried paths; and made ſo many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions from the road, that his feebler companions often outſtripped him. I obſerved that the Muſes beheld him with partiality; but Truth often frowned, and turned aſide her face. While Genius was thus waſting his ſtrength in eccentric flights; I ſaw a perſon of a very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent appearance, named Application. He crept along with a ſlow and unremitting pace; his eyes fixed on the top of the mountain, patiently removing every ſtone that obſtructed his way, till he ſaw moſt of thoſe below him, who had at firſt derided his ſlow and toilſome progreſs. Indeed, there were few who aſcended the hill with equal, and uninterrupted ſteadineſs; for beſide the difficulties of the way, they were continually ſolicited to turn aſide, by a numerous crowd of Appetites, Paſſions, and Pleaſures, whoſe importunity, when once complied with, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came leſs and leſs able to reſiſt: and though they often returned to the path, the aſperities of the road were more ſeverely felt; the hill appeared more ſteep and rugged; the fruits which were wholeſome and refreſhing, ſeemed harſh and ill-taſted; their ſight grew dim; and their feet tript at every little obſtruction.</p>
                     <p>I ſaw, with ſome ſurpriſe, that the Muſes, whoſe buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was to cheer and encourage thoſe who were toiling

up the aſcent, would often ſing in the bowers of Pleaſure, and accompany thoſe who were enticed away at the call of the Paſſions. They accompanied them, however, but a little way; and always forſook them when they loſt ſight of the hill. The tyrants then doubled their chains upon the unhappy captives; and led them away, without reſiſtance, to the cells of Ignorance, or the manſions of Miſery. Amongſt the innumerable ſeducers, who were endeavouring to draw away the votaries of Truth from the path of Science, there was one, ſo little formidable in her appearance, and ſo gentle and languid in her at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, that I ſhould ſcarcely have taken notice of her, but for the numbers ſhe had imperceptibly loaded with her chains. Indolence, (for ſo ſhe was called,) far from proceeding to open hoſtilities, did not attempt to turn their feet out of the path, but contented herſelf with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarding their progreſs; and the purpoſe ſhe could not force them to abandon, ſhe perſuaded them to delay. Her touch had a power like that of the torpedo, which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered the ſtrength of thoſe who came within its influence. Her unhappy captives ſtill turned their faces towards the temple, and always hoped to arrive there; but the ground ſeemed to ſlide from beneath their feet, and they found themſelves at the bottom, before they ſuſpected they had changed their place. The placid ſerenity, which at firſt appeared in their countenance, changed by degrees into a melancholy languor, which was tinged with deeper and deeper gloom, as they glided down the ſtream of Inſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificance; a dark and ſluggiſh water, which is curled by no breeze, and enlivened by no murmur, till it falls into a dead ſea, where ſtartled paſſengers are awakened by the ſhock, and the next moment buried in the gulph of Oblivion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="77" facs="unknown:038017_0077_1010D3D85ADCF7E8"/>Of all the unhappy deſerters from the paths of Science, none ſeemed leſs able to return than the followers of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolence. The captives of Appetite and Paſſion could often ſeize the moment when their tyrants were languid or aſleep, to eſcape from their enchantment; but the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of Indolence was conſtant and unremitted; and ſeldom reſiſted, till reſiſtance was in vain.</p>
                     <p>After contemplating theſe things, I turned my eyes towards the top of the mountain, where the air was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways pure and exhilirating, the path ſhaded with laurels and ever-greens, and the effulgence which beamed from the face of Science ſeemed to ſhed a glory round her vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries. Happy, ſaid I, are they who are permitted to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend the mountain!—But while I was pronouncing this exclamation with uncommon ardour, I ſaw, ſtanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide me, a form of diviner features, and a more benign radiance. "Happier," ſaid ſhe, "are they whom Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue conducts to the manſions of Content!" "What," ſaid I, "does Virtue then reſide in the vale?" "I am found," ſaid ſhe, "in the vale, and I illuminate the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. I cheer the cottager at his toil, and inſpire the ſage at his meditation. I mingle in the crowd of cities, and bleſs the hermit in his cell. I have a temple in every heart that owns my influence; and to him that wiſhes for me, I am already preſent. Science may raiſe thee to eminence, but I alone can guide thee to felicity!"— While Virtue was thus ſpeaking, I ſtretched out my arms towards her, with a vehemence which broke my ſlumber. The chill dews were falling around me, and the ſhades of evening ſtretched over the landſcape. I haſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed homeward; and reſigned the night to ſilence and meditation.</p>

                     <p>OBIDAH, the ſon of Abenſina, left the caravanſera early in the morning, and purſued his journey through the plains of Indoſtan. He was freſh and vigorous with reſt; he was animated with hope; he was incited by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire; he walked ſwiftly forward over the vallies, and ſaw the hills gradually riſing before him. As he paſſed along, his ears were delighted with the morning ſong of the bird of paradiſe; he was fanned by the laſt flutters of the ſinking breeze, and ſprinkled with dew by groves of ſpices. He ſometimes contemplated the towering height of the oak, monarch of the hills; and ſometimes caught the gentle fragrance of the primroſe, eldeſt daughter of the ſpring: all his ſenſes were gratified, and all care was baniſhed from his heart.</p>
                     <p>Thus he went on, till the ſun approached his meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, and the increaſing heat preyed upon his ſtrength; he then looked round about him for ſome more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious path. He ſaw, on his right hand, a grove that ſeemed to wave its ſhades as a ſign of invitation; he entered it, and found the coolneſs and verdure ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtably pleaſant. He did not, however, forget whither he was travelling; but found a narrow way bordered with flowers, which appeared to have the ſame direction with the main road; and was pleaſed, that, by this happy experiment, he had found means to unite pleaſure with buſineſs, and to gain the rewards of diligence without ſuffering its fatigues. He, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſtill continued to walk for a time, without the leaſt remiſſion of his ardour, except that he was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:038017_0079_1010D3DE850D03B8"/>
tempted to ſtop by the muſic of the birds, which the heat had aſſembled in the ſhade; and ſometimes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſed himſelf with plucking the flowers that covered the banks on either ſide, or the fruits that hung upon the branches. At laſt, the green path began to decline from its firſt tendency, and to wind among hills and thickets, cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with fountains, and murmuring with water-falls. Here Obidah pauſed for a time, and began to conſider whether it were longer ſafe to forſake the known and common track; but remembering that the heat was now in its greateſt violence, and that the plain was duſty and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>even, he reſolved to purſue the new path, which he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed only to make a few meanders, in compliance with the varieties of the ground, and to end at laſt in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon road.</p>
                     <p>Having thus calmed his ſolicitude, he renewed his pace, though he ſuſpected that he was not gaining ground. This uneaſineſs of his mind inclined him to lay hold on every new object, and give way to every ſenſation that might ſooth or divert him. He liſtened to every echo; he mounted every hill for a freſh proſpect; he turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide to every caſcade; and pleaſed himſelf with tracing the courſe of a gentle river that rolled among the trees, and watered a large region with innumerable circumvolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. In theſe amuſements, the hours paſſed away unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted; his deviations had perplexed his memory, and he knew not towards what point to travel. He ſtood penſive and confuſed, afraid to go forward leſt he ſhould go wrong, yet conſcious that the time of loitering was now paſt. While he was thus tortured with uncertainty, the ſky was overſpread with clouds; the day vaniſhed from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him; and a ſudden tempeſt gathered round his head.
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:038017_0080_1010D3E19788B438"/>
He was now rouſed by his danger to a quick and painful remembrance of his folly; he now ſaw how happineſs is loſt when eaſe is conſulted; he lamented the unmanly impatience that prompted him to ſeek ſhelter in the grove; and deſpiſed the petty curioſity that led him on from trifle to trifle. While he was thus reflecting, the air grew blacker, and a clap of thunder broke his meditation.</p>
                     <p>He now reſolved to do what yet remained in his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, to tread back the ground which he had paſſed, and try to find ſome iſſue where the wood might open into the plain. He proſtrated himſelf on the ground, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended his life to the Lord of Nature. He roſe with confidence and tranquility, and preſſed on with reſolution. The beaſts of the deſert were in motion, and on every hand were heard the mingled howls of rage and fear, and ravage and expiration. All the horrors of darkneſs and ſolitude ſurrounded him: the winds roared in the woods: and the torrents tumbled from the hills.</p>
                     <p>Thus forlorn and diſtreſſed, he wandered through the wild, without knowing whither he was going, or whether he was every moment drawing nearer to ſafety or to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. At length, not fear, but labour began to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come him; his breath grew ſhort, and his knees trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled; and he was on the point of lying down in reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his fate, when he beheld, through the brambles, the glimmer of a taper. He advanced towards the light; and finding that it proceeded from the cottage of a her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, he called humbly at the door, and obtained admiſſion.

                     <p>"Son, ſaid the hermit, "let the errors and follies, the dangers and eſcape of this day, ſink deep into thy heart. Remember, my ſon, that human life is the journey of a day. We riſe in the morning of youth, full of vigour and full of expectation; we ſet forward with ſpirit and hope, with gaiety and with diligence, and travel on a while in the direct road of piety towards the manſions of reſt. In a ſhort time, we remit our fervour, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to find ſome mitigation of our duty, and ſome more eaſy means of obtaining the ſame end. We then relax our vigour, and reſolve no longer to be terrified with crimes at a diſtance; but rely upon our own conſtancy, and venture to approach what we reſolve never to touch. We thus enter the bowers of eaſe, and repoſe in the ſhades of ſecurity. Here the heart ſoftens, and vigilance ſubſides; we are then willing to enquire whether ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther advance cannot be made, and whether we may not, at leaſt, turn our eyes upon the gardens of pleaſure. We approach them with ſcruple and heſitation; we enter them, but enter timorous and trembling; and always hope to paſs through them without loſing the road of virtue, which, for a while, we keep in our ſight, and to which we purpoſe to return. But temptation ſucceeds tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and one compliance prepares us for another; we in time loſe the happineſs of innocence, and ſolace our

diſquiet with ſenſual gratifications. By degrees, we let fall the remembrance of our original intention, and quit the only adequate object of rational deſire. We entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle ourſelves in buſineſs, immerge ourſelves in luxury, and rove through the labyrinths of inconſtancy; till the darkneſs of old age begins to invade us, and diſeaſe and anxiety obſtruct our way. We then look back upon our lives with horror, with ſorrow, with repentance; and wiſh, but too often vainly wiſh, that we had not forſaken the ways of virtue. Happy are they, my ſon, who ſhall learn from thy example, not to deſpair; but ſhall remember, that, though the day is paſt, and their ſtrength is waſted, there yet remains one effort to be made: that reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is never hopeleſs, nor ſincere endeavours ever un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſiſted: that the wanderer may at length return after all his errors; and that he who implores ſtrength and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage from above, ſhall find danger and difficulty give way before him. Go now, my ſon, to thy repoſe; commit thyſelf to the care of Omnipotence; and when the morning calls again to toil, begin anew thy journey and thy life."</p>

                     <p>I CONSIDER a human ſoul, without education, like marble in the quarry; which ſhows none of its inherent beauties, until the ſkill of the poliſher fetches out the colours, makes the ſurface ſhine, and diſcovers every or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namental cloud, ſpot, and vein, that runs through the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of it. Education, after the ſame manner, when it works upon a noble mind, draws out to view every latent virtue and perfection, which, without ſuch helps, are never able to make their appearance.</p>
                     <p>If my reader will give me leave to change the alluſion ſo ſoon upon him, I ſhall make uſe of the ſame inſtance to illuſtrate the force of education, which Ariſtotle has brought to explain his doctrine of ſubſtantial forms, when he tells us, that a ſtatue lies hid in a block of marble; and that the art of the ſtatuary only clears away the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous matter, and removes the rubbiſh. The figure is in the ſtone, and the ſculptor only finds it. What ſculp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is to a block of marble, education is to a human ſoul. The philoſopher, the ſaint, or the hero, the wiſe, the good, or the great man, very often lies hid and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed in a plebeian, which a proper education might have diſinterred, and have brought to light. I am therefore

much delighted with reading the accounts of ſavage na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and with contemplating thoſe virtues which are wild and uncultivated: to ſee courage exerting itſelf in fierceneſs, reſolution in obſtinacy, wiſdom in cunning, patience in ſullenneſs and deſpair.</p>
                     <p>Men's paſſions operate variouſly, and appear in differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent kinds of actions, according as they are more or leſs rectified and ſwayed by reaſon. When one hears of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes, who, upon the death of their maſters, or upon changing their ſervice, hang themſelves upon the next tree, as it ſometimes happens in our American planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, who can forbear admiring their fidelity, though it expreſſes itſelf in ſo dreadful a manner? What might not that ſavage greatneſs of ſoul, which appears in theſe poor wretches on many occaſions, be raiſed to, were it rightly cultivated? And what colour of excuſe can there be, for the contempt with which we treat this part of our ſpecies; that we ſhould not put them upon the common foot of humanity; that we ſhould only ſet an inſignificant fine upon the man who murders them; nay, that we ſhould, as much as in us lies, cut them off from the proſpects of happineſs in another world, as well as in this; and deny them that which we look upon as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per means for attaining it?</p>
                     <p>It is therefore an unſpeakable bleſſing, to be born in thoſe parts of the world where wiſdom and knowledge flouriſh; though, it muſt be confeſſed, there are, even in theſe parts, ſeveral poor uninſtructed perſons, who are but little above the inhabitants of thoſe nations of which I have been here ſpeaking; as thoſe who have had the advantages of a more liberal education, riſe

                     <p>THERE is not a more pleaſing exerciſe of the mind, than gratitude. It is accompanied with ſuch inward ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, that the duty is ſufficiently rewarded by the performance. It is not, like the practice of many other virtues, difficult and painful, but attended with ſo much pleaſure, that were there no poſitive command which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined it, nor any recompenſe laid up for it hereafter, a generous mind would indulge in it, for the natural grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication which it affords.</p>
                     <p>If gratitude is due from man to man, how much more from man to his Maker?—The Supreme Being does not only confer upon us thoſe bounties which proceed more immediately from his hand, but even thoſe benefits which are conveyed to us by others. Every bleſſing we enjoy, by what means ſoever it may be derived upon us, is the gift of Him who is the great Author of good, and the Father of mercies.</p>

When allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to reign with full dominion, it is more than ſufficient to poiſon the few pleaſures which remain to man in his preſent ſtate. How much ſoever a perſon may ſuffer from injuſtice, he is always in hazard of ſuffering more from the proſecution of revenge.

                     <p>Thoſe evil ſpirits who inhabit the regions of miſery, are repreſented as delighting in revenge and cruelty. But all that is great and good in the univerſe is on the ſide of clemency and mercy. The almighty Ruler of the world, though for ages offended by the unrigheouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and inſulted by the impiety of men, is "long-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering and ſlow to anger." His Son, when he appeared in our nature, exhibited, both in his life, and his death, the moſt illuſtrious example of forgiveneſs which the world ever beheld. If we look into the hiſtory of mankind, we ſhall find that, in every age, they who have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected as worthy, or admired as great, have been diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed for this virtue. Revenge dwells in little minds. A noble and magnanimous ſpirit is always ſuperior to it. It ſuffers not from the injuries of men thoſe ſevere ſhocks which others feel. Collected within itſelf, it ſtands un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved by their impotent aſſaults; and with generous pity, rather than with anger, looks down on their unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy conduct.—It has been truly ſaid, that the greateſt man on earth can no ſooner commit an injury, than a good man can make himſelf greater, by forgiving it.</p>

We claim attentions to which we are not entitled. We are rigorous to offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as if we had never offended; unfeeling to diſtreſs, as if we knew not what it was to ſuffer. From thoſe airy regions of pride and folly, let us deſcend to our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per level. Let us ſurvey the natural equality on which Providence has placed man with man, and reflect on the infirmities common to all. If the reflection on natural equality and mutual offences, be inſufficient to prompt humanity, let us at leaſt remember what we are in the ſight of our Creator. Have we none of that forbearance to give one another, which we all ſo earneſtly intreat from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven?

The moſt inconſiderable point of intereſt, or honour, ſwells into a momentous object; and the ſlighteſt attack ſeems to threaten immediate ruin. But after paſſion or pride has ſubſided, we look around in vain for the mighty miſchiefs we dreaded. The fabric, which our diſturbed imagination had reared, totally diſappears.

                     <p>AS a ſuſpicious ſpirit is the ſource of many crimes and calamities in the world, ſo it is the ſpring of certain miſery to the perſon who indulges it. His friends will be few; and ſmall will be his comfort in thoſe whom he poſſeſſes. Believing others to be his enemies, he will of courſe make them ſuch. Let his caution be ever ſo great, the aſperity of his thoughts will often break out in his behaviour; and in return for ſuſpecting and hating, he will incur ſuſpicion and hatred. Beſides the external evils which he draws upon himſelf, ariſing from alienated friendſhip, broken confidence, and open enmity, the ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious temper itſelf is one of the worſt evils which any man can ſuffer. If "in all fear there is torment," how miſerable muſt be his ſtate who, by living in perpetual jealouſy, lives in perpetual dread? Looking upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be ſurrounded with ſpies, enemies, and deſigning men, he is a ſtranger to reliance and truſt. He knows

not to whom to open himſelf. He dreſſes his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance in forced ſmiles, while his heart throbs within from apprehenſions of ſecret treachery.

                     <p>So numerous and great are the evils ariſing from a ſuſpicious diſpoſition, that, of the two extremes, it is more eligible to expoſe ourſelves to occaſional diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage from thinking too well of others, than to ſuffer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual miſery by thinking always ill of them.

                     <p>THERE are many who have paſſed the age of youth and beauty; who have reſigned the pleaſures of that ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſeaſon; who begin to decline into the vale of years, impaired in their health, depreſſed in their fortunes, ſtript of their friends, their children, and perhaps ſtill more tender connexions. What reſource can this world af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford them? It preſents a dark and dreary waſte, through which there does not iſſue a ſingle ray of comfort. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry deluſive proſpect of ambition is now at an end; long experience of mankind, an experience very different from what the open and generous ſoul of youth had fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dreamt of has rendered the heart almoſt inacceſſible to new friendſhips. The principal ſources of activity are taken away, when thoſe for whom we labour are cut off from us; thoſe who animated, and thoſe who ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened all the toils of life. Where then can the ſoul find refuge, but in the boſom of Religion? There ſhe is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to thoſe proſpects of Providence and futurity, which alone can warm and fill the heart. I ſpeak here of ſuch as retain the feelings of humanity; whom miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes have ſoftened, and perhaps rendered more deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cately ſenſible: not of ſuch as poſſeſs that ſtupid inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility, which ſome are pleaſed to dignify with the name of Philoſophy.</p>
                     <p>It might therefore be expected, that thoſe philoſophers, who think they ſtand in no need themſelves of the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of religion to ſupport their virtue, and who never feel the want of its conſolations, would yet have the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity

to conſider the very different ſituation of the reſt of mankind; and not endeavour to deprive them of what habit, at leaſt, if they will not allow it to be nature, has made neceſſary to their morals, and to their happineſs. It might be expected, that humanity would prevent them from breaking into the laſt retreat of the unfortunate, who can no longer be objects of their envy or reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and tearing from them their only remaining com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. The attempt to ridicule religion may be agreeable to ſome, by relieving them from reſtraint upon their pleaſures; and may render others very miſerable, by making them doubt thoſe truths, in which they were moſt deeply intereſted; but it can convey real good and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs to no one individual.</p>

An abſolute perfection of underſtanding, is impoſſible: he makes the neareſt approaches to it, who has the ſenſe to diſcern, and the humility to acknowledge, its imperfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Modeſty always ſits gracefully upon youth; it covers a multitude of faults, and doubles the luſtre of every virtue which it ſeems to hide: the perfections of men being like thoſe flowers which appear more beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, when their leaves are a little contracted and folded up, than when they are full blown, and diſplay themſelves, without any reſerve, to the view.</p>

As to new notions, and new doctrines, of which this age is very fruitful, the time will come, when we ſhall have no pleaſure in them: nay, the time ſhall come, when they ſhall be exploded, and would have been forgotten, if they had not been preſerved in thoſe excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent books, which contain a confutation of them; like inſects preſerved for ages in amber, which otherwiſe would ſoon have returned to the common maſs of things.

and are to render account at the laſt. That portion of it which he has allotted us, is intended partly for the concerns of this world, partly for thoſe of the next. Let each of theſe occupy, in the diſtribution of our time, that ſpace which properly belongs to it. Let not the hours of hoſpitality and pleaſure interfere with the diſcharge of our neceſſary affairs; and let not what we call neceſſary affairs, encroach upon the time which is due to devotion. To every thing there is a ſeaſon, and a time for every purpoſe under the heaven. If we delay till to-morrow what ought to be done to-day, we overcharge the morrow with a burden which belongs not to it. We load the wheels of time, and prevent them from carrying us along ſmoothly. He who every morning plans the tranſactions of the day, and follows out that plan, carries on a thread which will guide him through the labyrinth of the moſt buſy life. The order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly arrangement of his time is like a ray of light, which darts itſelf through all his affairs. But, where no plan is laid, where the diſpoſal of time is ſurrendered merely to the chance of incidents, all things lie huddled together in one chaos, which admits neither of diſtribution nor review.</p>
                     <p>The firſt requiſite for introducing order into the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement of time, is to be impreſſed with a juſt ſenſe of its value. Let us conſider well how much depends upon it, and how faſt it flies away. The bulk of men are in nothing more capricious and inconſiſtent, than in their appreciation of time. When they think of it, as the meaſure of their continuance on earth, they highly prize it, and with the greateſt anxiety ſeek to lengthen it out. But when they view it in ſeparate parcels, they appear to hold it in contempt, and ſquander it with inconſiderate
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:038017_0095_1010D410B5D1D500"/>
profuſion. While they complain that life is ſhort, they are often wiſhing its different periods at an end. Covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of every other poſſeſſion, of time only they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal. They allow every idle man to be maſter of this property, and make every frivolous occupation welcome that can help them to conſume it. Among thoſe who are ſo careleſs of time, it is not to be expected that order ſhould be obſerved in its diſtribution. But, by this fatal neglect, how many materials of ſevere and laſting regret are they laying up in ſtore for themſelves! The time which they ſuffer to paſs away in the midſt of confuſion, bitter repentance ſeeks afterwards to recal. What was omitted to be done at its proper moment, ariſes to be the torment of ſome future ſeaſon. Manhood is diſgraced by the conſequences of neglected youth. Old age, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by cares that belonged to a former period, labours under a burden not its own. At the cloſe of life, the dying man beholds with anguiſh that his days are finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when his preparation for eternity is hardly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced. Such are the effects of a diſorderly waſte of time, through not attending to its value. Every thing in the life of ſuch perſons is miſplaced. Nothing is performed aright, from not being performed in due ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
                     <p>But he who is orderly in the diſtribution of his time, takes the proper method of eſcaping thoſe manifold evils. He is juſtly ſaid to redeem the time. By proper manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he prolongs it. He lives much in little ſpace; more in a few years than others do in many. He can live to God and his own ſoul, and at the ſame time attend to all the lawful intereſts of the preſent world. He looks back on the paſt, and provides for the future. He

catches and arreſts the hours as they fly. They are marked down for uſeful purpoſes, and their memory re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains. Whereas thoſe hours fleet by the man of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion like a ſhadow. His days and years are either blanks of which he has no remembrance, or they are filled up with ſuch a confuſed and irregular ſucceſſion of unfiniſhed tranſactions, that though he remembers he has been buſy, yet he can give no account of the buſineſs which has employed him.</p>

                     <p>THE moſt excellent and honourable character which can adorn a man and a Chriſtian, is acquired by reſiſting the torrent of vice, and adhering to the cauſe of God and virtue againſt a corrupted multitude. It will be found to hold in general, that all thoſe, who, in any of the great lines of life, have diſtinguiſhed themſelves for thinking profoundly, and acting nobly, have deſpiſed popular pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices; and departed, in ſeveral things, from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ways of the world. On no occaſion is this more requiſite for true honour, than where religion and morality are concerned. In times of prevailing licentiouſneſs, to maintain unblemiſhed virtue, and uncorrupted integrity; in a public or a private cauſe, to ſtand firm by what is fair and juſt, amidſt diſcouragements and oppoſition; deſpiſing groundleſs cenſure and reproach; diſdaining all compliance with public manners, when they are vicious and unlawful; and never aſhamed of the punctual

diſcharge of every duty towards God and man;—this is what ſhows true greatneſs of ſpirit, and will force ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation even from the degenerate multitude themſelves. "This is the man," (their conſcience will oblige them to acknowledge,) "whom we are unable to bend to mean condeſcenſions. We ſee it in vain either to flatter or to threaten him; he reſts on a principle within, which we cannot ſhake. To this man we may, on any occaſion, ſafely commit our cauſe. He is incapable of betraying his truſt, or deſerting his friend, or denying his faith."</p>
                     <p>It is, accordingly, this ſteady inflexible virtue, this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to principle, ſuperior to all cuſtom and opinion, which peculiarly marked the characters of thoſe in any age, who have ſhone with diſtinguiſhed luſtre; and has conſecrated their memory to all poſterity.

When Sodom could not furniſh ten righteous men to ſave it, Lot remained unſpotted amidſt the contagion.

                     <head>SECTION X. The Mortifications of Vice greater than thoſe of Virtue.</head>
                     <p>THOUGH no condition of human life is free from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs, yet it muſt be allowed, that the uneaſineſs belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a ſinful courſe, is far greater, than what attends a courſe of well-doing. If we are weary of the labours of virtue, we may be aſſured, that the world, whenever we try the exchange, will lay upon us a much heavier load. It is the outſide, only, of a licentious life, which is gay and ſmiling. Within, it conceals toil, and trouble, and deadly ſorrow. For vice poiſons human happineſs in the ſpring, by introducing diſorder into the heart. Thoſe paſſions which it ſeems to indulge, it only feeds with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect gratifications; and thereby ſtrengthens them for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <pb n="99" facs="unknown:038017_0099_1010D41C64FD6FC8"/>It is a great miſtake to imagine, that the pain of ſelf-denial is confined to virtue. He who follows the world, as much as he who follows Chriſt, muſt "take up his croſs;" and to him aſſuredly, it will prove a more op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive burden. Vice allows all our paſſions to range uncontrouled: and where each claims to be ſuperior, it is impoſſible to gratify all. The predominant deſire can only be indulged at the expenſe of its rival. No mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations which virtue exacts, are more ſevere than thoſe, which ambition impoſes upon the love of eaſe, pride up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on intereſt, and covetouſneſs upon vanity. Self-denial, therefore, belongs, in common, to vice and virtue; but with this remarkable difference, that the paſſions which virtue requires us to mortify, it tends to weaken; whereas, thoſe which vice obliges us to deny, it, at the ſame time, ſtrengthens. The one diminiſhes the pain of ſelf-deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, by moderating the demand of paſſion; the other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes it, by rendering thoſe demands imperious and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent. What diſtreſſes, that occur in the calm life of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, can be compared to thoſe tortures, which remorſe of conſcience inflicts on the wicked; to thoſe ſevere humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, ariſing from guilt combined with misfortunes, which ſink them to the duſt; to thoſe violent agitations of ſhame and diſappointment, which ſometimes drive them to the moſt fatal extremities, and make them abhor their exiſtence?

                        </gap>hat he calls the philoſopher's ſtone; and if it does not bring riches, it does the ſame thing by baniſhing the deſire of them. If it cannot remove the diſquietudes ariſing from a man's mind, body, or fortune, it makes him eaſy under them. It has indeed a kindly influence on the ſoul of man, in reſpect of every being to whom he ſtands related. It extinguiſhes all murmur, repining, and ingratitude, towards that Being who has allotted him his part to act in this world. It deſtroys all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate ambition, and every tendency to corruption, with regard to the community wherein he is placed. It gives ſweetneſs to his converſation, and a perpetual ſerenity to all his thoughts.</p>
                     <p>Among the many methods which might be made uſe of for acquiring this virtue, I ſhall mention only the two following. Firſt of all, a man ſhould always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how much he has more than he wants; and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, how much more unhappy he might be than he really is.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, a man ſhould always conſider how much he has more than he wants, I am wonderfully pleaſed with the reply which Ariſtippus made to one, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doled him upon the loſs of a farm: "Why," ſaid he, "I have three farms ſtill, and you have but one; ſo that I ought rather to be afflicted for you than you for me." On the contrary, fooliſh men are more apt to conſider what they have loſt, than what they poſſeſs;
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:038017_0101_1010C7201C468A68"/>
and to fix their eyes upon thoſe who are richer than themſelves, rather than on thoſe who are under greater difficulties. All the real pleaſures and conveniencies of life lie in a narrow compaſs; but it is the humour of mankind to be always looking forward; and ſtraining after one who has got the ſtart of them in wealth and honour. For this reaſon, as none can be properly called rich, who have not more than they want, there are few rich men in any of the politer nations, but among the middle ſort of people, who keep their wiſhes within their fortunes, and have more wealth than they know how to enjoy. Perſons of a higher rank live in a kind of ſplendid poverty; and are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually wanting, becauſe, inſtead of acquieſcing in the ſolid pleaſures of life, they endeavour to outvie one another in ſhadows and appearances. Men of ſenſe have at all times beheld, with a great deal of mirth, this ſily game that is playing over their heads; and, by contracting their deſires, enjoy all that ſecret ſatisfaction which others are always in queſt of. The truth is, this ridiculous chaſe after imaginary pleaſures, cannot be ſufficienly expoſed, as it is the great ſource of thoſe evils which generally undo a nation. Let a man's eſtate be what it may, he is a poor man, if he does not live within it; and naturally ſets himſelf to ſale to any one that can give him his price. When Pittacus, after the death of his brother, who had left him a good eſtate, was offered a great ſum of money by the king of Lydia, he thanked him for his kindneſs; but told him, he had already more by half than he knew what to do with. In ſhort, content is equivalent to
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:038017_0102_1010D41F84C252A0"/>
wealth, and luxury to poverty; or, to give the thought a more agreeable turn, "Content is natural wealth," ſays Socrates; to which I ſhall add, Luxury is artificial poverty. I ſhall therefore recommend to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of thoſe, who are always aiming at ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous and imaginary enjoyments, and who will not be at the trouble of contracting their deſires, an excellent ſaying of Bion the philoſopher, namely, "That no man has ſo much care, as he who endeavours after the moſt happineſs."</p>
                     <p>In the ſecond place, every one ought to reflect how much mure unhappy he might be, than he really is.— The former conſideration took in all thoſe, who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> ſufficiently provided with the means to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves eaſy; this regards ſuch as actually lie under ſome preſſure or misfortune. Theſe may receive great alleviation, from ſuch a compariſon as the unhappy perſon may make between himſelf and others; or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the misfortunes which he ſuffers, and greater miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes which might have befallen him.</p>
                     <p>I like the ſtory of the honeſt Dutchman, who, upon breaking his leg by a fall from the main-maſt, told the ſtanders by, it was a great mercy that it was not his neck. To which, ſince I am got into quotations, give me leave to add the ſaying of an old philoſopher, who, after having invited ſome of his friends to dine with him, was rufled by a perſon that came into the room in a paſſion, and threw down the table that ſtood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them: "Every one," ſays he, "has his calamity; and he is a happy man that has no greater than this." We find an inſtance to the ſame purpoſe, in the life of Doctor Hammond, written by Biſhop Fell. As this
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:038017_0103_1010D422DAFD7838"/>
good man was troubled with a complication of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempers, when he had got the gout upon him, he uſed to thank God that it was not the ſtone; and when he had the ſtone; that he had not both theſe diſtempers on him at the ſame time.</p>
                     <p>I cannot conclude this eſſay without obſerving, that there never was any ſyſtem beſides that of Chriſtianity, which could effectually produce in the mind of man the virtue I have been hitherto ſpeaking of. In order to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <p>THE wide circle of human ſociety is diverſified by an endleſs variety of characters, diſpoſitions, and paſſions. Uniformity is, in no reſpect, the genius of the world. Every man is marked by ſome peculiarity which diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes him from another: and no where can two indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals be found, who are exactly, and in all reſpects alike. Where ſo much diverſity obtains, it cannot but happen, that, in the intercourſe which men are obliged to maintain, their tempers ſhall often be ill adjuſted to that intercourſe: ſhall jar, and interfere with each other. Hence, in every ſtation, the higheſt as well as the loweſt, and in every condition of life, public, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, and domeſtic, occaſions of irritation frequently ariſe. We are provoked, ſometimes, by the folly and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of thoſe with whom we are connected; ſometimes, by their indifference or neglect; by the incivility of a friend, the haughtineſs of a ſuperior, or the inſolent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour of one in lower ſtation. Hardly a day paſſes, without ſomewhat or other occurring, which ſerves to ruffle the man of impatient ſpirit. Of courſe, ſuch a man lives in a continual ſtorm. He knows not what it is to enjoy a train of good humour. Servants, neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, friends, ſpouſe, and children, all, through the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrained violence of his temper, become ſources of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbance and vexation to him. In vain is affluence; in vain are health and proſperity. The leaſt trifle is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to diſcompoſe his mind, and poiſon his pleaſures. His very amuſements are mixed with turbulence and paſſion.</p>

                     <p>THE active mind of man ſeldom or never reſts ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with is preſent condition, how proſperous ſoever. Originally formed for a wider range of objects, for a higher ſphere of enjoyments, it finds itſelf, in every ſituation of fortune, ſtraitened and confined. Senſible of deficiency in its ſtate, it is ever ſending forth the fond deſire, the aſpiring wiſh, after ſomething beyond what is enjoyed at preſent. Hence, that reſtleſſneſs which prevails ſo generally among mankind. Hence, that diſguſt of pleaſures which they have tried; that paſſion for novelty; that ambition of riſing to ſome degree of eminence or felicity, of which they have formed to themſelves an indiſtinct idea. All which
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:038017_0109_1010D4338499B818"/>
may be conſidered as indications of a certain native, original greatneſs in the human ſoul, ſwelling beyond the limits of its preſent condition; and pointing at the higher objects for which it was made. Happy, if theſe latent remains of our primitive ſtate, ſerved to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect our wiſhes towards their proper deſtination, and to lead us into the path of true bliſs!</p>
                     <p>But in this dark and bewildered ſtate, the aſpiring ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of our nature unfortunately takes an oppoſite di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and feeds a very miſplaced ambition. The flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering appearances which here preſent themſelves to ſenſe; the diſtinctions which fortune confers; the advantages and pleaſures which we imagine the world to be capable of beſtowing, fill up the ultimate wiſh of moſt men. Theſe are the objects which engroſs their ſolitary muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and ſtimulate their active labours; which warm the breaſts of the young, animate the induſtry of the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle aged, and often keep alive the paſſions of the old, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the very cloſe of life.</p>
                     <p>Aſſuredly, there is nothing unlawful in our wiſhing to be freed from whatever is diſagreeable, and to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a fuller enjoyment of the comforts of life. But when theſe wiſhes are not tempered by reaſon, they are in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of precipitating us into much extravagance and folly. Deſires and wiſhes are the firſt ſprings of action. When they become exorbitant, the whole character is likely to be tainted. If we ſuffer our fancy to create to itſelf worlds of ideal happineſs, we ſhall diſcompoſe the peace and order of our minds, and foment many hurtful paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. Here, then, let moderation begin its reign: by bringing within reaſonable bounds the wiſhes that we
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:038017_0110_1010D436B14BA4E8"/>
form. As ſoon as they become extravagant, let us check them, by proper reflections on the fallacious nature of thoſe objects, which the world hangs out to allure deſire.</p>
                     <p>You have ſtrayed, my friends, from the road which conducts to felicity, you have diſhonoured the native dignity of your ſouls, in allowing your wiſhes to termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate on nothing higher than worldly ideas of greatneſs or happineſs. Your imagination roves in a land of ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows. Unreal forms deceive you. It is no more than a phantom, an illuſion of happineſs, which attracts your fond admiration; nay, an illuſion of happineſs, which often conceals much real miſery.</p>
                     <p>Do you imagine, that all are happy, who have attained to thoſe ſummits of diſtinction, towards which your wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es aſpire? Alas! how frequently has experience ſhown, that where roſes were ſuppoſed to bloom, nothing but briers and thorns grew? Reputation, beauty, riches, grandeur, nay, royalty itſelf, would, many a time, have been gladly exchanged by the poſſeſſors, for that more quiet and humble ſtation, with which you are now diſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied. With all that is ſplendid and ſhining in the world, it is decreed that there ſhould mix many deep ſhades of woe. On the elevated ſituations of fortune, the great calamities of life chiefly fall. There, the ſtorm ſpends its violence, and there, the thunder breaks; while, ſafe and unhurt, the inhabitant of the vale remains be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.—Retreat, then, from thoſe vain and pernicious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions of extravagant deſire. Satisfy yourſelves with what is rational and attainable. Train your minds to moderate views of human life, and human happineſs. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, and admire, the wiſdom of Agur's petition: "Remove far from me vanity and lies. Give me neither

                     <p>I WAS yeſterday, about ſun-ſet, walking in the open fields, till the night inſenſibly fell upon me. I at firſt amuſed myſelf with all the richneſs and variety of colours, which appeared in the weſtern parts of heaven. In pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion as they faded away and went out, ſeveral ſtars and planets appeared one after another, till the whole fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament was in a glow. The blueneſs of the ether was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly heightened and enlivened, by the ſeaſon of the year, and the rays of all thoſe luminaries that paſſed through it. The galaxy appeared in its moſt beautiful white. To complete the ſcene, the full-moon roſe, at length, in that clouded majeſty, which Mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>As I was ſurveying the moon walking in her bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and taking her progreſs among the conſtellations, a thought aroſe in me, which I b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>eve very often perplexes and diſturbs men of ſerious and contemplative natures. David himſelf fell into it in that reflection: "When I conſider the heavens, the work of thy fingers; the moon
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:038017_0112_1010D43B661F9520"/>
and the ſtars which thou haſt ordained; what is man that thou art mindful of him, and the ſon of man that thou regardeſt him!" In the ſame manner, when I conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that infinite hoſt of ſtars, or, to ſpeak more philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, of ſins, which were then ſhining upon me; with thoſe innumerable ſets of planets or worlds, which were moving round their reſpective ſuns; when I ſtill enlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the idea, and ſuppoſed another heaven of ſuns and worlds, riſing ſtill above this which we diſcovered; and theſe ſtill enlightened by a ſuperior firmament of lumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which are planted at ſo great a diſtance, that they may appear to the inhabitants of the former, as the ſtars do to us; in ſhort, while I purſued this thought, I could not but reflect on that little inſignificant figure, which I myſelf bore amidſt the immenſity of God's works.</p>
                     <p>Were the ſun, which enlightens this part of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with all the hoſt of planetary worlds that move a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, utterly extinguiſhed and annihilated, they would not be miſſed, more than a grain of ſand upon the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhore. The ſpace they poſſeſs is ſo exceedingly little in compariſon of the whole, it would ſcarcely make a blank in the creation. The chaſm would be imperceptible to an eye, that could take in the whole compaſs of nature, and paſs from one end of the creation to the other; as it is poſſible there may be ſuch a ſenſe in ourſelves hereafter, or in creatures which are at preſent more exalted than ourſelves. By the help of glaſſeſs, we ſee many ſtars, which we do not diſcover with our naked eyes; and the finer our teleſcopes are, the more ſtill are our diſcoveries. Huygenius carries this thought ſo far, that he does not think it impoſſible there may be ſtars, whoſe light has not yet travelled down to us, ſince their firſt creation.
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:038017_0113_1010D44072DC3F98"/>
There is no queſtion that the univerſe has certain bounds ſet to it; but when we conſider that it is the work of infinite Power, prompted by infinite Goodneſs, with an infinite ſpace to exert itſelf in, how can our imagination ſet any bounds to it?</p>
                     <p>To return, therefore, to my firſt thought, I could not but look upon myſelf with ſecret horror, as a being that was not worth the ſmalleſt regard of one who had ſo great a work under his care and ſuperintendency. I was afraid of being overlooked amidſt the immenſity of nature; and loſt among that infinite variety of creatures, which, in all probability, ſwarm through all theſe immeaſureable regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of matter.</p>
                     <p>In order to recover myſelf from this mortifying thought, I conſidered that it took its riſe from thoſe narrow con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, which we are apt to entertain of the Divine nature. We ourſelves cannot attend to many different objects at the ſame time. If we are careful to inſpect ſome things, we muſt of courſe neglect others. This imperfection which we obſerve in ourſelves is an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection that cleaves, in ſome degree, to creatures of the higheſt capacities, as they are creatures, that is beings of finite and limited natures. The preſence of every cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated being is confined to a certain meaſure of ſpace; and conſequently his obſervation is ſtinted to a certain number of objects. The ſphere in which we move, and act, and underſtand; is of a wider circumference to one crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, than another, according a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> we riſe one above another in the ſcale of exiſtence. But the wideſt of theſe our ſpheres has its circumference. When, therefore, we reflect on the Divine nature, we are ſo uſed and accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:038017_0114_1010C71D79038520"/>
to this imperfection in ourſelves, that we cannot forbear, in ſome meaſure, aſcribing it to HIM, in whom there is no ſhadow of imperfection. Our reaſon indeed aſſures us, that his attributes are infinite; but the poorneſs of our conceptions is ſuch, that it cannot forbear ſetting bounds to every thing it contemplates, till our reaſon comes again to our ſuccour, and throws down all thoſe little pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices, which riſe in us unawares, and are natural to the mind of man.</p>
                     <p>We ſhall therefore utterly extinguiſh this melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly thought, of our being overlooked by our Maker in the multiplicity of his works, and the infinity of thoſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects among which he ſeems to be inceſſantly employed, if we conſider, in the firſt place, that he is omnipreſent: and in the ſecond, that he is omniſcient.</p>
                     <p>If we conſider him in his omnipreſence, his being paſſes through, actuates, and ſupports, the whole frame of nature. His creation, and every part of it, is full of him. There is nothing he has made, that is either ſo diſtant, ſo little, or ſo inconſiderable, which he does not eſſentially inhabit. His ſubſtance is within the ſubſtance of every being, whether material or immaterial, and as intimately preſent to it, as that being is to itſelf. It would be an imperfection in him, were he able to move out of one place into another; or to withdraw himſelf from any thing he has created, or from any part of that ſpace which he diffuſed and ſpread abroad to infinity. In ſhort, to ſpeak of him in the language of the old philoſophers, he is a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whoſe centre is every where, and his circumference no where.</p>
                     <p>In the ſecond place, he is omniſcient as well as omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent. His omniſcience indeed neceſſarily and natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:038017_0115_1010D448BB6BE618"/>
flows from his omnipreſence. He cannot but be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of every motion that ariſes in the whole material world, which he thus eſſentially pervades; and of every thought that is ſtirring in the intellectual world, to every part of which he is thus intimately united. Were the ſoul ſeparate from the body, and with one glance of thought ſhould ſtart beyond the bounds of the creation; ſhould it, for millions of years, continue its progreſs through infinite ſpace, with the ſame activity, it would ſtill find itſelf within the embrace of its Creator, and encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed by the immenſity of the Godhead.</p>
                     <p>In this conſideration of the Almighty's omnipreſence and omniſcience, every uncomfortable thought vaniſhes. He cannot but regard every thing that has being, eſpecially ſuch of his creatures who fear they are not regarded by him. He is privy to all their thoughts, and to that anxiety of heart in particular, which is apt to trouble them on this occaſion: for, as it is impoſſible he ſhould overlook any of his creatures, ſo we may be confident that he regards, with an eye of mercy, thoſe who endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to recommend themſelves to his notice; and, in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned humility of hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>How then muſt I determine? Have I no intereſt at all? If I have not, I am ſtationed here to no purpoſe. But why no intereſt? Can I be contented with none but one ſeparate and detached! Is a ſocial intereſt, joined with others, ſuch an abſurdity as not to be admitted? The bee, the beaver, and the tribes of herding animals, are ſufficient to convince me, that the thing is ſomewhere at leaſt poſſible. How, then, am I aſſured that it is not equally true of man? Admit it; and what follows! If ſo, then honour and juſtice are my intereſt; then the
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:038017_0118_1010D44F0FF714F8"/>
whole train of moral virtues are my intereſt; without ſome portion of which, not even thieves can maintain ſociety.</p>
                     <p>But, farther ſtill—I ſtop not here—I purſue this ſocial intereſt as far as I can trace my ſeveral relations. I paſs from my own ſtock, my own neighbourhood, my own nation, to the whole race of mankind, as diſperſed through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the earth. Am I not related to them all, by the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual aids of commerce, by the general intercourſe of arts and letters, by that common nature which we all partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate!</p>
                     <p>Again—I muſt have food and cloathing. Without a proper genial warmth, I inſtantly periſh. Am I not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, in this view, to the very earth itſelf? to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant ſun, from whoſe beams I derive vigour? to that ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendous courſe and order of the infinite hoſt of heaven, by which the times and ſeaſons ever uniformly paſs on? Were this order once confounded, I could not probably ſurvive a moment; ſo abſolutely do I depend on this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon general welfare. What, then, have I to do, but to enlarge virtue into piety! Not only honour and juſtice, and what I owe to man, is my intereſt; but gratitude alſo, acquieſcence, reſignation, adoration, and all I owe to this great polity, and its great Governour our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Parent.</p>

                     <p>A SUSPICIOUS, uncharitable ſpirit is not only incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with all ſocial virtue and happineſs, but it is alſo,
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:038017_0119_1010D4538BFE9650"/>
unreaſonable and unjuſt. In order to form ſound opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons concerning characters and actions, two things are eſpecially requiſite, information and impartiality. But ſuch as are moſt forward to decide unfavourably, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly deſtitute of both. Inſtead of poſſeſſing, or even requiring, full information, the grounds on which they proceed are frequently the moſt ſlight and ſtivolous. A tale, perhaps, which the idle have invented, the inquiſitive have liſtened to, and the credulous have propagated; or a real incident which rumour, in carrying it along, has exaggerated and diſguiſed, ſupplies them with materials of confident aſſertion, and deciſive judgment. From an action they preſently look into the heart, and infer the motive. This ſuppoſed motive they conclude to be the ruling principle; and pronounce at once concerning the whole character.</p>
                     <p>Nothing can be more contrary both to equity and to ſound reaſon, than ſuch precipitate judgments. Any man who attends to what paſſes within himſelf, may eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcern what a complicated ſyſtem the human character is; and what a variety of circumſtances muſt be taken into the account, in order to eſtimate it truly. No ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle inſtance of conduct whatever, is ſufficient to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine it. As from one worthy action, it were credulity, not charity, to conclude a perſon to be free from all vice; ſo from one which is cenſurable, it is perfectly unjuſt to infer that the author of it is without conſcience, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out merit. If we knew all the attending circumſtances, it might appear in an excuſable light; nay, perhaps, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a commendable form. The motives of the actor may have been entirely different from thoſe which we aſcribe
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:038017_0120_1010D456DBA168F8"/>
to him; and where we ſuppoſe him impelled by bad de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, he may have been prompted by conſcience and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken principle. Admitting the action to have been in every view criminal, he may have been hurried into it through inadvertency and ſurpriſe. He may have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely repented; and the virtuous principle may have now regained its full vigour. Perhaps this was the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of frailty; the quarter on which he lay open to the incurſions of temptation; while the other avenues of his heart were firmly guarded by conſcience.</p>
                     <p>It is therefore evident, that no part of the government of temper deſerves attention more, than to keep our minds pure from uncharitable prejudices, and open to candour and humanity in judging of others.—The worſt conſequences, both to ourſelves and to ſociety, follow from the oppoſite ſpirit.</p>

                     <p>WE find man placed in a world, where he has by no means the diſpoſal of the events that happen. Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſometimes befall the worthieſt and the beſt, which it is not in their power to prevent, and where nothing is left them, but to acknowledge and to ſubmit to the high hand of Heaven. For ſuch viſitations of trial, many good and wiſe reaſons can be aſſigned, which the preſent ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject leads me not to diſcuſs. But though thoſe unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

calamities make a part, yet they make not the chief part, of the vexations and ſorrows that diſtreſs human life. A multitude of evils beſet us, for the ſource of which we muſt look to another quarter.—No ſooner has any thing in the health, or in the circumſtances of men, gone croſs to their wiſh, than they begin to talk of the unequal diſtribution of the good things of this life; they envy the condition of others; they repine at their own lot, and fret againſt the Ruler of the world.</p>
                     <p>Full of theſe ſentiments, one man pines under a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken conſtitution. But let us aſk him, whether he can, fairly and honeſtly, aſſign no cauſe for this but the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known decree of Heaven? Has he duly valued the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of health, and always obſerved the rules of virtue and ſobriety? Has he been moderate in his life, and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate in all his pleaſures? If now he is only paying the price of his former, perhaps his forgotten, indulgences, has he any title to complain, as if he were ſuffering un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly? Were we to ſurvey the chambers of ſickneſs and diſtreſs, we ſhould often find them peopled with the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tims of intemperance and ſenſuality, and with the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of vitious indolence and ſloth. Among the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands who languiſh there, we ſhould find the proportion of innocent ſufferers to be ſmall. We ſhould ſee faded youth, premature old age, and the proſpect of an untime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grave, to be the portion of multitudes who, in one way or other, have brought thoſe evils on themſelves; while yet theſe martyrs of vice and folly have the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to arraign the hard fate of man, and "to fret againſt the Lord."</p>
                     <p>But you, perhaps, complain of hardſhips of another kind, of the injuſtice of the world; of the poverty which
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:038017_0122_1010D45DC96ECF68"/>
you ſuffer, and the diſcouragements under which you labour; of the croſſes and diſappointments of which your life has been doomed to be full.—Before you give too much ſcope to your diſcontent, let me deſire you to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect impartially upon your paſt train of life. Have not ſloth, or pride, or ill temper, or ſinful paſſions, miſled you often from the path of ſound and wiſe conduct? Have you not been wanting to yourſelves in improving thoſe opportunities which Providence offered you, for better<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and advancing your ſtate? If you have choſen to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge your humour, or your taſte, in the gratifications of indolence or pleaſure, can you complain becauſe others, in preference to you, have obtained thoſe advantages which naturally belong to uſeful labours, and honourable purſuits? Have not the conſequences of ſome falſe ſteps, into which your paſſions, or your pleaſures, have betrayed you, purſued you through much of your life; tainted, perhaps, your characters, involved you in embarraſſments, or ſunk you into neglect?—It is an old ſaying, that every man is the artificer of his own fortune in the world. It is certain, that the world ſeldom turns wholly againſt a man, unleſs through his own fault. "Religion is," in general, "profitable unto all things." Virtue, diligence, and induſtry, joined with good temper and prudence, have ever been found the ſureſt road to proſperity; and where men fail of attaining it, their want of ſucceſs is far of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tener owing to their having deviated from that road, than to their having encountered inſuperable bars in it. Some, by being too artful, forfeit the reputation of probity. Some, by being too open, are accounted to fail in pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. Others, by being fickle and changeable, are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted by all.—The caſe commonly is, that men ſeek,
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:038017_0123_1010D45F9AB90C98"/>
to aſcribe their diſappointments to any cauſe, rather than to their own miſconduct; and when they can deviſe no other cauſe, they lay them to the charge of Providence. Their folly leads them into vices: their vices into mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes; and in their misfortunes they "murmur againſt Providence." They are doubly unjuſt towards their Creator. In their proſperity, they are apt to aſcribe their ſucceſs to their own diligence, rather than to his bleſſing; and in their adverſity, they impute their diſtreſſes to his providence, not to their own miſbehaviour. Whereas, the truth is the very reverſe of this. "Every good and perfect gift cometh from above;" and of evil and miſery, man is the author to himſelf.</p>
                     <p>When, from the condition of individuals, we look abroad to the public ſtate of the world, we meet with more proofs of the truth of this aſſertion. We ſee great ſocieties of men torn in pieces by inteſtine diſſenſions, tumults, and civil commotions. We ſee mighty armies going forth, in formidable array, againſt each other, to cover the earth with blood, and to fill the air with the cries of widows and orphans. Sad evils theſe are, to which this miſerable world is expoſed.—But are theſe evils, I beſeech you, to be imputed to God? Was it he who ſent forth ſlaughtering armies into the field, or who filled the peaceful cities with maſſacres and blood? Are theſe miſeries any other, than the bitter fruit of men's violent and diſorderly paſſions? Are they not clearly to be traced to the ambition and vices of princes, to the quarrels of the great, and the turbulence of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple?—Let us lay them entirely out of the account, in thinking of Providence; and let us think only of the "fooliſhneſs of man." Did man control his paſſions,
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:038017_0124_1010D4629A157D80"/>
and form his conduct according to the dictates of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, humanity, and virtue, the earth would no longer be deſolated by cruelty; and human ſocieties would live in order, harmony, and peace. In thoſe ſcenes of miſchief and violence which fill the world, let man behold, with ſhame, the picture of his vices, his ignorance, and folly. Let him be humbled by the mortifying view of his own perverſeneſs; but let not his "heart fret againſt the Lord."</p>

                     <p>I AM informed that certain Greek writers (philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, it ſeems, in the opinion of their countrymen) have advanced ſome very extraordinary poſitions relating to friendſhip; as, indeed, what ſubject is there, which theſe ſubtle geniuſſes have not tortured with their ſophiſtry?</p>
                     <p>The authors to whom I refer, diſſuade their diſciples from entering into any ſtrong attachments, as unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably creating ſupernumerary diſquietudes to thoſe who engage in them; and, as every man has more than ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to call forth his ſolicitude, in the courſe of his own affairs, it is a weakneſs, they contend, anxiouſly to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve himſelf in the concerns of others. They recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it alſo, in all connexions of this kind, to hold the hands of union extremely looſe; ſo as always to have it in one's power to ſtraiten or relax them, as circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and ſitu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>ions ſhall render moſt expedient. They add, as a capital article of their doctrine, that, "to live exempt from cares, is an eſſential ingredient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute

human happineſs: but an ingredient, however, which he, who voluntarily diſtreſſes himſelf with cares, in which he has no neceſſary and perſonal intereſt, muſt never hope to poſſeſs."</p>
                     <p>I have been told likewiſe, that there is another ſet of pretended philoſophers, of the ſame country, whoſe tenets, concerning this ſubject, are of a ſtill more illiberal and ungenerous caſt.</p>
                     <p>The propoſition they attempt to eſtabliſh, is, that "friendſhip is an affair of ſelf-intereſt entirely; and that the proper motive for engaging in it, is, not in order to gratify the kind and benevo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Accordingly they aſſert, that thoſe perſons are moſt diſpoſed to have recourſe to auxilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry alliances of this kind, who are leaſt qualified by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or fortune, to depend upon their own ſtrength and powers: the weaker ſex, fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Excellent and obliging ſages, theſe, undoubtedly! To ſtrike out the friendly affections from the moral world, would be like extinguiſhing the ſun in the natural: each of them being the ſource of the beſt and moſt grateful ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactions, that Heaven has conferred on the ſons of men. But I ſhould be glad to know, what the real value of this boaſted exemption from care, which they promiſe their diſciples, juſtly amounts to? an exemption flattering to ſelf-love, I confeſs; but which, upon many occurrences in human life, ſhould be rejected with the utmoſt diſdain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

for nothing, ſurely, can be more inconſiſtent with a well-poiſed and manly ſpirit, than to decline engaging in any laudable action, or to be diſcouraged from perſevering in it, by an apprehenſion of the trouble and ſolicitude, with which it may probably be attended. Virtue herſelf, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, ought to be totally renounced, if it be right to avoid every poſſible means that may be productive of uneaſineſs: for who, that is actuated by her principles, can obſerve the conduct of an oppoſite character, without being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with ſome degree of ſecret diſſatisfaction? Are not the juſt, the brave, and the good, neceſſarily expoſed to the diſagreeable emotions of diſlike and averſion, when they reſpectively meet with inſtances of fraud, of cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, or of villainy? It is an eſſential property of every well-conſtituted mind, to be affected with pain, or plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, according to the nature of thoſe moral appearances that preſent themſelves to obſervation.</p>

Extinguiſh all emotions of the heart, and what difference will remain, I do not ſay between man and brute, but between man and a mere <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Away then with thoſe auſtere philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, who repreſent virtue as hardening the ſoul againſt all the ſofter impreſſions of humanity! The fact, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, is much otherwiſe. A truly good man is, upon many occaſions, extremely ſuſceptible of tender ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and his heart expands with joy, or ſhrinks with
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:038017_0127_1010D46C0D894560"/>
ſorrow, as good or ill fortune accompanies his friend. Upon the whole, then, it may fairly be concluded, that, as in the caſe of virtue, ſo in that of friendſhip, thoſe pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſenſations, which may ſometimes be produced by the one, as well as by the other, are equally inſufficient grounds for excluding either of them from taking po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of our boſoms.</p>
                     <p>They who inſiſt that "utility is the firſt and prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing motive, which induces mankind to enter into parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular friendſhips," appear to me to diveſt the aſſociation of its moſt amiable and engaging principle. For, to a mind rightly diſpoſed, it is not ſo much the benefits re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, as the affectionate zeal from which they flow, that gives them their beſt and moſt valuable recommendation. It is ſo far indeed from being verified by fact, that a ſenſe of our wants is the original cauſe of forming theſe ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable alliances; that, on the contrary, it is obſervable, that none have been more diſtinguiſhed in their friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips than thoſe, whoſe power and opulence, but, above all, whoſe ſuperior virtue (a much firmer ſupport) have raiſed them above every neceſſity of having recourſe to the aſſiſtance of others.</p>
                     <p>The true diſtinction, then, in this queſtion is, that "although friendſhip is certainly productive of utility, yet utility is not the primary motive of friendſhip."— Thoſe ſelfiſh ſenſualiſts, therefore, who, lulled in the lap of luxury, preſume to maintain the reverſe, have ſurely no claim to attention; as they are neither qualified by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, nor experience, to be competent judges of the ſubject.</p>
                     <p>Is there a man upon the face of the earth, who would deliberately accept of all the wealth, and all the affluence

                     <p>I WAS yeſterday walking alone in one of my friend's woods; and loſt myſelf in it very agreeably, as I was running over, in my mind, the ſeveral arguments that eſtabliſh this great point; which is the baſis of morality, and the ſource of all the pleaſing hopes and ſecret joys, that can ariſe in the heart of a reaſonable creature. I conſidered thoſe ſeveral proofs drawn.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, from the nature of the ſoul itſelf, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly its immateriality; which, though not abſolutely neceſſary to the eternity of its duration, has, I think, been evinced to almoſt a demonſtration.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, from its paſſions and ſentiments; as, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, from its love of exiſtence; its horror of anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilation; and its hopes of immortality; with that ſecret ſatisfaction which it finds in the practice of virtue: and that uneaſineſs which follows upon the commiſſion of vice.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="129" facs="unknown:038017_0129_1010D4731F8997D8"/>Thirdly, from the nature of the Supreme Being, whoſe juſtice, goodneſs, wiſdom, and veracity, are all concerned in this point.</p>
                     <p>But among theſe, and other excellent arguments for the immortality of the ſoul, there is one drawn from the perpetual progreſs of the ſoul to its perfection, without a poſſibility of ever arriving at it; which is a hint that I do not remember to have ſeen opened and improved by others, who have written on this ſubject, though it ſeems to me to carry a very great weight with it. How can it enter into the thoughts of man, that the ſoul, which is capable of ſuch immenſe perfections, and of receiving new improvements to all eternity, ſhall fall away into nothing, almoſt as ſoon as it is created? Are ſuch abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities made for no purpoſe? A brute arrives at a point of perfection, that he can never paſs: in a few years he has all the endowments he is capable of; and were he to live ten thouſand more, would be the ſame thing he is at preſent. Where a human ſoul thus at a ſtand in her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments; were her faculties to be full blown, and incapable of farther enlargements; I could imagine ſhe might fall away inſenſibly, and drop at once into a ſtate of annihilation. But can we believe a thinking being, that is in a perpetual progreſs of improvements, and travelling on from perfection, to perfection, after having juſt looked abroad into the works of its Creator, and made a few diſcoveries of his infinite goodneſs, wiſdom, and power, muſt periſh at her firſt ſetting out, and in the very beginning of her inquiries?</p>
                     <p>A man, conſidered only in his preſent ſtate, ſeems ſent into the world merely to propagate his kind. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides himſelf with a ſucceſſor; and immediately quits his
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:038017_0130_1010D47514679648"/>
poſt to make room for him. He does not ſeem born to enjoy life, but to deliver it down to others. This is not ſurpriſing to conſider in animals, which are formed for our uſe, and can finiſh their buſineſs in a ſhort life. The ſilk-worm, after having ſpun her taſk, lays her eggs and dies. But a man cannot take in his full meaſure of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, has not time to ſubdue his paſſions, eſtabliſh his ſoul in virtue, and come up to the perfection of his nature, before he is hurried off the ſtage. Would an infinitely wiſe Being make ſuch glorious creatures for ſo mean a purpoſe? Can he delight in the production of ſuch abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive intelligences, ſuch ſhort-lived reaſonable beings? Would he give us talents that are not to be exerted? ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities that are never to be gratified? How can we find that wiſdom which ſhines through all his works, in the formation of man, without looking on this world as only a nurſery for the next; and without believing that the ſeveral generations of rational creatures, which riſe up and diſappear in ſuch quick ſucceſſions, are only to receive their firſt rudiments of exiſtence here, and afterwards to be tranſplanted into a more friendly climate, where they may ſpread and flouriſh to all eternity?</p>
                     <p>There is not, in my opinion, a more pleaſing and trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant conſideration in religion, than this of the perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al progreſs, which the ſoul makes towards the perfection of its nature, without ever arriving at a period in it. To look upon the ſoul as going on from ſtrength to ſtrength; to conſider that ſhe is to ſhine for ever with new acceſſions of glory, and brighten to all eternity; that ſhe will adding virtue to virtue and knowledge to knowledge; carries in it ſomething wonderfully agreeable to that ambition, which is natural to the mind
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:038017_0131_1010D47854C50828"/>
of man. Nay, it muſt be a proſpect pleaſing to God himſelf, to ſee his creation for ever beautifying in his eyes; and drawing nearer to him, by greater degrees of reſemblance.</p>
                     <p>Methinks this ſingle conſideration, of the progreſs of a finite ſpirit to perfection, will be ſufficient to extinguiſh all envy in inferior natures, and all contempt in ſuperor. That cherub, which now appears as a god to a human ſoul, knows very well, that the period will come about in eternity, when the human ſoul ſhall be as perfect as he himſelf now is: nay, when ſhe ſhall look down upon that degree of perfection as much as ſhe now falls ſhort of it. It is true, the higher nature ſtill advances, and by that means preſerves his diſtance and ſuperiority in the ſcale of being; but he knows that, how high ſoever the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is of which he ſtands poſſeſſed at preſent, the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior nature will at length mount up to it; and ſhine forth in the ſame degree of glory.</p>
                     <p>With what aſtoniſhment and veneration, may we look into our own ſouls, where there are ſuch hidden ſtores of virtue and knowledge, ſuch inexhauſted ſources of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection! We know not yet what we ſhall be; nor will it ever enter into the heart of man, to conceive the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that will be always in reſerve for him. The ſoul, conſidered with its Creator, is like one of thoſe mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical lines, that may draw nearer to another for all eternity, without a poſſibility of touching it: and can there be a thought ſo tranſporting, as to conſider our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in theſe perpetual approaches to HIM, who is the ſtandard not only of perfection, but of happineſs!</p>

                     <p>AMONG the great bleſſings and wonders of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, may be claſſed the regularities of times and ſeaſons. Immediately after the flood, the ſacred promiſe was made to man, that ſeed-time and harveſt, cold and heat, ſummer and winter, day and night, ſhould continue to the very end of all things. Accordingly, in obedience to that promiſe, the rotation is conſtantly preſenting us with ſome uſeful and agreeable alteration; and all the pleaſing novelty of life ariſes from theſe natural changes; nor are we leſs indebted to them for many of its ſolid com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts. It has been frequently the taſk of the moraliſt and poet, to mark, in poliſhed periods, the particular charms and conveniences of every change; and, indeed, ſuch diſcriminate obſervations upon natural variety, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be undelightful; ſince the bleſſing, which every month brings along with it, is a freſh inſtance of the wiſdom and bounty of that Providence, which regulates the glories of the year. We glow as we contemplate; we feel a propenſity to adore, whilſt we enjoy. In the time of ſeed-ſowing, it is the ſeaſon of <hi>confidence</hi>: the grain which the huſbandman truſts to the boſom of earth,
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:038017_0133_1010D47FAD4347C0"/>
ſhall, happly, yield its ſeven-fold rewards. Spring pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents us with a ſcene of lively <hi>expectation.</hi> That which was before ſown begins now to diſcover ſigns of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful vegetation. The labourer obſerves the change, and anticipates the harveſt: he watches the progreſs of nature, and ſmiles at her influence; while the man of contemplation walks forth with the evening, amidſt the fragrance of flowers, and promiſes of plenty; nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns to his cottage till darkneſs cloſes the ſcene upon his eye. Then cometh the harveſt, when the large wiſh is ſatisfied, and the granaries of nature are loaded with the means of life, even to a luxury of abundance. The powers of language are unequal to the deſcription of this happy ſeaſon. It is the carnival of nature: ſun and ſhade coolneſs and quietude, cheerfulneſs and melody, love and gratitude, unite to render every ſcene of ſummer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful.—The diviſion of light and darkneſs is one of kindeſt efforts of Omnipotent Wiſdom. Day and night yield us contrary bleſſings; and, at the ſame time, aſſiſt each other; by giving freſh luſtre to the delights of both. Amidſt the glare of day, and buſtle of life, how could we ſleep? Amidſt the gloom of darkneſs, how could we labour?</p>
                     <p>How wiſe, how benignant, then, is the proper divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion! The hours of light are adapted to activity; and thoſe of darkneſs to reſt. Ere the day is paſſed, exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe and nature prepare us for the pillow; and by the time that the morning returns, we are again able to meet it with a ſmile. Thus, every ſeaſon has a charm pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to itſelf; and every moment affords ſome intereſting innovation.</p>

                     <head>SECTION II. The Cataract of Niagara, in Canada, North America.</head>
                     <p>THIS amazing fall of water is made by the River St. Lawrence, in its paſſage from lake Erie into the lake On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tario. The St. Lawrence is one of the largeſt rivers in the world; and yet the whole of its waters is diſcharged in this place, by a fall of a hundred and fifty feet perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular. It is not eaſy to bring the imagination to correſpond to the greatneſs of the ſcene. A river extremely deep and rapid, and that ſerves to drain the waters of almoſt all North America into the Atlantic Ocean, is here pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed precipitately down a ledge of rocks, that riſes, like a wall, acroſs the whole bed of its ſtream. The river, a little above, is near three quarters of a mile broad; and the rocks, where it grows narrower, are four hundred yards over. Their direction is not ſtraight acroſs, but hollowing inwards like a horſe-ſhoe: ſo that the cataract, which bends to the ſhape of the obſtacle, rounding in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, preſents a kind of theatre the moſt tremendous in nature. Juſt in the middle of this circular wall of waters, a little iſland, that has braved the fury of the current, preſents one of its points, and divides the ſtream at top into two parts; but they unite again long before they reach the bottom. The noiſe of the fall is heard at the diſtance of ſeveral leagues; and the fury of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, at the termination of their fall, is inconceivable. The daſhing produces a miſt that riſes to the very clouds; and which forms a moſt beautiful rainbow, when the ſun ſhines. It will readily be ſuppoſed, that ſuch a cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ract entirely deſtroys the navigation of the ſtream; and

                     <p>OF all the ſubterraneous caverns now known, the grotto of Antiparos is the moſt remarkable, as well for its extent, as for the beauty of its ſparry incruſtations. This celebrated cavern was firſt explored by one Magni, an Italian traveller, about a hundred years ago, at Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paros, an inconſiderable iſland of the Archipelago. "Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been informed," ſays he, "by the natives of Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ros, that, in the little iſland of Antiparos, which lies about two miles from the former, a gigantic ſtatue was to be ſeen at the mouth of a cavern in that place, it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved that we (the French Conſul and himſelf) ſhould pay it a viſit. In purſuance of this reſolution, after we had landed on the iſland, and walked about four miles through the midſt of beautiful plains, and ſloping wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, we at length came to a little hill, on the ſide of which yawned a moſt horrid cavern, that by its gloom at firſt ſtruck us with terror, and almoſt repreſſed cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity. Recovering the firſt ſurpriſe, however, we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered boldly; and had not proceeded above twenty paces, when the ſuppoſed ſtatue of the giant preſented itſelf to our view. We quickly perceived, that what the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant natives had been terrified at as a giant, was nothing more than a ſparry concretion, formed by the water drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping from the roof of the cave, and by degrees harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into a figure, which their fears had formed into a
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:038017_0136_1010D488B9B05F20"/>
monſter. Incited by this extraordinary appearance, we were induced to proceed ſtill further, in queſt of new ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures in this ſubterranean abode. As we proceeded, new wonders offered themſelves; the ſpars, formed into trees and ſhrubs, preſented a kind of petrified grove; ſome white, ſome green; and all receding in due per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective. They ſtruck us with the more amazement, as we knew them to be mere productions of Nature, who, hitherto in ſolitude, had, in her playful moments, dreſſed the ſcene, as if for her own amuſement."</p>
                     <p>"We had as yet ſeen but a few of the wonders of the place; and we were introduced only into the portico of this amazing temple. In one corner of this half illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated receſs, there appeared an opening of about three feet wide, which ſeemed to lead to a place totally dark, and which one of the natives aſſured us contained nothing more than a reſervoir of water. Upon this information, we made an experiment, by throwing down ſome ſtones, which rumbling along the ſides of the deſcent for ſome time, the ſound ſeemed at laſt quaſhed in a bed of water. In order, however, to be more certain, we ſent in a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantine mariner, who, by the promiſe of a good reward, with a flambeau in his hand, ventured into this narrow aperture. After continuing within it for about a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an hour, he returned, bearing in his hand, ſome beautiful pieces of white ſpar, which art could neither equal nor imitate. Upon being informed by him that the place was full of theſe beautiful incruſtations, I ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured in once more with him, about fifty paces, anxiouſly and cautiouſly deſcending, by a ſteep and dangerous way. Finding, however, that we came to a precipice which led
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:038017_0137_1010D48A4A9993C8"/>
into a ſpacious amphitheatre, (if I may ſo call it) ſtill deeper than any other part, we returned, and being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided with a ladder, flambeau, and other things to expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite our deſcent, our whole company, man by man, ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured into the ſame opening; and deſcending one after another, we at laſt ſaw ourſelves all together in the moſt magnificent part of the cavern."</p>

                     <p>"OUR candles being now all lighted up, and the whole place completely illuminated, never could the eye be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented with a more glittering, or a more magnificent ſcene. The whole roof hung with ſolid iſicles, tranſparent as glaſs, yet ſolid as marble. The eye could ſcarcely reach the lofty and noble ceiling; the ſides were regularly formed with ſpars; and the whole preſented the idea of a magnificient theatre, illuminated with an immenſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of lights. The floor conſiſted of ſolid marble: and, in ſeveral places, magnificent columns, thrones, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, and other objects, appeared, as if nature had deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to mock the curioſities of art. Our voices, upon ſpeaking or ſinging, were redoubled to an aſtoniſhing loudneſs; and upon the firing of a gun, the noiſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verberations were almoſt deafening. In the midſt of this grand amphitheatre roſe a concretion of about fifteen feet high, that, in ſome meaſure, reſembled an altar; from which, taking the hint, we cauſed maſs to be celebrated there. The beautiful columns that ſhot up round the altar, appeared like candleſticks; and many other natural

                     <p>"Below even this ſpacious grotto there ſeemed another cavern; down which I ventured with my former mariner, and deſcended about fifty paces by means of a rope. I at laſt arrived at a ſmall ſpot of level ground, where the bottom appeared different from that of the amphitheatre, being compoſed of ſoft clay, yielding to the preſſure, and and in which I thruſt a ſtick to the depth of ſix feet. In this, however, as above, numbers of the moſt beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful cryſtals were formed; one of which, particularly, reſembled a table. Upon our egreſs from this amazing cavern, we perceived a Greek inſcription upon a rock at the mouth, but ſo obliterated by time, that we could not read it diſtinctly. It ſeemed to import that one Antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in the time of Alexander, had come hither; but whether he penetrated into the depths of the cavern, he does not think fit to inform us."

The walls were daſhed from their foundations; and no fewer than fifty-four cities, with an incredible number of villages, were either deſtroyed or greatly damaged. The city of Catanea, in particular, was utterly overthrown. A traveller, who was on his way thither, perceived, at the diſtance of ſome miles, a black cloud, like night, hanging over the place. The ſea, all of a ſudden, began to roar; Mount Aetna to ſend forth great ſpires of flame; and ſoon after a ſhock enſued, with a noiſe as if all the artillery in the world had been at once diſcharged. Our traveller, being obliged to alight inſtantly, felt himſelf raiſed a foot from the ground; and turning his eyes to the city, he with amazement ſaw nothing but a thick cloud of duſt in the air. The birds flew about aſtoniſhed; the ſun was darkened; the beaſts ran howling from the hills; and although the ſhock did not continue above three minutes, yet near nineteen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of the inhabitants of Sicily periſhed in the ruins.

The mountains roſe; and the rivers flowed. The ſun and moon began their courſe in the ſkies. Herbs and plants clothed the ground. The air, the earth, and the waters, were ſtored with their reſpective inhabitants. At laſt, man was made after the image of God.

                     <head>SECTION VII. On Charity.</head>
                     <p>CHARITY is the ſame with benevolence or love; and is the term uniformly employed in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to denote all the good affections which we ought to bear towards one another. It conſiſts not in ſpeculative ideas of general benevolence, floating in the head, and leaving the heart, as ſpeculations too often do, untouched and cold. Neither is it confined to that indolent good nature, which makes us reſt ſatisfied with being free from inveterate malice, or ill-will to our fellow-creatures, without prompting us to be of ſervice to any. True charity is an active principle. It is not properly a ſingle virtue; but a diſpoſition reſiding in the heart, as a fountain whence all the virtues of benignity, candour, forberance, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity, compaſſion, and liberality, flow, as ſo many native ſtreams. From general good-will to all, it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends its influence particularly to thoſe with whom we ſtand in neareſt connexion, and who are directly within the ſphere of our good offices. From the country or community to which we belong, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends to the ſmaller aſſociations of neighbourhood, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, and friends; and ſpreads itſelf over the whole circle of ſocial and domeſtic life. I mean not that it imports a promiſcuous undiſtinguiſhing affection, which gives every man an equal title to our love, Charity, if we ſhould endeavour to carry it ſo far, would be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered an impracticable virtue; and would reſolve it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into mere words, without affecting the heart. True charity attempts not to ſhut our eyes to the
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:038017_0142_1010D49B1A71E5C0"/>
diſtinction between good and bad men; nor to warm our hearts equally to thoſe who befriend, and thoſe who injure us. It reſerves our eſteem for good men, and our complacency for our friends. Towards our enemies it inſpires forgiveneſs, humanity, and a ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude for their welfare. It breaths univerſal candour, and liberality of ſentiment. It forms gentleneſs of temper, and dictates affability of manners. It prompts correſponding ſympathies with them who rejoice, and them who weep. It teaches us to ſlight and deſpiſe no man. Charity is the comforter of the afflicted, the protector of the oppreſſed, the reconciler of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, the interceſſor for offenders. It is faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the friend, public ſpirit in the magiſtrate, equity and patience in the judge, moderation in the ſovereign, and loyalty in the ſubject. In parents, it is a care and attention; in children, it is reverence and ſubmiſſion. In a word, it is the ſoul of ſocial life. It is the ſun that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livens and cheers the abodes of men. It is "like the dew of Hermon," ſays the Pſalmiſt, "and the dew that deſcendeth on the mountains of Zion, where the Lord commanded the bleſſing, even life for ever more."</p>

They are ſtrangers to thoſe complaints which flow from ſpleen, caprice, and all the fantaſtical diſtreſſes of a vitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted mind. While riotous indulgence enervates both the body and the mind, purity and virtue heighten all the powers of human fruition.</p>
                     <p>Feeble are all pleaſures in which the heart has no ſhare. The ſelfiſh gratifications of the bad, are both nar-now in their circle, and ſhort in their duration. But proſperity is redoubled to a good man, by his generous uſe of it. It is reflected back upon him from every one whom he makes happy. In the intercourſe of domeſtic affection, in the attachment of friends, the gratitude of dependents, the eſteem and good-will of all who know him, he ſees bleſſings multiplied round him, on every ſide. "When the ear heard me, then it bleſſed me; and when the eye ſaw me, it gave witneſs to me: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I delivered the poor that cried, the fatherleſs, and him that had none to help him. The bleſſing of him that was ready to periſh came upon me, and I cauſed the widow's heart to ſing with joy. I was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame: I was a father to the poor; and the cauſe which I knew not, I ſearched out." —Thus, while the righteous man flouriſhes like a tree planted by the rivers of water, he brings forth alſo his fruit in its ſeaſon: And that fruit he brings forth, not for himſelf alone. He flouriſhes, not like a tree in ſome ſolitary deſert, which ſcatters its bloſſoms to the wind, and communicates neither fruit nor ſhade to any living thing: but like a tree in the midſt of an inhabited country, which to ſome fantaſtical affords friendly ſhelter, to others,

                     <p>GREATNESS confers no exemption from the cares and ſorrows of life: its ſhare of them frequently bears a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy proportion to its exultation. This the monarch of Iſrael experienced. He ſought in piety, that peace which he could not find in empire; and alleviated the diſquietudes of ſtate, with the exerciſes of devotion. His invaluable Pſalms convey thoſe comforts to others, which they afforded to himſelf. Compoſed upon particular oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, yet deſigned for general uſe; delivered out as ſervices for Iſraelites under the Law, yet no leſs adapted to the circumſtances of Chriſtians under the Goſpel; they preſent religion to us in the moſt engaging dreſs; communicating truths which philoſophy could never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigate, in a ſtyle which poetry can never equal; while hiſtory is made the vehicle of prophecy, and creation lends all its charms to paint the glories of redemption. Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated alike to profit and to pleaſe, they inform the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, elevate the affections, and entertain the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genation. Indited under the influence of HIM, to whom all hearts are known, and all events foreknown, they ſuit mankind in all ſituations; grateful as the manna which deſcended from above, and conformed itſelf to every palate.</p>
                     <p>The faireſt productions of human wit, after a few peruſals, like gathered flowers, wither in our hands, and

loſe their fragrancy: but theſe unfading plants of para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe become, as we are accuſtomed to them, ſtill more and more beautiful; their bloom appears to be daily heighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; freſh odours are emitted, and new ſweets extract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from them.

                     <p>And now, could the Author flatter himſelf, that any one would take half the pleaſure in reading his work, which he has taken in writing it, he would not fear the loſs of his labour. The employment detached him from the buſtle and hurry of life, the din of politics, and the noiſe of folly. Vanity and vexation flew away for a ſeaſon; care and diſquietude came not near his dwelling. He aroſe, freſh as the morning, to his taſk; the ſilence of the night invited him to purſue it; and he can truly ſay, that food and reſt were not preferred before it. Every pſalm improved infinitely upon his acquaintance with it, and no one gave him uneaſineſs but the laſt: for then he grieved that his work was done. Happier hours than thoſe which have been ſpent in theſe meditations on the ſongs of Sion, he never expects to ſee in this world. Very pleaſantly did they paſs; they moved ſmoothly and ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly along: for when thus engaged, he counted no time. They are gone, but they have left a reliſh and a fragrance upon the mind; and the remembrance of them is ſweet.</p>

                     <p>Her ſingular talents for government were founded equally on her temper and on her capacity. Endowed with a great command over herſelf, ſhe ſoon obtained an uncontrolled aſcendant over the people.

paſſions and habits render him an abſolute dependent on the world, and the world's favour; on the uncertain goods of fortune, and the fickle humours of men. For it is by theſe he ſubſiſts, and among theſe his happineſs is ſought; according as his paſſions determine him to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue pleaſures, riches, or preferments. Having no fund within himſelf whence to draw enjoyment, his only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſource is in things without. His hopes and fears all hang upon the world. He partakes in all its viciſſitudes; and is moved and ſhaken by every wind of fortune. This is to be in the ſtricteſt ſenſe a ſlave to the world.</p>
                     <p>Religion and virtue, on the other hand, confer on the mind principles of noble independence. "The upright man is ſatisfied from himſelf." He deſpiſes not the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of fortune, but he centres not his happineſs in them. With a moderate ſhare of them he can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented; and contentment is felicity. Happy in his own integrity, conſcious of the eſteem of good men, repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing firm truſt in the providence, and the promiſes of God, he is exempted from ſervile dependence on other things. He can wrap himſelf up in a good conſcience, and look forward, without terror, to the change of the world. Let all things ſhift around him as they pleaſe, he believes that, by the Divine ordination, they ſhall be made to work together in the iſſue for his good: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, having much to hope from God, and little to fear from the world, he can be eaſy in every ſtate. One who poſſeſſes within himſelf ſuch an eſtabliſhment of mind, is truly free. But ſhall I call that man free, who has no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is his own, no property aſſured; whoſe very heart is not his own, but rendered the appendage of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal things, and the ſport of fortune? Is that man

free, let his outward condition be ever ſo ſplendid, whom his imperious paſſions detain at their call, whom they ſend forth at their pleaſure, to drudge and toil, and to beg his only enjoyment from the caſualties of the world? Is he free, who muſt flatter and lie to compaſs his ends; who muſt bear with this man's caprice, and that man's ſcorn; muſt profeſs friendſhip where he hates, and reſpect where he contemns; who is not at liberty to appear in his own colours, nor to ſpeak his own ſentiments; who dares not be honeſt, leſt he ſhould be poor?—Believe it, no chains bind ſo hard, no fetters are ſo heavy, as thoſe which faſten the corrupted heart to this treacherous world; no depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is more contemptible than that under which the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous, the covetous, or the ambitious man, lies to the means of pleaſure, gain, or power.

                     <p>IT will not take much time to delineate the character of the man of integrity, as by its nature it is a plain one, and eaſily underſtood. He is one, who makes it his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant rule to follow the road of duty, according as the word of God, and the voice of his conſcience, point it out to him.

The upright man is guided by a fixed principle of mind, which determines him to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teem nothing but what is honourable; and to abhor what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is baſe and unworthy, in moral conduct. Hence we find him ever the ſame; at all times, the truſty friend, the affectionate relation, the conſcientious man of buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the pious worſhipper, the public ſpirited citizen. He aſſumes no borrowed appearance. He ſeeks no maſk to cover him; for he acts no ſtudied part; but he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed what he appears to be, full of truth, candour, and humanity. In all his purſuits, he knows no path but the fair and direct one; and would much rather fail of ſucceſs, than attain it by reproachful means. He never ſhows us a ſmiling countenance, while he meditates evil againſt us in his heart. He never praiſes us among our friends; and then joins in traducing us among our enemies. We ſhall never find one part of his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter at variance with another. In his manners, he is ſimple and unaffected; in all his proceedings, open and conſiſtent.</p>

                     <head>SECTION XIV. On Gentleneſs.</head>
                     <p>I begin with diſtinguiſhing true gentleneſs from paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive tameneſs of ſpirit, and from unlimited compliance with the manners of others. That paſſive tameneſs, which ſubmits, without oppoſition, to every encroachment of the violent and aſſuming, forms no part of Chriſtian duty; but, on the contrary, is deſtructive of general hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs and order. That unlimited complaiſance, which,
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:038017_0153_1010D4BF0125EE18"/>
on every occaſion, falls in with the opinions and manners of others, is ſo far from being a virtue, that it is itſelf a vice, and the parent of many vices. It overthrows all ſteadineſs of principle; and produces that ſinful conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with the world, which taints the whole character. In the preſent corrupted ſtate of human manners, always to aſſent and to comply, is the very worſt maxim we can adopt. It is impoſſible to ſupport the purity and dignity of Chriſtian morals, without oppoſing the world on va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious occaſions, even though we ſhould ſtand alone. That gentleneſs therefore which belongs to virtue, is to be carefully diſtinguiſhed from the mean ſpirit of cowards, and the fawning aſſent of ſycophants. It renounces no juſt right from fear. It gives up no important truth from flattery. It is indeed not only conſiſtent with a firm mind, but it neceſſarily requires a manly ſpirit, and a fixed principle, in order to give it any real value. Upon this ſolid ground only, the poliſh of gentleneſs can with advantage be ſuperinduced.</p>
                     <p>It ſtands oppoſed, not to the moſt determined regard for virtue and truth, but to harſhneſs and ſeverity, to pride and arogance, to violence and oppreſſion. It is, proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that part of the great virtue of charity, which makes us unwilling to give pain to any of our brethren. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion prompts us to relieve their wants. Forbearance prevents us from retaliating their injuries. Meekneſs reſtrains our angry paſſions; candour, our ſevere judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Gentleneſs corrects whatever is offenſive in our manners; and, by a conſtant train of humane atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſtudies to alleviate the burden of common miſery. Its office, therefore, is extenſive. It is not, like ſome other virtues, called forth only on peculiar emergencies;
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:038017_0154_1010D4C08BE34238"/>
but it is continually in action, when we are engaged in intercourſe with men. It ought to form our addreſs, to regulate our ſpeech, and to diffuſe itſelf over our whole behaviour.</p>
                     <p>We muſt not, however, confound this gentle "wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom which is from above," with that artificial courteſy, that ſtudied ſmoothneſs of manners, which is learned in the ſchool of the world. Such accompliſhments, the moſt frivolous and empty may poſſeſs. Too often they are employed by the artful, as a ſnare; too often affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the hard and unfeeling, as a cover to the baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their minds. We cannot, at the ſame time, avoid obſerving the homage, which, even in ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, the world is conſtrained to pay to virtue. In order to render ſociety agreeable, it is found neceſſary to aſſume ſomewhat, that may at leaſt carry its appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Virtue is the univerſal charm. Even its ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow is courted, when the ſubſtance is wanting. The imitation of its form has been reduced into an art; and, in the commerce of life, the firſt ſtudy of all who would either gain the eſteem, or win the hearts of others, is to learn the ſpeech, and to adopt the manners, of candour, gentleneſs, and humanity. But that gentleneſs which is the characteriſtic of a good man, has, like every other virtue, its ſeat in the heart; and let me add, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing except what flows from the heart, can render even external manners truly pleaſing. For no aſſumed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour can at all times hide the real character. In that unaffectd civility which ſprings from a gentle mind, there is a charm infinitely more powerful, than in all the ſtudied manners of the moſt finiſhed courtier.</p>
                     <p>True gentleneſs is founded on a ſenſe of what we owe to HIM who made us, and to the common nature
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:038017_0155_1010D4C59CD52E08"/>
of which we all ſhare. It ariſes from reflection on our own failings and wants; and from juſt views of the condition, and the duty of man. It is native feeling, heightened and improved by principle. It is the heart which eaſily relents; which feels for every thing that is human; and is backward and ſlow to inflict the leaſt wound. It is affable in its addreſs, and mild in its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour; ever ready to oblige, and willing to de oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by others: breathing habitual kindneſs towards friends, courteſy to ſtrangers, long-ſuffering to enemies. It exerciſes authority with moderation; adminiſters re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof with tenderneſs; confers favours with eaſe and modeſty. It is unaſſuming in opinion, and temperate in zeal. It contends not eagerly about trifles; ſlow to contradict, and ſtill ſlower to blame; but prompt to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay diſſention, and to reſtore peace. It neither intermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles unneceſſarily with the affairs, nor pries inquiſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into the ſecrets of others. It delights above all things to alleviate diſtreſs; and, if it cannot dry up the falling tear, to ſooth at leaſt the grieving heart. Where it has not the power of being uſeful, it is never burdenſome. It ſeeks to pleaſe, rather than to ſhine and dazzle; and conceals with care that ſuperiority, either of talents, or of rank, which is oppreſſive to thoſe who are beneath it. In a word, it is that ſpirit and that tenour of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, which the goſpel of Chriſt enjoins, when it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us "to bear one onother's burdens; to rejoice with thoſe who rejoice, and to weep with thoſe who weep; to pleaſe every one his neighbour for his good; to be kind and tender-hearted; to be pitiful and cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous; to ſupport the weak, and to be patient towards all men"</p>

                     <p>THE Earl of Strafford defended himſelf againſt the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations of the houſe of Commons, with all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of mind, judgment, and ſagacity, that could be expected from innocence and ability. His children were placed beſide him, as he was thus defending his life, and the cauſe of his royal maſter. After he had, in a long and eloquent ſqeech, delivered without pre-meditation, confuted all the accuſations of his enemies, he thus drew to a concluſion. "But my Lords, I have troubled you too long: longer than I ſhould have done, but for the ſake of theſe dear pledges, which a ſaint in heaven has left me."—Upon this he pauſed; dropped a tear; looked upon his children; and proceeded.— "What I forfeit for myſelf is a triflle: that my indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretions ſhould reach my poſterity, wounds me to the heart. Pardon my infirmity.—Something I ſhould have added, but I am not able; and therefore I let it paſs. And now, my lords, for myſelf, I have long been taught, that the afflictions of this life are overpaid by that eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal weight of glory, which awaits the innocent. And ſo, my Lords, even ſo, with the utmoſt tranquility,
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:038017_0157_1010D4CB58BF9628"/>
I ſubmit myſelf to your judgment, whether that judgment be life or death: not my will, but thine, O God, be done!"</p>
                     <p>His eloquence and innocence induced thoſe judges to pity, who were the moſt zealous to condemn him. The King himſelf went to the Houſe of Lords, and ſpoke for ſome time in his defence; but the ſpirit of vengeance, which had been chained for eleven years, was now rouſed; and nothing but his blood could give the people ſatisfaction. He was condemned by both Houſes of Parliament; and nothing remained but for the King to give his conſent to the bill of attainder. But in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent commotions, the conſent of the King would very eaſily be diſpenſed with; and imminent danger might attend his refuſal. Charles, however, who loved Strafford tenderly, heſitated, and ſeemed reluctant; trying every expedient to put off ſo dreadful an office, as that of ſigning the warrant for his execution. While he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in this agitation of mind, and ſtate of ſuſpenſe, his doubts were at laſt ſilenced by an act of great magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity in the condemned Lord. He received a letter from that unfortunate nobleman, deſiring that his life might be made a ſacrifice to obtain reconciliation between the King and his people: adding, that he was prepared to die; and that to a willing mind there could be no injury. This inſtance of noble generoſity was but ill repaid by his maſter, who complied with his requeſt. He conſented to ſign the fatal bill by commiſſion; and Strafford was beheaded on Tower-Hill; behaving with all that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed dignity of reſolution, which was expected from his character.</p>

                        </gap> their names illuſtrious through ſucceeding ages, have been eminent for fortitude of mind. Of this we have one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous example in the Apoſtle Paul, whom it will be inſtructive for us to view in a remarkable occurrence of his life. After having long acted as the apoſtle of the Gentiles, his miſſion called him to go to Jeruſalem, where he knew that he was to encounter the utmoſt violence of his enemies. Juſt before he ſet ſail, he call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together the elders of his favourite church at Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus; and, in a pathetic ſpeech, which does great honour to his character, gave them his laſt farewell. Deeply affected by their knowledge of the certain dangers to which he was expoſing himſelf, all the aſſembly were fill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with diſtreſs, and melted into tears. The cirmſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were ſuch, as might have conveyed dejection even into a reſolute mind; and would have totally overwhelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the feeble. "They all wept ſore, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ell on Paul's neck, and kiſſed him; ſorrowing moſt of all for the words which he ſpoke, that they ſhould ſee his face no more." —What were then the ſentiments, what was the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, of this great and good man? Hear the words which ſpoke his firm and undaunted mind. "Behold, I go bound in the ſpirit, to Jeruſalem, not knowing the things that ſhall befall me there; ſave that the Holy Spirit witneſſeth in every city, ſaying, that bonds and afflictions
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:038017_0159_1010D4D22A36CB10"/>
abide me. But none of theſe things move me; neither count I my life dear to myſelf, ſo that I might finiſh my courſe with joy, and the miniſtry which I have received of the Lord Jeſus, to teſtify the goſpel of the grace of God." There was uttered the voice, there breathed the ſpirit, of a brave and a virtuous man. Such a man knows not what it is to ſhrink from danger, when con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience points out his path. In that path he is deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to walk; let the conſequences be what they may.</p>
                     <p>This was the magnanimous behaviour of that great Apoſtle, when he had perſecution and diſtreſs full in view. Attend now to the ſentiments of the ſame excellent man, when the time of his laſt ſuffering approached; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark the majeſty, and the eaſe, with which he looked on death. "I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand. I have fought the good fight. I have finiſhed my courſe. I have kept the faith. Hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth there is laid up for me a crown of righteouſneſs." How many years of life does ſuch a dying moment over-balance? Who would not chooſe, in this manner, to go off the ſtage, with ſuch a ſong of triumph in his mouth, rathar than prolong his exiſtence through a wretched old age, ſtained with ſin and ſhame?</p>

                     <p>THE religion of Chriſt not only arms us with forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude againſt the approach of evil; but, ſuppoſing evils to fall upon us with their heavieſt preſſure, it lightens the

load by many conſolations to which others are ſtrangers. While bad men trace, in the calamities with which they are viſited, the hand of an offended ſovereign, Chriſtians are taught to view them as the well-intended chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of a merciful Father. They hear amidſt them, that ſtill voice which a good conſcience brings to their ear: "Fear not, for I am with thee; be not diſmayed, for I am thy God." They apply to themſelves the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable promiſes with which the goſpel abounds. They diſcover in theſe the happy iſſue decreed to their troubles; and wait with patience till Providence ſhall have accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed its great and good deſigns. In the mean time, Devotion opens to them its bleſſed and holy ſanctuary: That ſanctuary in which the wounded heart is healed, and the weary mind is at reſt; where the cares of the world are forgotten, where its tumults are huſhed, and its miſeries diſappear; where greater objects open to our view than any which the world preſents; where a more ſerene ſky ſhines, and a ſweeter and calmer light beams on the afflicted heart. In thoſe moments of devotion, a pious man pouring out his wants and ſorrows to an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Supporter, feels that he is not left ſolitary and forſaken in a vale of woe. God is with him; Chriſt and the Holy Spirit are with him; and, though he ſhould be bereaved of every friend on earth, he can look up in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to a Friend that will never deſert him.</p>

What heart but then warms with the glow of humanity? In whoſe eye does not the tear gather, on revolving the fate of paſſing and ſhort-lived man?</p>
                     <p>Behold the poor man who lays down at laſt the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of his weariſome life. No more ſhall he groan un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the load of poverty and toil. No more ſhall he hear the inſolent calls of the maſter, from whom he received his ſcanty wages. No more ſhall he be raiſed from need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſlumber on his bed of ſtraw, nor be hurried away from his homely meal, to undergo the repeated labours of the day. While his humble grave is preparing, and a few poor and decayed neighbours are carrying him thither, it is good for us to think, that this man too was our brother; that for him the aged and deſtitute wife, and the needy children, now weep; that, neglected as he was by the world, he poſſeſſed perhaps both a ſound un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and a worthy heart; and is now carried by angels to reſt in Abraham's boſom.—At no great diſtance from him, the grave is opened to receive the rich and proud man.

While the funeral is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by a numerous unconcerned company, who are diſcourſing to one another about the news of the day, or the ordinary affairs of life, let our thoughts rather follow to the houſe of mourning, and repreſent to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves what is paſſing there. There we ſhould ſee a diſconſolate family, ſitting in ſilent grief, thinking of the ſad breach that is made in their little ſociety; and, with tears in their eyes, looking to the chamber that is now left vacant, and to every memorial that preſents it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of their departed friend. By ſuch attention to the woes of others, the ſelfiſh hardneſs of our hearts will be gradually ſoftened, and melted down into humanity.</p>

As we are going along to the manſion of the dead, it is natural for us to think, and to diſcourſe, of all the changes which ſuch a perſon has ſeen during the courſe of his life. He has paſſed, it is likely, through varieties of fortune. He has experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced

proſperity, and adverſity. He has ſeen families and kindreds riſe and fall. He has ſeen peace and war ſucceeding in their turns; the face of his country un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoing many alterations; and the very city in which he dwelt riſing, in a manner, new around him. After all he has beheld, his eyes are now cloſed for ever. He was becoming a ſtranger in the midſt of a new ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of men. A race who knew him not, had ariſen to fill the earth. Thus paſſes the world away. Through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all ranks and conditions, "one generation paſſeth, and another generation cometh;" and this great inn is by turns evacuated, and repleniſhed, by troops of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding pilgrims.—O vain and inconſtant world!

Iſaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven;" a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe which opens the ſublimeſt proſpects to the human mind. It allows good men to entertain the hope, that, ſeparated from all the dregs of the human maſs, from that mixed and polluted crowd in the midſt of which they now dwell, they ſhall be permitted to mingle with prophets, patriarchs, and apoſtles, with all thoſe great and illuſtrious ſpirits, who have ſhone in former ages as the ſervants of God, or the benefactors of men; whoſe deeds we are accuſtomed to celebrate; whoſe ſteps we now follow at a diſtance; and whoſe names we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce with veneration.</p>

                     <p>NO human character exhibited in the records of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is more remarkable or inſtructive than that of the patriarch Joſeph. He is one whom we behold tried in all the viciſſitudes of fortune; from the condition of a ſlave, riſing to be ruler of the land of Egypt; and in every ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion acquiring, by his virtue and wiſdom, favour with God and man. When overſeer of Potiphar's houſe, his fidelity was proved by ſtrong temptations, which he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably reſiſted. When thrown into priſon by the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice of a falſe woman, his integrity and prudence ſoon rendered him conſpicuous, even in that dark manſion. When called into the preſence of Pharaoh, the wiſe and and extenſive plan which he formed for ſaving the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from the miſeries of impending famine, juſtly raiſed him to a high ſtation, wherein his abilities were eminently diſplayed in the public ſervice. But in his whole hiſtory, there is no circumſtance ſo ſtriking and intereſting, as his behaviour to his brethren who had ſold him into ſlavery. The moment in which he made himſelf known to them, was the muſt critical one of his life, and the moſt deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of his character. It is ſuch as rarely occu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

higheſt attention of all who are endowed with any degree of ſenſibility of heart.</p>
                     <p>From the whole tenour of the narration it appears, that though Joſeph, upon the arrival of his brethren in Egypt, made himſelf ſtrange to them, yet from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning he intended to diſcover himſelf; and ſtudied ſo to conduct the diſcovery, as might render the ſurpriſe of joy complete. For this end, by affected ſeverity, he took meaſures for bringing down into Egypt all his father's children. They were now arrived there; and Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min among the reſt, who was his younger brother by the ſame mother, and was particularly beloved by Joſeph. Him he threatened to detain; and ſeemed willing to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the reſt to depart. This incident renewed their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs. They all knew their father's extreme anxiety about the ſafety of Benjamin, and with what difficulty he had yielded to his undertaking this journey. Should he be prevented from returning, they dreaded that grief would overpower the old man's ſpirits, and prove fatal to his life. Judah, therefore, who had particularly urged the neceſſity of Benjamin's accompanying his brothers, and had ſolemnly pledged himſelf to their father for his ſafe return, craved, upon this occaſion, an audience of the governour; and gave him a full account of the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of Jacob's family.</p>
                     <p>Nothing can be more intereſting and pathetic than this diſcourſe of Judah. Little knowing to whom he ſpoke, he paints in all the colours of ſimple and natural eloquence, the diſtreſſed ſituation of the aged patriarch, haſtening to the cloſe of life; long afflicted for the loſs of a favourite ſon, whom he ſuppoſed to have been torn in pieces by a beaſt of prey; labouring now under anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:038017_0167_1010D4ED1FFF6FD0"/>
concern about his youngeſt ſon, the child of his old age, who alone was left alive of his mother, and whom nothing but the calamities of ſevere famine could have moved a tender father to ſend from home, and expoſe to the dangers of a foreign land. "If we bring him not back with us, we ſhall bring down the grey hairs of thy ſervant, our father, with ſorrow, to the grave. I pray thee therefore let thy ſervant abide, inſtead of the young man, a bondman to our lord. For how ſhall I go up to my father, and Benjamin not with me? leſt I ſee the evil that ſhall come on my father."</p>
                     <p>Upon this relation, Joſeph could no longer reſtrain himſelf. The tender ideas of his father and his father's houſe, of his ancient home, his country and his kindred, of the diſtreſs of his family, and his own exaltation, all ruſhed too ſtrongly upon his mind to bear any farther concealment. "He cried, cauſe every man to go out from me; and he wept aloud." The tears which he ſhed were not the tears of grief. They were the burſt of affection. They were the effuſions of a heart overflowing with all the tender ſenſibilites of nature. Formerly he had been moved in the ſame manner, when he firſt ſaw his brethren before him. "His bowels yearned upon them; he ſought for a place where to weep. He went into his chamber; and then waſhed his face and returned to them." At that period his generous plans were not completed. But now, when there was no farther occaſion for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining himſelf, he gave free vent to the ſtrong emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his heart. The firſt miniſter to the king of Egypt was not aſhamed to ſhow, that he felt as a man, and a brother. "He wept aloud; and the Egyptians, and the houſe of Pharaoh heard him."</p>

                        <pb n="168" facs="unknown:038017_0168_1010D4EEAA3C1688"/>The firſt words which his ſwelling heart allowed him to pronounce, are the moſt ſuitable to ſuch an affecting ſituation that were ever uttered; —"I am Joſeph; doth my father yet live?"—What could he, what ought he, in that impaſſionate moment, to have ſaid more? This is the voice of Nature herſelf, ſpeaking her own language; and it penetrates the heart: No pomp of expreſſion; no parade of kindneſs, but ſtrong affection haſtening to utter what it ſtrongly felt. "His brethren could not anſwer him; for they were troubled at his preſence." Their ſilence is as expreſſive of thoſe emotions of repentance and ſhame, which, on this amazing diſcovery, filled their breaſts, and ſtopped their utterance, as the few words which Joſeph ſpeaks, are expreſſive of the generous agitations which ſtruggled for vent within him. No painter could ſeize a more ſtriking moment for diſplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the characteriſtical features of the human heart, than what is here preſented. Never was there a ſituation of more tender and virtuous joy, on the one hand; nor, on the other, of more overwhelming confuſion and conſcious guilt. In the ſimple narration of the ſacred hiſtorian, it is ſet before us with the greater energy and higher effect, than if it had been wrought up with all the colouring of the moſt admired modern eloquence.</p>

                     <head>SECTION VII. ALTAMONT. The following account of an affecting exit is related by Dr. Young, who was preſent at the melancholy ſcene.</head>
                     <p>THE ſad evening before the death of that noble youth, whoſe laſt hours ſuggeſted theſe thoughts, I was with him. No one was there, but his phyſician, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate whom he loved, and whom he had ruined. At my coming in, he ſaid,—"you and the phyſician are come too late.—I have neither life nor hope. You both aim at miracles. You would raiſe the dead!"</p>
                     <p>Heaven, I ſaid, was merciful—"Or," exclaimed he,— "I could not have been thus guilty. What has it not done to bleſs, and to ſave me?—I have been too ſtrong for omnipotence! I have plucked down ruin."—I ſaid, the bleſſed Redeemer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> —"Hold! hold! you wound me!— That is the rock on which I ſplit—I denied his name!"</p>
                     <p>Refuſing to hear any thing from me, or take any thing from the phyſician, he lay ſilent, as far as ſudden darts of pain would permit, till the clock ſtruck: Then with vehemence;—"Oh! time! time! it is fit thou ſhouldſt thus ſtrike thy murderer to the heart!—How art thou fled forever!—A month!—Oh, for a ſingle week! I aſk not for years; though an age were too little for the much I have to do."</p>
                     <p>On my ſaying, we could not do too much: that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven was a bleſſed place—</p>
                     <p>"So much the worſe.—'Tis loſt! 'tis loſt!—Heaven is to me the ſevereſt part of hell!"</p>
                     <p>Soon after I propoſed prayer. "Pray you that can. I never prayed. I cannot pray:—Nor need I. Is not
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:038017_0170_1010D4F753F17800"/>
Heaven on my ſide already? It cloſes with my conſcience. Its ſevereſt ſtrokes but ſecond my own."</p>
                     <p>His friend being much touched, even to tears at this— (who could forbear? I could not)—with a moſt affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate look, he ſaid, "Keep thoſe tears for thyſelf. I have undone thee.—Doſt weep for me? that's cruel. What can pain me more?"</p>
                     <p>Here his friend too much affected, would have left him.—"No, ſtay—thou ſtill mayſt hope;—therefore hear me. How madly have I talk'd! How madly haſt thou liſtened, and believed! but look on my preſent ſtate, as a full anſwer to thee, and to myſelf. This body is all weakneſs and pain; but my ſoul, as if ſtung up by torment to greater ſtrength and ſpirit, is full powerful to reaſon; full mighty to ſuffer. And that, which thus tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs within the jaws of immortality, is, doubtleſs, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal—And, as for a Deity, nothing leſs than an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty could inflict what I feel."</p>
                     <p>I was about to congratulate this paſſive, involuntary confeſſor, on his aſſerting the two prime articles of his creed, extorted by the rack of nature, when he thus, very paſſionately:—"No, no! let me ſpeak on. I have not long to ſpeak.—My much injured friend! my ſoul, as my body, lies in ruins; in ſcattered fragments of bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken thought—Remorſe for the paſt, throws my thought on the future. Worſe dread of the future, ſtrikes it back on the paſt. I turn, and turn, and find no ray. Didſt thou feel half the mountain that is on me, thou wouldſt ſtruggle with the martyr for his ſtake; and bleſs Heaven for the flames!—that is not an everlaſting flame; that is not an unquenchable fire."</p>
                     <p>How were we ſtruck! yet, ſoon after, ſtill more.

With what an eye of diſtraction, what a face of deſpair! he cried out:—"My principles have poiſoned my friend; my extravagance has beggared my boy! my unkindneſs has murdered my wife!—And is there another hell?— Oh! thou blaſphemed, yet indulgent LORD GOD! Hell itſelf is a refuge, if it hide me from thy frown!"</p>
                     <p>Soon after his underſtanding failed. His terrified ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination uttered horrors not to be repeated, or ever for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten. And ere the ſun (which, I hope, has ſeen, few like him) aroſe, the gay, young, noble, ingenious, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, and moſt wretched Altamont, expired!</p>
                     <p>If this is a man of pleaſure, what is a man of pain? How quick, how total, is their tranſit! In what a diſmal gloom they ſet for ever! How ſhort, alas! the day of their rejoicing!—For a moment they glitter—they daz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zle. In a moment, where are they? Oblivion covers their memories. Ah! would it did! Infamy ſnatches them from oblivion. In the long-living annals of infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my their triumphs are recorded. Thy ſufferings ſtill bleed in the boſom, poor Altamont! of the heart-ſtricken friend—for Altamont had a friend. He might have had many. His tranſient morning might have been the dawn of an immortal day. His name might have been gloriouſly enrolled in the records of eternity. His me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory might have left a ſweet fragrance behind it, grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the ſurviving friend, ſalutary to the ſucceeding ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration. With what capacities was he endowed! with what advantages, for being greatly good! But with the talents of an angel, a man may be a fool. If he judges amiſs in the ſupreme point, judging right in all elſe, but aggravates his folly; as it ſhows him wrong, though bleſſed with the beſt capacity of being right.</p>

                        <p>Yes; it is good for human nature to know its own weakneſs. When we arrogantly preſume on a ſtrength we have not, we are always in great danger of hurting ourſelves, or at leaſt of deſerving ridicule and contempt by vain and idle efforts.</p>

In the vaſt ocean of phi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>loſophy, I had the line and the plummet always in my hands. Many of its depths I found myſelf unable to fathom; but, by caution in ſounding, and the careful ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations I made in the courſe of my voyage, I found out ſome truths of ſo much uſe to mankind, that they acknowledge me to have been their benefactor.</p>

A later ſage will ariſe, perhaps among men now barbarous and unlearned, whoſe ſaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious diſcoveries will diſcredit the opinions of his admired predeceſſor.

                     <p>THE time is come, Fathers, when that which has long been wiſhed for, towards allaying the envy your order has been ſubject to, and removing the imputations againſt trials, is effectually put in your power. An opinion has long prevailed, not only here at home, but likewiſe in foreign countries, both dangerous to you, and perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to the ſtate,—, that, in proſecutions, men of wealth are always ſafe, however clearly convicted. There is now to be brought upon his trial before you, to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, I hope, of the propagators of this ſlanderous impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, one whoſe life and actions condemn him in the opinion of all impartial perſons; but who, according to his own reckoning and declared dependence upon his riches, is already acquitted; I mean Caius Verres. I demand juſtice of you, Fathers, upon the robber of the public treaſury, the oppreſſor of Aſia Minor and Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phylia, the invader of the rights and privileges of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, the ſcourge and curſe of Sicily. If that ſentence is paſſed upon him which his crimes deſerve, your au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, Fathers, will be venerable and ſacred in the eyes
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:038017_0190_1010D5338F430350"/>
of the public; but if his great riches ſhould bias you in his favour, I ſhall ſtill gain one point,—to make it appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to all the world, that what was wanting in this caſe, was not a criminal nor a proſecutor, but juſtice and ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate puniſhment.</p>
                     <p>To paſs over the ſhameful irregularities of his youth, what does his quaeſtorſhip, the firſt public employment he held, what does it exhibit, but one continued ſcene of villanies? Cneius Carbo plundered of the public money by his own treaſurer, a conſul ſtripped and betrayed, an army deſerted and reduced to want, a province robbed, the civil and religious rights of a people violated. The employment he held in Aſia Minor and Pamphylia, what did it produce but the ruin of thoſe countries? in which, houſes, cities, and temples were robbed by him. What was his conduct in his praetorſhip here at home? Let the plundered temples, and public works neglected, that he might embezz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e the money intended for carrying them on, bear witneſs. How did he diſcharge the office of a judge? Let thoſe who ſuffered by his injuſtice anſwer. But his praetorſhip in Sicily crowns all his works of wickedneſs, and finiſhes a laſting monument to his infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. The miſchiefs done by him in that unhappy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, during the three years of his iniquitous adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are ſuch, that many years, under the wiſeſt and beſt of praetors, will not be ſufficient to reſtore things to the condition in which he found them: for it is notorious, that, during the time of his tyranny, the Sicilians neither enjoyed the protection of their own original laws; of the regulations made for their benefit by the Roman ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, upon their coming under the protection of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth; nor of the natural and unalienable rights of
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:038017_0191_1010D5382448AA70"/>
men. His nod has decided all cauſes in Sicily for theſe three years. And his deciſions have broken all law, all precedent, all right. The ſums he has, by arbitrary taxes and unheard of impoſitions, extorted from the induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous poor, are not to be computed. The moſt faithful allies of the commonwealth have been treated as enemies. Roman citizens have, like ſlaves, been put to death with tortures. The moſt atrocious criminals, for money, have been exempted from the deſerved puniſhments; and men of the moſt unexceptionable characters, condemned and baniſhed unheard. The harbours, though ſufficiently fortified, and the gates of ſtrong towns, have been opened to pirates and ravagers. The ſoldiery and ſailors, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to a province under the protection of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, have been ſtarved to death. Whole fleets, to the great detriment of the province, ſuffered to periſh. The ancient monuments of either Sicilian or Roman greatneſs, the ſtatues of heroes and princes have been car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried off; and the temples ſtripped of the images.—Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by his iniquitous ſentences, filled the priſons with the moſt induſtrious and deſerving of the people, he then proceeded to order numbers of Roman citizens to be ſtrangled in the gaols: ſo that the exclamation, "I am a citizen of Rome!" which has often, in the moſt diſtant regions, and among the moſt barbarous people, been a protection, was of no ſervice to them; but, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, brought a ſpeedier and more ſevere puniſhment upon them.</p>
                     <p>I aſk now, Verres, what thou haſt to advance againſt this charge? Wilt thou pretend to deny it? Wilt thou pretend, that any thing falſe, that even any thing aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated,
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:038017_0192_1010D53CECACFF18"/>
is alleged againſt thee? Had any prince, or any ſtate, committed the ſame outrage againſt the privilege of Roman citizens, ſhould we not think we had ſufficient ground for demanding ſatisfaction? What puniſhment ought, then, to be inflicted upon a tyrannical and wicked praetor, who dared, at no greater diſtance than Sicily, within ſight of the Italian coaſt, to put to the infamous death of crucifixion, that unfortunate and innocent citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen, Publius Gavius Coſanus, only for his having aſſerted his privilege of citizenſhip, and declared his intention of appealing to the juſtice of his country, againſt a cruel oppreſſor, who had unjuſtly confined him in priſon at Syracuſe, whence he had juſt made his eſcape? The unhappy man, arreſted as he was going to embark for his native country, is brought before the wicked praetor. With eyes darting fury, and a countenance diſtorted with cruelty, he orders the helpleſs victim of his rage to be ſtripped, and rods to be brought; accuſing him, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt ſhadow of evidence, or even of ſuſpicion, of having come to Sicily as a ſpy. It was in vain that the unhappy man cried out, "I am a Roman citizen: I have ſerved under Lucius Pretius, who is now at Pano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramus, and will atteſt my innocence." The blood-thirſty praetor, deaf to all he could urge in his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, ordered the infamous puniſhment to be inflicted. Thus, Fathers, was an innocent Roman citizen publicly mangled with ſcourging; whilſt the only words he ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, amidſt his cruel ſufferings, were, "I am a Roman citizen!" With theſe he hoped to defend himſelf from violence and infamy. But of ſo little ſervice was this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege to him, that, while he was thus aſſerting his citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zenſhip,
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:038017_0193_1010D53E73B142D8"/>
the order was given for his execution,—for his execution upon the croſs!—</p>
                     <p>O liberty!—O ſound once delightful to every Roman ear!—O ſacred privilege of Roman citizenſhip!—once ſacred!—how trampled upon!—But what then! Is it come to this? Shall an inferior magiſtrate, a governor, who holds his whole power of the Roman people, in a Roman province, within ſight of Italy, bind, ſcourge, torture with fire and red hot plates of iron, and at laſt put to the infamous death of the croſs, a Roman citizen? Shall neither the cries of innocence expiring in agony, nor the tears of pitying ſpectators, nor the majeſty of the Roman commonwealth, nor the fear of the juſtice of his country, reſtrain the licentious and wanton cruelty of a monſter, who, in confidence of his riches, ſtrikes at the root of liberty, and ſets mankind at defiance.</p>
                     <p>I conclude with expreſſing my hopes, that your wiſdom and juſtice, Fathers, will not, by ſuffering the atrocious and unexampled inſolence of Caius Verres to eſcape due puniſhment, leave room to apprehend the danger of a total ſubverſion of authority, and the introduction of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral anarchy and confuſion.</p>

                     <p>IT is known to you, that king Micipſa, my father, on his death bed, left in charge to Jugurtha, his adopted ſon, conjunctly with my unfortunate brother Hiempſal and

myſelf, the children of his own body, the adminiſtration of the kingdom of Numidia, directing us to conſider the ſenate and people of Rome proprietors of it. He charged us to uſe our beſt endeavours to be ſerviceable to the Roman commonwealth; aſſuring us, that your protection would prove a defence againſt all enemies; and would be inſtead of armies, fortifications, and treaſures.</p>
                     <p>While my brother and I were thinking of nothing but how to regulate ourſelves according to the directions of our deceaſed father—Jugurtha—the moſt infamous of mankind!—breaking through all ties of gratitude and of common humanity, and trampling on the authority of the Roman commonwealth, procured the murder of my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate brother; and has driven me from my throne and native country, though he knows I inherit, from my grandfather Maſſiniſſa, and my father Micipſa, the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and alliance of the Romans.</p>
                     <p>For a prince to be reduced, by villany, to my diſtreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful circumſtances, is calamity enough; but my misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes are heightened by the conſideration—that I find myſelf obliged to ſolicit your aſſiſtance, Fathers, for the ſervices done you by my anceſtors, not for any I have been able to render you in my own perſon.

would become the greatneſs of the Roman common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, to protect the injured, and to check the triumph of daring wickedneſs over helpleſs innocence. But, to provoke your reſentment to the utmoſt, Jugurtha has driven me from the very dominions, which the ſenate and people of Rome gave to my anceſtors; and, from which my grandfather, and my father, under your um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brage expelled Syphax and the Carthaginians. Thus, Fathers, your kindneſs to our family is defeated; and Jugurtha, in injuring me, throws contempt upon you.</p>
                     <p>O wretched prince! Oh cruel reverſe of fortune! Oh father Micipſa! is this the conſequence of thy generoſity; that he, whom thy goodneſs raiſed to an equality with thy own children, ſhould be the murderer of thy children? Muſt, then, the royal houſe of Numidia always be a ſcene of havock and blood? While Carthage remained, we ſuffered, as was to be expected, all ſorts of hardſhips from their hoſtile attacks; our enemy near; our only powerfull ally, the Roman commonwealth, at a diſtance. When that ſcourge of Africa was no more, we congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulated ourſelves on the proſpect of eſtabliſhed peace. But, inſtead of peace, behold the kingdom of Numidia drenched with royal blood! and the only ſurviving ſon of its late king, flying from an adopted murderer, and ſeeking that ſafety in foreign parts, which he cannot command in his own kingdom.</p>

                     <p>Oh murdered, butchered brother! Oh deareſt to my heart—now gone forever from my ſight!—but why ſhould I lament his death? He is, indeed, deprived of the bleſſed light of heaven, of life, and kingdom, at once, by the very perſon who ought to have been the firſt to hazard his own life, in defence of any one of Micipſa's family. But, as things are, my brother is not ſo much deprived of theſe comforts, as delivered from terror, from flight, from exile, and the endleſs train of miſeries which render life to me a burden. He lies full low, gored with wounds, and feſtering in his own blood. But he lies in peace. He feels none of the miſeries which rend my ſoul with agony and diſtraction, while I am ſet up a ſpectacle to all mankind, of the uncertainty of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man affairs. So far from having it in my power to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh his murderer, I am not maſter of the means of ſecur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my own life. So far from being in a condition to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend my kingdom from the violence of the uſurper, I am obliged to apply for foreign protection for my own perſon.</p>

                     <p>AGRIPPA ſaid unto Paul, thou art permitted to ſpeak for thyſelf. Then Paul ſtretched forth the hand, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered for himſelf.</p>
                     <p>I think myſelf happy, king Agrippa, becauſe I ſhall anſwer for myſelf this day before thee, concerning all the things whereof I am accuſed by the Jews: eſpecially, as I know thee to be expert in all cuſtoms and queſtions which are among the Jews. Wherefore I beſeech thee to hear me patiently.</p>
                     <p>My manner of life from my youth, which was at the firſt among my own nation at Jeruſalem, know all the Jews; who knew me from the beginning, (if they would teſtify,) that after the ſtraiteſt ſect of our religion, I lived a Phariſee. And now I ſtand and am judged for the hope of the promiſe made by God to our fathers: to which promiſe, our twelve tribes, continually ſerving God day and night, hope to come: and, for this hope's ſake, king Agrippa, I am accuſed by the Jews.</p>
                     <p>Why ſhould it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God ſhould raiſe the dead? I verily thought with myſelf, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jeſus of Nazareth: and this I did in Jeruſalem. Many of the ſaints I ſhut up in priſon, having received authority from the chief prieſts, and when they were put to death, I gave my voice againſt them. And I of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten puniſhed them in every ſynagogue, and compelled them to blaſpheme; and being exceedingly mad againſt
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:038017_0199_1010D551899DF1D0"/>
them, I perſecuted them even unto ſtrange cities. But as I went to Damaſcus, with authority and commiſſion from the chief prieſts, at mid-day, O king! I ſaw in the way a light from heaven, above the brightneſs of the ſun, ſhining round about me, and them who journeyed with me. And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice ſpeaking to me, and ſaying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me? It is hard for thee to kick againſt the pricks. And I ſaid, who art thou, Lord? And he replied, I am Jeſus whom thou perſecuteſt. But riſe, and ſtand upon thy feet: for I have appeared to thee for this purpoſe, to make thee a miniſter, and a witneſs both of theſe things, which thou haſt ſeen, and of thoſe things in which I will appear to thee; delivering thee from the people, and from the Gentiles, to whom I now ſend thee, to open their eyes, and to turn them from darkneſs to light, and from the power of Satan to God; that they may receive forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſins, and inheritance amongſt them who are ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by faith that is in me.</p>
                     <p>Whereupon, O king Agrippa! I was not diſobedient to the heavenly viſion: but ſhowed firſt to them of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſcus, and at Jeruſalem, and through all the coaſts of Judea, and then to the Gentiles, that they ſhould repent, and turn to God, and do works meet for repentance. For theſe cauſes, the Jews caught me in the temple; and went about to kill me. Having, however, obtained help from God, I continue, to this day, witneſſing both to ſmall and great, ſaying no other things than thoſe which the prophets and Moſes declared ſhould come: that Chriſt ſhould ſuffer; that he would be the firſt who ſhould riſe from the dead; and he would ſhow light to the people, and to the Gentiles.</p>

But he replied, I am not mad, moſt noble Feſtus; but ſpeak the words of truth and ſoberneſs. For the king knoweth theſe things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whom alſo I ſpeak freely. I am perſuaded that none of theſe things are hidden from him: for this thing was not done in a corner. King Agrippa, believeſt thou the prophets? I know that thou believeſt. Then Agrippa ſaid to Paul, "almoſt thou perſuadeſt me to be a Chriſtian." And Paul replied, "I would to God, that not only thou, but alſo all that hear me this day, were both almoſt, and altogether ſuch as I am, except theſe bonds."<note n="*" place="bottom">How happy was this great Apoſtle, even in the moſt perilous circumſtances!

                     <opener>
                        <salute>MY LORDS,</salute>
                     </opener>
                     <p>WHEN I conſider the importance of this bill to your Lordſhips, I am not ſurpriſed it has taken up ſo much of your conſideration. It is a bill, indeed, of no common magnitude; it is no leſs than to take away from two thirds of the legiſlative body of this great kingdom, certain privileges and immunities of which they have been long poſſeſſed. Perhaps there is no ſituation the human mind can be placed in, that is ſo difficult and ſo trying, as when it is made a judge in its own cauſe. There is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing implanted in the breaſt of man ſo attached to ſelf, ſo tenacious of privileges once obtained, that in ſuch a ſituation, either to diſcuſs with impartiality, or decide with juſtice, has ever been held the ſummit of all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man virtue. The bill now in queſtion puts your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips in this very predicament; and I doubt not but the wiſdom of your deciſion will convince the world, that where ſelf-intereſt and juſtice are in oppoſite ſcales, the latter will ever preponderate with your Lordſhips.</p>
                     <p>Privileges have been granted to legiſlators in all ages, and in all countries. The practice is founded in wiſdom; and, indeed, it is peculiarly eſſential to the conſtitution of this country, that the members of both Houſes ſhould be free in their perſons, in caſes of civil ſuits: for there may come a time when the ſafety and welfare
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:038017_0202_1010C73E432DFED0"/>
of this whole empire, may depend upon their attendance in parliament. I am far from adviſing any meaſure that would in future endanger the ſtate: but the bill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your Lordſhips has, I am confident, no ſuch tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; for it expreſsly ſecures the perſons of members of either Houſe in all civil ſuits. This being the caſe, I confeſs, when I ſee many noble Lords, for whoſe judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I have a very great reſpect, ſtanding up to oppoſe a bill which is calculated merely to facilitate the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of juſt and legal debts, I am aſtoniſhed and amazed. They, I doubt not, oppoſe the bill upon public princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: I would not wiſh to inſinuate, that private intereſt had the leaſt weight in their determination.</p>
                     <p>The bill has been frequently propoſed, and as fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently has miſcarried: but it was always loſt in the lower Houſe. Little did I think, when it had paſſed the Commons, that it poſſibly could have met with ſuch oppoſition here. Shall it be ſaid, that you, my Lords, the grand council of the nation, the higheſt judicial and legiſlative body of the realm, endeavour to evade, by privilege, thoſe very laws which you enforce on your fellow-ſubjects? Forbid it juſtice!—I am ſure, were the noble Lords as well acquainted as I am, with but half the difficulties and delays occaſioned in the courts of juſtice, under pretence of privilege, they would not, nay they could not, oppoſe this bill.</p>
                     <p>I have waited with patience to hear what arguments might be urged againſt the bill; but I have waited in vain: the truth is, there is no argument that can weigh againſt it. The juſtice and expediency of the bill are ſuch as render it ſelf-evident. It is a propoſition of that nature, that can neither be weakened by argument,
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:038017_0203_1010C73FF80FBAF8"/>
nor entangled with ſophiſtry. Much, indeed, has been ſaid by ſome noble Lords, on the wiſdom of our anceſtors, and how differently they thought from us. They not only decreed, that privilege ſhould prevent all civil ſuits from proceeding during the ſitting of parliament, but likewiſe granted protection to the very ſervants of mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. I ſhall ſay nothing on the wiſdom of our anceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; it might perhaps appear invidious: that is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in the preſent caſe. I ſhall only ſay, that the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Lords who flatter themſelves with the weight of that reflection, ſhould remember, that as circumſtances alter, things themſelves ſhould alter. Formerly, it was not ſo faſhionable either for maſters or ſervants to run in debt, as it is at preſent. Formerly, we were not that great commercial nation we are at preſent; nor formerly were merchants and manufacturers members parliament, as at preſent. The caſe is now very different: both mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants and manufacturers are, with great propriety, elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed members of the Lower Houſe. Commerce having thus got into the legiſlative body of the kingdom, privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege muſt be done away. We all know, that the very ſoul and eſſence of trade are regular payments; and ſad experience teaches us, that there are men, who will not make their regular payments without the compulſive power of the laws. The law then ought to be equally open to all. Any exemption to particular men, or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ranks of men, is, in a free and commercial coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, a ſoleciſm of the groſſeſt nature.</p>
                     <p>But I will not trouble your Lordſhips with arguments for that, which is ſufficiently evident without any. I ſhall only ſay a few words to ſome noble Lords, who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee much inconveniency, from the perſons of their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:038017_0204_1010D55662745BB8"/>
being liable to be arreſted. One noble lord ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, That the coachman of a peer may be arreſted, while he is driving his maſter to the Houſe, and, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, he will not be able to attend his duty in parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament. If this were actually to happen, there are ſo many methods by which the member might ſtill get to the Houſe, that I can hardly think the noble lord is ſerious in his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection. Another noble peer ſaid, That, by this bill, one might loſe his moſt valuable and honeſt ſervants. This I hold to be a contradiction in terms: for he can neither be a valuable ſervant, nor an honeſt man, who gets into debt which he is neither able nor willing to pay, till com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled by the law. If my ſervant, by unforeſeen acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, has got into debt, and I ſtill wiſh to retain him, I certainly would pay the demand. But upon no principle of liberal legiſlation whatever, can my ſervant have a title to ſet his creditors at defiance, while, for forty ſhillings only, the honeſt tradeſman may be torn from his family, and locked up in a gaol. It is monſtrous injuſtice! I flatter myſelf, however, the determination of this day will entirely put an end to all ſuch partial proceedings for the future, by paſſing into a law the bill now under your Lordſhips' conſideration.</p>
                     <p>I come now to ſpeak, upon what, indeed, I would have gladly avoided, had I not been particularly pointed at, for the part I have taken in this bill. It has been ſaid, by a noble lord on my left hand, that I likewiſe am run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the race of popularity. If the noble lord means by popularity, that applauſe beſtowed by after-ages on good and virtuous actions, I have long been ſtruggling in that race: to what purpoſe, all-trying Time can alone deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. But if the noble lord means that muſhroom po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pularity,
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:038017_0205_1010D557EED21D50"/>
which is raiſed without merit, and loſt without a crime, he is much miſtaken in his opinion. I defy the noble Lord to point out a ſingle action of my life, in which the popularity of the times ever had the ſmalleſt influence on my determinations. I thank God I have a more permanent and ſteady rule for my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,—the dictates of my own breaſt. They who have foregone that pleaſing adviſer, and given up their mind to be the ſlave of every popular impulſe, I ſincerely pity: I pity them ſtill more, if their vanity leads them to miſtake the ſhouts of a mob, for the trumpet of Fame. Experience might inform them, that many, who have been ſaluted with the huzzas of a crowd one day, have receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their execrations the next; and many, who, by the popularity of their times, have been held up as ſpotleſs patriots, have, nevertheleſs, appeared upon the hiſtorian's page, when truth has triumphed over deluſion, the aſſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins of liberty. Why then the noble lord can think I am ambitious of preſent popularity, that echo of folly, and ſhadow of renown, I am at a loſs to determine. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, I do not know that the bill now before your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips will be popular: it depends much upon the cap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ice of the day. It may not be popular to compel people to pay their debts; and, in that caſe, the preſent muſt be a very unpopular bill. It may not be popular neither to take away any of the privileges of parliament; for I very well remember, and many of your Lordſhips may remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that, not long ago, the popular cry was for the exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of privilege; and ſo far did they carry it at that time, that it was ſaid, the privilege protected members even in criminal actions; nay, ſuch was the power of popular prejudices over weak minds, that the very deciſions of
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:038017_0206_1010D55B8F52AB20"/>
ſome of the courts were tinctured with that doctrine. It was undoubtedly an abominable doctrine; I thought ſo then, I think ſo ſtill; but, nevertheleſs, it was a popular doctrine, and came immediately from thoſe who are call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the friends of liberty; how deſervedly, time will ſhow. True liberty, in my opinion, can only exiſt when juſtice is equally adminiſtered to all; to the king and to the beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar. Where is the juſtice then, or where is the law that protects a member of parliament more than any other man, from the puniſhment due to his crimes? The laws of this country allow of no place, nor any employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to be a ſanctuary for crimes; and where I have the honour to ſit as judge, neither royal favour, nor popular applauſe, ſhall ever protect the guilty.</p>
                     <p>I have now only to beg pardon for having employed ſo much of your Lordſhips' time; and I am ſorry a bill, frought with ſo many good conſequences, has not met with an abler advocate: but I doubt not your Lordſhips' determination will convince the world, that a bill, calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to contribute ſo much to the equal diſtribution of juſtice as the preſent, requires with your Lordſhips but very little ſupport.</p>

advantages of fortune, are not all equally proſperous in the courſe of life. While ſome of them, by wiſe and ſteady conduct, attain diſtinction in the world, and paſs their days with comfort and honour; others, of the ſame rank, by mean and vicious behaviour, forfeit the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of their birth; involve themſelves in much miſery; and end in being a diſgrace to their friends, and a burden on ſociety. Early, then, may you learn, that it is not on the external condition in which you find yourſelves plac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but on the part which you are to act, that your wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare or unhappineſs, your honour or infamy, depends. Now, when beginning to act that part, what can be of greater moment, than to regulate your plan of conduct with the moſt ſerious attention, before you have yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted any fatal or irretrievable errors? If, inſtead of exerting reflection for this valuable purpoſe, you deliver yourſelves up, at ſo critical a time, to ſloth and pleaſure; if you refuſe to liſten to any counſellor but humour, or to attend to any purſuit except that of amuſement; if you allow yourſelves to float looſe and careleſs on the tide of life, ready to receive any direction which the current of faſhion may chance to give you; what can you expect to follow from ſuch beginnings? While ſo many around you are undergoing the ſad conſequences of a like indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, for what reaſon ſhall not thoſe conſequences ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to you?

                     <p>When you look forward to thoſe plans of life, which either your circumſtances have ſuggeſted, or your friends have propoſed, you will not heſitate to acknowledge, that in order to purſue them with advantage ſome previous diſcipline is requiſite. Be aſſured, that whatever is to be your profeſſion, no education is more neceſſary to your ſucceſs, than the acquirement of virtuous diſpoſitions and habits. This is the univerſal preparation for every cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, and every ſtation in life. Bad as the world is, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect is always paid to virtue. In the uſual courſe of human affairs, it will be found, that a plain underſtanding, joined with acknowledged worth, contributes more to proſperity, than the brighteſt parts without probity or honour. Whether ſcience or buſineſs, or public life, be your aim, virtue ſtill enters, for a principal ſhare, into all theſe great departments of ſociety. It is connected with eminence, in every liberal art; with reputation, in every
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:038017_0209_1010D56579589290"/>
branch of fair and uſeful buſineſs; with diſtinction, in every public ſtation. The vigour which it gives the mind, and the weight which it adds to character; the generous ſentiments which it breathes; the undaunted ſpirit which it inſpires; the ardour of diligence which it quickens; the freedom which it procures from pernicious and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable avocations; are the foundations of all that is highly honourable, or greatly ſucceſsful among men.</p>

It will form the channel in which your life is to run; nay, it may determine is everlaſting iſſue. Conſider then the employment of this important period, as the higheſt truſt which ſhall ever be committed to you; as in a great meaſure, deciſive of your happineſs, in time, and in eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. As in the ſucceſſion of the ſeaſons, each, by the invariable laws of Nature, affects the productions of what is next in courſe; ſo, in human life, every period of our age, according as it is well or ill ſpent, influences the happineſs of that which is to follow. Virtuous youth gradually brings forward accompliſhed and flouriſhing manhood; and ſuch manhood paſſes of itſelf, without un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs, into reſpectable and tranquil old age. But when nature is turned out of its regular courſe, diſorder takes place in the moral, juſt as in the vegetable world. If the Spring put forth no bloſſoms, in Summer there will be no beauty, and in Autumn, no fruit. So, if youth be trifled away without improvement, manhood will proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be contemptible, and old age miſerable. If the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of life have been "vanity," its latter end can <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>carcely be any other than "vexation of ſpirit."</p>
                     <p>I ſhall finiſh this addreſs, with calling your attention to that dependence on the bleſſing of Heaven, which, amidſt all your endeavours after improvement, you ought continually to preſerve. It is too common with the young, even when they reſolve to tread the path of virtue and honour, to ſet out with preſumptuous confidence in themſelves. Truſting to their own abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities for carrying them ſucceſsfully through life, they
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:038017_0211_1010D56AB353DCB0"/>
are careleſs of applying to God, or of deriving any aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from what they are apt to reckon the gloomy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline of religion. Alas! how little do they know the dangers which await them? Neither human wiſdom, nor human virtue, unſupported by religion, is equal to the trying ſituations which often occur in life. By the ſhock of temptation, how frequently have the moſt vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous intentions been overthrown? Under the preſſure of diſaſter, how often has the greateſt conſtancy ſunk? "every good, and every perfect gift, is from above." Wiſdom and virtue, as well as "riches and honour, come from God." Deſtitute of his favour, you are in no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſituation, with all your boaſted abilities, than orphans left to wander in a trackleſs deſert, without any guide to conduct them, or any ſhelter to cover them from the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering ſtorm. Correct, then, this ill-founded arrogance. Expect not, that your happineſs can be independent of him who made youth. By faith and repentance, apply to the Redeemer of the world. By piety and prayer, ſeek the protection of the God of heaven. I conclude with the ſolemn words, in which a great prince delivered his dying charge to his ſon; words, which every young per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ought to conſider as addreſſed to himſelf, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave deeply on his heart: "Solomon, my ſon, know thou the God of thy fathers; and ſerve him with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect heart, and with a willing mind. For the Lord ſearches all hearts, and underſtandeth all the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the thoughts. If thou ſeek him, he will be found of thee; but if thou forſake him, he will caſt thee off for ever."</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>AN account of this dreadful earthquake, is given by the celebrated Father Kircher. It happened whilſt he was on his journey to viſit Mount Aetna, and the reſt of the wonders that lie towards the ſouth of Italy. Kircher is conſidered, by ſcholars, as one of the greateſt prodigies of learning.</p>
                     <p>"Having hired a boat, in company with four more, (two friars of the order of St. Francis, and two ſeculars,) we launched, from the harbour of Meſſina, in Sicily; and arrived, the ſame day, at the promontory of Pelorus. Our deſtination was for the city of Euphaemia, in Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bria; where we had ſome buſineſs to tranſact; and where we deſigned to tarry for ſome time. However, Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſeemed willing to croſs our deſign; for we were obliged to continue three days at Pelorus, on account of the weather; and though we often put out to ſea, yet we were as often driven back. At length, wearied with the delay, we reſolved to proſecute our voyage; and, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the ſea ſeemed more than uſually agitated, we ventured forward. The gulph of Charybdis, which we approached, ſeemed whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>led round in ſuch a manner, as
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:038017_0213_1010D5761B3B4C58"/>
to form a vaſt hollow, verging to a point in the centre. Procceding onward, and turning my eyes to Aetna, I ſaw it caſt forth large volumes of ſmoke, of mountainous ſizes, which entirely covered the iſland, and blotted out the very ſhores from my view. This, together with the dreadful noiſe, and the fulphurous ſtench which was ſtrongly perceived, filled me with apprehenſions, that ſome more dreadful calamity was impending. The ſea itſelf ſeemed to wear a very unuſual appearance: they who have ſeen a lake in a violent ſhower of rain, covered all over with bubbles, will conceive ſome idea of its agitations. My ſurpriſe was ſtill increaſed, by the calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſerenity of the weather; not a breeze, not a cloud, which might be ſuppoſed to put all nature thus into motion. I therefore warned my companions, that an earthquake was approaching; and, after ſome time, making for the ſhore with all poſſible diligence, we landed at Tropaea, happy and thankful for having eſcaped the threatening dangers of the ſea."</p>
                     <p>"But our triumphs at land were of ſhort duration; for we had ſcarcely arrived at the Jeſuits' College, in that City, when our ears were ſtunned with a horrid ſound, reſembling that of an infinite number of chariots, driven fiercely forward; the wheels rattling, and the thongs cracking. Soon after this, a moſt dreadful earthquake enſued; ſo that the whole tract upon which we ſtood, ſeemed to vibrate, as if we were in the ſcale of a balance, that continued wavering. This motion, however, ſoon grew more violent; and being no longer able to keep my legs, I was thrown proſtrate upon the ground. In the mean time, the univerſal ruin round me redoubled

                        </gap>ering of towers, and the groans of the dying, all contributed to raiſe my terror and deſpair. On every ſide of me, I ſaw nothing but a ſcene of ruin; and danger threatening wherever I ſhould fly. I commend myſelf to God, as my laſt great refuge. At that hour, O how vain was every ſublunary happineſs! Wealth, honour, empire, wiſdom, all mere uſeleſs ſounds, and as empty as the bubbles in the deep! Juſt ſtanding on the threſhold of eternity, nothing but God was my pleaſure; and the nearer I approached, I only loved him the more. After ſome time, however, finding that I remained unhurt, amidſt the general concuſſion, I reſolved to venture for ſafety; and running as faſt as I could, I reached the ſhore, but almoſt terrified out of my reaſon. I did not ſearch long here, till I found the boat in which I had landed; and my companions alſo, whoſe terrors were even greater than mine. Our meeting was not of that kind, where every one is deſirous of telling his own happy eſcape: it was all ſilence, and a gloomy dread of impending terrors."</p>
                     <p>"Leaving this ſeat of deſolation, we proſecuted our voyage along the coaſt; and the next day came to Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chetta, where we landed, although the earth ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in violent agitations. But we had ſcarcely arrived at our inn, when we were once more obliged to return to the boat; and, in about half an hour, we ſaw the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er part of the town, and the inn at which we had ſet up, daſhed to the ground, and burying the inhabitants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the ruins."</p>
                     <p>"In this manner, proceeding onward in our little veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, finding no ſafety at land, and yet, from the ſmallneſs
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:038017_0215_1010D577AE362F58"/>
of our boat, having but a very dangerous continuance at ſea, we at length landed at Lopizium, a caſtle midway between Tropaea and Euphaemia, the city to which, as I ſaid before, we were bound. Here, wherever I turned my eyes, nothing but ſcenes of ruin and horror appeared; towns and caſtles levelled to the ground; Strombalo, though at ſixty miles diſtance, belching forth flames in an unuſual manner, and with a noiſe which I could diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctly hear. But my attention was quickly turned from more remote, to contiguous danger. The rumbling ſound of an approaching earthquake, which we by this time were grown acquainted with, alarmed us for the conſequences; it every moment ſeemed to grow louder, and to approach nearer. The place on which we ſtood now began to ſhake moſt dreadfully; ſo that being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to ſtand, my companions and I caught hold of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhrub grew next to us, and ſupported ourſelves in that manner."</p>
                     <p>"After ſome time, this violent paroxyſm ceaſing, we again ſtood up, in order to proſecute our voyage to Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaemia, which lay within ſight. In the mean time, while we were preparing for this purpoſe, I turned my eyes towards the city, but could ſee only a frightful dark cloud, that ſeemed to reſt upon the place. This the more ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed us, as the weather was ſo very ſerene. We waited, therefore, till the cloud had paſſed away: then turning to look for the city, it was totally ſunk. Wonderful to tell! nothing but a diſmal and putrid lake was ſeen where it ſtood. We looked about to find ſome one that could tell us of its ſad cataſtrophe, but could ſee no perſon. All was become a melancholy ſolitude; a ſcene of hideous deſolation. Thus proceeding penſively along, in queſt
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:038017_0216_1010D57DD4329BC8"/>
of ſome human being that could give us a little informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we at length ſaw a boy ſitting by the ſhore, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing ſtupified with terror. Of him, therefore, we enquired concerning the fate of the city; but he could not be prevailed on to give us an anſwer. We entreated him, with every expreſſion of tenderneſs and pity, to tell us; but his ſenſes were quite wrapt up in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of the danger he had eſcaped. We offered him ſome victuals, but he ſeemed to loath the ſight. We ſtill perſiſted in our offices of kindneſs; but he only pointed to the place of the city, like one out of his ſenſes; and then running up into the woods, was never heard of after. Such was the fate of the city of Euphaemia: and as we continued our melancholy courſe along the ſhore, the whole coaſt, for the ſpace of two hundred miles, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented nothing but the remains of cities; and men ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, without a habitation, over the fields. Proceeding thus along, we at length ended our diſtreſsful voyage, by arriving at Naples, after having eſcaped a thouſand dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers both at ſea and land."</p>

                     <head>SECTION IV. On Diſcretion.</head>
                     <p>I HAVE often thought, if the minds of men were laid open, we ſhould ſee but little difference between that of the wiſe man, and that of the fool.</p>
                     <p>There are infinite reveries, numberleſs extravagances, and a ſucceſſion of vanities, which paſs through both. The great difference is, that the firſt knows how to pick and cull his thoughts for converſation, by ſuppreſſing
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:038017_0220_1010D58933CD3330"/>
ſome, and communicating others; whereas the other lets them all indifferently fly out in words. This ſort of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, however, has no place in private converſation between intimate friends. On ſuch occaſions, the wiſeſt men very often talk like the weakeſt; for indeed talking with a friend is nothing elſe than <hi>thinking aloud.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Tully has therefore very juſtly expoſed a precept, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by ſome ancient writers, That a man ſhould live with his enemy in ſuch a manner, as might leave him room to become his friend; and with his friend, in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that, if he became his enemy, it ſhould not be in his power to hurt him. The firſt part of this rule, which regards our behaviour towards an enemy, is indeed very reaſonable, as well as very prudential; but the latter part of it, which regards our behaviour towards a friend, favours more of cunning than of diſcretion; and would cut a man off from the greateſt pleaſures of life, which are the freedoms of converſation with a boſom friend. Beſides that, when a friend is turned into an enemy, the world is juſt enough to accuſe the perfidiouſneſs of the friend, rather than the indiſcretion of the perſon who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fided in him.</p>
                     <p>Diſcretion does not only ſhow itſelf in words, but in all the circumſtances of action; and is like an under-agent of Providence, to guide and direct us in the ordinary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of life.</p>
                     <p>There are many more ſhining qualities in the mind of man, but there is none ſo uſeful as diſcretion. It is this, indeed, which gives a value to all the reſt; which ſets them at work in their proper times and places; and turns them to the advantage of the perſon who is poſſeſſed of
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:038017_0221_1010D58C32DDE190"/>
them. Without it, learning is pedantry, and wit imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inence; virtue itſelf looks like weakneſs; the beſt parts only qualify a man to be more ſprightly in errors, and active to his own prejudice.</p>
                     <p>Diſcretion does not only make a man the maſter of his own parts, but of other men's. The diſcreet man finds out the talents of thoſe he converſes with; and knows how to apply them to proper uſes. Accordingly, if we look into particular communities and diviſions of men, we may obſerve, that it is the diſcreet man, not the witty, nor the learned, nor the brave, who guides the converſation, and gives meaſures to the ſociety. A man with great talents, but void of diſcretion, is like Polyphemus in the fable, ſtrong and blind; endued with an irreſiſtible force, which, for want of ſight, is of no uſe to him.</p>
                     <p>Though a man have all other perfections, and want diſcretion, he will be of no great conſequence in the world; but if he have this ſingle talent in perfection, and but a common ſhare of others, he may do what he pleaſes in his particular ſtation of life.</p>
                     <p>At the ſame time that I think diſcretion the moſt uſeful talent a man can be maſter of, I look upon cunning to be the accompliſhment of little, mean, ungenerous minds. Diſcretion points out the nobleſt ends to us; and purſues the moſt proper and laudable methods of attaining them: cunning has only private ſelfiſh aims; and ſticks at no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which may make them ſucceed. Diſcretion has large and extended views; and, like a well formed eye, commands a whole horizon: cunning is a kind of ſhort-ſightedneſs, that diſcovers the minuteſt objects which are near at hand, but is not able to diſcern things at a diſtance.
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:038017_0222_1010C727D97E3308"/>
Diſcretion, the more it is diſcovered, gives a greater au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to the perſon who poſſeſſes it: cunning, when it is once detected, loſes its force, and makes a man inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of bringing about even thoſe events which he might have done, had he paſſed only for a plain man. Diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the perfection of reaſon; and a guide to us in all the duties of life: cunning is a kind of inſtinct, that only looks out after our immediate intereſt and welfare. Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion is only found in men of ſtrong ſenſe and good un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings: cunning is often to be met with in brutes themſelves; and in perſons who are but the feweſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves from them. In ſhort, cunning is only the mimic of diſcretion; and it may paſs upon weak men, in the ſame manner as vivacity is often miſtaken for wit, and gravity for wiſdom.</p>
                     <p>The caſt of mind which is natural to a diſcreet man, makes him look forward into futurity, and conſider what will be his condition millions of ages hence, as well as what it is at preſent. He knows that the miſery or hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs which is reſerved for him in another world, loſes nothing of its reality by being placed at ſo great a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from him. The objects do not appear little to him becauſe they are remote. He conſiders, that thoſe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and pains which lie hid in eternity, approach nearer to him every moment; and will be preſent with him in their full weight and meaſure, as much as thoſe pains and pleaſures which he feels at this very inſtant. For this reaſon, he is careful to ſecure to himſelf that which is the proper happineſs of his nature, and the ultimate deſign of his being. He carries his thoughts to the end of every

action; and conſiders the moſt diſtant, as well as the moſt immediate effects of it. He ſuperſedes every little proſpect of gain and advantage which offers itſelf here, if he does not find it conſiſtent with his views of an here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. In a word, his hopes are full of immortality; his ſchemes are large and glorious; and his conduct ſuitable to one who knows his true intereſt, and how to purſue it by proper methods.</p>

                     <head>SECTION V. On the government of our Thoughts.</head>
                     <p>A MULTITUDE of caſes occur, in which we are no leſs accountable for what we think, than for what we do.</p>
                     <p>As, firſt, when the introduction of any train of thought depends upon ourſelves, and is our voluntary act; by turning our attention towards ſuch objects, awakening ſuch paſſions, or engaging in ſuch employments, as we know muſt give a peculiar determination to our thoughts. Next, when thoughts, by whatever accident they may have been originally ſuggeſted, are indulged with delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and complacency. Though the mind has been paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive in their reception, and, therefore, free from blame; yet, if it be active in their continuance, the guilt becomes its own. They may have intruded at firſt, like unbidden gueſts; but if when entered, they are made welcome, and kindly entertained, the caſe is the ſame as if they had been invited from the beginning. If we be thus accountable to God for thoughts either voluntarily introduced, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberately indulged, we are no leſs ſo, in the laſt place,
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:038017_0224_1010D59716AFF008"/>
for thoſe which find admittance into our hearts from ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine negligence, from total relaxation of attention, from allowing our imagination to rove with entire licence, "like the eyes of the fool, towards the ends of the earth." Our minds are, in this caſe, thrown open to folly and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. They are proſtituted to every evil thing which pleaſes to take poſſeſſion. The conſequences muſt all be charged to our account; and in vain we plead excuſe from human infirmity. Hence it appears, that the great object at which we are to aim in governing our thoughts, is, to take the moſt effectual meaſures for preventing the introduction of ſuch as are ſinful, and for haſtening their expulſion, if they ſhall have introduced themſelves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conſent of the will.</p>
                     <p>But when we deſcend into our breaſts, and examine how far we have ſtudied to keep this object in view, who can tell, "how oft he hath offended?" In no article of religion or morals are men more culpably remiſs, than in the unreſtrained indulgence they give to fancy; and that too, for the moſt part, without remorſe. Since the time that Reaſon began to exert her powers, Thought, during our waking hours, has been active in every breaſt, without a moments ſuſpenſion or pauſe. The current of ideas has been always flowing. The wheels of the ſpiritual engine have circulated with perpetual motion. Let me aſk, what has been the fruit of this inceſſant ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity with the greater part of mankind? Of the innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable hours that have been employed in thought, how few are marked with any permanent or uſeful effect? How many have either paſſed away in idle dreams: or have been abandoned to anxious diſcontented muſings, to unſocial and malignant paſſions, or to irregular and crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:038017_0225_1010D59A3B3C2F40"/>
deſires? Had I power to lay open that ſtorehouſe of iniquity which the hearts of too many conceal; could I draw out and read to them a liſt of all the imaginations they have deviſed, and all the paſſions they have indulged in ſecret; what a picture of men ſhould I preſent to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves! What crimes would they appear to have perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated in ſecrecy, which to their moſt intimate companions they durſt not reveal!</p>
                     <p>Even when men imagine their thoughts to be inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently employed they too commonly ſuffer them to run out into extravagant imaginations, and chimerical plans of what they would wiſh to attain, or chooſe to be, if they could frame the courſe of things according to their deſire. Though ſuch employments of fancy come not under the ſame deſcription with thoſe which are plainly criminal, yet wholly unblamable they ſeldom are. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the waſte of time which they occaſion, and the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>application which they indicate of thoſe intellectual pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that were given to us for much nobler purpoſes, ſuch romantic ſpeculations lead us always into the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of forbidden regions. They place us on dangerous ground. They are for the moſt part connected with ſome one bad paſſion; and they always nouriſh a giddy and frivolous turn of thought. They unfit the mind for ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying with vigour to rational purſuits, or for acquieſcing in ſober plans of conduct. From that ideal world in which it allows itſelf to dwell, it returns to the commerce of men, unbent and relaxed, ſickly and tainted, averſe from diſcharging the duties, and ſometimes diſqualified even for reliſhing the pleaſures, of ordinary life.</p>

                     <head>SECTION VI. On the Evils which flow from unreſtrained Paſſions.</head>
                     <p>WHEN man revolted from his Maker, his paſſions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled againſt himſelf; and, from being originally the miniſters of reaſon, have become the tyrants of the ſoul. Hence, in treating of this ſubject, two things may be aſſumed as principles: firſt, that through the preſent weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the underſtanding, our paſſions are often directed towards improper objects; and next, that even when their direction is juſt, and their objects are innocent, they perpetually tend to run into exceſs; they always hurry us towards their gratification, with a blind and dangerous impetuoſity. On theſe two points then turns the whole government of our paſſions: firſt, to aſcertain the proper objects of their purſuit; and next, to reſtrain them in that purſuit, when they would carry us beyond the bounds of reaſon. If there be any paſſion which intrudes itſelf unſeaſonably into our mind, which darkens and troubles our judgment, or habitually diſcompoſes our temper; which unfits us for properly diſcharging the duties, or diſqualifies us for cheerfully enjoying the comforts of life, we may certainly conclude it to have gained a dangerous aſcendant. The great object which we ought to propoſe to ourſelves is, to acquire a firm and ſtedfaſt mind, which the infatuation of paſſion ſhall not ſeduce, nor its violence ſhake; which, reſting on fixed principles, ſhall, in the midſt of contending emotions, remain free, and maſter
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:038017_0227_1010D59EE9E528A0"/>
of itſelf; able to liſten calmly to the voice of conſcience, and prepared to obey its dictates without heſitation.</p>
                     <p>To obtain, if poſſible, ſuch command of paſſion, is one of the higheſt attainments of the rational nature. Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to ſhow its importance crowd upon us from every quarter. If there be any fertile ſource of miſchief to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man life, it is, beyond doubt, the miſrule of paſſion. It is this which poiſons the enjoyment of individuals, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns the order of ſociety, and ſtrews the path of life with ſo many miſeries, as to render it indeed the vale of tears. All thoſe great ſcenes of public calamity, which we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold with aſtoniſhment and horror, have originated from the ſource of violent paſſions. Theſe have overſpread the earth with bloodſhed. Theſe have pointed the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſſin's dagger, and filled the poiſoned bowl. Theſe, in every age, have furniſhed too copious materials for the orator's pathetic declamation, and for the poet's tragical ſong.</p>
                     <p>When from public life we deſcend to private conduct, though paſſion operates not there in ſuch a wide and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive ſphere, we ſhall find its influence to be no leſs baneful. I need not mention the black and fierce paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, ſuch as envy, jealouſy, and revenge, whoſe effects are obviouſly noxious, and whoſe agitations are immediate miſery. But take any of the licentious and ſenſual kind. Suppoſe it to have unlimitted ſcope; trace it throughout its courſe: and we ſhall find that gradually, as it riſes, it taints the ſoundneſs, and troubles the peace of his mind over whom it reigns; that, in its progreſs, it engages him in purſuits which are marked either with danger or with ſhame; that, in the end, it waſtes his fortune, deſtroys his health, or debaſes his character; and aggravates all
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:038017_0228_1010D5A27609B998"/>
the miſeries in which it has involved him, with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding pangs of bitter remorſe. Through all the ſtages of this fatal courſe, how many have heretofore run? What multitudes do we daily behold purſuing it, with blind and headlong ſteps?</p>

                     <head>SECTION VII. On the proper State of our Temper, with reſpect to one another.</head>
                     <p>IT is evident, in the general, that if we conſult either public welfare or private happineſs, Chriſtian charity ought to regulate our diſpoſition in mutual intercourſe. But as this great principle admits of ſeveral diverſified appearances, let us conſider ſome of the chief forms un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which it ought to ſhow itſelf in the uſual tenour of life.</p>
                     <p>What, firſt, preſents itſelf to be recommended, is a peaceable temper; a diſpoſition averſe to give offence, and deſirous of cultivating harmony, and amicable inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe in ſociety. This ſuppoſes yielding and condeſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manners, unwillingneſs to contend with others about trifles, and, in conteſts that are unavoidable, proper mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of ſpirit. Such a temper is the firſt principle of ſelf-enjoyment. It is the baſis of all order and happineſs among mankind. The poſitive and contentious, the rude and quarrelſome, are the bane of ſociety. They ſeem deſtined to blaſt the ſmall ſhare of comfort which nature has here allotted to man. But they cannot diſturb the peace of others, more than they break their own. The hurricane rages firſt in their own boſom, before it is let
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:038017_0229_1010D5A6F5078FC0"/>
forth upon the world. In the tempeſts which they raiſe, they are always toſt; and frequently it is their lot to periſh.</p>
                     <p>A peaceable temper muſt be ſupported by a candid one, or a diſpoſition to view the conduct of others with fairneſs and impartiality. This ſtands oppoſed to a jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and ſuſpicious temper, which aſcribes every action to the worſt motive, and throws a black ſhade over every character. If we would be happy in ourſelves, or in our connexions with others, let us guard againſt this malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſpirit. Let us ſtudy that charity "which thinketh no evil;" that temper which, without degenerating into credulity, will diſpoſe us to be juſt; and which can allow us to obſerve an error, without imputing it as a crime. Thus we ſhall be kept free from that continual irritation, which imaginary injuries raiſe in a ſuſpicious breaſt; and ſhall walk among men as our brethren, not as our enemies.</p>
                     <p>But to be peaceable, and to be candid, is not all that is required of a good man. He muſt cultivate a kind, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and ſympathizing temper, which feels for diſtreſs, wherever it is beheld; which enters into the concerns of his friends with ardour; and to all with whom he has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe, is gentle, obliging, and humane. How amiable appears ſuch a diſpoſition, when contraſted with a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious or envious temper, which wraps itſelf up in its own narrow intereſt, looks with an evil eye on the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of others, and with an unnatural ſatisfaction, feeds on their diſappointments or miſeries! How little does he know of the true happineſs of life, who is a ſtranger to that intercourſe of good offices and kind affections, which, by a pleaſing charm, attaches men to one another, and circulates joy from heart to heart!</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="230" facs="unknown:038017_0230_1010C72E461F1BB0"/>We are not to imagine, that a benevolent temper finds no exerciſe, unleſs when opportunities offer of perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing actions of high generoſity, or of extenſive utility. Theſe may ſeldom occur. The condition of the greater part of mankind, in a good meaſure, precludes them. But, in the ordinary round of human affairs, many occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions daily preſent themſelves of mitigating the vexations which others ſuffer: of ſoothing their minds; of aid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their intereſt; of promoting their cheerfulneſs, or eaſe. Such occaſions may relate to the ſmaller incidents of life. But let us remember, that of ſmall incidents the ſyſtem of human life is chiefly compoſed. The at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions which reſpect theſe, when ſuggeſted by real benignity of temper, are often more material to the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of thoſe around us, than actions which carry the appearance of greater dignity and ſplendour. No wiſe or good man ought to account any rules of behaviour as below his regard, which tend to cement the great brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of mankind in comfortable union.</p>
                     <p>Particularly amidſt that familiar intercourſe which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to domeſtic life, all the virtues of temper find an ample range. It is very unfortunate, that within that circle, men too often think themſelves at liberty, to give unreſtrained vent to the caprice of paſſion and humour. Whereas there, on the contrary, more than any where, it concerns them to attend to the government of their heart; to check what is violent in their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and to ſoften what is harſh in their manners. For there the temper is formed. There, the real character diſplays itſelf. The forms of the world diſguiſe men when abroad. But within his own family, every man is known to be what he truly is.—In all our intercourſe
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:038017_0231_1010D5AA4B11B998"/>
then with others, particularly in that which is cloſeſt and moſt intimate, let us cultivate a peaceable, a candid, a gentle and friendly temper. This is the temper to which, by repeated injunctions, our holy religion ſeeks to form us. This was the temper of Chriſt. This is the temper of Heaven.</p>

                     <p>IS it bigotry to believe the ſublime truth of the goſpel, with full aſſurance of faith? I glory in ſuch bigotry. I would not part with it for a thouſand worlds. I congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the man who is poſſeſſed of it: for, amidſt all the viciſſitudes and calamities of the preſent ſtate, that man enjoys an inexhauſtible fund of conſolation, of which it it is not in the power of fortune to deprive him.</p>
                     <p>There is not a book on earth, ſo favourable to all the kind, and all the ſublime affections; or ſo unfriendly to hatred and perſecution, to tyranny, injuſtice, and every ſort of malevolence, as the Goſpel. It breathes nothing throughout, but mercy, benevolence, and peace.</p>
                     <p>Poetry is ſublime, when it awakens in the mind any great and good affection, as piety, or patriotiſm. This is one of the nobleſt effects of the heart. The Pſalms are remarkable, beyond all other writings, for their power of inſpiring devout emotions. But it is not in this reſpect only, that they are ſublime. Of the Divine nature, they contain the moſt magnificent deſcriptions, that the ſoul of man can comprehend. The hundred and fourth

                     <p>Such of the doctrines of the Goſpel as are level to human capacity, appear to be agreeable to the pureſt truth, and the ſoundeſt morality.

                     <p>The powers of his mind were yet unimpaired.

When I took my firſt ſurvey of the world, in my twentieth year, having conſidered the various con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of mankind, in the hour of ſolitude I ſaid thus to myſelf, leaning againſt a cedar, which ſpread its branches over my head: 'Seventy years are allowed to man: I have yet fifty remaining. Ten years I will allot to the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of knowledge, and ten I will paſs in foreign countries; I ſhall be learned, and therefore ſhall be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured; every city will ſhout at my arrival, and every ſtudent will ſolicit my friendſhip. Twenty years thus paſſed, will ſtore my mind with images, which I ſhall be buſy, through the reſt of my life, in combining and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring. I ſhall revel in inexhauſtable accumulations of intellectual riches; I ſhall find new pleaſures for every moment; and ſhall never more be weary of myſelf. I will not, however, deviate too far from the beaten track of life; but will try what can be found in female delicacy. I will marry a wife beautiful as the Houries, and wiſe as Zobeide: with her I will live twenty years within the ſuburbs of Bagdat, in every pleaſure that wealth can pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe, and fancy can invent. I will then retire to a rural dwelling; paſs my days in obſcurity and contemplation; and lie ſilently down on the bed of death. Throgh my life it ſhall be my ſettled reſolution, that I will never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the ſmile of princes; that I will never ſtand expoſed to the artifices of courts; I will never pant for public honours, nor diſturb my quiet with the affairs of

ſtate.' Such was my ſcheme of life, which I impreſſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delibly upon my memory."</p>
                     <p>"The firſt part of my enſuing time was to be ſpent in ſearch of knowledge, and I know not how I was diverted from my deſign.

I now poſtponed my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of travelling; for why ſhould I go abroad, while ſo much remain to be learned at home? I immured myſelf for four years, and ſtudied the laws of the empire. The fame of my ſkill reached the judges: I was found able to ſpeak upon doubtful queſtions; and was commanded to ſtand at the footſtool of the calif. I was heard with atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; I was conſulted with confidence; and the love of praiſe faſtened on my heart."</p>
                     <p>"I ſtill wiſhed to ſee diſtant countries; liſtened with rapture to the relations of travellers; and reſolved ſome time to aſk my diſmiſſion, that I might feaſt my ſoul with novelty: but my preſence was always neceſſary; and the ſtream of buſineſs hurried me along. Sometimes I was afraid leſt I ſhould be charged with ingratitude; but I ſtill propoſed to travel, and therefore would not confine my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by marriage."</p>
                     <p>"In my fiftieth year, I began to ſuſpect that the time of travelling was paſt; and thought it beſt to lay hold on the felicity yet in my power, and indulge myſelf in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic pleaſures.

inquired and rejected, conſulted and deliberated, till the ſixty-ſecond year made me aſhamed of wiſhing to marry. I had now nothing left but retirement; and for retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I never found a time, till diſeaſe forced me from public employment."</p>
                     <p>"Such was my ſcheme, and ſuch has been its conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. With an inſatiable thirſt for knowledge, I trifled away the years of improvement; with a reſtleſs deſire of ſeeing different countries, I have always reſided in the ſame city; with the higheſt expectation of connubial fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, I have lived unmarried; and with unalterable reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of contemplative retirement, I am going to die within the walls of Bagdat."</p>

                     <head>SECTION XI. The Pleaſures of virtuous Senſibility.</head>
                     <p>THE good effects of true ſenſibility on general virtue and happineſs, admit of no diſpute. Let us conſider its effect on the happineſs of him who poſſeſſes it, and the various pleaſures to which it gives him acceſs. If he is maſter of riches or influence, it affords him the means of increaſing his own enjoyment, by relieving the wants, or increaſing the comforts of others. If he command not theſe advantages, yet all the comforts, which he ſees in the poſſeſſion of the deſerving, become in ſome ſort his, by his rejoicing in the good which they enjoy. Even the face of nature yields a ſatisfaction to him, which the inſenſible can never know. The profuſion of goodneſs which he beholds poured forth on the univerſe, dilates his heart with the thought, that innumerable multitudes around
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:038017_0238_1010D5BDEDBA8B00"/>
him are bleſt and happy. When he ſees the labours of men appearing to proſper, and views a country flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in wealth and induſtry; when he beholds the ſpring coming forth in its beauty; and reviving the decayed face of nature; or in autumn beholds the fields loaded with plenty, and the year crowned with all its fruits; he lifts his affections with gratitude to the great Father of all, and rejoices in the general felicity and joy.</p>
                     <p>It may indeed be objected, that the ſame ſenſibility lays open the heart to be pierced with many wounds, from the diſtreſſes which abound in the world; expoſes us to frequent ſuffering from the participation which it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates of the ſorrows, as well as of the joys, of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. But let it be conſidered, that the tender melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly of ſympathy, is accompanied with a ſenſation, which they who feel it would not exchange for the gratifications of the ſelfiſh. When the heart is ſtrongly moved by any of the kind affections, even when it pours itſelf forth in virtuous ſorrow, a ſecret attractive charm mingles with the painful emotion; there is a joy in the midſt of grief. Let it be farther conſidered, that the griefs which ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility introduces, are counterbalanced by pleaſures which flow from the ſame ſource. Senſibility heightens in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral the human powers, and is connected with acuteneſs in all our feelings. If it makes us more alive to ſome painful ſenſations, in return, it renders the pleaſing ones more vivid and animated. The ſelfiſh man languiſhes in his narrow circle of pleaſures. They are confined to what affects his own intereſt. He is obliged to repeat the ſame gratifications, till they become inſipid. But the
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:038017_0239_1010D5C0A8D91B88"/>
man of virtuous ſenſibility moves in a wider ſphere of felicity. His powers are much more frequently called forth into occupations of pleaſing activity. Numberleſs occaſions open to him of indulging his favourite taſte, by conveying ſatisfaction to others. Often it is in his power, in one way or other, to ſooth the afflicted heart; to carry ſome conſolation into the houſe of woe. In the ſcenes of ordinary life, in the domeſtic and ſocial inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes of men, the cordiality of his affections cheers and gladdens him. Every appearance, every deſcription of innocent happineſs, is enjoyed by him. Every native expreſſion of kindneſs and affection among others, is felt by him, even though he be not the object of it. Among a circle of friends, enjoying one another, he is as happy as the happieſt. In a word, he lives in a different ſort of world from what the ſelfiſh man inhabits. He poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes a new ſenſe that enables him to behold objects which the ſelfiſh cannot ſee. At the ſame time, his enjoyments are not of that kind which remain merely on the ſurface of the mind. They penetrate the heart. They enlarge and elevate, they refine and ennoble it. To all the pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing emotions of affection, they add the dignified conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of virtue.—Children of men! men formed by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to live and to feel as brethren! how long will ye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to eſtrange yourſelves from one another by compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions and jealouſies, when in cordial union ye might be ſo much more bleſt? How long will ye ſeek your happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in ſelfiſh gratifications alone, neglecting thoſe purer and better ſources of joy, which flow from the affections and the heart?</p>

                     <head>SECTION XII. On the true Honour of Man.</head>
                     <p>THE proper honour of man ariſes not from ſome of thoſe ſplendid actions and abilities, which excite high ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration. Courage and proweſs, military renown, ſignal victories and conqueſts, may render the name of a man famous without rendering his character truly honourable. To many brave men, to many heroes renowned in ſtory, we look up with wonder. Their exploits are recorded. Their praiſes are ſung. They ſtand as on an eminence above the reſt of mankind. Their eminence, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, may not be of that ſort, before which we bow with inward eſteem and reſpect. Something more is wanted for that purpoſe, than the conquering arm, and the intre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid mind. The laurels of the warrior muſt at all times be dyed in blood, and bedewed with the tears of the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow and the orphan. But if they have been ſtained by rapine and inhumanity; if ſordid avarice has marked his character; or low and groſs ſenſuality has degraded his life; the great hero ſinks into a little man. What at a diſtance, or on a ſuperficial view, we admired, becomes mean, perhaps odious, when we examine it more cloſely. It is like the Coloſſal ſtatue, whoſe immenſe ſize ſtruck the ſpectator afar off with aſtoniſhment; but when nearly viewed, it appears diſproportioned, unſhapely, and rude.</p>
                     <p>Obſervations of the ſame kind may be applied to all the reputation derived from civil accompliſhments; from the refined politics of the ſtateſman; or the literary ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts

                        </gap>o beſtow, eminence and diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on men. They diſcover talents which in themſelves are ſhining; and which become highly valuable, when employed in advancing the good of mankind. Hence, they frequently give riſe to fame. But a diſtinction is to be made between fame and true honour. The ſtateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, the orator, or the poet, may be famous; while yet the man himſelf is far from being honoured. We envy his abilities. We wiſh to rival them. But we would not chooſe to be claſſed with him who poſſeſſed them. Inſtances of this ſort are too often found in every record of ancient or modern hiſtory.</p>
                     <p>For all this it follows, that, in order to diſcern where man's true honour lies, we muſt look, not to any adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious circumſtance of fortune; not to any ſingle ſpark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling quality but to the whole of what forms a man; what entitles him, as ſuch, to rank high among that claſs of beings to which he belongs; in a word, we muſt look to the mind and the ſoul.—A mind ſuperior to fear, to ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh intereſt and corruption; a mind governed by the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of uniform rectitude and integrity; the ſame in proſperity and adverſity; which no bribe can ſeduce, nor terror overawe; neither by pleaſure melted into effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy, nor by diſtreſs ſunk into dejection: ſuch is the mind which forms the diſtinction and eminence of man.—One, who, in no ſituation of life, is either aſhamed or afraid of diſcharging his duty, and acting his proper part with firmneſs and conſtancy; true to the God whom he wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, and true to the faith in which he profeſſes to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; full of affection to his brethren of mankind; faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

                     <p>WHATEVER promotes and ſtrengthens virtue, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever calms and regulates the temper, is a ſource of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. Devotion produces thoſe effects in a remarkable degree. It inſpires compoſure of ſpirit, mildneſs and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity; weakens the painful, and cheriſhes the pleaſing emotions; and, by theſe means, carries on the life of a pious man in a ſmooth and placid tenour.</p>
                     <p>Beſides exerting this habitual influence on the mind, devotion opens a field of enjoyments, to which the vicious are entire ſtrangers; enjoyments the more valuable, as they peculiarly belong to retirement, when the world leaves us; and to adverſity, when it becomes our foe.
<pb n="243" facs="unknown:038017_0243_1010D5CCCBEA6270"/>
Theſe are the two ſeaſons, for which every wiſe man would moſt wiſh to provide ſome hidden ſtore of comfort. For let him be placed in the moſt favourable ſituation which the human ſtate admits, the world can neither al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways amuſe him, nor always ſhield him from diſtreſs. There will be many hours of vacuity, and many of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, in his life. If he be a ſtranger to God, and to devotion, how dreary will the gloom of ſolitude often prove! With what oppreſſive weight will ſickneſs, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment, or old age, fall upon his ſpirits! But for thoſe penſive periods, the pious man has a relief prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. From the tireſome repetition of the common vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of life, or from the painful corroſion of its cares and ſorrows, devotion tranſports him into a new region; and ſurrounds him there with ſuch objects, as are the moſt fitted to cheer the dejection, to calm the tumults, and to heal the wounds of his heart. If the world has been empty and deluſive, it gladdens him with the proſpect of a higher and better order of things, about to ariſe. If men have been ungrateful and baſe, it diſplays before him the faithfulneſs of that Supreme Being, who, though eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry other friend fail, will never forſake him. Let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult our experience, and we ſhall find, that the two great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſources of inward joy, are, the exerciſe of love di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected towards a deſerving object, and the exerciſe of hope terminating on ſome high and aſſured happineſs. Both theſe are ſupplied by devotion; and therefore we have no reaſon to be ſurpriſed, if, on ſome occaſions, it fills the hearts of good men with a ſatisfaction not to be expreſſed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="244" facs="unknown:038017_0244_1010D5CE54B64AB8"/>The refined pleaſures of a pious mind are, in many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, ſuperior to the coarſe gratifications of ſenſe. They are pleaſures which belong to the higheſt powers and beſt affections of the ſoul; whereas the gratifications of ſenſe reſide in the loweſt region of our nature. To the latter the ſoul ſtoops below its native dignity. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, raiſe it above itſelf. The latter, leave always a comfortleſs, often a motifying, remembrance behind them. The former, are reviewed with applauſe and delight. The pleaſures of ſenſe reſemble a foaming torrent, which after a diſorderly courſe, ſpeedily runs out, and leaves an empty and offenſive channel. But the pleaſures of devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion reſemble the equable current of a pure river, which enlivens the fields through which it paſſes, and diffuſes verdure and fertility along its banks. To thee, O De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion! we owe the higheſt improvement of our nature, and much of the enjoyment of our life. Thou art the ſupport of our virtue, and the reſt of our ſouls, in this tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent world. Thou compoſeſt the thoughts. Thou calmeſt the paſſions. Thou exalteſt the heart. Thy communications, and thine only, are imparted to the low, no leſs than to the high; to the poor, as well as to the rich.

                     <p>TO US, who dwell on its ſurface, the earth is by far the moſt extenſive orb that our eyes can any where be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold: it is alſo clothed with verdure, diſtinguiſhed by trees, and adorned with a variety of beautiful decorations; whereas, to a ſpectator placed on one of the planets, it wears a uniform aſpect; looks all luminous; and no larger than a ſpot. To beings who dwell at ſtill greater diſtances, it entirely diſappears. That which we call alternately the morning and the evening ſtar, as in one part of the orbit ſhe rides foremoſt in the proceſſion of night, in the other uſhers in and anticipates the dawn, is a planetary world, which, with the four others that ſo wonderfully vary their myſtic dance, are in themſelves dark bodies, and ſhine only by reflection; have fields and ſeas, and ſkies of their own; are furniſhed with all accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modations for animal ſubſiſtence, and are ſuppoſed to be the abodes of intellectual life; all which, together with our earthly habitation, are dependent on that grand diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſer of Divine munificence, the ſun; receive their light from the diſtribution of his rays, and derive their comfort from his benign agency.</p>
                     <p>The ſun, which ſeems to perform its daily ſtages through the ſky, is in this reſpect fixed and immoveable: it is the great axle of heaven, about which the globe we inhabit, and other more ſpacious orbs, wheel their ſtated courſes. The ſun, though ſeemingly ſmaller than the
<pb n="246" facs="unknown:038017_0246_1010D5D6C4ABEC40"/>
dial it illuminates, is abundantly larger than this whole earth, on which ſo many lofty mountains riſe, and ſuch vaſt oceans roll. A line extending from ſide to ſide through the centre of that reſplendent orb, would mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure more than eight hundred thouſand miles: a girdle formed to go round its circumference, would require a length of millions. Were its ſolid contents to be eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the account would overwhelm our underſtanding, and be almoſt beyond the power of language to expreſs. Are we ſtartled at theſe reports of philoſophy? Are we ready to cry out in a tranſport of ſurpriſe, "How mighty is the Being who kindled ſuch a prodigious fire; and keeps alive, from age to age, ſuch an enormous maſs of flame!" let us attend our philoſophic guides, and we ſhall be brought acquainted with ſpeculations more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged and more inflaming.</p>
                     <p>This ſun with all its attendant planets, is but a very little part of the grand machine of the univerſe; every ſtar, though in appearance no bigger than the diamond that glitters upon a lady's rings, is really a vaſt globe, like the ſun in ſize and in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>lory; no leſs ſpacious, no leſs lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous, than the radiant ſource of day. So that every ſtar, is not barely a world, but the centre of a magnificent ſyſtem; has a retinue of worlds, irradiated by its beams, and revolving round its attractive influence, all which are loſt to our ſight in unmeaſurable wilds of ether. That the ſtars appear like ſo many diminutive, and ſcarcely diſtinguiſhable points, is owing to their immenſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable diſtance. Immenſe and inconceivable indeed it is, ſince a ball, ſhot from the loaded cannon, and flying
<pb n="247" facs="unknown:038017_0247_1010D5D8C184EA80"/>
with unabated rapidity, muſt travel at this impetuous rate, almoſt ſeven hundred thouſand years, before it could reach the neareſt of theſe twinkling luminaries.</p>
                     <p>While, beholding this vaſt expanſe, I learn my own extreme meanneſs, I would alſo diſcover the abject little<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of all terreſtrial things. What is the earth, with all her oſtentatious ſcenes, compared with this aſtoniſhing grand furniture of the ſkies? What, but a dim ſpeck, hardly perceivable in the map of the univerſe? It is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by a very judicious writer, that if the ſun himſelf, which enlightens this part of the creation, were extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, and all the hoſt of planetary worlds, which move about him, were annihilated, they would not be miſſed by an eye that can take in the whole compaſs of nature, any more than a grain of ſand upon the ſea-ſhore. The bulk of which they conſiſt, and the ſpace which they occupy, are ſo exceedingly little in compariſon of the whole, that their loſs would ſcarcely leave a blank in the immenſity of God's works. If then, not our globe only, but this whole ſyſtem, be ſo very diminutive, what is a kingdom or a county? What are a few lordſhips, or the ſo much admired patrimonies of thoſe who are ſtyled wealthy? When I meaſure them with my own little pittance, they ſwell into proud and bloated dimenſions: but when I take the univerſe for my ſtandard, how ſcanty is their ſize, how contemptible their figure! They ſhrink into pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous nothings.</p>

                     <p>THERE is not a common ſaying, which has a better turn of ſenſe in it, than what we often hear in the mouths of the vulgar, that 'Cuſtom is a ſecond nature.' It is indeed able to form the man anew; and give him inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and capacities altogether different from thoſe he was born with. A perſon who is addicted to play or gaming, though he took but little delight in it at firſt, by degrees contracts ſo ſtrong an inclination towards it, and gives himſelf up ſo entirely to it, that it ſeems the only end of his being. The love of a retired or buſy life will grow upon a man inſenſibly, as he is converſant in the one or the other, till he is utterly unqualified for reliſhing that to which he has been for ſome time diſuſed. Nay, a man may ſmoke, or drink, or take fnuff, till he is unable to paſs away his time without it; not to mention how our delight in any particular ſtudy, art, or ſcience, riſes and improves, in proportion to the application which we beſtow upon it. Thus, what was at firſt an exerciſe, becomes at length an entertainment. Our employments are changed into diverſions. The mind grows fond of thoſe actions it is accuſtomed to; and is drawn with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctancy from thoſe paths in which it has been uſed to walk.</p>
                     <p>If we attentively conſider this property of human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it may inſtruct us in very fine moralities. In the firſt place, I would have no man diſcouraged with that
<pb n="249" facs="unknown:038017_0249_1010D5E01AF86758"/>
kind of life, or ſeries of action, in which the choice of others, or his own neceſſities, may have engaged him. It may perhaps be very diſagreeable to him, at firſt; but uſe and application will certainly render it not only leſs painful, but pleaſing and ſatisfactory.</p>
                     <p>In the ſecond place, I would recommend to every one, the admirable precept, which Pythagoras is ſaid to have given to his diſciples, and which that philoſopher muſt have drawn from the obſervation I have enlarged upon: "Pitch upon that courſe of life which is the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and cuſtom will render it the moſt delightful." Men, whoſe circumſtances will permit them to chooſe their own way of life, are inexcuſable if they do not purſue that which their judgment tells them is the moſt laudable. The voice of reaſon is more to be regarded, than the bent of any preſent inclination; ſince, by the rule above mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, inclination will at length come over to reaſon, though we can never force reaſon to comply with inclination.</p>
                     <p>In the third place, this obſervation may teach the moſt ſenſual and irreligious man, to overlook thoſe hardſhips and difficulties, which are apt to diſcourage him from the proſecution of a virtuous life. "The Gods," ſaid Heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od, "have placed labour before virtue; the way to her is at firſt rough and difficult, but grows more ſmooth and eaſy the farther we advance in it." The man who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds in it with ſteadineſs and reſolution, will in a little time, find that "her ways are ways of pleaſantneſs, and that all her paths are peace."</p>
                     <p>To enforce this conſideration, we may further obſerve, that the practice of religion will not only be attended with
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:038017_0250_1010D5E322134828"/>

                     <p>In the fourth place, we may learn from this obſervation, which we have made on the mind of man, to take parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular care, when we are once ſettled in a regular courſe of life, how we too frequently indulge ourſelves in even the moſt innocent diverſions and entertainments; ſince the mind may inſenſibly fall off from the reliſh of virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous actions, and, by degrees, exchange that pleaſure which it takes in the performance of its duty, for delights of a much inferior and an unprofitable nature.</p>
                     <p>The laſt uſe which I ſhall make of this remarkable property in human nature, of being delighted with thoſe actions to which it is accuſtomed, is, to ſhow how abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary it is for us to gain habits of virtue in this life, if we would enjoy the pleaſures of the next. The ſtate of bliſs, we call Heaven, will not be capable of affecting thoſe minds which are not thus qualified for it: we muſt, in this world, gain a reliſh of truth and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, if we would be able to taſte that knowledge and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, which are to make us happy in the next. The ſeeds of thoſe ſpiritual joys and raptures, which are to riſe up and flouriſh in the ſoul to all eternity, muſt be planted in it during this its preſent ſtate of probation. In ſhort, heaven is not to be looked upon only as the reward, but as the natural effect, of a religious life.</p>

The greateſt miniſter of ſtate has not more buſineſs to do, in a public capacity, than he, and indeed every other man, may find, in the retired and ſtill ſcenes of life. Even in his private walks, every thing that is viſible convinces him there is preſent a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inviſible. Aided by natural philoſophy, he reads plain legible traces of the Divinity in every thing he meets: he ſees the Deity in every tree, as well as Moſes did in the burning buſh, though not in ſo glaring a manner: and when he ſees him, he adores him with the tribute of a grateful heart.</p>

                     <p>TRUE candour is altogether different from that guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, inoffenſive language, and that ſtudied openneſs of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, which we ſo frequently meet with among men of the world. Smiling, very often, is the aſpect, and ſmooth are words, of thoſe who inwardly are the moſt ready to think evil of others. That candour which is a Chriſtian virtue, conſiſts, not in fairneſs of ſpeech, but in fairneſs of heart. It may want the blandiſhment of external courteſy, but ſupplies its place with humane and generous liberality of ſentiment. Its manners are unaffected, and its profeſſions cordial. Exempt, on one hand, from the dark jealouſy of a ſuſpicious mind, it is no leſs removed, on the other, from that eaſy credulity which is impoſed on by every ſpecious pretence. It is perfectly conſiſtent with extenſive knowledge of the world, and with due atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to our own ſafety. In that various intercourſe, which we are obliged to carry on with perſons of every differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent character, ſuſpicion, to a certain degree, is a neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry guard. It is only when it exceeds the bounds of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent caution, that it degenerates into vice. There is a proper mean between undiſtinguiſhing credulity, and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal jealouſy, which a ſound underſtanding diſcerns, and which the man of candour ſtudies to preſerve.</p>
                     <p>He makes allowance for the mixture of evil with good, which is to be found in every human character. He ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects none to be faultleſs: and he is unwilling to believe
<pb n="253" facs="unknown:038017_0253_1010D5EAC4F2D0B0"/>
that there is any without ſome commendable quality. In the midſt of many defects, he can diſcover a virtue. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the influence of perſonal reſentment, he can be juſt to the merit of an enemy. He never lends an open ear to thoſe defamatory reports and dark ſuggeſtions, which, among the tribes of the cenſorious, circulate with ſo much rapidity, and meet with ſuch ready acceptance. He is not haſty to judge, and he requires full evidence before he will condemn. As long as an action can be aſcribed to different motives, he holds it as no mark of ſagacity to impute it always to the worſt. Where there is juſt ground for doubt, he keeps his judgment undecided; and, during the period of ſuſpenſe, leans to the moſt charitable conſtruction which an action can bear. When he muſt condemn, he condemns with regret; and without thoſe aggravations which the ſeverity of others adds to the crime. He liſtens calmly to the apology of the offender, and readily admits every extenuating circumſtance, which equity can ſuggeſt. How much ſoever he may blame the principles of any ſect or party, he never confounds, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one general cenſure, all who belong to that party or ſect. He charges them not with ſuch conſequences of their tenets, as they refuſe and diſavow. From one wrong opinion, he does not infer the ſubverſion of all ſound principles; nor from one bad action, conclude that all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to conſcience is overthrown. When he "beholds the mote in his brother's eye," he remembers "the beam in his own." He commiſerates human frailty; and judges of others according to the principles, by which he would think it reaſonable that they ſhould judge of him. In a word, he views men and actions in the clear
<pb n="254" facs="unknown:038017_0254_1010D5EDE338F7C0"/>
ſunſhine of charity and good-nature; and not in that dark and ſullen ſhade which jealouſy and party-ſpirit throw over all characters.</p>

                     <head>SECTION XVIII. On the Imperfection of that Happineſs which reſts ſolely on worldly Pleaſures.</head>
                     <p>THE vanity of human pleaſures is a topic which might be embelliſhed with the pomp of much deſcription. But I ſhall ſtudiouſly avoid exaggeration, and only point out a threefold vanity in human life, which every impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial obſerver cannot but admit; diſappointment in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit, diſſatisfaction in enjoyment, uncertainty in poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, diſappointment in purſuit. When we look around us on the world, we every where behold a buſy multitude, intent on the proſecution of various deſigns, which their wants or deſires have ſuggeſted. We be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold them employing every method which ingenuity can deviſe; ſome the patience of induſtry, ſome the boldneſs of enterprize, others the dexterity of ſtratagem, in order to compaſs their ends. Of this inceſſant ſtir and activity, what is the fruit? In compariſon of the crowd who have toiled in vain, how ſmall is the number of the ſucceſsful? Or rather where is the man who will declare, that in every point he has completed his plan, and attained his utmoſt wiſh? No extent of human abilities has been able to diſcover a path which, in any line of life, leads un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erringly to ſucceſs. "The race is not always to the
<pb n="255" facs="unknown:038017_0255_1010D5EF6E3FCC48"/>
ſwift, nor the battle to the ſtrong, nor riches to men of underſtanding." We may form our plans with the moſt profound ſagacity, and with the moſt vigilant caution may guard againſt dangers on every ſide. But ſome unfore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen occurrence comes acroſs, which baffles our wiſdom, and lays our labours in the duſt.</p>
                     <p>Were ſuch diſappointments confined to thoſe who aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire at engroſſing the higher departments of life, the misfortune would be leſs. The humiliation of the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the fall of ambition from its towering height, lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle concern the bulk of mankind. Theſe are objects on which, as on diſtant meteors, they gaze from afar, without drawing perſonal inſtruction from events ſo much above them. But, alas! when we deſcend into the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of private life, we find diſappointment and blaſted hope equally prevalent there. Neither the moderation of our views, nor the juſtice of our pretenſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ons, can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſucceſs. But "time and chace happen to all." A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſtream of events, both the worthy and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſerving are obliged to ſtruggle; and both are frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly overborn alike by the current.</p>
                     <p>Beſides diſappointment in purſuit, diſſatisfaction in enjoyment is a farther vanity, to which the human ſtate is ſubject. This is the ſevereſt of all mortifications, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having been ſucceſsful in the purſuit, to be baffled in the enjoyment itſelf. Yet this is found to be an evil ſtill more general than the former. Some may be ſo fortunate as to attain what they have purſued; but none are ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered completely happy by what they have attained. Diſappointed hope is miſery; and yet ſucceſsful hope is only imperfect bliſs. Look through all the ranks of
<pb n="256" facs="unknown:038017_0256_1010D5F40F173C48"/>
mankind. Examine the condition of thoſe who appear moſt proſperous; and you will find that they are never juſt what they deſire to be. If retired, they languiſh for action; if buſy, they complain of fatigue. If in middle life, they are impatient for diſtinction; if in high ſtations, they ſigh after freedom and eaſe. Something is ſtill wanting to that plenitude of ſatisfaction, which they expected to acquire. Together with every wiſh that is gratified, a new demand ariſes. One void opens in the heart, as another is filled. On wiſhes, wiſhes grow; and to the end, it is rather the expectation of what they have not, than the enjoyment of what they have, which occupies and intereſts the moſt ſucceſsful.</p>
                     <p>This diſſatisfaction in the midſt of human pleaſure, ſprings partly from the nature of our enjoyments them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and partly from circumſtances which corrupt them. No worldly enjoyments are adequate to the high deſires and powers of an immortal ſpirit. Fancy paints them at a diſtance with ſplendid colours; but poſſeſſion unveils the fallacy. The eagerneſs of paſſion beſtows upon them, at firſt a briſk and lively reliſh. But it is their fate always to pall by familiarity, and ſometimes to paſs from ſatiety into diſguſt. Happy would the poor man think himſelf, if he could enter on all the treaſures of the rich; and happy for a ſhort time he might be: but before he had long contemplated and admired his ſtate, his poſſeſſions would ſeem to leſſen, and his cares would grow.</p>
                     <p>Add to the unſatisfying nature of our pleaſures, the attending circumſtances which never fail to corrupt them. For, ſuch as they are, they are at no time poſſeſſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed. To human lips it is not given to taſte the cup
<pb n="257" facs="unknown:038017_0257_1010D5F767BEB2A8"/>
of pure joy. When external circumſtances ſhow faireſt to the world, the envied man groans in private under his own burden. Some vexation diſquiets, ſome paſſion corrodes him; ſome diſtreſs, either felt or feared, gnaws, like a worm, the root of his felicity. When there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from without to diſturb the proſperous, a ſecret poiſon operates within. For worldly happineſs ever tends to deſtroy itſelf, by corrupting the heart. It foſters the looſe and the violent paſſions. It engenders noxious habits; and taints the mind with falſe delicacy, which makes it feel a thouſand unreal evils.</p>
                     <p>But put the caſe in the moſt favourable light. Lay aſide from human pleaſures both diſappointment in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit, and deceitfulneſs in enjoyment; ſuppoſe them to be fully attainable, and completely ſatisfactory; ſtill there remains to be conſidered the vanity of uncertain poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ſhort duration. Were there i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But our condition is ſuch, that every thing wavers and tot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters around us. "Boaſt not thyſelf of to-morrow; for thou knoweſt not what a day may bring forth." It is much if, during its courſe, thou heareſt not of ſomewhat to diſquiet or alarm thee. For life never proceeds long in a uniform train. It is continually varied by unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected events. The ſeeds of alteration are every where ſown; and the ſunſhine of proſperity commonly acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerates their growth. If our enjoyments be numerous, we lie more open on different ſides to be wounded. If we have poſſeſſed them long, we have greater cauſe to dread an approach<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

riſes; but rapid is the progreſs of evil. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires no preparation to bring it forward. The edifice which it coſt much time and labour to erect, one inauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious event, one ſudden blow, can level with the duſt. Even ſuppoſing the accidents of life to leave us untouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, human bliſs muſt ſtill be tranſitory; for man changes of himſelf. No courſe of enjoyment can delight us long. What amuſed our youth, loſes its charm in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turer age. As years advance, our powers are blunted, and our pleaſurable feelings decline. The ſilent lapſe of time is ever carrying ſomewhat from us, till at length the period comes, when all muſt be ſwept away. The proſpect of this termination of our labours and purſuits, is ſufficient to mark our ſtate with vanity. "Our days are a hand-breadth, and our age is a nothing." With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in that little ſpace is all our enterp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>This much let it ſuffice to have ſaid concerning the vanity of the world. That too much has not been ſaid, muſt appear to every one who conſiders how generally mankind lean to the oppoſite ſide; and how often, by undue attachment to the preſent ſtate, they both feed the moſt ſinful paſſions, and "pierce themſelves through with many ſorrows."</p>

                     <head>SECTION XIX. What are the real and ſolid enjoyments of Human Life</head>
                     <p>IT muſt be admitted, that unmixed and complete hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs is unknown on earth. No regulation of conduct can altogether prevent paſſions from diſturbing our peace, and misfortunes from wounding our heart. But after this conceſſion is made, will it follow, that there is no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject on earth which deſerves our purſuit, or that all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment becomes contemptible which is not perfect? Let us ſurvey our ſtate with an impartial eye, and be juſt to the various gifts of Heaven. How vain ſoever this life, conſidered in itſelf, may be, the comforts and hopes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion are ſufficient to give ſolidity to the enjoyments of the righteous. In the exerciſe of good affections, and the teſtimony of an approving conſcience; in the ſenſe of peace and reconciliation with God, through the great Redeemer of mankind; in the firm confidence of being conducted through all the trials of life, by infinite wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and goodneſs; and in the joyful proſpect of arriving, in the end, at immortal felicity, they poſſeſs a happineſs which, deſcending from a purer and more perfect region than this world, partakes not of its vanity.</p>
                     <p>Beſides the enjoyments peculiar to religion, there are other pleaſures of our preſent ſtate, which, though of an inferior order, muſt not be overlooked in the eſtimate of human life. It is neceſſary to call attention to theſe, in order to check that repining and unthankful ſpirit to
<pb n="260" facs="unknown:038017_0260_1010D6001F503858"/>
which man is always too prone. Some degree of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance muſt be allowed to the comforts of health, to the innocent gratifications of ſenſe, and to the entertainment afforded us by all the beautiful ſcenes of nature; ſome to the purſuits and harmleſs amuſements of ſocial life; and more to the internal enjoyments of thought and reflection, and to the pleaſures of affectionate intercourſe with thoſe whom we love. Theſe comforts are often held in too low eſtimation, merely becauſe they are ordinary and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon; although that is the circumſtance which ought, in reaſon, to enhance their value. They lie open, in ſome degree, to all; extend through every rank of life, and fill up agreeably many of thoſe ſpaces in our preſent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence, which are not occupied with higher objects, or with ſerious cares.</p>
                     <p>From this repreſentation it appears that, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the vanity of the world, a conſiderable degree of comfort is attainable in the preſent ſtate. Let the recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of this ſerve to reconcile us to our condition, and to repreſs the arrogance of complaints and murmurs.— What art thou, O ſon of man! who, having ſprung but yeſterday out of the duſt, dareſt to lift up thy voice againſt thy Maker, and to arraign his providence, becauſe all things are not ordered according to thy wiſh?

Are all the hours forgotten which thou haſt paſt in eaſe, in complacency, or joy? Is it a ſmall favour in thy eyes, that the hand of Divine Mercy has been ſtretched forth to aid thee, and, if thou reject not its proffered aſſiſtance, is ready to conduct thee into a happier ſtate of exiſtence? When thou compareſt thy condition with thy deſert, bluſh, and be aſhamed of thy complaints. Be ſilent, be grateful, and adore.

and inquiries, it is amazing to conſider the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity of animals with which it is ſtocked. Every part of matter is peopled; every green leaf ſwarms with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants. There is ſcarcely a ſingle humour in the body of a man, or of any other animal, in which our glaſſes do not diſcover myriads of living creatures. We find, even in the moſt ſolid bodies, as in marble itſelf, innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable cells and cavities, which are crowded with ſuch imperceptible inhabitants, as are too little for the naked eye to diſcover. On the other hand, if we look into the more bulky parts of nature, we ſee the ſeas, lakes, and rivers, teeming with numberleſs kinds of living creatures. We find every mountain and marſh, wilderneſs and wood, plentifully ſtocked with birds and beaſts; and every part of matter affording proper neceſſaries and conveniencies, for the livelihood of multitudes which inhabit it.</p>
                     <p>The author of "the Plurality of Worlds," draws a very good argument from this conſideration, for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling of every planet; as indeed it ſeems very probable, from the analogy of reaſon, that if no part of matter, with which we are acquainted, lies waſte and uſeleſs, thoſe great bodies, which are at ſuch a diſtance from us, are not deſert and unpeopled; but rather, that they are fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with beings adapted to their reſpective ſituations.</p>
                     <p>Exiſtence is a bleſſing to thoſe beings only which are endowed with perception; and is in a manner thrown away upon dead matter, any farther than as it is ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient to beings which are conſcious of their exiſtence. Accordingly we find, from the bodies which lie under our obſervation, that matter is only made as the baſis and

It is wonderful to obſerve, by what a gradual progreſs the world of life advances, through a prodigious variety of ſpecies, before a creature is formed, that is complete in all its ſenſes: and even among theſe, there is ſuch a different degree of perfection, in the ſenſe which one animal enjoys beyond what appears in another, that though the ſenſe in different animals is diſtinguiſhed by the ſame common denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it ſeems almoſt of a different nature. If, after this, we look into the ſeveral inward perfections, of cunning and ſagacity, or what we generally call inſtinct, we find them riſing, after the ſame manner, imperceptibly one above another; and receiving additional improvements, according to the ſpecies in which they are implanted.
<pb n="264" facs="unknown:038017_0264_1010D60DDB099D98"/>
This progreſs in nature is ſo very gradual, that the moſt perfect of an inferior ſpecies, comes very near to the moſt imperfect of that which is immediately above it.</p>
                     <p>The exuberant and overflowing goodneſs of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Being, whoſe mercy extends to all his works, is plainly ſeen, as I have before hinted, in his having made ſo very little matter, at leaſt what falls within our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that does not ſwarm with life. Nor is his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs leſs ſeen in the diverſity, than in the multitude of living creatures. Had he made but one ſpecies of ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, none of the reſt would have enjoyed the happineſs of exiſtence: he has therefore, <hi>ſpecified,</hi> in his creation, every degree of life, every capacity of being. The whole chaſm of nature, from a plant to a man, is filled up with diverſe kinds of creatures, riſing one after another, by ſuch a gentle and eaſy aſcent, that the little tranſitions and deviations from one ſpecies to another, are almoſt inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. This intermediate ſpace is ſo well huſbanded and managed, that there is ſcarcely a degree of perception, which does not appear in ſome one part of the world of life. Is the goodneſs, or the wiſdom of the Divine Being, more manifeſted in this his proceeding?</p>
                     <p>There is a conſequence, beſides thoſe I have already mentioned, which ſeems very naturally deducible from the foregoing conſiderations. If the ſcale of being riſes by ſuch a regular progreſs, ſo high as man, we may, by parity of reaſon, ſuppoſe, that it ſtill proceeds gradually through thoſe beings which are of a ſuperior nature to him; ſince there is infinitely great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſpace and room for different degree<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

between the Supreme Being and man, than between man and the moſt deſpicable inſect.</p>
                     <p>In this great ſyſtem of being, there is no creature ſo wonderful in its nature, and which ſo much deſerves our particular attention, as man; who fills up the middle ſpace between the animal and the intellectual nature, the viſible and the inviſible world; and who is that link in the chain of beings, which forms the connexion between both. So that he who, in one reſpect, is aſſociated with angels and arch-angels, and may look upon a being of infinite per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection as his father, and the higheſt order of ſpirits as his brethren, may, in another reſpect, ſay, to "corruption, thou art my father, and to the worm, thou art my mother and my ſiſter."</p>

                     <p>MAN, conſidered in himſelf, is a very helpleſs, and a very wretched being. He is ſubject every moment to the greateſt calamities and misfortunes. He is beſet with dangers on all ſides; and may become unhappy by num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs caſualties, which he could not foreſee, nor have have prevented had he foreſeen them.</p>
                     <p>It is our comfort, while we are obnoxious to ſo many accidents, that we are under the care of ONE who directs contingencies, and has in his hands the management of every thing that is capable of annoying or offending us;
<pb n="266" facs="unknown:038017_0266_1010D61245256200"/>
who knows the aſſiſtance we ſtand in need of, and is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ready to beſtow it on thoſe who aſk it of him.</p>
                     <p>The natural homage, which ſuch a creature bears to ſo infinitely wiſe and good a Being, is a firm reliance on him for the bleſſings and conveniences of life; and an habitual truſt in him, for deliverance out of all ſuch dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and difficulties as may befall us.</p>
                     <p>The man who always lives in this diſpoſition of mind, has not the ſame dark and melancholy views of human nature, as he who conſiders himſelf abſtractedly from this relation to the Supreme Being. At the ſame time that he reflects upon his own weakneſs and imperfection, he comforts himſelf with the contemplation of thoſe divine attributes, which are employed for his ſafety, and his wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare. He finds his want of foreſight made up, by the omniſcience of him who is his ſupport. He is not ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of his own want of ſtrength, when he knows that his helper is almighty. In ſhort, the perſon who has a firm truſt on the Supreme Being, is powerful in his power, wiſe by his wiſdom, happy by his happineſs. He reaps the benefit of every divine attribute; and loſes his own inſufficiency in the fulneſs of infinite perfection.</p>
                     <p>To make our lives more eaſy to us, we are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to put our truſt in him, who is thus able to relieve and ſuccour us; the Divine goodneſs having made ſuch a reliance a duty, notwithſtanding we ſhould have been miſerable, had it been forbidden us.</p>
                     <p>Among ſeveral motives, which might be made uſe of to recommend this duty to us, I ſhall only take notice of thoſe that follow.</p>
                     <p>The firſt and ſtrongeſt is, that we are promiſed, He will not fail thoſe who put their truſt in him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="267" facs="unknown:038017_0267_1010D613D27F0410"/>But without conſidering the ſupernatural bleſſing, which accompanies this duty, we may obſerve, that it has a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural tendency to its own reward; or, in other words, that this firm truſt and confidence in the great Diſpoſer of all things, contributes very much to the getting clear of any affliction, or to the bearing of it manfully. A per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who believes he has his ſuccour at hand, and that he acts in the ſight of his friend, often exerts himſelf beyond his abilities; and does wonders, that are not to be match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by one who is not animated with ſuch a confidence of ſucceſs. Truſt in the aſſiſtance of an Almighty Being, naturally produces patience, hope, cheerfulneſs, and all other diſpoſitions of mind, which alleviate thoſe calamities that we are not able to remove.</p>
                     <p>The practice of this virtue adminiſters great comfort to the mind of man, in times of poverty and affliction; but moſt of all, in the hour of death. When the ſoul is hovering, in the laſt moments of its ſeparation: when it is juſt entering on another ſtate of exiſtence, to converſe with ſcenes, and objects, and companions, that are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether new; what can ſupport her under ſuch tremblings of thought, ſuch fear, ſuch anxiety, ſuch apprehenſions, but the caſting of all her cares upon HIM, who firſt gave her being; who has conducted her through one ſtage of it; and who will be always preſent, to guide and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort her in her progreſs through eternity?</p>

                     <head>SECTION XXII. Piety and Gratitude enliven Proſperity.</head>
                     <p>PIETY, and gratitude to God, contribute, in a high degree, to enliven proſperity. Gratitude is a pleaſing emotion. The ſenſe of being diſtinguiſhed by the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of another gladdens the heart, warms it with recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal affection, and gives to any poſſeſſion which is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in itſelf, a double reliſh, from its being the gift of a friend. Favours conferred by men, I acknowledge, may prove burdenſome. For human virtue is never perfect; and ſometimes unreaſonable expectations on the one ſide, ſometimes a mortifying ſenſe of dependence on the other, corrode in ſecret the pleaſure of benefits, and convert the obligations of friendſhip into grounds of jealouſy. But nothing of this kind can affect the intercourſe of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude with Heaven. Its favours are wholly diſintereſted; and with a gratitude the moſt cordial and unſuſpicious, a good man looks up to that Almighty Benefactor, who aims at no end but the happineſs of thoſe whom he bleſſes, and who deſires no return f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>om them, but a devout and thankful heart. While others can trace their proſperity to no higher ſource than a concurrence of worldly cauſes; and, often, of mean or trifling incidents, which occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally favoured their deſigns; with what ſuperior ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion does the ſervant of God remark the hand of that Gracious Power which hath raiſed him up; which hath happily conducted him through the various ſteps of life,
<pb n="269" facs="unknown:038017_0269_1010D61D416427C8"/>
and crowned him with the moſt favourable diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond his equals?</p>
                     <p>Let us farther conſider, that not only gratitude for the the paſt, but a cheering ſenſe of Divine favour at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, enters into the pious emotion. They are only the virtuous, who in their proſperous days hear this voice ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed to them, "Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a cheerful heart; for God now accepteth thy works." He who is the Author of their proſperity, gives them a title to enjoy, with complacency, his own gift. While bad men ſnatch the pleaſures of the world as by ſtealth, without countenance from the Great Proprietor of the world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the righteous ſit openly down to the feaſt of life, under the ſmile of approving Heaven. No guilty fears damp their joys. The bleſſing of God reſts upon all that they poſſeſs; his protection ſurrounds them; and hence, "in the habitations of the righteous, is found the voice of rejoicing and ſalvation." A luſtre unknown to others, inveſts, in their ſight, the whole face of nature. Their piety reflects a ſunſhine from heaven upon the proſperity of the world; unites in one point of view, the ſmiling aſpect, both of the powers above, and of the objects below. Not only have they as full a reliſh as others, of the innocent pleaſures of life, but, moreover, in theſe they hold communion with their Divine Benefactor. In all that is good or fair, they trace his hand. From the beauties of nature, from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements of art, from the enjoyments of ſocial life, they raiſe their affection to the ſource of all the happineſs which ſurrounds them; and thus widen the ſphere of their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, by adding intellectual, and ſpiritual, to earthly j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

How many inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Divine goodneſs aroſe before him in pleaſing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, when with ſuch reliſh he ſpeaks of the "green paſtures and ſtill waters, beſide which God had led him; of his cup which he had made to overflow; and of the table which he had prepared for him in the preſence of his enemies!" With what perfect tranquility does he look forward to the time of his paſſing through "the valley of the ſhadow of death;" unappalled by that ſpectre, whoſe moſt diſtant appearance blaſts the proſperity of ſinners! He fears no evil, as long as "the rod and the ſtaff" of his Divine Shepherd are with him; and, through all the unknown periods of this and of future exiſtence, commits himſelf to his guidance with ſecure and triumphant hope: "Surely goodneſs and mercy will follow me all the days of my life; and I ſhall dwell in the houſe of the Lord forever."—What a purified, ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental enjoyment of proſperity is here exhibited! How different from that groſs reliſh of worldly pleaſures, which belongs to thoſe who behold only the terreſtrial ſide of things; who raiſe their views to no higher objects than the ſucceſſion of human contingences, and the weak ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts

                     <p>THE city of Sidon having ſurrendered to Alexander, he ordered Hepheſtion to beſtow the crown on him whom the Sidonians ſhould think moſt worthy of that honor. Hepheſtion being at that time reſident with two young men of diſtinction, offered them the kingdom; but they refuſed, it telling him that it was contrary to the laws of their country, to admit any one to that honor, who was not of the royal family. He then, having expreſſed his admiration of their diſintereſted ſpirit, deſired them to name one of the royal race, who might remember that he received the crown through their hands. Overlook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many, who would have been ambitious of this high honor, they made choice of Abdolonymus, whoſe ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar merit had rendered him conſpicuous, even in the vale of obſcurity.

They informed him that Alexander had appointed him to that office; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired him immediately to exchange his ruſtic garb, and utenſils of huſbandry, for the regal robe and ſceptre. At the ſame time, they admoniſhed him, when he ſhould be ſeated on the throne, and have a nation in his power, not to forget the humble condition from which he had been raiſed.</p>
                     <p>All this, at the firſt, appeared to Abdolonymus as an illuſion of the fancy, or an inſult offered to his poverty. He requeſted them not to trouble him farther with their impertinent jeſts; and to find ſome other way of amuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves, which might leave him in the peaceable enjoyment of his obſcure habitation.—At length, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, they convinced him, that they were ſerious in their propoſal; and prevailed upon him to accept the regal office, and accompany them to the palace.</p>

He commanded the new-elected prince to be ſent for; and required of him, with what temper of mind he had borne his poverty. "Would to heaven," replied Abdolonymus, "that I may be able to bear my crown with equal moderation: for when I poſſeſſed little, I wanted nothing: theſe hands ſupplied me with whatever I deſired." From this anſwer, Alexander formed ſo high an idea of his wiſdom, that he confirmed the choice which had been made; and annexed a neighbouring province to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Sidon.</p>

                     <p>WITH regard to my poverty, the king has, indeed, been juſtly informed. My whole eſtate conſiſts in a houſe of but mean appearance, and a little ſpot of ground; from which, by my own labour, I draw my ſupport. But if, by any means, thou haſt been perſuaded to think that this poverty renders me of leſs conſequence in my own country, or in any degree unhappy, thou art greatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. I have no reaſon to complain of fortune; ſhe ſupplies me with all that nature requires; and if I am without ſuperfluities, I am alſo free from the deſire of them.

They know the many opportunities I have had to enrich myſelf, without cenſure; they are convinced of my diſintereſted zeal for their proſperity: and if I have any thing to complain of, in the return they make me, it is only the exceſs of their applauſe. What value, then, can I put on thy gold and ſilver? What king can add any thing to my fortune?

                     <p>No Prince, ſo little enterpriſing and ſo inoffenſive, was ever ſo much expoſed to the oppoſite extremes of calumny and flattery, of ſatire and panegyric. And the factions which began in his time, being ſtill continued, have made his character be as much diſputed to this day, as is commonly that of princes who are our contempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raries. Many virtues, however, it muſt be owned, he was poſſeſſed of; but not one of them pure, or free from the contagion of the neighbouring vices. His generoſity bordered on profuſion, his learning on pedantry, his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cific diſpoſition on puſillanimity, his wiſdom on cunning, his friendſhip on light fancy and boyiſh fondneſs. While he imagined that he was only maintaining his own au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, he may perhaps be ſuſpected in ſome of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ſtill more of his pretenſions, to have encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the liberties of his people. While he endeavoured,

by an exact neutrality, to acquire the good-will of all his neighbours, he was able to preſerve fully the eſteem and regard of none. His capacity was conſiderable, but fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to diſcourſe on general maxims, than to conduct any intricate buſineſs.</p>
                     <p>His intentions were juſt, but more adapted to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of private life, than to the government of kingdoms. Aukward in his perſon, and ungainly in his manners, he was ill qualified to command reſpect: partial and undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning in his affections, he was little fitted to acquire general love. Of a feeble temper, more than of a fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal judgment; expoſed to our ridicule from his vanity, but exempt from our hatred by his freedom from pride and arrogance. And, upon the whole, it may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced of his character, that all his qualities were ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied with weakneſs, and embelliſhed by humanity.

his kingdoms; and to withdraw entirely from any concern in buſineſs or the affairs of this world, in order that he might ſpend the remainder of his days in retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſolitude. Though it requires neither deep re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, nor extraordinary diſcernment, to diſcover that the ſtate of royalty is not exempt from cares and diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments; though moſt of thoſe who are exalted to a throne, find ſolicitude, and ſatiety, and diſguſt, to be their perpetual attendants, in that envied pre-eminence; yet, to deſcend voluntarily from the ſupreme to a ſubordinate ſtation, and to relinquiſh the poſſeſſion of power in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to attain the enjoyment of happineſs, ſeems to be an effort too great for the human mind. Several inſtances, indeed, occur in hiſtory, of monarchs who have quitted a throne, and have ended their days in retirement. But they were either weak princes, who took this reſolution raſhly, and repented of it as ſoon as it was taken; or unfortunate princes, from whoſe hands ſome ſtrong rival had wreſted their ſceptre, and compelled them to deſcend with reluctance into a private ſtation.

paſſion had been uniformly the love of power, at the age of fifty-ſix, when objects of ambition operate with full force on the mind, and are purſued with the greateſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, to take a reſolution ſo ſingular and unexpected.</p>
                     <p>The emperor, in purſuance of his determination, having aſſembled the ſtates of the Low Countries at Bruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, ſeated himſelf, for the laſt time, in the chair of ſtate; on one ſide of which was placed his ſon, and on the other, his ſiſter the queen of Hungary, regent of the Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, with a ſplendid retinue of the grandees of Spain and the princes of the empire ſtanding behind him. The preſident of the council of Flanders, by his command, explained, in a few words, his intention in calling this extraordinary meeting of the ſtates. He then read the inſtrument of reſignation, by which Charles ſurrendered to his ſon Philip all his territories, juriſdiction, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in the Low Countries; abſolving his ſubjects there from their oath of allegiance to him, which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired them to transfer to Philip his lawful heir; and to ſerve him with the ſame loyalty and zeal that they ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Charles then roſe from his ſeat, and leaning on the ſhoulder of the Prince of Orange, becauſe he was unable to ſtand without ſupport, he addreſſed himſelf to the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; and, from a paper which he held in his hand, in order to aſſiſt his memory, he recounted, with dignity, but without oſtentation, all the great things which he had undertaken and performed, ſince the commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his adminiſtration. He obſerved, that from the ſeventeenth year of his age, he had dedicated all
<pb n="278" facs="unknown:038017_0278_1010D637166FE580"/>
his thoughts and attention to public objects, reſerving no portion of his time for the indulgence of his eaſe, and very little for the enjoyment of private pleaſure; that either in a pacific or hoſtile manner, he had viſited Germany nine times, Spain ſix times, France four times, Italy ſeven times, the Low Countries ten times, England twice, Africa as often, and had made eleven voyages by ſea; that while his health permitted him to diſcharge his duty, and the vigour of his conſtitution was equal in any degree, to the arduous office of governing ſuch extenſive dominions, he had never ſhunned labour, nor repined un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der fatigue; that now, when his health was broken, and his vigour exhauſted by the rage of an incurable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper, his growing infirmities admoniſhed him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire; nor was he ſo fond of reigning, as to retain the ſceptre in an impotent hand, which was no longer able to protect his ſubjects, or to render them happy; that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a ſovereign worn out with diſeaſes, and ſcarcely half alive, he gave them one in the prime of life, accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed already to govern, and who added to the vigour of youth all the attention and ſagacity of maturer years<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that if, during the courſe of a long adminiſtration, he had committed any material error in government, or if, under the preſſure of ſo many and great affairs, and amidſt the attention which he had been obliged to give to them, he had either neglected or injured any of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, he now implored their forgiveneſs; that, for his part, he ſhould ever retain a grateful ſenſe of their fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and attachment, and would carry the remembrance of it along with him to the place of his retreat, as his ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt conſolation, as well as the beſt reward for all his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices;
<pb n="279" facs="unknown:038017_0279_1010D63A10534E58"/>
and, in his laſt prayers to Almighty God, would pour forth his ardent wiſhes for their welfare.</p>
                     <p>Then turning towards Philip, who fell on his knees and kiſſed his father's hand, "If," ſays he, "I had left you, by my death, this rich inheritance, to which I have made ſuch large additions, ſome regard would have been juſtly due to my memory on that account; but now, when I voluntarily reſign to you what I might have ſtill retained, I may well expect the warmeſt expreſſions of thanks on your part. With theſe, however, I diſpenſe; and ſhall conſider your concern for the welfare of your ſubjects, and your love of them, as the beſt and moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable teſtimony of your gratitude to me. It is in your power, by a wiſe and virtuous adminiſtration, to juſtify the extraordinary proof which I give this day of my pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal affection, and to demonſtrate that you are worthy of the confidence which I repoſe in you. Preſerve an inviolable regard for religion; maintain the Catholic faith in its purity; let the laws of your country be ſacred in your eyes; encroach not on the rights and privileges of your people; and, if the time ſhall ever come, when you ſhall wiſh to enjoy the tranquility of private life, may you have a ſon endowed with ſuch qualities, that you can reſign your ſceptre to him, with as much ſatisfaction as I give up mine to you."</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as Charles had finiſhed this long addreſs to his ſubjects, and to their new ſovereign, he ſunk into the chair, exhauſted and ready to faint with the fatigue of ſuch an extraordinary effort. During his diſcourſe, the whole audience melted into tears; ſome from admiration of his magnanimity; others ſoftened by the expreſſions
<pb n="280" facs="unknown:038017_0280_1010D63D2B891888"/>
of tenderneſs towards his ſon, and of love to his people; and all were affected with the deepeſt ſorrow, at loſing a ſovereign, who had diſtinguiſhed the Netherlands, his native country, with particular marks of his regard and attachment.</p>

                     <p>A FEW weeks after the reſignation of the Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, Charles, in an aſſembly no leſs ſplendid, and with a ceremonial equally pompous, reſigned to the ſon the crowns of Spain, with all the territories depending on them, both in the old and in the new world.

                     <p>Nothing now remained to detain him from that retreat for which he languiſhed.

                        </gap> by his ſon Philip, his daughter the Arch-ducheſs, his ſiſters the Dowager Queens of France and Hungary, Maximilian his ſon-in-law, and a numerous retinue of
<pb n="281" facs="unknown:038017_0281_1010D6403396B9E0"/>
the Flemiſh nobility. Before he went on board, he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed them, with marks of his attention or regard; and taking leave of Philip with all the tenderneſs of a father who embraced his ſon for the laſt time, he ſet ſail under convoy of a large fleet of Spaniſh, Flemiſh, and Engliſh ſhips.</p>
                     <p>His voyage was proſperous and agreeable; and he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at Laredo in Biſcay, on the eleventh day after he left Zealand. As ſoon as he landed, he fell proſtrate on the ground and conſidering himſelf now as dead to the world, he kiſſed the earth, and ſaid, "Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked I now return to thee, thou common mother of mankind." From Laredo he proceeded to Valladolid. There he took a laſt and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der leave of his two ſiſters; whom he would not permit to accompany him to his ſolitude, though they entreated it with tears; not only that they might have the conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of contributing, by their attendance and care, to mitigate or to ſooth his ſufferings, but that they might reap inſtruction and benefit, by joining with him in thoſe pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous exerciſes, to which he had conſecrated the remainder of his days.</p>
                     <p>From Valladolid, he continued his journey to Plazen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia in Eſtremadura. He had paſſed through that city a great many years before; and having been ſtruck at that time with the delightful ſituation of the monaſtery of St. Juſtus, belonging to the order of St. Jerome, not many miles diſtant from that place, he had then obſerved to ſome of his attendants, that this was a ſpot to which Diocleſian might have retired with pleaſure. The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion had remained ſo ſtrong on his mind, that he pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="282" facs="unknown:038017_0282_1010D6430E1FFF50"/>
upon it as the place of his retreat. It was ſeated in a vale of no great extent, watered by a ſmall brook, and ſurrounded by riſing grounds, covered with lofty trees: from the nature of the ſoil, as well as the temperature of the climate, it was eſteemed the moſt healthful and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious ſituation in Spain. Some months before his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation, he had ſent an architect thither, to add a new apartment to the monaſtery, for his accommodation; but he gave ſtrict orders, that the ſtyle of the building ſhould be ſuch as ſuited his preſent ſtation, rather than his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer dignity. It conſiſted only of ſix rooms, four of them in the form of friars' cells, with naked walls; the other two, each twenty feet ſquare, were hung with brown cloth and furniſhed in the moſt ſimple manner. They were all on a level with the ground; with a door on one ſide into a garden, of which Charles himſelf had given the plan, and had filled it with various plants, which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to cultivate with his own hands. On the other ſide, they communicated with the chapel of the monaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, in which he was to perform his devotions. Into this humble retreat, hardly ſufficient for the comfortable accommodation of a private gentleman, did Charles en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, with twelve domeſtics only. He buried there, in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude and ſilence, his grandeur, his ambition, together with all thoſe vaſt projects, which, during half a century, had alarmed and agitated Europe; filling every kingdom in it, by turns, with the terror of his arms, and the dread of being ſubjected to his power.</p>
                     <p>In this retirement Charles formed ſuch a plan of life for himſelf, as would have ſuited the condition of a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
<pb n="283" facs="unknown:038017_0283_1010D644E40655F8"/>
perſon of a moderate fortune. His table was neat but plain; his domeſtics few; his intercourſe with them fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar; all the cumberſome and ceremonious forms of attendance on his perſon were entirely aboliſhed, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive of that ſocial eaſe and tranquility, which he courted, in order to ſooth the remainder of his days. As the mildneſs of the climate, together with his deliverance from the burdens and cares of government, procured him, at firſt, a conſiderable remiſſion from the acute pains with which he had been long tormented, he enjoyed, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, more complete ſatisfaction in this humble ſolitude, than all his grandeur had ever yielded him. The am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious thoughts and projects, which had ſo long engroſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and diſquieted him, were quite effaced from his mind. Far from taking any part in the political tranſactions of the princes of Europe, he reſtrained his curioſity even from any inquiry concerning them; and he ſeemed to view the buſy ſcene which he had abandoned, with all the contempt and indifference ariſing from his thorough experience of its vanity, as well as from the pleaſing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection of having diſentangled himſelf from its cares.</p>

Three objects are propoſed by Mr. Murray, in giving this volume to the world: firſt, to improve youth in the indiſpenſable art of reading; ſecondly, to meliorate their language and ſentiments; and thirdly, to inculcate ſome of the moſt important principles of piety and virtue.—The articles ſelected for the firſt of theſe purpoſes, are peculiarly calculated for exerciſing the various pauſes, inflections, and modulations of the voice; they are judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly diverſified and proportioned, and accurately punctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted—In purſuance of his ſecond object, Mr. Murray has made his ſelections from the moſt correct and elegant writers; and purity, propriety, and perſpicuity, of courſe, character<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ize them.—In his third department, we find extracts ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tending to promote piety and virtue.

In no part of the work do we meet with an expreſſion that might gratify a corrupt, or viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate a pure mind; nor a ſentiment that can offend the ear of innocence. The Peruſal of the Sacred Scriptures is pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully recommended, by the frequent inſertion of the moſt ſublime, beautiful, and intereſting paſſages of theſe invalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble writings. But though the general caſt of the volume partakes more of the grave than the gay, yet is it not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a conſiderable portion of rational amuſement: and as it is ſerious without enthuſiaſm or ſuperſtition, ſo is it cheerful

            <p>"This ſelection reflects much credit on the taſte of the compiler; and the arrangement of the various pieces is judicious. The different authors, from whom theſe extracts are taken, enforce virtue by the graces of their compoſition.

The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection is made with judgment; the pieces are ſuch as may be recommended to the peruſal of youth; they are extracted from the works of the moſt correct and elegant writers, and are diſtinguiſhed by their purity, propriety, perſpecuity, and in many inſtances elegance of diction.
