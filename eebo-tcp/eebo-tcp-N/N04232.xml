            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>The Proprietor having purchaſed certain Lands from your Nations about Six Years ago, a Moiety of what was agreed to be given in Conſideration <pb n="4" facs="unknown:005216_0004_101714408A40B5C8"/>of that Purchaſe was at that Time delivered to them, and the other being at their own Deſire left in the Proprietor's Hands, He preſſed you by <hi>Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kalamy</hi> to ſend laſt Year for it, and would have been glad to have ſeen you and taken you by the Hand before his Departure. But as the Deſign of this Meeting is to hear your News and converſe together in a free and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Manner, I ſhall ſay no more about the Goods than that they lye ready at the Proprietor's Houſe, and will be delivered when you ſhall have ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently reſted from the Fatigue of your Journey.</p>
               </q>

                  <q>
                     <hi>BRETHREN,</hi> We propoſe to reſt four Days, and then come to the main Buſineſs. At preſent we are at a private Conference about News, and have ſomething of this Sort to mention to our Brother <hi>Onas.</hi>
                  </q> And on the Governor's ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they would be glad to know what it was, the Chief proceeded.</p>

                     <hi>BRETHREN,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is our Way when we come to our Brethren, or any other Perſons, whom we live in ſtrict Friendſhip with, to remove all Obſtructions to a good Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; with this View we are to inform you of a Piece of diſa reta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble News that happen'd in our Journey.—Some White People living at a Place called <hi>Conegocheegoe,</hi> whoſe Names we cannot tell, nor whether they belong to this or the neighbouring Government, but one of them, as we heard, had his Houſe burnt over his Head ſome Years ago, and he was brought down a Priſoner and committed to the Goal of this City: Theſe People lighting of our young Warriours, as they were hunting, made ſome Propoſals about the Purchaſing of Land from them, and our young Men being indiſcreet, and unacquainted with Publick Buſineſs, were fooliſh enough to hearken to them, and to receive five Duffil Strowds for two Plantations on the River <hi>Cohongoronto.</hi> A <hi>Coneſtogoe</hi> Indian, and a <hi>French</hi> Indian, and ſome others that were in Company had three Duffil Strowds, and went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with them; and our young Men carried off the other two. As ſoon as this came to our Knowledge, we ſent for our Warriours, and after examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and rebuking them ſeverely, we took away their two Strowds, and publickly cenſured them for expoſing us to our Brethren of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> in doing a Thing ſo inconſiſtent with our Engagements to them; <q>You are, ſaid we aloud, that all our People might hear and take Notice, to know and remember, that the Six Nations have obliged themſelves to ſell none of the Land that falls within the Province of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> to any other but our Brother <hi>Onas,</hi> and that to ſell Lands to any other is an high Breach of the League of Friendſhip.</q> Brethren, this raſh Proceeding of our young Men makes us aſhamed. We always mean well, and ſhall perform faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully what we have promiſed: And we aſſure you, this Affair was tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Manner we have related, without our Privity or Conſent. And that you may be fully convinced of this, and of the Sincerity of our Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, we have brought you theſe Two Strowds [<hi>here be preſented two Red Strowds to the Governor</hi>] they are the very Strowds our fooliſh young Men received; we took them from them, and we give them to you to return to thoſe white People who made the Bargain, and deſire when the Strowds
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:005216_0005_101714426DFC7600"/>
are returned to them, they may be told what we now ſay, and that we ſhall not confirm ſuch Bargains nor any other that may interfere with our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements to our Brother <hi>Onas.</hi>
                  </p>
               </q>
               <p>The Governor then ſpoke:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>BRETHREN,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I thank you for this Piece of News; you have taken this Matter perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly right. All Bargaining for Land within this Province, is, to be ſure, a manifeſt Breach of your Contract with the Proprietors, and what we know you will not countenance. We have hitherto found the <hi>Six Nations</hi> faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to their Engagements, and this is a freſh Inſtance of their Punctuality. You could not help theſe Miſtakes of your young Men; they were not done in your Preſence: But as ſeveral Inconveniences may ariſe from theſe kind of clandeſtine Sales, or from any ſuch looſe Sales of Land by your People, we deſire you will, on your Return home, give publick Notice to all your Warriours not to bargain for any Land; o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> if they do, that you will not confirm ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h Bargains; and that this very Affair, together with what you have done therein, may be particularly reported to all your Nation aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled in Council.</p>
               </q>
               <p>The <hi>Onondago</hi> Chief promiſed to give ſuch publick Notice; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring Liberty to mend his former Speech, he proceeded:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>BRETHREN,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I forgot one Circumſtance: Our People who pretended to ſell the Land, demanded a Belt of Wampum of the Buyers to carry to their Chiefs; and on their declaring they had no Wampum, our Warriours ſaid, they would not anſwer that their Chiefs would confirm this Bargain, ſince they never did any thing of this Nature without Wampum.</p>
               </q>
               <p>The Governor, after a ſhort Pauſe, ſpoke:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>BRETHREN of the Six Nations,</hi>

                  <p>I ſhall take this Opportunity to relate to you a Piece of diſagreeable News I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſome Days ago in a Letter from <hi>Le Tort</hi> the Indian Trader, at <hi>Allegheny,</hi> who ſays, <q>That in <hi>May</hi> laſt ſome Indians of the <hi>Taway</hi> Nation, ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by us to be the <hi>Twightwees,</hi> in their Return from War, called and ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome Time with the <hi>Shawaneſe</hi>; who being aſked, and denying they had brought either Scalps or Priſoners, the <hi>Shawaneſe</hi> ſuſpecting them, had the Curioſity to ſearch their Bags, and finding two Scalps in them that by the Softneſs of the Hair did not feel like Indian Scalps, they waſh'd them clean and found them to be the Scalps of ſome Chriſtians. On this Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, the <hi>Twightwees</hi> were ſo much aſhamed, that they ſtole away from their Town in the Night-time; and coming, as they afterwards un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, to a little Village belonging to the <hi>Shawaneſe,</hi> they told our Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that their Hearts were full of Grief; for, as they came along the Road, they found it all bloody; and having good Cauſe to believe it was made bloody with the Blood of ſome of the White Brethren, they had very ſorrowfully ſwept the Road; and deſired them to inform the Governor of <hi>Penſilvania</hi> of their (the <hi>Twightwees</hi>) Grief; and how they had ſwept 
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:005216_0006_10171443F9F3C8F0"/>
the Road clean.</q> 
                     <hi>Le Tort</hi> adds, on Behalf of the <hi>Shawaneſe,</hi> 
                     <q>That they were much troubled and grieved at this unfortunate Accident; and prayed, as they had no Concern in it, more than by being Inſtruments to diſcover it, their Brethren would not blame them, nor ſuffer a Miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to ariſe between them on this Account: They would ſweep the Road clean, and wipe all the Blood away; and deſired their Brethren would be ſatisfied with this, and not weep too much for a Misfortune that might not happen again as long as the Sun and Moon ſhone.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Perſon who delivered me <hi>Le Tort</hi>'s Letter, brought this Bundle of Skins as a Preſent to me; but I told the Meſſenger, I would not meddle with it; he might leave it if he pleaſed: The Affair appear'd to me in a bad Light, and I would repreſent it to the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> who were expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Town every Day. This is the Fact as I have it from <hi>Le Tort:</hi> I deſire to be inform'd if you know any thing of this Matter; and if you do not, that you will make diligent Enquiry who committed the Murder, and who are the unhappy Sufferers, and aſſiſt us to obtain Satisfaction, if it ſhall appear to be any of our Fellow-Subjects that have been treated in this Manner.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>To inforce this Requeſt, I preſent you with this String of Wampum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Onondago</hi> Chief, in Reply, ſaid:</p>

                     <hi>BRETHREN,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We take this Information kindly at your Hands; we will take this String of Wampum Home with us to our Lodgings, and there conſult about the moſt regular and proper Steps to be taken by us to anſwer your Expectations; and when we have duly conſidered the Matter, we will return you an Anſwer.</p>

               <p>Upon this the Governor put an End to the Conference; and calling for Wine and other Liquors, according to the <hi>Indian</hi> Cuſtom, after a decent and chearful Entertainment, the <hi>Indians</hi> withdrew.</p>

Dinner was provided for their Chiefs; and after they had made an hearty Meal, and drank his Majeſty's Health, the Proprietors, and the Health of the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> the Chiefs gave the ſolemn Cry, in Teſtimony of their Thanks, for the Honour done them. And ſoon after the Governor began, in a free Way, to enquire for what Reaſon the <hi>Senecas</hi> were not come down, ſince they had an equal Right to a Share of the Goods with the other Nations.—<hi>Canaſſateego,</hi> their Speaker, ſaid, <q>The <hi>Senecas</hi> were in great Diſtreſs, on Account of a Famine that raged in their Country, which had reduced them to ſuch Want, that a Father had been obliged to kill two of his Children to preſerve his own and the reſt of his Family's Lives; and they could not now come down, but had given Directions about their Share of the Goods.</q>—The Governor expreſs'd his Concern for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Circumſtances of their Brethren of the <hi>Seneca</hi> Nation; and, after a ſhort Reſpite, enquired if any of their Deputies were then at <hi>Canada,</hi> and whether the <hi>French</hi> Governor was making any warlike Preparations. And on their anſwering, <hi>Yes</hi>; the Governor ſaid, with a ſmiling, pleaſant Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, <q>I ſuppoſe if the <hi>French</hi> ſhould go to War with us, you will join them.</q> The <hi>Indians</hi> conferr'd together for ſome Time, and then <hi>Canaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teego,</hi> in a chearful lively Manner, made Anſwer.—<q>We aſſure you, the Governor of <hi>Canada</hi> pays our Nations great Court at this Time, well knowing of what Conſequence we are to the <hi>French</hi> Intereſt: He has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready told us, he was uncovering the Hatchet and ſharpening it, and hoped, if he ſhould be obliged to lift it up againſt the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> their Nations would remain neuter and aſſiſt neither Side.—But we will now ſpeak plainly to our Brethren: Why ſhould we, who are one Fleſh with you, refuſe to help you, whenever you want our Aſſiſtance?— We have continued a long Time in the ſtricteſt League of Amity and Friendſhip with you, and we ſhall always be faithful and true to you our old and good Allies.—The Governor of <hi>Canada</hi> talks a great deal, but ten of his Words do not go ſo far as one of yours.—We do not look towards them; We look towards you; and you may depend on our Aſſiſtance.</q> Whilſt the <hi>Onondago</hi> Chief made this open and hearty Declaration, all the other <hi>Indians</hi> made frequently that particular Kind of Noiſe which is known to be a Mark of Approbation.—The Governor bid the Interpreter tell <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſateego,</hi> 
                  <q>He did not ſet on foot this Enquiry from any Suſpicion he had of the <hi>Six Nations</hi> wanting a due Regard for the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>—Our Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of their Honour and Faith would not permit us to think any other of them than that they would eſteem our Friends their Friends, and our Enemies their Enemies, agreeable to the ſtrict Union which had ever ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted between us.—As to the Governor of <hi>Canada,</hi> they need not mind what he ſaid.—The <hi>Engliſh,</hi> on equal Terms, had beat the <hi>French,</hi> and could beat them again: And were they but to conſider the Advantages which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have, by poſſeſſing ſo many large and populous Countries and ſo many good Ports on the Continent of <hi>America,</hi> they would ſoon ſee who had moſt Reaſon to fear a War, the <hi>French</hi> or the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Here the Converſation drop'd; and, after another Glaſs of Wine, the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> reſumed the Diſcourſe, by aſking whether their Brethren had not been for ſome time engaged in a War with the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and what Succeſſes they had met with.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="unknown:005216_0008_10171451A49C8B18"/>
The Governor told them, the King of <hi>Great Britain</hi> lived in an Iſland, and being ſurrounded with the Sea, his chief Strength lay in his Ships; in which he was ſo much ſuperior to his Enemies, that they were ſeldom to be met with on the broad Ocean, but ſculk'd and hid themſelves, only venturing out now and then; and whenever they did they were almoſt ſure to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; and that the King of <hi>Great Britain</hi> had, with his Ships, beat down or taken ſeveral of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Great Forts in <hi>America.</hi>—The <hi>Indians</hi> ſaid, they were pleaſed to hear their Brethren were an Over-match for their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and wiſh'd them good Succeſs.</p>
               <p>The Governor then inquired into the State and Condition of the Nations to the Weſtward of the Great Lakes, and whether they had any Warriours then in thoſe Countries? Whether they had concluded Peace with the Southern <hi>Indians?</hi> And whether they had heard what their Deputies had done at <hi>Albany?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They made Anſwer: That they had always Abundance of their Men out amongſt the Nations ſituate to the Weſt of their Lakes.—That they had kindled a Fire with a vaſt many Nations, ſome whereof were Tributaries, and they had a good Underſtanding with all.—They ſet out from their own Country in Company with two Sets of Deputies, one going to hold a Treaty with the Southern <hi>Indians,</hi> and they believed a Peace would be concluded: The other going to meet the Governor of <hi>New-York,</hi> at <hi>Albany</hi>; but they could not tell what had been done at either Place.—On their Return, they were to hold a General Council, and would inform their Brethren of theſe Particulars.</p>
               <p>Then the Governor put an End to the Conference, by telling the <hi>Indians</hi> the Goods would be delivered to them at a Council to be held to morrow Afternoon at the Meeting-Houſe.</p>

The Governor, having commanded Silence, ſpoke as follows:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Friends and Brethren of the Six Nations,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Six Years ago a Number of your Chiefs obliged us with a Viſit, when they agreed, on Behalf of your Nations, to the Releaſe of certain Lands on both Sides the River <hi>Saſquehannah,</hi> to the Southward of the <hi>Endleſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Mountains,</hi> and within the Limits and Bounds of the King's Grant of this Province. In Conſideration of which, a certain Quantity of Goods was agreed on and delivered as a full Satisfaction for the ſaid Lands lying on the Eaſtern Side of the ſaid River: And for the Lands on the Weſtern Side of the ſaid River, you deſired the Payment ſhould be deferr'd ſill another Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity. Theſe Goods, which are exactly the ſame in Quantity as thoſe you received the laſt Time the Chiefs of your Nations were here, have been ready a conſiderable Time, and kept in Expectation of your Coming for them: And now you are come down fully impowered by your reſpective Councils to receive them, we are well pleaſed to deliver them: Leaving it to you to make a fair and equal Diviſion of them amongſt yourſelves. We are ſorry for the Abſence of our Brethren the <hi>Senecas,</hi> and much more ſo that it ſhould be owing to their Diſtreſs at Home by a Famine that rages in their Country:—A Famine ſo great that you tell us a Father has been obliged to ſacrifice one Part of his Family, even his own Children, for the Support and Preſervation of himſelf, and the other Part.—We heartily commiſerate their Condition, and do not doubt but you will do them fair and ample Juſtice in the Diſpoſal of their Part of the Goods in ſuch Manner as they have inſtructed you. You ſhall now hear the Liſt of the Goods read to you.</p>

               <p>Then the Governor told them that the Goods, of which the Particulars had been juſt read to them, were in the Meeting-Houſe, and would be ſent to whatever Place they would direct.</p>
               <p>The Governor then proceeded:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>BRETHREN,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You have often heard of the Care that your great and good Friend and Brother <hi>William Penn</hi> took at all Times to cultivate a perfect good Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony with all the <hi>Indians:</hi> Of this your Nations have ever been fully ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; but more eſpecially a Number of your Chiefs, about ten Years ago,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:005216_0011_101714584AEDAB20"/>
when, on the Arrival of a Son of your ſaid great Friend <hi>William Penn,</hi> large and valuable Preſents were exchanged by us with you; a new Road was made and clear'd; a new Fire kindled; and the Chain of Friendſhip made ſtronger ſo as to laſt while the Sun and Moon endure.</p>
                  <p>And now we cannot but congratulate ourſelves that your Coming ſhould happen at a Time when we are in daily Expectation of a War being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared between the King of <hi>England,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> King, well knowing that ſhould ſuch a War happen, it muſt very ſenſibly affect you, conſidering your Situation in the Neighbourhood of <hi>Canada.</hi> Your Coming at this Juncture is particularly fortunate, ſince it gives us an Opportunity of mentioning ſeveral Things that may be neceſſary to be ſettled between People ſo ſtrictly and cloſely united as we are.—An Union not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd by any thing leſs than the affectionate Regards which Children of the ſame Parents bear for each other, as conceiving ourſelves to be one Fleſh and one People.</p>
                  <p>The utmoſt Care therefore ought mutually to be taken by us on both Sides, that the Road between us be kept perfectly clear and open, and no Lets nor the leaſt Obſtruction be ſuffered to lie in the Way; or if any ſhould by Accident be found, that may hinder our free Intercourſe and Correſpondence, it muſt forthwith be removed.</p>
               </q>
               <p>To inforce this, We lay down a String of Wampum.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>In next Place, We, on our Part, ſhall inlarge our Fire that burns be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us. We ſhall provide more Fewel to increaſe it and make it burn brighter and clearer, and give a ſtronger and more laſting Light and Warmth.</p>
               </q>
               <p>In Evidence of our ſincere Intentions, We lay down this Belt of Wampum.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>In the laſt Place, conſidering the Obligations we are mutually under by our ſeveral Treaties, "That we ſhould hear with our Ears for you, and you hear with your Ears for us." We ſhall at all Times very willingly give you the earlieſt and beſt Intelligence of any Deſigns that may be form'd to your Diſadvantage.—And if you diſcover any Preparations that can hurt us, we deſire you will immediately diſpatch ſome ſuitable Perſon in whom we can place a Confidence, to give us a proper Information.</p>
               </q>
               <p>To inforce this Requeſt, as well as to brighten the Chain, we lay down this other Belt of Wampum.</p>
               <p>On the Governor's concluding the Speech, the ſolemn Cry by way of Approbation was repeated by the <hi>Indians</hi> as many Times as there were Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions preſent; and then <hi>Canaſſateego</hi> roſe up and ſpoke.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>BRETHREN,</p>
                  <p>We thank you for your kind Speech: What you have ſaid is very agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to us; and to-morrow when we have deliberated on the ſeveral Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters recommended to us, we will give you our Anſwer. We deſire, as our Time will be wholly taken up in Council, you will order the Goods to be carried back to the Proprietaries to prevent their being loſt, and that they may continue there till we call for them.</p>

               </p>
               <q>
                  <p>BRETHREN, the Governor and Council, and all preſent,</p>
                  <p>According to our Promiſe we now propoſe to return you an Anſwer to the ſeveral Things mentioned to us Yeſterday, and ſhall beg Leave to ſpeak to Publick Affairs firſt, tho' they were what you ſpoke to laſt. On this Head you Yeſterday put us in Mind, firſt, <q>Of <hi>William Penn</hi>'s early and conſtant Care to cultivate Friendſhip with all the <hi>Indians</hi>; of the Treaty we held with one of his Sons, about ten Years ago; and of the Neceſſity there is at this Time of keeping the Roads between us clear and free from all Obſtructions.</q> We are all very ſenſible of the kind Regard that good Man <hi>William Penn</hi> had for all the <hi>Indians,</hi> and cannot but be pleaſed to find that his Children have the ſame. We well remember the Treaty you mention held with his Son on his Arrival here, by which we confirmed our League of Friendſhip that is to laſt as long as the Sun and Moon endure: In Conſequence of this, We, on our Part, ſhall preſerve the Road free from all Incumbrances; in Confirmation whereof we lay down this String of Wampum.</p>
                  <p>You in the next Place ſaid you would inlarge the Fire and make it burn brighter, which we are pleaſed to hear you mention; and aſſure you, we ſhall do the ſame, by adding to it more Fewel, that it may ſtill flame out more ſtrongly than ever: In the laſt Place, you were pleaſed to ſay that we are bound, by the ſtricteſt Leagues, to watch for each others Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; that we ſhould hear with our Ears for you, and you hear with your Ears for us: This is equally agreeable to us; and we ſhall not fail to give you early Intelligence whenever any thing of Conſequence comes to our Knowledge: And to encourage you to do the ſame, and to nouriſh in your Hearts what you have ſpoke to us with your Tongues, about the Renewal of our Amity and the Brightening of the Chain of Friendſhip; we confirm what we have ſaid with another Belt of Wampum.</p>
                  <p>BRETHREN,</p>
                  <p>We received from the Proprietors, yeſterday, ſome Goods in Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Releaſe of the Lands on the Weſt-Side of <hi>Saſquehannah,</hi> It is true we have the full Quantity according to Agreement; but if the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietor had been here himſelf, we think, in Regard of our Numbers and Poverty, he would have made an Addition to them.—If the Goods were only to be divided amongſt the <hi>Indians</hi> preſent, a ſingle Perſon would have but a ſmall Portion; but if you conſider what Numbers are left behind, equally entitled with us to a Share, there will be extremely little. We therefore deſire, if you have the Keys of the Proprietor's Cheſt, you will open it, and take out a little more for us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="13" facs="unknown:005216_0013_1017145C344C5610"/>
We know our Lands are now become more valuable: The white People think we do not know their Value; but we are ſenſible that the Land is everlaſting, and the few Goods we receive for it are ſoon worn out and gone. For the Future we will ſell no Lands but when Brother <hi>Onas</hi> is in the Country; and we will know beforehand the Quantity of the Goods we are to receive. Beſides, we are not well uſed with reſpect to the Lands ſtill unſold by us. Your People daily ſettle on theſe Lands, and ſpoil our Hunting.—We muſt inſiſt on your Removing them, as you know they have no Right to ſettle to the Northward of <hi>Kittochtinny-Hills.</hi>—In particular, we renew our Complaints againſt ſome People who are ſettled at <hi>Juniata,</hi> a Branch of <hi>Saſquahannah,</hi> and all along the Banks of that River, as far as <hi>Mahaniay</hi>; and deſire they may be forthwith made to go off the Land; for they do great Damage to our Couſins the <hi>Delawares.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We have further to obſerve, with reſpect to the Lands lying on the Weſt Side of <hi>Saſquahannah,</hi> that tho' Brother <hi>Onas</hi> (meaning the Proprietor) has paid us for what his People poſſeſs, yet ſome Parts of that Country have been taken up by Perſons whoſe Place of Reſidence is to the South of this Province, from whom we have never received any Conſideration. This Affair was recommended to you by our Chiefs at our laſt Treaty; and you then, at our earneſt Deſire, promiſed to write a Letter to that Perſon who has the Authority over thoſe People, and to procure us his Anſwer: As we have never heard from you on this Head, we want to know what you have done in it. If you have not done any thing, we now renew our Requeſt, and deſire you will inform the Perſon whoſe People are ſeated on our Lands, that that Country belongs to us, in Right of Conqueſt; we having bought it with our Blood, and taken it from our Enemies in fair War; and we expect, as Owners of that Land, to receive ſuch a Conſideration for it as the Land is worth. We deſire you will preſs him to ſend us a poſitive Anſwer: Let him ſay <hi>Yes</hi> or <hi>No</hi>: If he ſays Yes, we we will treat with him; if No, we are able to do ourſelves Juſtice; and we will do it, by going to take Payment ourſelves.</p>
                  <p>It is cuſtomary with us to make a Preſent of Skins whenever we renew our Treaties. We are aſhamed to offer our Brethren ſo few; but your Horſes and Cows have eat the Graſs our Deer uſed to feed on. This has made them ſcarce, and will, we hope, plead in Excuſe for our not bringing a larger Quantity: If we could have ſpared more we would have given more; but we are really poor; and deſire you'll not conſider the Quantity, but, few as they are, accept them in Teſtimony of our Regard.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Here they gave the Governor a Bundle of Skins.</p>
               <p>The Governor immediately replied:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>BRETHREN,</p>
                  <p>We thank you for the many Declarations of Reſpect you have given us in this ſolemn Renewal of our Treaties: We receive, and ſhall keep your String and Belts of Wampum, as Pledges of your Sincerity, and deſire thoſe we gave you may be carefully preſerved, as Teſtimonies of ours.</p>
                  <p>In Anſwer to what you ſay about the Proprietaries.—They are all ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and have taken the Keys of their Cheſt with them; ſo that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:005216_0014_101714638CB40788"/>
on their Behalf, enlarge the Quantity of Goods: Were they here, they might, perhaps, be more generous; but we cannot be liberal for them.—The Government will, however, take your Requeſt into Conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and, in Regard to your Poverty, may perhaps make you a Preſent. I but juſt mention this now, intending to refer this Part of your Speech to be anſwered at our next Meeting.</p>
                  <p>The Number of Guns, as well as every thing elſe, anſwers exactly with the Particulars ſpecified in your Deed of Conveyance, which is more than was agreed to be given you. It was your own Sentiments, that the Lands on the Weſt Side of <hi>Saſquahannah</hi> were not ſo valuable as thoſe on the Eaſt; and an Abatement was to be made, proportionable to the Difference in Value: But the Proprietor overlooked this, and ordered the ſull Quantity to be delivered, which you will look on as a Favour.</p>
                  <p>It is very true, that Lands are of late become more valuable; but what raiſes their Value? Is it not entirely owing to the Induſtry and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour uſed by the white People in their Cultivation and Improvement? Had not they come amongſt you, theſe Lands would have been of no Uſe to you, any further than to maintain you. And is there not, now you have ſold ſo much, enough left for all the Purpoſes of Living?—What you ſay of the Goods, that they are ſoon worn out, is applicable to every thing; but you know very well, that they coſt a great deal Money, and the Value of Land is no more than it is worth in Money.</p>

               </q>
               <p>Here they interrupted the Governor, and ſaid:—<q>Theſe Perſons who were ſent did not do their Duty: So far from removing the People, they made Surveys for themſelves, and they are in League with the Treſpaſſers. We deſire more effectual Methods may be uſed, and honeſter Perſons imploy'd.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Which the Governor promiſed, and then proceeded:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>BRETHREN,</p>
                  <p>According to the Promiſe made at our laſt Treaty with you, Mr. <hi>Logan,</hi> who was at that Time Preſident, did write to the Governor of <hi>Maryland,</hi> that he might make you Satisfaction for ſuch of your Lands as his People had taken up; but did not receive one Word from him upon that Head. I will write to him again, and endeavour to procure you a ſatisfactory Anſwer. We do not doubt but he will do you Juſtice: But we exhort you to be careful not to exerciſe any Acts of Violence towards his People, as they likewiſe are our Brethren, and Subjects of the ſame Great King; and therefore Violence towards them muſt be productive of very evil Conſequences.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall conclude what I have to ſay at this Time with Acknowledgments for your Preſent; which is very agreeable to us, from the Expreſſions of Regard uſed by you in preſenting it: Gifts of this Nature receiving their

               <p>The Governor informed the Board, that the <hi>Indian</hi> Chiefs dining with him Yeſterday, after Dinner delivered their Anſwer to two Affairs of Conſequence;</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="unknown:005216_0016_1017146A6A04A720"/>
The firſt related to the violent Battery committed on <hi>William Webb,</hi> in the Forks of <hi>Delaware,</hi> whereby his Jaw-Bone was broke, and his Life greatly endangered, by an unknown <hi>Indian. Canaſſatego</hi> repeating the Meſſage de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to the <hi>Six Nations</hi> by <hi>Shickcalamy,</hi> in the Year 1740, with a String of Wampum, ſaid in Anſwer: <q>The <hi>Six Nations</hi> had made diligent Enquiry into the Affair, and had found out the <hi>Indian</hi> who had committed the Fact; he lived near <hi>Aſopus,</hi> and had been examined and ſeverely reprov'd: And they hoped, as <hi>William Webb</hi> was recovered, the Governor would not expect any further Puniſhment; and therefore they returned the String of Wampum received from their Brethren, by the Hand of <hi>Shickcalamy,</hi> in Token that they had fully comply'd with their Requeſt.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I thank'd them for their Care; but reminded them, that tho' the Man did not die, yet he lay a long Time in extreme Miſery, and would never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the free Uſe of his Speech, and was rendered leſs able to get his Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood, and in ſuch Caſes the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Laws obliged the Aſſailant to make good all Damages, beſides paying for the Pain endured. — But as the <hi>Indian</hi> was, in all Probability, poor and unable to make Satisfaction, I told them, that for their Sake I would forgive him; adding, had <hi>Webb</hi> died I make no Doubt but you would have put the <hi>Indian</hi> to Death, juſt as we did two of our People who had killed an <hi>Indian</hi>; we cauſed them to be hung on a Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, in the Preſence of many Hundreds of our People, to deter all others from doing the like. <hi>Canaſſatego</hi> made me this Reply: <q>The <hi>Indians</hi> know no Puniſhment but Death; they have no ſuch Thing as pecuniary Mulcts; if a Man be guilty of a Crime, he is either put to Death, or the Fault is overlook'd. We have often heard of your Hanging-up thoſe two Perſons; but as none of our <hi>Indians</hi> ſaw the Men die, many believe they were not hanged, but tranſported to ſome other Colony: And it would be ſatisfactory to the <hi>Indians,</hi> if, for the Future, ſome of them be ſent for, to be Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of ſuch Executions.</q> I aſſured them, that whoever gave them that Information, abuſed them; for the Perſons certainly ſuffered Death, and in the Preſence of all the People.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Canaſſatego</hi> then proceeded to give an Anſwer to what was ſaid to them the 2d Inſtant relating to <hi>Le Tort</hi>'s Letter: <q>That they had, in Council, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in what Manner the Matter recommended to them ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted; and they were of Opinion, that as the <hi>Shawaneſe,</hi> not the <hi>Twightwys</hi> (for they knew ſo much of it that the People were of the <hi>Twightwy</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in whoſe Bags the Scalps were found) had ſent me a Preſent of Skins, I ſhould, in return, ſend them a Blanket or a Kettle, and with it a very ſharp Meſſage, that tho' they had done well in ſweeping the Road from Blood, yet that was but a ſmall Part of their Duty; they ought not to have ſuffered the <hi>Twightwys,</hi> after their Lie and the Diſcovery of the Scalps, to have left them, 'til they had given a full and true Account how they came by them, whoſe Scalps they were, and in what Place, and for what Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the Men were kill'd; and when they had been fully ſatisfied of all theſe Particulars, then it was their Duty to have given Information to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment where the white People lived, that the Murderers might be complained againſt, and puniſhed by the Nation they belong'd to: And as the <hi>Shawaneſe</hi> had omitted to perform the Part of Brethren, that I ſhould reprove them for it, and charge them to make Amends for their Neglect, by uſing all poſſible Expedition to come at the Knowledge of theſe Things, and to aid their Brethren the white People in obtaining Juſtice.</q>

The Minutes of the preceding Council being read, Mr. <hi>Logan,</hi> in Purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Board's Direction of Yeſterday, reported, on Behalf of himſelf and the other Gentlemen to whom it was recommended, that they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd with Mr. <hi>Kinſey,</hi> and requeſted him to conſult the other Members of the Aſſembly concerning the making a Preſent to the <hi>Indians</hi>; and that Mr. <hi>Kinſey</hi> having collected the Sentiments of ſeveral Members of the Aſſembly in Town, whom he had confer'd with on that Subject, found them generally of Opinion, that a Preſent ſhould at this Time be made; but that they had declined nominating any Sum: However, that Mr. <hi>Kinſey</hi> had given it as his own Opinion, that the Governor and Council might go as far as <hi>Three Hundred Pounds.</hi>

                     <hi>BRETHREN,</hi>

                  <p>The laſt Time the Chiefs of the <hi>Six Nations</hi> were here, they were informed, that your Couſins, a Branch of the <hi>Delawares,</hi> gave this Province ſome Diſturbance about the Lands the Proprietor purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from them, and for which their Anceſtors had received a valuable Conſideration above <hi>Fifty-five</hi> Years ago, as appears by a Deed now lying on the Table.—Sometime after this, <hi>Conrad Weiſer</hi> delivered to your Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Thomas Penn</hi> your Letter, wherein you requeſt of him and <hi>James Logan</hi> that they would not buy Land, &amp;c.—This has been ſhewn to them and interpreted; notwithſtanding which they have continued their former Diſturbances, and have had the Inſolence to write Letters to ſome of the Magiſtrates of this Government, wherein they have abuſed your good Brethren our worthy Proprietaries, and treated them with the utmoſt Rudeneſs and Ill-Manners.

on all Occaſions, apply to us to remove all white People that are ſettled on Lands before they are purchaſed from you, and we do our our Endeavours to turn ſuch People off; we now expect from you, that you will cauſe theſe <hi>Indians</hi> to remove from the Lands in the Forks of <hi>Delaware,</hi> and not give any further Diſturbance to the Perſons who are now in Poſſeſſion.</p>

I hope you will enable me to ſend them a ſatisfactory Anſwer. It would be impertinent in me to ſay more to one ſo well informed as you are of theſe Nations, and of their abſolute Authority over all the <hi>Indians</hi> bordering upon us, or of the Advantages of maintaining a ſtrict Friendſhip with them at all Times, but more eſpecially at this critical Juncture.</p>

                  <p>This Meeting will be ſhort: It is in order to make you a Preſent from the Governor, the Council, the Aſſembly, and all our People. <hi>William Penn</hi> was known to you to be a good and faithful Friend to all the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians:</hi> He made a League of Friendſhip with you, by which we became one People. This League has often ſince been renew'd by friendly Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and as you have declared that the Friendſhip ſhall always laſt on your Parts, ſo we would have you believe that it ſhall remain inviolable on ours while Sun and Moon endure.</p>
                  <p>I gave you ſome Expectation of a Preſent, and we have it now ready to deliver to you. This Preſent is made you by the Governor, Council, Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, and all our People, in Conſideration of the great Miſeries and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes which you our good Friends have lately ſuffered. This will be ſome Relief to you for the preſent, and it's to be hoped your own Induſtry will ſoon retrieve your Circumſtances.</p>
                  <p>It has ſometimes happened, and may happen again, that idle and untrue Stories are carried to you concerning us your Brethren; but our Deſire is, and we expect it from you, that you will give no Credit to them; for we are, and always will be, your ſteady and ſincere Friends.</p>
                  <p>It is a Cuſtom when we renew our Treaties with our good Friends the <hi>Indians,</hi> to clear the Road and make our Fire burn bright: We have done ſo upon this Occaſion; and, in Token of our Sincerity, we deliver you, as

                     <hi>BRETHREN the Governor and Council,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The other Day you informed us of the Miſbehaviour of our Couſins the <hi>Delawares,</hi> with reſpect to their continuing to claim, and refuſing to remove from ſome Land on the River <hi>Delaware,</hi> notwithſtanding their Anceſtors had ſold it by a Deed under their Hands and Seals to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietaries,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:005216_0021_1017147AF1652828"/>
for a valuable Conſideration, upwards of <hi>Fifty</hi> Years ago; and notwithſtanding that they themſelves had about <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">
                        <desc> _____ </desc>
                     </gap> Years ago, after a a long and full Examination, ratified that Deed of their Anceſtors, and given a freſh one under their Hands and Seals; and then you requeſted us to remove them, inforcing your Requeſt with a String of Wampum.—Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards you laid on the Table our own Letters by <hi>Conrad Weiſer,</hi> ſome of our Couſins Letters, and the ſeveral Writings, to prove the Charge againſt our Couſins, with a Draught of the Land in Diſpute.—We now tell you, we have peruſed all theſe ſeveral Papers: We ſee with our own Eyes, that they have been a very unruly People, and are altogether in the Wrong in their Dealings with you.—We have concluded to remove them, and oblige them to go over the River <hi>Delaware,</hi> and quit all Claim to any Lands on this Side for the Future, ſince they have received Pay for them, and it is gone thro' their Guts long ago.—To confirm to you that we will ſee your Requeſt executed, we lay down this String of Wampum in return for yours.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Then turning to the <hi>Delawares,</hi> holding a Belt of Wampum in his Hand, he ſpoke to them as follows:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>COUSINS,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let this Belt of Wampum ſerve to chaſtiſe you. You ought to be taken by the Hair of the Head and ſhaked ſeverely, till you recover your Senſes and become ſober. You don't know what Ground you ſtand on, nor what you are doing. Our Brother <hi>Onas</hi>'s Cauſe is very juſt and plain, and his Intentions to preſerve Friendſhip. On the other Hand, Your Cauſe is bad; your Heart far from being upright; and you are maliciouſly bent to break the Chain of Friendſhip with our Brother <hi>Onas</hi> and his People. We have ſeen with our Eyes a Deed ſign'd by nine of your Anceſtors above <hi>Fifty</hi> Years ago for this very Land, and a Releaſe ſign'd, not many Years ſince, by ſome of yourſelves and Chiefs now living, to the Number of fifteen or upwards.—But how came you to take upon you to ſell Land at all: We conquered you; we made Women of you; you know you are Women, and can no more ſell Land than Women; nor is it fit you ſhould have the Power of ſelling Lands, ſince you would abuſe it. This Land that you claim is gone through your Guts; you have been furniſh'd with Cloaths, Meat and Drink, by the Goods paid you for it, and now you want it again, like Children as you are.—But what makes you ſell Land in the Dark. Did you ever tell us that you had ſold this Land. Did we ever receive any Part, even the Value of a Pipe-Shank, from you for it. You have told us a blind Story, that you ſent a Meſſenger to us to inform us of the Sale, but he never came amongſt us, nor we never heard any thing about it.—This is acting in the Dark, and very different from the Conduct our <hi>Six</hi> Nations obſerve in their Sales of Land; on ſuch Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions they give publick Notice, and invite all the <hi>Indians</hi> of their united Nations, and give them all a Share of the Preſent they receive for their Lands.—This is the Behaviour of the wiſe united Nations.—But we find you are none of our Blood: You act a diſhoneſt Part, not only in this but in other Matters: Your Ears are ever open to ſlanderous Reports about
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:005216_0022_1017147F5BEF8128"/>
our Brethren; you receive them with as much Greedineſs as lewd Women receive the Embraces of bad Men. And for all theſe Reaſons we charge you to remove inſtantly; we don't give you the Liberty to think about it. You are Women. Take the Advice of a wife Man, and remove immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately. You may return to the other Side of <hi>Delaware</hi> where you came from: But we do not know whether, conſidering how you have demean'd yourſelves, you will be permitted to live there; or whether you have not ſwallowed that Land down your Throats as well as the Land on this Side. We therefore aſſign you two Places to go, either to <hi>Wyomen or Shamokin.</hi> You may go to either of theſe Places, and then we ſhall have you more under our Eye, and ſhall ſee how you behave. Don't deliberate; but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move away, and take this Belt of Wampum.</p>
               </q>
               <p>This being interpreted by <hi>Conrad Weiſer</hi> into <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and by <hi>Cornelius Spring</hi> into the <hi>Delaware</hi> Language, <hi>Canaſſatego</hi> taking a String of Wampum, added further.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>After our juſt Reproof, and abſolute Order to depart from the Land, you are now to take Notice of what we have further to ſay to you.

               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Canaſſatego</hi> then ſpoke to the Governor and Council:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>BRETHREN,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We called at our old Friend <hi>James Logan</hi>'s, in our Way to this City, and to our Grief we found him hid in the Bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>es, and retired, thro' Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, from Publick Buſineſs. We preſs'd him to leave his Retirement and prevailed with him to aſſiſt once more on our Account at your Councils. We hope, notwithſtanding his Age, and the Effects of a Fit of Sickneſs, which we underſtand has hurt his Conſtitution, that he may yet continue a long Time to aſſiſt this Province with his Counſels. He is a wife Man, and a faſt Friend to the <hi>Indians.</hi> And we deſire, when his Soul goes to GOD, you may chuſe in his Room juſt ſuch another Perſon, of the ſame Prudence and Ability in Counſelling, and of the ſame tender Diſpoſition and Affection for the <hi>Indians.</hi> In Teſtimony of our Gratitude for all his Services, and becauſe he was ſo good as to leave his Country-Houſe, and follow us to Town, and be at the Trouble, in this his advanced Age, to attend the Council; we preſent him with this Bundle of Skins.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>BRETHREN,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is always our Way, at the Concluſion of a Treaty, to deſire you will uſe your Endeavours with the Traders, that they may ſell their Goods cheaper
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:005216_0023_10171482ACC0B210"/>
and give us a better Price for our Deer-Skins. Whenever any particular Sort of <hi>Indian</hi> Goods is ſcarce, they conſtantly make us pay the dearer on that Account. We muſt now uſe the ſame Argument with them: Our Deer are killed in ſuch Quantities, and our Hunting-Countries grown leſs every Day, by the Settlement of white People, that Game is now difficult to find, and we muſt go a great Way in Queſt of it; they therefore ought to give us a better Price for our Skins; and we deſire you would ſpeak to them to do ſo. We have been ſtinted in the Article of Rum in Town. We deſire you will open the Rum-Bottle, and give it to us in greater Abundance on the Road.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>To inforce our Requeſt, about the</hi> Indian <hi>Traders, we preſent you with this Bundle of Skins.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>BRETHREN,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When we firſt came to your Houſes, we found them clean and in Order: But we have ſtaid ſo long as to dirty them; which is to be imputed to our different Way of Living from the white People: And therefore, as we cannot but have been diſagreeable to you on this Account, we preſent you with ſome Skins to make your Houſes clean, and put them into the ſame Condition they were in when we came amongſt you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>BRETHREN,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Buſineſs the <hi>Five</hi> Nations tranſact with you is of great Conſequence, and requires a ſkilful and honeſt Perſon to go between us; one in whom both you and we can place a Confidence.—We eſteem our preſent Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter to be ſuch a Perſon, equally faithful in the Interpretation of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is ſaid to him by either of us, equally allied to both; he is of our Nation, and a Member of our Council as well as of yours. When we adopted him, we divided him into Two equal Parts: One we kept for our ſelves, and one we left for you. He has had a great deal of Trouble with us, wore out his Shoes in our Meſſages, and dirty'd his Cloaths by being amongſt us, ſo that he is become as naſty as an <hi>Indian.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In Return for theſe Services, we recommend him to your Generoſity; and on our own Behalf, we give him <hi>Five Skins</hi> to buy him Clothes and Shoes with.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>BRETHREN,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We have ſtill one more Favour to aſk. Our Treaty, and all we have to ſay about Publick Buſineſs, is now over, and to morrow we deſign to leave you. We hope, as you have given us plenty of good Proviſion whilſt in Town, that you will continue your Goodneſs ſo far as to ſupply us with a little more to ſerve us on the Road. And we likewiſe deſire you will provide us with Waggons, to carry our Goods to the Place where they are to be conveyed by Water.</p>
               </q>
               <p>

To theſe ſeveral Points the Governor made the following Reply.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>BRETHREN of the Six Nations,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Judgment you have juſt now paſs'd on your Couſins the <hi>Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares,</hi> confirms the high Opinion we have ever entertained of the Juſtice of the <hi>Six Nations.</hi> This Part of your Character, for which you are deſervedly famed, made us waive doing our ſelves Juſtice, in order to give you another Opportunity of convincing the World of your inviolable Attachment to your Engagements. Theſe unhappy People might have always liv'd eaſy, having never receiv'd the leaſt Injury from us; but we believe ſome of our own People were bad enough to impoſe on their Credulity, and engage them in theſe wrong Meaſures, which we with, for their Sakes, they had avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
                  <p>We hoped, from what we have conſtantly given in Charge to the Indian Traders, that they would have adminiſtred no juſt Cauſe of Complaint: If they do you Wrong, it is againſt our Inclinations, and contrary to our expreſs Directions. As you have exhibited no particular Charge againſt them, we ſhall uſe our beſt Endeavours to perſuade them to give you as much for your Skins as they can poſſibly afford; and to take Care that their Goods which they give in Exchange for Skins, be of the beſt Sort. We will likewiſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you ſome Rum to ſerve you on your Journey home, ſince you deſire it.</p>
                  <p>We wiſh there had been more Room and better Houſes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for your Entertainment; but not expecting ſo many of you, we did the beſt we could. 'Tis true there are a great many Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in Town, but as they are the Property of other People, who have their own Families to take Care of, it is difficult to procure Lodgings for a large Number of People, eſpecially if they come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedly.</p>
                  <p>We entertain the ſame Sentiments of the Abilities and Probity of the Interpreter as you have expreſs'd. We were induc'd at firſt to make uſe of him in this important Truſt, from his being known to be agreeable to you, and one who had lived amongſt you for ſome Years, in good Credit and Eſteem with all your Nations; and have ever found him equally faithful to both. We are pleas'd with the Notice you have taken of him, and think he richly deſerves it at your Hands. We ſhall not be wanting to make him a ſuitable Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, for the many good and faithful Services he hath done this Government.</p>
                  <p>We have already given Orders for Waggons to carry your Goods, and for a Supply of Proviſions to ſerve you on the Road in your Return home, where we heartily wiſh you may arrive in good Health.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="unknown:005216_0025_10171485C2D09C90"/>
After the Governor had concluded, Mr. <hi>Logan</hi> return'd an Anſwer to that Part of <hi>Canaſſateego</hi>'s Speech which related to him, and ſaid, <q>That not only upon the Account of his Lameneſs, of which the Indians themſelves were Witneſſes; but on Account of another Indiſpoſition which about three Years ſince had laid him under an Incapacity of expreſſing himſelf with his former uſual Freedom, he had been obliged to live retired in the Country. But that our firſt Proprietor, the Honourable <hi>William Penn,</hi> who had ever been a Father and true Friend to all the Indians, having above Forty Years ſince recommended them to his particular Care, he had always, from his own Inclination as well as from that ſtrict Charge, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to convince all the Indians, that He was their true Friend; and was now well pleaſed, that after a Tract of ſo many Years, they were not inſenſible of it. He thanked them kindly for their Preſent, and heartily joined with them in their Deſires, that this Government may always be furniſhed with Perſons of equally good Inclinations, and not only with ſuch, but alſo with better Abilities to ſerve them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And then <hi>Canaſſatego</hi> ſaid, he had forgot to mention, that <hi>Shickcalamy</hi> and <hi>Caxbayn</hi> had been employ'd on ſeveral Meſſages to this Government, and deſir'd they might be conſider'd on that Account.</p>
