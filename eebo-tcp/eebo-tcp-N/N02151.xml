            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>We,</hi> that will never have an <hi>End.</hi> Now This is the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nhappy condition</hi> of the moſt among us: We ſo poorly Behave our ſelves, in the <hi>Time of our Trial,</hi> that we <hi>know not</hi> what <hi>State</hi> we are going into; Whether it will be a <hi>Bliſsful State,</hi> or whether it will be a <hi>Woful State,</hi> wherein we are even to all <hi>Eternity,</hi> to have our Lodging aſſign'd unto us.

            </p>
            <p>There are Two Things that ſhall now be Enquired, &amp; briefly Anſwered, about it.</p>
            <p>We will Enquire, Firſt; Whence it comes to paſs, that ſo many are in the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nhappy Condition</hi>; to be in the <hi>Dark,</hi> how it ſhall fare with them in the <hi>Future State!</hi> Now,</p>
            <p>Firſt <hi>The Earth with its Bars, is about them forever.</hi> The Enchantments &amp; Amuſements of <hi>This World</hi> keep the moſt of us from that <hi>Religion in Earneſt,</hi> which alone will <hi>ſettle Good Terms with Heaven</hi> for us. Tis nothing but <hi>Religion in Earneſt,</hi> &amp; a <hi>Seeking the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour</hi> of GOD <hi>with our whole Heart,</hi> that will aſſure us of our being in His <hi>Favour.</hi> Would we be aſſur'd of our Entring in at the <hi>Straight Gate?</hi> Our SAVIOUR has inſiſted on this Direction; <hi>Luck<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> XIII. 24 <hi>Strive,</hi> and be in <hi>Agony</hi> for it. Now, <hi>This World</hi> ſo Bewitches us, and the <hi>Buſineſs</hi> of <hi>This World</hi> ſo Engages us; that we afford no room for this <hi>Agony.</hi> Our <hi>Agony</hi> is upon, <hi>What ſhall I Eat or Drink,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:002559_0012_0FDB6FAE9633DE50"/>
&amp; wherewithal ſhall I be Cloathed?</hi> This Extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhes the due <hi>Agony</hi> upon, <hi>What ſhall I do to be Saved</hi>? The Ancient complaint may be renewed in every Generation, <hi>There is none who Stirs up himſelf to take hold on GOD.</hi> What hinders? Tis <hi>This World</hi>; The Affairs, and the Hurries, of <hi>This World,</hi> Engroſs our Spirits, &amp; weaken our concern about <hi>Another World</hi> We are ſo Swallowed up in the cares to make ſure of <hi>This World,</hi> that we fooliſhly forget, ſhamefully neglect, the Needful En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to make ſure of a part in a <hi>Better World<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> We are always <hi>Grinding</hi> for <hi>This World</hi>; and let <hi>Satan</hi> alone to keep always filling the <hi>Hopper</hi> for us. Hence tis, that we have truly <hi>No Heart,</hi> &amp; then falſely pretend that we have <hi>No Time,</hi> to <hi>Stir up our ſelves,</hi> that we may <hi>lay Hold on Eternal Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly. People generally go to <hi>Settle Good Terms with Heaven,</hi> on the <hi>Terms</hi> of the <hi>old Covenant.</hi> The Invitation of the Goſpel, is, O <hi>chief of Sinners, come Immediately unto thy SAVIO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>R. Let thy Heart with His Help conſent unto it, That thy SAVIO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>R ſhould make thee Righteous and Holy. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent then take up a comfortable perſwaſion, that thy SAVIO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>R will ſurely do thee Good.</hi> People thro' the <hi>Pride</hi> of a <hi>carnal Mind</hi> have an Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for this <hi>Way of GOD.</hi> They will go on, it may be all their Days, doing ſome <hi>Duties,</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:002559_0013_0FDB6FB015A12BA0"/>
which they know themſelves bound unto. Yea, They will take <hi>Pains</hi> in the <hi>Duties.</hi> But what are their <hi>Aims</hi> in all the <hi>Pains</hi>? They <hi>Aim</hi> at making themſelves a <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi>; or at leaſt, they <hi>Aim</hi> at thoſe Attainments, which may Qualify them for, &amp; Recommend them to, a kind Reception with their SAVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUR. They durſt not come to their SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOUR, or be well perſwaded of His Receiving them, until they have gone thro' a <hi>courſe of Duties,</hi> and led ſuch <hi>Regular Lives</hi> as may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeak a kind Reception with their SAVIOUR for them. This <hi>Prepoſterous Proceeding</hi> has too much of the <hi>Old Covenant</hi> in it: And yet even ſome that have the <hi>Fear of GOD</hi> really in their Hearts, may have the Spirit of the <hi>Old Covenant</hi> working too much in them Now of this <hi>Old Covenant</hi> we ſhall ſtill find, what we read; Gal. IV. 24. <hi>It genders unto Bondage.</hi> It begets nothing but a <hi>Fear of Death,</hi> and of Wrath, which will <hi>hold us in Bendage all our Days.</hi> Tis nothing but the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> wiſely Underſtood, &amp; Embraced, &amp; Applied, that will <hi>ſpeak Peace</hi> unto us. People don't come off Entirely from the <hi>Covenant of Works</hi> into the <hi>Covenant of Grace.</hi> And they can do no other than <hi>Walk in Darkneſs,</hi> while they have the <hi>Covenant of Works</hi> in any operation upon them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly. Many are Patient &amp; Eaſy, while
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:002559_0014_0FDB6FB481C2A730"/>
they do not <hi>Settle Good Terms with Heaven,</hi> under a <hi>Slothful pretence</hi> of <hi>waiting</hi> till GOD ſhall pleaſe to give ſome <hi>Aſſurance of His Love</hi> unto them. Tis true, we ſhall not know our ſelves to be the <hi>Children of</hi> GOD, until that Priviledge be granted us; Rom. VIII. 16. <hi>The Spirit beareth witneſs with our Spirit, that we are the Children of GOD.</hi> But then, How is this <hi>Witneſs</hi> to be <hi>waited</hi> for? Surely, not with the meet <hi>Deſire of the Sluggard, refuſing to Labour</hi> for it: Not with a Soul that can be <hi>Quiet</hi> without it; Not counting it enough with a faint, mean, melancholy Tone to ſay, <hi>Ay, It is a good Thing, if one could Attain to it. It is well for them that can Attain to it. I muſt wait until it pleaſe</hi> GOD <hi>that I ſhall Attain to it</hi>! And is this all that you have to ſay, <hi>ye Slug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard</hi>? It muſt be <hi>waited for!</hi> But, How <hi>waited for?</hi> Syrs, It muſt be <hi>Groaned for</hi>; It muſt be <hi>Wreſtled for,</hi> it muſt be Earneſtly <hi>Laboured</hi> for. The GOD who <hi>waits to be Gracious,</hi> will be <hi>waited</hi> for. But in our <hi>waiting</hi> on Him, to <hi>Satisfy</hi> us with ſome Glimpſe of His <hi>Law</hi> unto us, our Importunity muſt be Vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, be Violent, be Unpacifiable. The cry muſt be, <hi>O Satisfy us Early with thy Mercy</hi>! Yea, the cry muſt be, <hi>Hear me Speedily, O Lord, my Spirit faileth: Hide not thy Face from me.</hi> About a matter of ſome weight, it was of old ſaid, <hi>The Man will not be at Reſt until he
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:002559_0015_0FDB6FB602D7EBA8"/>
has finiſhed the Thing.</hi> A matter infinitely more weighty, is that of getting into this <hi>Peace</hi> of GOD: And it ſhould be ſaid of him that is <hi>waiting</hi> on GOD for it; <hi>The man will not be at Reſt until the Thing is finiſhed.</hi> Few, Few, are ſuch <hi>Importunate waiters.</hi> Many<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> content themſelves with a Liftleſs, Lazy, Drowſy <hi>waiting.</hi> And they Speed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.</p>
            <p>Fourthly. Even they that are truely <hi>Turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Darkneſs to Light and from the power of Satan unto GOD,</hi> may be liable to this <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Condition</hi>: But Frequently, yea, Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their <hi>Darkneſs</hi> is a <hi>Chaſtiſement</hi> from GOD upon them. GOD is herein for their Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages <hi>Chaſtiſing</hi> of them Indeed, there may be ſometimes a Diſplay of <hi>Sovereignty</hi> in it. The Glorious GOD may <hi>hide his Face</hi> from them who are the <hi>Dearly Beloved of His Soul</hi>: and then <hi>how Great the Darkneſs</hi>! The Beſt man Living in the World, may be left unto ſuch <hi>Darkneſs,</hi> as to conclude, <hi>GOD counteth me for His Enemy</hi>! But yet for the moſt part, the Children of GOD may <hi>Thank Themſelves</hi> for it, when they are <hi>in the Dark</hi> about it, whether GOD will own them for His Children. For the Iniquity of their Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, I hide My ſelf, and am wroth with them, ſays the GOD, who will not let them <hi>know that He has Loved them.</hi> We are adviſed
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:002559_0016_0FDB6FBC5B379B08"/>
Eph. IV. 30. <hi>Grieve not the Holy Spirit, whereby ye are Sealed unto the Day of Redemption.</hi> We are <hi>Sealed</hi> by the <hi>Holy Spirit of GOD,</hi> when we are filled by Him, with an Hopeful, Joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, Sanctifying <hi>Aſſurance,</hi> That our GOD <hi>has Loved us with an Everlaſting Love,</hi> &amp; that He will give us to ſee a <hi>Day of Redemption</hi> from all that is a Trouble unto us. But we Blot our <hi>Evidences</hi> for Heaven, by our Manifold Irregularities. By not Maintaining a Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, Fruitful, Humble <hi>Walk with GOD,</hi> We <hi>Grieve the Holy Spirit of GOD</hi> By our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulging our ſelves in carnal <hi>Paſſions,</hi> and by too Eagerly <hi>Minding of Earthly Things,</hi> We <hi>Grieve the Holy Spirit of GOD.</hi> By our Inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate fondneſs for <hi>Creatures</hi> and <hi>Lightly E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeming the Rock of our Salvation,</hi> We <hi>Grieve the Holy Spirit of GOD.</hi> The <hi>Grieved Spirit,</hi> who ſhould be our <hi>Comforter</hi> now <hi>departs</hi> from us. And, <hi>Wo to them, when I depart from them, ſaith the Lord.</hi> His <hi>withdraw</hi> makes a <hi>Dark Time</hi> with us. <hi>Deſertions</hi> which Leave an <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of Darkneſs</hi> upon us, theſe are ſome of the <hi>Puniſhments</hi> which the <hi>Grieved Spirit</hi> inflicts on His own, when He will <hi>Viſit their Iniquity with Stripes,</hi> tho' He do <hi>not utterly take away His Loving kindneſs from them.</hi> The <hi>Holy</hi> One offended at His faulty Children, Says up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, <hi>I will puniſh them, with ſuch Darkneſs upon them, that they ſhall not be able to Read their Names
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:002559_0017_0FDB6FBD86354B60"/>
written in the Book of Life; not be able to See, that I have any purpoſes of Mercy for them.</hi> So does the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nhappy Condition</hi> come upon us.</p>
            <p>We will Enquire, Secondly; What is the <hi>Unhappineſs</hi> of this <hi>Condition</hi>; For People to be <hi>in the Dark,</hi> whether their <hi>Future State,</hi> muſt be in a <hi>Glad,</hi> or in a <hi>Sad</hi> Eternity.</p>
            <p>Now,</p>
            <p>Firſt; A <hi>Darkneſs</hi> on our Minds, whether we are <hi>in Good Terms with Heaven,</hi> or no, it muſt needs bring a <hi>Weakneſs</hi> on our Eſſays to <hi>Love</hi> GOD, &amp; <hi>Live</hi> unto Him. It was a luſt Remark; Neh VIII 10. <hi>The Joy of the Lord is your Strength.</hi> The <hi>Joy</hi> of a Soul Reconcil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto GOD, and knowing, yea, feeling it ſelf <hi>Bound up in the Bundle of Life,</hi> Oh! how it would <hi>Strengthen</hi> us to <hi>Walk with our GOD,</hi> Yea, How would it <hi>Enlarge our Hearts</hi> to <hi>Run</hi> in the <hi>Ways</hi> commanded of GOD! This <hi>Joy</hi> would be the <hi>Life of our hand,</hi> in doing the <hi>Works of GOD</hi> which our <hi>Hand finds to do,</hi> &amp; would cauſe us to <hi>Sing in the Ways of the Lord.</hi> When we Hear our GOD ſaying to us, <hi>Be comforted, Thy Sins are Forgiven thee</hi>! Nothing will have ſuch a Tendency to render all <hi>Sins</hi> Bitter and Hateful unto us. GOD <hi>Speaking Peace</hi> to us, this more than any thing will keep us from <hi>Returning to Folly</hi> any more. When tis teſtified unto us, That GOD has made us <hi>Heirs of the Kingdom which He has
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:002559_0018_0FDB6FBF0CE53948"/>
promiſed for them that Love Him,</hi> there will ſoon be Teſtimonies, <hi>How Holily, and Righteouſly, and Unblameably, we ſhall behave our ſelves.</hi> Did we know that we are <hi>Bound for Heaven,</hi> and that we have <hi>all the Spiritual Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of the Heavenly places</hi> reſerved for us, what <hi>Heavenly Tempers</hi> would be thereby pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in us! How ſhould we have our <hi>Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation in Heaven</hi> while we are on the <hi>Earth</hi>: &amp; Soar, &amp; Fly, &amp; Mount up <hi>as with the wings of Eagles</hi> thither! All the <hi>Delights</hi> of <hi>Earth,</hi> &amp; all the <hi>Troubles</hi> of <hi>Earth,</hi> how Mortified, how Indifferent, ſhould we be unto them all? But now, while you <hi>Walk in Darkneſs,</hi> O ye <hi>Feeble Folk,</hi> How is it poſſible for you to <hi>Walk with GOD,</hi> and be <hi>Stately in your Goings</hi>? While you cannot <hi>Rejoice,</hi> how Weak, how Dull, how Low, will be all your Actions in <hi>Working of Righteouſneſs?</hi> How poorly will the <hi>Love</hi> of GOD be flaming in you, while, for ought you know, you have the <hi>Wrath</hi> of GOD Lying on you! Will you <hi>Love</hi> GOD, while you have a Suſpicion, That He is your <hi>Adverſary,</hi> and that your <hi>King</hi> has of old <hi>Ordained a Tophet</hi> for you! How Sorrily will you <hi>Live</hi> to GOD, while you are Jealous, that you have <hi>never yet paſſed from Death to Life</hi>; Jealous, that after all the <hi>Sparks</hi> you have <hi>kindled</hi> you muſt <hi>Ly down in Sorrow</hi>: It will be found, That a Great occaſion of it, why there is to be ſeen ſo little
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:002559_0019_0FDB6FC441E9CAB8"/>
of <hi>Godlineſs in the power of it</hi> among us, &amp; we are moſtly ſuch Feeble, Meagre, <hi>Minor Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> tis this; People are too willing to <hi>Walk in Darkneſs,</hi> and can go on from year to year without <hi>Knowing whither they are going.</hi> Tho' there is alſo a Reciprocation of it; Becauſe there is no more <hi>Godlineſs in the Power of it,</hi> Therefore tis that we have ſo much <hi>Darkneſs</hi> upon us. Ah! <hi>Frozen</hi> Souls, in what an <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Condition</hi> are you?</p>
            <p>But then, Secondly; My Brethren, while you have a <hi>Darkneſs,</hi> on your Minds, whether you are <hi>in Good Terms with Heaven,</hi> or no. How can you <hi>Dy?</hi> Nay How can you <hi>Live?</hi> which way can you keep off <hi>Anguiſh</hi> from your Minds, which if a <hi>Spirit of Slumber</hi> had not <hi>Poiſon'd</hi> you, would be indeed, <hi>Intolerable</hi>? One that ſeems at a Loſs, whether GOD would be <hi>Favourable</hi> to him, or not <hi>caſt him off fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> cried out, Pſal. LXXVII. 24. <hi>My Soul refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to be comforted; Thou holdeſt mine Eyes waking: I am ſo Troubled that I cannot Speak.</hi> Indeed, If you could ſay, <hi>I know that my Redeemer Lives, and I know that He is indeed mine, &amp; has Loved me, and has died for me</hi>; How comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably might you <hi>Paſs the Time of your Sojourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing here</hi> in the <hi>Fear</hi> of GOD, but without the leaſt <hi>Fear</hi> of any <hi>Evil</hi>! Yea, Look where you will, all objects would conſpire to Speak unto you, as the Lord unto the Angel in the Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

Methinks, you ſhould have a <hi>Soul refuſing to be comforted</hi> with any thing here. Methinks, your <hi>Eyes</hi> may be held <hi>Waking,</hi> with the Flames that are before them.

And tho' they are told of it, yet they will <hi>Proceed further</hi> in it. It was a Problem of old, <hi>As for Darkneſs, where is the place thereof</hi>? Alas, How many of us may lay our Hand on our <hi>Heart,</hi> and ſay, <hi>Here is the place of Darkneſs. Tis an Heart always in the Dark, about the place to which I am going.

and they know not whither their <hi>Pathes</hi> will carry them. And yet I muſt bring this alſo into my Remonſtrance; The <hi>Darkneſs</hi> is not ſo <hi>Grievous</hi> to them, as it ought to be. It was threatened as a very Direful Curſe upon the Enemies of GOD, and His CHRIST; Pſal. XXXV. 6. <hi>Let their Way be Dark and Slippery.</hi> How many are under this <hi>Curſe,</hi> &amp; yet how little are they affected with it? <hi>Their Way</hi> is all <hi>in the Dark</hi>; they <hi>know not whither they are going.</hi> And yet is it ſuch a <hi>Slippery Way,</hi> that they are Every moment in danger of <hi>Slipping</hi> and falling down into the Land, where they <hi>never ſee Light,</hi> but where <hi>the Light it ſelf is Darkneſs.</hi>

And what a Thin Appearance is Left at the <hi>Holy Table</hi>? Be Sure, Not Half of the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on! But what is the Cauſe of This? The True Cauſe why People <hi>do</hi> not come unto the <hi>Table</hi> of the Lord, is becauſe they <hi>Dare</hi> not come.

Think, <hi>If I go up to that World, I ſhall ſee a Perfect Rest from every thing that can be grievous to me here; I ſhall have no Sorrow there, but all Tears will be Wiped from my Eyes.</hi> Think again; <hi>If I go up to That World, I ſhall find in the Alſufficient GOD, all that is Reliſhable or Valuable in any creatures here, &amp; inconcervably more; and an Admirable CHRIST will fill me with all the Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

Think again, <hi>If I go down to that World, all the painful Things, that ever I did or could Suffer, by the mediation of my ſenſes here, I ſhall have without them, diſpenſed unto me there, in very Tormenting Sentiments which a Provoked GOD will compel me to; And all thoſe pains little enough to puniſh my Crimes in Denying the GOD that is above.</hi> Think once more; <hi>If I go down to that World, an Almighty GOD Himſelf will take me into His own Hands, and make me feel ſuch Scalding Strokes, of His Wrath as no Tongue is able to Expreſs, no Heart able to Conceive. Immediate Emanations from an Offended, Omnipotent, Omniſcient &amp; Omnipreſent

GOD, will penetrate like Hot Lightning into my Soul: immediate Coruſcations from GOD acting as a Conſuming Fire. GOD Himſelf will fight againſt me, with a Strong Arm, even in Great Wrath. And can my Hands be ſtrong, or can my Heart endure, when GOD ſhall deal with me?</hi> But then, let thy <hi>Meditation</hi> mind thee of the <hi>Eternity</hi> which renders <hi>That World,</hi> yet more Terrible: The <hi>Everlaſting Puniſhment,</hi> which the <hi>Wicked</hi> ſhall <hi>go away</hi> into. Think; <hi>If I come to be tormented in that World, I know not of any Period for my Torment. An Aking Tooth for one Month, how grievous would it be unto me here! But if I muſt ly down among the damned, I muſt undergo much worſe Griefs than That: and after as many Millions of Years, as there are Leaves on the Trees, or Drops in the Sea, or Sands on the Shore, I have no proſpect of any Period. When the Mediator delivers up the Kingdom to His Father, I ſhall be left ſtill under the Vengeance of GOD. And how can I hope for a Deliverance, when there will be no Mediator for me! When GOD lays me in the loweſt pit in Darkneſs, in the Deeps, I ſhall be ſhut up, and cannot come forth any more.</hi> Canſt thou think thus, and canſt thou bear the Horror of the <hi>Hazzard</hi> of ſuch a <hi>Portion</hi>: Oh!

               <p>Again; All turns upon your Compliance, with the <hi>Three Illuſtrious Articles</hi> of PIETY, which <hi>all that Fear GOD and work Righteouſneſs</hi> are united in. There are <hi>Three Illuſtrious Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,</hi> wherein all the People of our SAVIOUR are <hi>One,</hi> as He has <hi>Interceeded</hi> that they may be. There have been many large Diſcourſes upon, <hi>The Trial of a Good State</hi>: And ſometimes after the Thing has been Largely Diſcourſed on, tis left in as much obſcurity and perplexity, as it was before. But the moſt <hi>Weighty Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> in the World, will be ſoon determined by theſe Three Enquiries.</p>
               <p>Enquire, firſt. <q>Is it my principal &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Study to Glorify GOD in doing the <hi>Things that pleaſe Him</hi>? And am I always a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of Every Thing, which the <hi>Light of GOD</hi> in my Soul condemns as an Evil Thing?</q>
               </p>
               <p>Enquire, nextly. <q>Do I come &amp; look to a Glorious CHRIST, for all the Bleſſings of an <hi>Holy Redeemer</hi>; &amp; do I long for nothing ſo much, as to be what He would have me <hi>to be?</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Enquire, laſtly. <q>Do I heartily wiſh that my Neighbour may have with me a ſhare in all the <hi>Bleſſings of Goodneſs</hi>; Pleas'd with his
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:002559_0043_0FDB6FF4A86C53E0"/>
Welfare; Griev'd at his Trouble; not har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring any evil Diſpoſition towards Him?</q>
               </p>
               <p>Soul, If thou art come to theſe Things, thou haſt the <hi>Marks of GOD</hi> upon thee; Thou art of the <hi>Righteous Nation,</hi> which the <hi>Gates of the Holy City</hi> forever ſtand open to. Oh! let nothing pacify thee, till thou find thy ſelf thus <hi>Marked</hi> of, and for the Lord.</p>
               <p>Thirdly. There are various <hi>Acts</hi> of a <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever Living unto GOD.</hi> The Doing of any ſuch <hi>Acts</hi> will help to ſhow it, and a courſe Abounding and perſiſting in ſuch <hi>Acts,</hi> will indiſputably ſhow it, that you are to <hi>Live Eternally.</hi> As now, To do the part of a <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer,</hi> in Patiently and Cheerfully Submitting to the <hi>Will</hi> of GOD, as often as he does with Afflictive Diſpenſations <hi>Perform the Thing that is appointed for us</hi>: Willingly to offer up our <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> when our <hi>Deſirable Things</hi> are taken away with a <hi>Stroke</hi>; Devoutly to find in a CHRIST all the Good which we fondly ſought in the things that we have <hi>Sacrificed</hi>: This will determine it, that we have a part in the <hi>Royal Prieſthood</hi>; &amp; we ſhall one day come to ſerve GOD in His <hi>Temple</hi> which is <hi>Above.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again; To Realize the <hi>Eye</hi> of GOD upon you in all your ways; to be by the Aw thereof Reſtrain'd from <hi>Evil</hi> ways, and Forwarded in <hi>Good</hi> ways; by this Thought, <hi>GOD ſees me; GOD knows what is done in the moſt ſecret places</hi>!
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:002559_0044_0FDB6FF7A8947938"/>
To keep a Guard on the very Motions of your <hi>Hearts,</hi> becauſe <hi>GOD Looks</hi> upon them! This is the way of none but the <hi>upright in Heart</hi>; the <hi>Good</hi> ones, whom GOD will <hi>do Good</hi> unto.</p>
               <p>Moreover, To welcome any <hi>Bitter Thing,</hi> whereby <hi>Sin</hi> may be <hi>Embittered</hi>; and this <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe</hi> of its being ſo! To prefer a Sanctified <hi>Adverſity,</hi> before a Secure, Senſeleſs, Carnal <hi>Proſperity</hi>: To be Thankful for a <hi>Way hedged with Thorns,</hi> wherein you are kept from <hi>Walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the vanity of your Minds</hi>! This is not the way of the <hi>Hypocrite</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Soul, Here are Symptoms, that thou haſt the <hi>Life of GOD</hi> begun in thee But if thou doſt indeed feel thy ſelf <hi>Living</hi> to GOD, thou mayſt argue from it, <hi>Now I ſee that the Sentence of Death paſſed on me for my Sin, is taken off, &amp; my Sin is all forgiven.</hi> Go on, &amp; argue at this rate; <hi>The Life of GOD thus begun in me, will never Dy: No Death can Ever Extinguiſh it!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will add one thing more. Chriſtian, Doſt thou feel the <hi>Blood</hi> of thy JESUS running warm in the Veins of thy Soul? That is to ſay: Does thy Soul cloſe with the Intentions on which the <hi>Blood</hi> of thy SAVIOUR has been ſhed for His people, to <hi>Purify for Himſelf a Peculiar People?</hi> Does thy Soul wiſh &amp; long &amp; groan for it, that the Spirit of thy SAVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUR, would make thee <hi>Like</hi> unto Him, and bring thee to <hi>Hate Wickedneſs</hi> &amp; <hi>Love Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs</hi>
                  <pb n="44" facs="unknown:002559_0045_0FDB6FFAAC3AA1C0"/>
and <hi>always do the Things that pleaſe the FATHER?</hi> Doſt thou <hi>Dy</hi> to Creatures, <hi>and</hi> as this <hi>Death</hi> goes on, is a CHRIST more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dear'd unto thee; nothing but a CHRIST left <hi>Alive</hi> unto thee? Now tis no longer to be queſtion'd, Thou art moſt certainly one of thoſe whom thy SAVIOUR has <hi>Died</hi> for. The <hi>Blood</hi> of thy SAVIOUR has been moſt certainly <hi>Sprinkled</hi> upon thee. The <hi>Holy of Holies</hi> is open for thee.</p>
               <p>Fourthly. Yea, The <hi>Speaking</hi> of ONE WORD, if the <hi>Word</hi> be but <hi>Heartily Spoken</hi>; This may determine it, That you have <hi>an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance in the Heavens reſerved for you.</hi> Such a <hi>Word</hi> as That; Pſal CXIX. 94 <hi>Lord, I am Thine!</hi> This, This ONE WORD will go very far towards it. ONE WORD, O Soul ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous to <hi>know whither thou art going,</hi> ONE WORD, that ſhall Declare thee to be among the <hi>Willing People</hi> of thy SAVIOUR; This will determine it. The Experiment ſhall be made only in Two Inſtances.</p>
               <p>Firſt. The <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> wherein a Glorious CHRIST is the <hi>Head</hi> of His People, is Propos'd unto thee. It is Propos'd by GOD, <hi>Art thou willing that thy SAVIOUR ſhould make thee both Righteous &amp; Holy, &amp; both Reſtore thee to the Favour of thy GOD, &amp; Reſtore to thee His Image; and make thee to be all that He will have His choſen to be</hi>? Now, Heartily Reply this

ONE WORD; <hi>Lord Make me willing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thou haſt Made me willing!</hi> Then haſt thou <hi>Laid Hold on the Covenant</hi>; and thou art <hi>Bound up in the Bundle of Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly. There is made unto thee a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of an <hi>Eſpouſal</hi> unto a Glorious CHRIST, who ſays, <hi>I Marry My ſelf unto thee.</hi> The Propoſal of thy SAVIOUR, is; <hi>Art thou wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, That I ſhould make thee Mine, &amp; by my Spirit Entirely take Poſſeſſion of thee</hi>; &amp; <hi>Feed thee, Cloath thee, Inſtruct thee, Protect thee, bring thee to My Fathers Houſe, &amp; Rejoyce in thee forevermore</hi>? Now, Heartily Reply this ONE WORD; <hi>Lord, Make me willing; Thou haſt Made me wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi>; Then art thou come into an <hi>Eſpouſal</hi> with a Lord who <hi>hates putting away.</hi> In <hi>Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs forever</hi> has He <hi>Bethrothed</hi> thee unto Himſelf; &amp; He will no more part with thee, than the <hi>Apple of His Eye.</hi> Oh!
