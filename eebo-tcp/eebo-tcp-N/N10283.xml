            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

wiſe and moral; however it may exceed <hi>our</hi> comprehenſion. The moſt <hi>immediate</hi> government of the world, if God had choſen ſuch a method, could have afforded no degree of trouble to that myſteriouſly perfect Being, who is neceſſarily infinite in happineſs: In his wiſdom, however, He has choſen to uſe, in a great variety of inſtances, the <hi>media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of others, for carrying on the deſigns of his providence. Agreeably, civil rulers, in this world, are in the number of His miniſters, or ſervants. They are <hi>conſtituted</hi> by <hi>Him. There is no power</hi> (ſays the Apoſtle) <hi>but of God: the powers that be, are ordained of God.</hi> It is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the <hi>will of God,</hi> that there ſhould be civil government: <hi>He</hi> has given to mankind that <hi>reaſon</hi> which points to it, as uſeful and neceſſary; and, in general terms, the magiſtrate is raiſed up, and inveſted with his office, in the courſe of <hi>divine providence.</hi>

militates againſt the ſuppoſition that the people ought to have a voice in the elevation of thoſe who are, in a civil ſenſe, to rule them, than the doctrine of God's appointing goſpel miniſters interferes with the ſuppoſition of a right in the churches to elect their own paſtors. He never deſigned, mediately or imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, to appoint rulers over the people, in ſtate or church, ſo as to debar <hi>them</hi> from the privilege of chooſing their own officers (except in a few extraordinary inſtances of ancient date) and they, who attempt to deprive the people of ſuch a privilege, oppoſe themſelves equally, to the will of God, and to the rights of mankind.<note n="†" place="bottom">The People may, by a conſtitution, make an office hereditary in a Family, or leave it to particular perſons to appoint rulers, agreeably to a conſtitution eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the whole ſociety, when, ſo far, and ſo long as they think it beſt; but ſtill they have an unaliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble right to alter ſuch conſtitution at pleaſure, and to interpoſe <hi>immediately</hi> in the election of their officers, whenever they judge it proper.</note>

the affairs of the world ſo as to increaſe the felicity of the ſupreme Being, for He is above the poſſibility of being benefited, by the ſervices of men or Angels—not to enſlave mankind, and involve them in miſery and ruin—not ſurely to enrich and aggrandize themſelves and their families, prejudicially to honeſt induſtry, as if God had a partiality for <hi>them;</hi> but He appoints them to be his miniſters, <hi>for good to the publick:</hi> mean while intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they ſhould have, from the people, a certain diſtinguiſhing reſpect and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, as the juſt recompence of their faithful arduous important ſervices, to the community.</p>
            <p>THAT the civil ruler, and chriſtian miniſter, ſhould engroſs the wealth of the world to themſelves, <hi>as</hi> they have done, in many countries and ages, and live in pride and luxury, on ſpoils vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently extorted, or ſlily drained from the people, is altogether foreign to the deſign of God, in ſetting them up.

            <p>THE Apoſtle Paul in this letter to ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man chriſtians, ſays, <hi>He,</hi> meaning the civil magiſtrate, <hi>is the miniſter of God to thee for good.</hi> The ſenſe of the ſacred writer we judge to be, that civil magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracy is <hi>deſigned</hi> of God for good to the governed; and that rulers are, therefore, <hi>eventually,</hi> His miniſters for the promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of public happineſs, conſidered as underſtanding, and acting up to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirements of their ſtations, and ſo as to anſwer the end of their inveſtiture. To ſuppoſe that the Apoſtle intended here, particularly to characterize Nero, who was then at the head of the Roman
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:013053_0009_0F8FF617F881E1A0"/>
Empire, and his ſervants, who probably partook of his ſpirit, and imitated his conduct, as if they were benefactors to the public, is apparently abſurd (unleſs this epiſtle was written ſoon after his coming to the imperial crown, when he is ſaid to have reigned well<note n="*" place="bottom">HARWOOD, in his liberal Tranſlation of the New-Teſtament, at the beginning of this 13th Chapter to the Romans, has the following Note,—<q>When this epiſtle was written Nero had the character of an excellent prince.

               </note>) for Nero, except at the beginning of his reign, was a tyrannical <hi>malefactor</hi> to his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
            <p>GOD would have His civil miniſters to prove, <hi>a terror to evil works; to puniſh evil doers</hi>—by ſalutary laws, honeſtly and honorably executed, to ſave the ſtate from foreign injurious invaders (while they are circumſpectful, to leave

the people in the ample enjoyment of all rational liberties, in oppoſition to any temptations they may be under to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringe the ſame themſelves) and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the peoples ſuffering, from one another, as to life, property, or any of their rights. It is alſo His pleaſure, that they ſhould be <hi>a praiſe to them that do well</hi>—ſhould properly honour and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them. When the virtuous and the good are frowned on and diſgraced, when laudable exertions for publick utility are damped and checked, when the perpetrators of wickedneſs noxious to ſociety are not terrified and ſuppreſſed, but ſcreened and promoted, there is a ſorrowful, and not blameleſs deviation from the deſign of the righteous <hi>God, the father of mercies,</hi> in the inſtitution of civil government.</p>
            <p>To anſwer the purpoſe of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it is of conſequence that men ſhould be bleſſed with capacity, and poſſeſſed of enlarged knowledge, reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting the nature of their office, the extent of their power, the ſtate ſufferings,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:013053_0011_0F8FF61B70167878"/>
and dangers of the people, their intereſts, and what may conduce to their relief, ſecurity and happineſs: but men of ſuch greatneſs (like elephants in war) are not to be <hi>depended</hi> on, as perſons who will <hi>ſteadily</hi> purſue the publick good, unleſs they are poſſeſſed of that publick ſpirit, which the charitable Goſpel infuſes, and ſo have the end of government at <hi>heart.</hi> Avarice and ambition may carry men conſiderable lengths, in meaſures which are for publick advantage, when they perceive that ſuch meaſures will beſt gratify theſe paſſions; but if they are enriched with no higher principles, whenever it ſo happens, that there is an interference between the gratification of theſe paſſions, and a purſuance of the publick good, which is likely to be fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the caſe, the happineſs of mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes will probably fall a ſacrifice to the vile affections of a few. Whereas, publick ſpirit, poſſeſſed as it ought to be, predominates over every private worldly affection, and cauſes every pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate worldly intereſt, incompatible with the public welfare, to fall a ſacrifice to
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:013053_0012_0F8FF61C77DA7A28"/>
the general felicity: It carries the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, with firmneſs, uniformity and perſeverance, through his courſe of duty; however environed with warping temptations: It inſpires him with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, forbids the <hi>appearance</hi> of oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: It quickens to vigilance and activity, renders him a father to the community, a miniſter of God, <hi>in event,</hi> for good, a God-like bleſſing.</p>
            <p>IT has been ſaid, that the miniſters of the Goſpel ought to have no concern in political matters; but, that God's civil miniſters ought to ſtand at a diſtance from every thing relating to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, we do not afirm. They have a right to govern the miniſters of Chriſt's Spiritual Kingdom. The clergy, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of arrogating to themſelves an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent papal power of depoſing Kings and Emperors, are as much obliged to be in ſubjection to civil powers, as other ranks of men. The rights of conſcience are to be treated with the greateſt deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy; but if people, under a <hi>pretence</hi> of conſcience, conduct manifeſtly to the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:013053_0013_0F8FF61D33D43810"/>
material damage of Society, the civil arm has a right to reſtrain them. It is the part of civil powers to encourage and promote religion, as <hi>that</hi> is condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive to the benefit of Society; particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, as it gives people due veneration for <hi>an Oath,</hi> which <hi>for confirmation is to them an end of all ſtrife.</hi> Eſpecially, it is incumbent on the civil magiſtrate to cultivate the ſincereſt piety in his own breaſt. A miniſter of God, who has no reverence for that great Being whom he is ordained to ſerve, is a perfect prodigy. The perpetual nouriſhment of godlineſs in the heart, is the indiſpenſable duty of the civil governor—for the honor of God, for his own ſake, and for the ſake of the people. A ſuperlative <hi>reſpect</hi> for <hi>Him,</hi> whoſe abſolutely diſintereſted goodneſs brought the world into being, and who governs it ſo that <hi>His tender mercies are over all His works;</hi> a <hi>reverence</hi> for the authority of the chriſtian Legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lator, whoſe precepts, in favor of charity, juſtice and kindneſs, hold a diſtinguiſhed place in the new teſtament; an engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>regard</hi> to <hi>His</hi> example, <hi>who went
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:013053_0014_0F8FF61DD5376D50"/>
about doing good,</hi> as He came down from heaven with the moſt beneficent purpoſe, and who condeſcended to die for the <hi>good</hi> of the world; together with a deeply impreſſed <hi>ſenſe of Eternity</hi>—will have an happy and neceſſary influence into that patriotiſm, which is the magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate's indiſpenſable qualification. Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere piety fills the ſoul with the tendereſt feelings for mankind, and ſo engages the heart in purſuit of that, which is the great end of government. Impiety, worldly-mindedneſs and ſenſuality render the heart flinty, and inſenſible to the groans of the oppreſſed; while godlineſs inſpires the ſofteſt paſſions—inſpires the <hi>brotherly kindneſs and charity,</hi> which will never give their poſſeſſor reſt, 'till every rational method is adopted, for the relief of the diſtreſſed, and the promotion of publick happineſs. Joſeph, firſt miniſter of ſtate to Pharaoh, having for ſeveral days confined his brethren, found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf inſufferably pained in heart, with the thought of longer detaining a ſupply from the half famiſhed houſe of his father, becauſe he <hi>feared God.</hi>

               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:013053_0015_0F8FF61EA10A6B78"/>
ALL the wiſdom, however, religion and publick ſpirit, which have generally exiſted, or can be expected ſoon to take place, among <hi>the great men of the earth,</hi> are by no means a ſufficient ſecurity to the people, that the end of government will be honorably anſwered. Rulers are ſo prone to have, vaſtly at heart, certain worldly intereſts, inconſiſtent with the publick, welfare and the duty they owe to the community, that it is incumbent on the people (whoſe right it is to do this, on proper conſideration, and every thing elſe, reſpecting government, which they judge will be for the ſalvation and advantage of the whole) to fix on certain regulations, which if we pleaſe we may call a <hi>conſtitution,</hi> as the ſtanding meaſure of the proceedings of government; ſo determining what powers they will inveſt their rulers with, and what privileges they will retain in their own hands.</p>
            <p>THROUGH the miſguiding arts of deſigning men, miſtakes and freakiſh paſſions, things hurtful to ſociety, are apt to take place in popular governments,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:013053_0016_0F8FF61F52B421B8"/>
which might be prevented by abſolute monarchy; while it ought in juſtice to be acknowledged, that ſome abſolute princes have been great benefactors to the publick: But ſuch conſiderations ſcarcely furniſh a better argument in favor of yielding up to deſpotiſm, than the religious diviſions in proteſtant countries, and the degrees of ſervice ever done to the churches by the Popes, afford, in favor of the re-admiſſion and eſtabliſhment of the papacy.</p>
            <p>UNLIMITED power has generally been deſtructive of human happineſs. The people are not under ſuch tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to thwart their own intereſts, as abſolute government is under to abuſe the people: and, that the publick intereſt has, generally and on the whole, ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed beyond all compariſon better, where the people have, by the barrier of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, retained power in a great degree in their own hands, than it has under deſpotick governments, we dare appeal to all the ſenſible, humane, impartial examiners of univerſal hiſtory.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:013053_0017_0F8FF6219763DE88"/>
OF ineſtimable value and importance are ſuch rights and privileges as are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the people, according to the Engliſh conſtitution particularly, and ſuch as were once enjoyed by this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, eſpecially under the firſt charter,—a charter that was inhumanly murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and over whoſe grave many of the people are now diſpoſed to raiſe a freſh lamentation.</p>
            <p>A CONSTITUTION being ſettled by the public conſent, the magiſtrate, awed by that Sovereignty which God has been pleaſed to inveſt the people with in the caſe, ought ever to maintain a ſacred reſpect to ſuch conſtitution, in every inſtance of government legiſlative or executive. The community having a right to fix boundaries between rulers and people by a conſtitution, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that individuals ſhould have a right to remove them, however high the rank of ſuch individuals may be. Rulers as well as others, have an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted right to make fair, and, as they judge, rational propoſals for the amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:013053_0018_0F8FF6229131AC20"/>
of a conſtitution; but by no means to attempt an alteration of it, without the publick conſent: by ſuch an attempt, they will merit a degree of blame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to the <hi>importance</hi> of the <hi>people'</hi>s fixing conſtitutional limits to the <hi>higher powers,</hi> in view of the common ſecurity. To forfeit any thing of a worldly nature, rather than bear a part in violating ſacred compacts, is the path of honor, chriſtian virtue, and happineſs.</p>
            <p>To have conſtitutions ſo expreſſed, that potentates ſhould be incapable of putting conſtructions upon them, through a biaſſed underſtanding, different from their original meaning, is impoſſible. Magiſtrates, who have no direct deſign or willingneſs to infringe the people's conſtitutional rights, may, nevertheleſs, be ſuppoſed to do it, and perhaps to a great degree, through a judgment pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced by worldly paſſions; and call that by the name of <hi>light,</hi> which the people rationally perceive to be <hi>darkneſs;</hi> and give that the denomination of <hi>ſweetneſs,</hi> which the people know to be

               <hi>bitter.</hi> The ruler's deſigned or prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced invaſion of conſtitutions has occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned innumerable evils, ſorrowful to relate; beſides the devaſtation and wretchedneſs brought on the world by the licentious paſſions of abſolute Princes: and the like may be juſtly feared, 'till they, who are <hi>rich</hi> and great <hi>in this world,</hi> are more <hi>enriched in faith</hi> and ſocial virtues than they have hitherto been.</p>
            <p>How far any perſons may have been charged, injuriouſly, with an inclination to promote the meaſures which are grievous to this Province and Country, we do not pretend to determine. But, if the Gentlemen, on either ſide of the Atlantick, who may be juſtly ſaid to be engaged in purſuit of ſuch meaſures, confidently judge, that they are acting the part which becomes men appointed of God to conſult the publick happineſs; and find their inward tranquillity, in no degree, diſturbed by ſuſpicions that they are infringing the rights of this People; may it not be excuſeable, nevertheleſs,

Men of eminence in life, as well as others, may have the judgment unduly influenced by the affections. In connexion with theſe things, it may not be amiſs to conſider, that communities, if they meet with treatment which is tolerably fair and good, will be generally found to be contented;—that the people of this land, who are ſo firmly and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally perſwaded, that their moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant rights are infringed, and are ſo much diſpoſed to complain of the meaſures they receive from the Britiſh Government, as endangering their moſt valuable bleſſings, if not the welfare of Britain, have been trained up, from their cradles, in a moſt affectionate dutiful reſpect to, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in the Houſe of Hanover,—abhor

            <p>THE people ought to have the end of government, the publick good, at heart,

as well as the magiſtrate; and therefore, to yield all loyal ſubjection to well regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated government, in oppoſition to every thing of a factious nature and complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and, for the ſame reaſon, it is not only their privilege, but it is alſo their duty, properly to aſſert their freedom, and take all rational and neceſſary me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods for the publick ſecurity and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, when conſtitutional boundaries are broken over, and ſo their rights are invaded. This affirmation ſuppoſes, <hi>the People have a right to judge</hi> of the conduct of government, and its tendency; and this again ſuppoſes them capable of judging in things of ſuch a nature.</p>
            <p>To have incomprehenſible myſteries in government is the Divine prerogative. Profound ſecrets in human governments, inacceſſible by ſociety, are too liable to become inſufferable <hi>myſteries of iniquity.</hi> It would be ſafeſt, if the people in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral could keep a very conſtant ſight of all the proceedings of civil adminiſtration; but as that is ſcarcely to be expected, whenever there appears any thing, in

the conduct of magiſtracy, juſtly alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it is the duty of thoſe in ſociety, who have the beſt advantages for full and ſeaſonable information, to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate what they can learn of the ſtate, and courſe of things, to others: and myſteries in government, which the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of the people, after obtaining ſuch aſſiſtance, and uſing laudable appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, muſt remain incapable of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending, ought to have no exiſtence.</p>
            <p>RULERS are, at once, <hi>miniſters of God,</hi> and <hi>ſervants of ſociety;</hi> as Goſpel miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are ſervants of Chriſt, and of the Churches. And, if God has given to the community a right to appoint its ſervants, it is but rational and conſiſtent to ſuppoſe, that the community ſhould have a right to take effectual care, that their ſervants ſhould not counteract and diſappoint the great purpoſe for which they were diſtinguiſhed from their fellow-creatures; and if, in any caſes, it may be ſeen neceſſary for the publick ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to give the ſervants of ſociety a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. That ſervants of the publick,
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:013053_0030_0F8FF62E4592F8B0"/>
ſhould not be reſponſible to the publick, is popery, either in religion, or politicks.</p>
            <p>IF the eſtabliſhment of a conſtitution, together with the religion and virtue rulers may be ſuppoſed to be poſſeſſed of, appears inſufficient, it is the people's duty to take thoſe further ſteps, which may be ſeen proper and needful, that the publick may not ſuffer. The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple's duty, in this reſpect, ariſes from the regard they owe to the great immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Law of Self-preſervation, and from the indebtments every perſon in ſociety is under to all the reſt, and to poſterity, by the laws of Chriſtian Charity.</p>
            <p>THESE are principles, we firmly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve perfectly conſonant to right reaſon, and to the word of God; they are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſuch principles as were adopted, and acted upon, at the Revolution, and which cannot be conſiſtently called into queſtion by thoſe, who pretend the leaſt regard to the continuation of our preſent Royal Family in the government.

            <p>THE Apoſtle, in this thirteenth chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his Epiſtle to the Romans, charges <hi>every ſoul to be ſubject to the higher powers;</hi> and, the argument whereby he enforces this exhortation, and diſſuades from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, is, that theſe civil powers are ordained of God, and ordained by Him, miniſterially to convey bleſſings from Him to the People. So long, therefore, and ſo far, as civil powers act agreeably to the deſign of their ordination, and do <hi>good</hi> in their ſtations, the people are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to ſubjection, and reſiſtance will be blameable; but if theſe powers forſake

their proper ſphere, thwart God's deſign in ordaining them, diſſerve the people, and take meaſures which tend to ruin them, the Apoſtle's ground of the people's ſubjection ceaſes; and, indeed, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion becomes a fault, and reſiſtance a virtue. If the people ought to obey well conducting rulers, out of a regard to the publick good, it muſt be as much their duty, ſtill governed by a regard to the publick good, to oppoſe them, when purſuing deſtructive me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods. To ſuppoſe it belongs to the Apoſtle's meaning, that it is a damnable ſin to reſiſt civil powers, <hi>becauſe ordained of God,</hi> though they act entirely out of character, and thwart every kind pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe God had in ordaining them, is in the claſs of moſt palpable grating abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities. A pretence to ground ſuch ideas, as thoſe of indefeaſible right, paſſive obedience, and non-reſiſtance, on the Bible, is criminal—an high abuſive ſcandal to the Chriſtian Religion, and it's Divinely inſpired Promulgators. If God had given up mankind to the will of oppreſſors, not permitting the people,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:013053_0033_0F8FF62FE1A71CC0"/>
on pain of damnation, to attempt their own relief, it would not, indeed, have exceeded the demerit of a ſinful world; but would have been diſagreeable to the general analogy of kind providence.</p>
            <p>IT has been thought, with great good judgment, the Apoſtle Paul de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined handling, particularly, real or ſuppoſed caſes, of rulers departing from their line; and giving particular direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions how to conduct, in ſuch caſes, for a very <hi>ſpecial</hi> reaſon; and that was, the imprudence in running the riſk of expoſing the Church, in it's infant ſtate, to the vengeance of an <hi>heathen</hi> govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>THE people ought to be in ſubjection to <hi>higher powers</hi> ruling honorably, not only through fear of human <hi>wrath,</hi> in caſe of diſobedience; but alſo <hi>for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſake:</hi> and, <hi>for conſcience ſake,</hi> they ſhould alſo maintain the aſſaulted bleſſings of freedom; as being thereto obliged, by our Saviour's enjoinment of that <hi>Charity, which is the bond of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectneſs.</hi>

But the man who holds the reins of government too laxly, the tyrant and the rebel, and the people who are negligent of their rights, as they all, in their ſeveral ways, counteract, diſappoint, or neglect, that which is the great purpoſe of government, the publick <hi>good;</hi> ſo they may all be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be equally guilty in the ſight of God—to merit an equal weight of Divine diſpleaſure. If any perſons diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, whether mere negligence can be thought ſo culpable, let them recollect, of what kind the ſins are, which, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Evangeliſt Matthew, will be expreſsly mentioned, in the illuſtration of the rectitude of the ſentence of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation on the wicked, at the great <hi>Day of God.</hi>

How diſtreſſing the thought of being ſlaves, how charming that of being free! While liberty is fruitful, in trade, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, wealth, learning, religion and nobleſt virtue, all that is great and good and happy; ſlavery clogs every ſublimer movement of the ſoul, prevents every thing excellent, and introduces poverty, ignorance, vice and univerſal miſery a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong a people. But if a few general terms can give no tolerable idea of the bleſſings of freedom, let them be learnt from the ſtory of the world, let their richneſs be eſtimated, by the price that has been paid for them, in lands that have been favovred with them, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly by our Progenitors. Heaven grant, that the preſent generation may come by a juſt ſenſe of the excellency of their civil and ſacred immunities, as may be neceſſary for the ſecurity of the ſame, at a cheaper rate, than by experience of ſuch ſufferings as our Anceſtors under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went!</p>
            <p>THAT the people ſhould be divided, and ſome of them diſengaged from <hi>ſuch</hi> a

cauſe as that of their countries freedom, by ſmall private piques and prejudicing contentions; or influenced by little hopes and fears about worldly promotions and intereſts, ſhould treat it in a nugatory manner, is intirely aſtoniſhing! But our ſurprize abates, when we conſider how capable human nature is of trifling, in the moſt immediate concerns of religion—in reference to eternal life, and everlaſting miſery.</p>
            <p>It concerns men of every order, ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and employment, to be advocates for their country's rights. The miniſter of the Goſpel, in proteſtant lands, where the doctrine which forbids clergymen's marrying, is not adopted, may have a family—poſterity to be concerned for; of whoſe welfare, he cannot be regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs without <hi>denying the faith, and being worſe than an infidel.</hi> As a man, and a chriſtian, he is bound to befriend the liberties of the land; nor is there any thing, in the ſpecial nature of <hi>his</hi> office, incompatible herewith, more than in the ſeveral other occupation, men are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:013053_0037_0F90424F0F832160"/>
engaged in. On the contrary, ſuch are the connections of things, that, in the due and full execution of his office, he muſt have a reference to political matters; and as a friend to liberty. The ſcriptures cannot be rightly expounded, without explaining them in a manner friendly to the cauſe of freedom, as well as of loyalty. He ought to bear againſt a factious moleſtation of well conducted government, and publickly to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend all orderly rational ſubmiſſion; while a conſtant reference is to be had to <hi>the King, and to all that are in authority,</hi> in the prayers of the Church. <hi>Put them in mind,</hi> ſays Paul to Titus, <hi>to be ſubject to principalities and powers, to obey magiſtrates.</hi> But that the chriſtian mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ought to appear an advocate for loyalty, and not for liberty—to frown upon rebellion, and not bear againſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, by <hi>reaſoning of righteouſneſs, and judgment to come,</hi> are myſteries too deep to be fathomed.</p>
            <p>WHEN the <hi>civil</hi> rights of a country receive a ſhock, lit may juſtly render the

miniſters of religion deeply thoughtful for the ſafety of <hi>ſacred</hi> privileges; and diſpoſe them to all proper ſollicitude for the ſecurity of the former, as neceſſary to the preſervation of the latter: for religious liberty is ſo blended with civil, that if one falls it is not to be expected that the other will continue. May not ſuch a connection be, in ſome meaſure, illuſtrated by preſent appearances? While our civil privileges are in their preſent wounded and perilous circumſtances, let men ſoberly conſider—how dormant and unexecuted, the Laws of England againſt popery, are known to remain—a roman-catholick biſhop at Canada—a popiſh prieſt at Nova-Scotia, as we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe publickly ſupported, and Counſellors in a Britiſh American Iſland, of the ſame religious complexion—together with the late zealous application, for an Engliſh-American Epiſcopate; and judge the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious privileges of this country to be in no degree of danger, if they are able.</p>
            <p>IT is greatly to be deſired that, for the future, the miniſters of our benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:013053_0039_0F8FF6345FAF5FB8"/>
impartial Lord, may pay a due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to liberty, as well as ſubjection to principalities; as a kind of atonement for the diſhonour that has been reflected on the Goſpel, and the immenſe damages done to an enſlaved world by clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men's exceſſive complaiſance to men in power.</p>
            <p>THE miniſters of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt will think it their duty to aſſiſt the people, at this time of peculiar dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty and danger, in a due religious acknowledgement of the Governor of the world. Our adverſity is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as the effect of <hi>providential</hi> agen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, or permiſſion—as a righteous paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal chaſtiſement of Heaven, for our many provocations; and a loud call for uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal repentance and reformation, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Goſpel of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>THOUGH greatly diſtant, we are ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfully infected with the irreligion and vices, which are predominant in England; and which reign there to ſuch a degree, that we can ſcarcely forbear applying,

            <p>WHILE the diſpenſations of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence inſtruct the people, in that <hi>fear of the Lord,</hi> which <hi>is the beginning of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;</hi> we truſt they will continue to pay a due regard to the Divine Law for <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring the King;</hi> and none of them ſlide, under their trials, into an habit of deſpiſing <hi>all</hi> government.
