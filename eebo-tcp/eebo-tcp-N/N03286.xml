            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

16<hi>th Chapter,</hi> to direct and exhort them to ſundry diſtinct Duties, among which is <hi>that</hi> in our <hi>Text</hi>; which being obſerv'd, 'twill be the leſs needful to look into the Context for clearing the Senſe of theſe Words, which indeed, are, in a Manner, independent, either on the preceeding or ſubſequent Verſes. The holy Apoſtle being aware of the Dangers that ſtill threatned the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> in their preſent unſettled State, thro' inteſtine Diviſions, and "the Leaven of their old Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims and Manners that had not been throughly purged out by the Chriſtian Principles they had entertained," and thro' the reſtleſs Agency of Satan and his Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to corrupt their Faith and Practice, cou'd not forbear expreſſing his hearty Affection and Concern for them, by leaving with them theſe important Words of Caution and Counſel, <hi>Watch ye, ſtand faſt in the Faith, quit you like Men, be ſtrong.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Phraſes here uſed appear at firſt View to be of a Military Import, being borrowed from the Cuſtom of War, wherein, as Soldiers in the Camp, Garriſon, or City, are ſet to keep Watch and Ward, to deſcry Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers at a Diſtance, to give timely Notice of the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of an Enemy, that they might be in a prepared Poſture of Defence, ſo Chriſtians who are engaged in a ſpiritual War, are highly concern'd to <hi>Watch,</hi> to keep their ſpiritual Senſes awake and in Exerciſe, that they may be always on their Guard againſt the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers that continually ſurround them from their ſpiritual Enemies, the World, the Fleſh and the Devil, and be in a Readineſs, with Wiſdom and Skill in the Uſe of their ſpiritual Armour, to oppoſe their malicious Deſigns, and to ſecure and defend themſelves. And as Soldiers being about to face an Enemy, are exhorted and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to ſtand their Ground, to be true and faithful to their Leaders, and to ſtand firm in the Defence of the Cauſe and Intereſt of their Country, and of their publick Liberties, ſo Chriſtians are, anſwerably here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, required to <hi>Stand faſt in the Faith,</hi> their Faith being not only the main Part of their Armour, with
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:004000_0005_100366D52F828D48"/>
which they muſt Fight, but the main Cauſe <hi>for</hi> which they muſt Fight, the <hi>Prize</hi> they are to contend for: <hi>I have fought a good Fight,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle,—<hi>I have kept the Faith.</hi> 
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">2 Tim. 4.7.</note> And they muſt ſtand <hi>faſt</hi> in this <hi>Faith,</hi> and in order thereunto muſt act <hi>like Men,</hi> with Wiſdom. Strength and Courage. <hi>Quit you like Men, be ſtrong.</hi> Theſe Words, which I have choſen for my Text, (not excluding the Conſideration of the foregoing, of which ſome Improvement may be made) carry in them the Sound of a Charge from the Mouth of a Captain, or Commander of an Army, animating his Soldiers to ſome vigorous Engagement with an Enemy; like <hi>that</hi> of <hi>Joſhua</hi> to the Captains of the Tribes, encouraging them to their Wars in <hi>Canaan, Be ſtrong and of good Courage,</hi> Joſh. 1 18. And again <hi>Chap.</hi> 10 25 God himſelf had encouraged <hi>Joſhua</hi> with the ſame Words, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.9. And the like Speech often occurs to the ſame Purpoſe. Particularly remarkable is <hi>that</hi> of <hi>Joab</hi> at the Head of the Forces of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> animating them to charge with Vigour and Courage in the Battle againſt the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> and <hi>Ammonites,</hi> 2 Sam. 10.12. <hi>Be of good Courage, and let us play the Men for our People,</hi> &amp;c. Thus we find the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> ſtirring up each others Courage to Fight againſt <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when they underſtood that the Ark of God was bro't into the Camp. <hi>Be ſtrong and quit your ſelves like Men,</hi>—in the very Words of the Text. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4 9. The Word here in the Original <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> ſignify's to <hi>play the Man,</hi> or to <hi>act</hi> Manfully and Valiantly <note n="†" place="bottom">Leigh. <hi>Crit. Sacra.</hi>

Thus it is requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of Chriſtians that they ſhould exert a maſculine Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and Courage, in maintaining with Perſeverance, a vigorous Oppoſition againſt the Enemies of their Peace. Wherefore I ſhall here endeavour, <hi>Firſt,</hi> with what Brevity I can, to open and inculcate <hi>the Chriſtian Duty</hi>

And then, being led by the Alluſion, ſhall make a more particular Apolication of this Charge to <hi>Men of the military Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,</hi> agreable to the Deſign of this Day. Accordingly, the Point that lies before us is this, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <div type="doctrine">
               <head>
                  <hi>DOCTRINE.</hi> That Chriſtians in the Management of their ſpiritual Warfare, muſt quit themſelves like Men, and be ſtrong.</head>
               <p>And I hope to make it appear both in the doctrinal and applicatory Part of my Diſcourſe, That <hi>true Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyneſs is ſupported and improved by the Principles and Rules of Chriſtianity.</hi> And here,</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is ſuppoſed that <hi>our preſent State in the World is a warfaring State</hi>; our Life is a Warfare, which it requires the Wiſdom, Skill and Courage of Men, to manage aright; and in this Warfare we are concern'd both as Men and as Chriſtians.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>As Men.</hi> Job 7.1. <hi>Is there not an appointed Time,</hi> or as the Tranſlation is varied in the Margin, <hi>Is there not a Warfare for Man upon Earth</hi>? Man is born to various Labours, Struggles and Conflicts, which are not terminated but in Death. This Warfare is both Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and Internal. <hi>External,</hi> ariſing from a thouſand Dangers, Hardſhips, Adverſities, Croſſes &amp; Oppoſitions that befall us in the World. <hi>Internal,</hi> proceeding from the diſquieting Paſſions, excited by external Objects, Anger, Grief, Sorrow, Fear, Shame, Deſpair, and the like, with which we are expoſed to daily Conflicts: ſo that oftentimes <hi>without</hi> are <hi>Fightings,</hi> and <hi>within</hi> are <hi>Fears</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">2. Cor. vii 5.</note>. But more eſpecially,</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>As Chriſtians,</hi> liſted under Chriſt's Banner, we are engag'd in a Warfare with his, and our Soul's Enemies,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:004000_0007_100357CF1F4372D0"/>
Sin, Satan, the World and the Fleſh: All theſe hold in Confederacy together. <hi>Satan</hi>'s Kingdom, which is ſet up in Oppoſition to the Kingdom of Chriſt, is founded in <hi>Sin</hi>: And the Temptations of the <hi>World,</hi> both its Allurements and Terrors, are his Auxiliaries; and <hi>fleſhly Luſts</hi> are the Traitors in our own Boſoms that hold Correſpondence with this Enemy, and give him mighty Advantages againſt us, and are therefore the moſt dangerous of all. Now with all theſe our ſpiritual Enemies, we have openly declared War, by taking upon us a Chriſtian Profeſſion, and by coming over into the Camp of Chriſt, and renouncing the Intereſts of Sin and Satan. And therefore in Point of Duty and Fidelity to our Lord Redeemer, the <hi>Captain of our Salvation,</hi> as well as from a prudent Regard to our own ſpiritual Peace and Welfare, we ought to be conſtantly arm'd for a Conflict, to take to ourſelves, and with Wiſdom, Courage and Reſolution to improve, the <hi>whole</hi> ſpiritual <hi>Armour</hi> he has furniſh'd us withal. <note n="†" place="bottom">Eph. vi. 11.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore,</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>In the Management of this ſpiritual Warfare, we muſt quit our ſelves like Men, and be ſtrong.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the Enquiry is,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q</hi> What Matter of Duty is laid upon us by this Charg,e to <hi>quit our ſelves like Men</hi>? The latter In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, <hi>Be ſtrong,</hi> comes in as an Explication of the former, and ſhews in one ſpecial Inſtance, how we muſt <hi>quit our ſelves like Men,</hi> viz. by putting on Strength, Reſolution and Courage, becoming <hi>Men</hi>; and therefore may be conſider'd as one main Branch under this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Head, <hi>wherein true Manhood conſiſts</hi>? Or <hi>how muſt we quit our ſelves like Men</hi>?</p>
               <p>I Anſwer, We may be ſaid to <hi>quit our ſelves like Men,</hi> either by <hi>governing our ſelves by Principles of
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:004000_0008_100366EACB25C668"/>
Reaſon,</hi> whereby <hi>Men</hi> are differenced from <hi>Brutes,</hi> or by <hi>ſhewing forth a manly Spirit,</hi> whereby <hi>Men</hi> diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh themſelves from <hi>Children.</hi> Both theſe Ways we muſt <hi>quit</hi> our ſelves <hi>like Men.</hi> Therefore,</p>
               <p n="1">1. In general, <hi>To be truly Religious, is to quit our ſelves like Men,</hi> like reaſonable Creatures: For Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is the higheſt Improvement and Exaltation of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and that which puts the main Difference between Men and Beaſts.

In the moral Government of Man, God dealeth with him as a reaſonable Creature; in all the Revelations of his Will concerning Man's Duty and Happineſs, he ſtill addreſſes him as a rational free Agent. So he ſpeaks in the Prophet Iſai. 1.18, 19, 20. <hi>Come, and let us Reaſon together, ſaith the Lord, — if ye be Willing and Obedient, ye ſhall eat the Good of the Land,</hi> &amp;c. His <hi>Laws</hi> are ſo adapted to our reaſonable Powers, and as it were interwoven with them, that were we freed from the byaſs of carnal Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and Paſſions, which participate of the Temper of the Body, wherein we are ally'd to the Brute Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, and were we at Liberty to purſue the rational

Moreover, all the <hi>Promiſes</hi> and <hi>Threatnings</hi> of God's Word are ſuited to the Principles of Man's Nature, as he is a Creature endowed with a rational Judgment, and Liberty of Choice, capable of being influenc'd in his Actions by Hopes and Fears <note n="†" place="bottom">Deut. xxx. 19.</note>. So that <hi>then</hi> we may be truly ſaid to act <hi>like Men,</hi> when we behave our ſelves towards God as Creatures, ſo made, ought to do, in purſuing the End of our Beings, by uſing aright the noble Powers of our rational Natures, in all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of a ſober, righteous, and godly Life, which is a Thing ſo Juſt, that none can except againſt it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſclaiming, at the ſame Time, the Principles of Reaſon and Humanity.

               <p n="2">2. To quit our ſelves like Men, is <hi>to put away chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh Things,</hi> and to put forth the Virtues &amp; Perfections of a manly Spirit.</p>

Thus Chriſtians muſt guard their Minds againſt all vain, fooliſh, trifling and confuſed Thoughts and Muſings, eſpecially all vicious Imaginations; and learn to think ſeriouſly, cloſely, and pertinently, as Men of ripe Parts, and employ their Meditations upon the <hi>great Things</hi> of God's Law and Goſpel; Things Spiritual and Heavenly; and not ſuffer earthly Things to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſs all their Thoughts and Studies, and fill their Minds from Morning to Night, without leaving Room for the more ſerious and ſpiritual Exerciſes of the Mind.

Herein Chriſtians muſt act like Men in renouncing vain, carnal Myrth and Paſtimes, and filling up their Time, as much as this State of Imperfection will admit, with the Buſineſs of their general and particular Callings. <hi>See that ye walk circumſpectly, not as Fools, but as Wiſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> redeeming the Time,</hi> (Eph. 5.15, 16) <hi>Not ſlothful in Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs; fervent in Spirit, ſerving the Lord,</hi> (Rom. 12.11.)</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Childiſh Paſſions.</hi> Children are often peeviſh and quarrelſom, ſullen and out of Humour at every ſlight Diſguſt. Quarrels and Contentions are childiſh Things, which Chriſtians ſhou'd put far away from them; eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially ſuch as ariſe from ſmall Provocations: Some may, perhaps, think they act a manly Part to reſent every Slight put upon them, to manifeſt their Diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure at every petty Injury or Affront, to bear a Grudge, and ſtudy Revenge; and that it is a weak and cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly Part to put up Wrongs and Abuſes; but really it is a childiſh Weakneſs, not to be able to curb the Paſſions, and ſhews they want that Command of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that Men of Reaſon ought to have: and that they want that <hi>Diſcretion of a Man that deferreth his Anger,</hi> (Prov. 19.11.)

As to <hi>the Matter</hi> of them, Things agreable to the Senſes: For Children are led by Senſe, before they come to the uſe of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and are much better pleas'd with Toys that take their Senſes, than with thoſe Things which would do them a real Benefit.

And therefore are like Children herein, who are led by Senſe, whoſe Deſires are mainly carry'd out to carnal Things, that ſuit the Appetites and Conveniences of the Body, and have no Taſte or Reliſh for Things Spiritual; thus <hi>they that are after the Fleſh, do mind the Things of the Fleſh</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. viii. 5.</note>. But Chriſtians muſt be otherwiſe minded, to diſtinguiſh themſelves from Children, and muſt renounce the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Senſe, and ſubordinate Senſe to Reaſon and Faith. We muſt <hi>walk by Faith, and not by</hi> carnal <hi>Sight</hi> and Senſe <note n="†" place="bottom">2 Cor. v. 7</note>; and muſt learn to <hi>diſcern the Things that differ,</hi> and <hi>approve</hi> thoſe <hi>that are Excellent</hi> 
                  <note n="‖" place="bottom">Phil. i. 10.</note>. And as to <hi>the Manner</hi> of Childrens Deſires, they are, for the moſt part, vehement and impatient of Delay, they know not how to wait for what they eagerly deſire, but muſt have preſent Satisfaction. So are all the fleſhly Luſts of Mens Hearts, importunate to be gratified with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Things. But Chriſtians muſt renounce ſuch chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh Appetites, and deny worldly Luſts, and diſclaim this preſent World for their Portion, and govern them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by Faith of better Things, and be content to wait for an Inheritance in Reverſion; agreable to that Maxim of true Wiſdom, that requires us to <hi>ſubmit to a leſſer Evil, to avoid a greater,</hi> and to deny our ſelves in ſome preſent Conveniences, for the obtaining a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Good.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>We muſt quit our ſelves like Men, by exerting the Virtues and Perfections of a manly Spirit.</hi> Particularly,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>We muſt exerciſe the Reaſon and Underſtanding of Men,</hi> in all Matters of a religious Nature, and in the whole Conduct of our Lives. <hi>Be not Children in Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle <note n="{inverted †}" place="bottom">1 Cor. xiv. 20.</note>

by his Word, and by his Works. This is a noble Employment of our reaſonable Powers. Eſpecially we muſt exerciſe our Reaſon and Underſtanding, in ſearching into the Truths of Revelation for the Government of our Faith and Practice, and that we may be able to give a <hi>Reaſon</hi> of that Faith and <hi>Hope that is in us</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">1 Pet. iii. 15.</note>. And in all Duties of religious Worſhip, we muſt offer <hi>a reaſonable Service</hi> to God <note n="‖" place="bottom">Rom. xii. 1.</note>. Ignorance may well enough paſs for the Mother of popiſh Devotion; but the manly Devotion of a true Chriſtian, requires the intenſe Exerciſe of his intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual Powers. It is not enough to have a warm Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, but we muſt have a clear and ſound Mind. Moreover, both our perſonal and relative Conduct affords a large Scope for the Exerciſe and Improvement of Reaſon. But this rather falls under the next Head.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>We muſt exerciſe the Wiſdom, Judgment and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of Men</hi> Children are raw and unexperienc'd, and their childiſh Weakneſs is often ſeen in their Judgment and Choice, in preferring Trifles before Things of great Worth. But Men whoſe Reaſon is ripon'd by Age, and improv'd by much Experience and Obſervation, are capable of a more ſolid Judgment; and herein Chriſtians muſt ſhew themſelves Men, of a ripe Judgment, which is highly needful in all Matters of Faith, that they may be able to diſtinguiſh and judge aright of Things that differ, and being <hi>skilful in the Word of Righteouſneſs,</hi> may readily diſcern be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Truth and Error, <hi>as Men of full Age, who by Reaſon of Uſe, have their Senſes exerciſed to diſcern both Good and Evil</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Heb. v. 13, 14.</note>. This manly Diſcretion and Wiſdom, is neceſſary to reduce our Knowlege to Practice in all particular Caſes, that the <hi>Knowlege of</hi> God's <hi>Will</hi> may produce its happy Fruits in us, <hi>in all Wiſdom and ſpiritual Underſtanding</hi>

to direct us how to <hi>order our Converſations aright</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God and towards Man; how to ſpend our Time moſt profitably, what Portions of it to apply to religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Exerciſes, and what, to our worldly Occaſions; how to order all our ſecular Affairs, that they may not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench on Religion, nor juſtle out the Duties of God's Worſhip; how to demean our ſelves in every Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as Members of the Family, Church, and common Wealth, that our whole Converſe and Deportment may be inoffenſive, pure and amiable, ſeaſon'd with the Fear of God; how to diſpoſe our Charity to the beſt Advantage; how and when to <hi>pleaſe our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for his Good to Edification,</hi> without indulging him in any ſinful Humour; how to adminiſter Reproofs as to Time, Manner, and Circumſtances, ſo as may be moſt likely to gain an Offender; when to keep Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and when, and how to Speak; how to Converſe as becomes our holy Profeſſion, in good Company, and in bad Company; how to govern the Paſſions and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peties; how to carry it in the Uſe of our lawful Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, in Meats, Drinks, Apparrel, Viſits and Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that we may not tranſgreſs the Rules of Decency, Reaſon, and Religion: In all theſe, and numberleſs other Inſtances, <hi>Wiſdom is profitable to direct,</hi> and this ſpiritual <hi>Wiſdom</hi> will <hi>make</hi> a Chriſtian's <hi>Face to ſhine</hi>

               <p>More eſpecially, this manly Virtue is eminently uſeful in our ſpiritual Warfare, to direct us how to manage it moſt ſucceſsfully, and how moſt skilfully to employ the ſeveral Parts of our ſpiritual Armour; that underſtanding and conſidering our peculiar Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Infirmities, and moſt prevalent Corruptions, and being acquainted with the Advantages, Wiles and Stratagems of our ſpiritual Adverſaries, we may be excited to uſe all needful Precaution, to be always ſober and vigilent, depending on divine Grace and

               <p n="4">4. <hi>We muſt ſhew forth the Strength, Courage, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of Men.</hi> This is a Perfection ſo peculiar to a manly Spirit, which diſtinguiſhes Men from Children and Babes, that it hath the Name of <hi>Manhood</hi> in an appropriate Senſe commonly given to it. This ſpiritual <hi>Fortitude</hi> (for it is the Strength of the Soul, and not of the Body, that is here intended) ſeems to be peculiarly aimed at by the Apoſtle in this Injunction, <hi>Quit you like Men</hi>; for he adds by way of Explication, as I have obſerv'd, <hi>Be ſtrong.</hi> This Fortitude is a martial Virtue, which hath a peculiar &amp; ſovereign Uſe and Influence in our Chriſtian Warfare: It is by this Virtue that we are enabled perſeveringly to adhere to a good Cauſe, and manfully to perſiſt in the Paths of Virtue and Holineſs,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:004000_0016_10036712146AC6B0"/>
whatever Temptations, Difficulties, or Diſcouragements are thrown in the Way to obſtruct us herein, or divert us therefrom.</p>
               <p>True Fortitude holds the <hi>Mean</hi> between thoſe two Extreams of a daring <hi>Raſhneſs</hi> on the one Hand, and a ſneaking <hi>Cowardice</hi> on the other. <hi>Raſhneſs</hi> offends in the <hi>Exceſs,</hi> when Men out of fooliſh Obſtinacy, expoſe themſelves to Dangers, or ruſh into them unadviſedly and without neceſſity, prompted by vain Glory, or any other headſtrong Paſſion, not duly conſidering the Conſequences of their Actions. <hi>Cowardice</hi> is as much an Error in the <hi>Defect,</hi> when Men are prevailed with to decline their Duty, or to deſert a good Cauſe in which they are engag'd, thro' Fear and Diſpondency of Mind, under a proſpect of Difficulties and Dangers. But in Oppoſition to both theſe Extreams, a true Spirit of Fortitude, as it will not expoſe a Man to needleſs Dangers, ſo it will enable him, being ſupported by Faith and Hope in God, to go on with a reſolved Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy in the Way of his Duty, without ſhrinking or ſwerving, whatever Fears he may be impreſs'd with, or whatever Temptations, Difficulties, or Dangers may preſent themſelves to his View.</p>
               <p>The ſhuning of needleſs Dangers, is an Effect of that Wiſdom and Precaution that is proper to a reaſonable Creature, in Purſuance of the grand Principle of ſelf Preſervation, implanted by the wiſe Creator, in all rational and ſenſitive Beings; and therefore not incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with a valiant Spirit, which can contemn the greateſt Dangers, when a virtuous and good Cauſe makes it neceſſary to encounter them.</p>
               <p>Nor, again, is it an Argument of a weak and cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly Spirit, to be impreſs'd with Fear of thoſe Evils, which we muſt unavoidably encounter, if we would perſevere in the Way of our Duty. This is evident beyond Exception from the Example of the <hi>Man Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> who, as in all other manly Perfections, ſo in a Spirit

of Courage &amp; Might, incomparably excell'd all the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Men; a ſignal <hi>Specimen</hi> whereof, he gave the Night before his Sufferings, when having eaten the <hi>Paſſover</hi> with his Diſciples, (in the original Inſtitution whereof, the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> were forbid to go out of their Houſes, for fear of the deſtroying Angel <note n="‡" place="bottom">Exod. xii. 22, 23.</note>, yet,) he couragiouſly went forth to meet his Enemies (having a full Proſpect of all the Circumſtances of his Paſſion) as it were challenging all the Powers of Darkneſs, in ſuch tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant Language (we may ſuppoſe) as that in which he is bro't in ſpeaking, by the evangelical Prophet, in his State of Humiliation, <hi>He is near, that juſtifieth me, who will contend with me?

                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Iſai. l. 8.</note>. Therefore he <hi>ſet his Face like a Flint,</hi> and went on with an undaunted Courage and Magnanimity, being confident of the Goodneſs of the Cauſe, and the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Iſſue of the Combat, thro' the divine Power and Preſence with him. But was he then without all Fears? No; the Evangeliſt tells us, that he was <hi>ſore Amazed,</hi> (Mark 14.33.) And the Author to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> that <hi>he Feared,</hi> (Heb. 5.7.) Theſe Fears argued no Degree of Deſpondency, but were the Effect of the natural Reluctancy of the innocent humane Nature of our bleſſed Saviour, againſt his Sufferings in View; but his Courage exceeded his Fears, and carried him tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphantly through all. Fear is an involuntary Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion on the Mind of a reaſonable Creature, ariſing from the Pre-apprehenſions of approaching Evils, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially if they be great, near, and unavoidable. Some may ſeem to be courageous and fearleſs, through meer Ignorance, or a ſtupid Inconſideration of the Cauſes of Fear. But the greater ſuch Fears are, that ariſe from a juſt Cauſe, the greater is the Courage and Reſolution that withſtands them, that breaks through them, and gets the Maſtery of them.</p>

                  <pb n="16" facs="unknown:004000_0018_1003671A52FD6B70"/>This is one Inſtance of true Fortitude, not to be without Fears, but ſo to manage, and keep them under, that they may not divert us from, nor clog and depreſs our Spirits in our Courſe of Duty; but that we may be able notwithſtanding, to keep up a comfortable Hope in God, free from a ſervile Dejection of Spirit.</p>
               <p>But Chriſtian Fortitude is diſcover'd in withſtanding all Oppoſition to the ſpiritual Life, not only from the <hi>Terrors</hi> of Senſe, but from the <hi>Gratifications</hi> of Senſe, worldly Pleaſures, Profits and Honours; when theſe prove Temptations to decline our Duty, or betray our Virtue and Innocence in any Degree, we muſt reſiſt them with a manly Reſolution, and be inflexible to their Importunities. Here lies much of our daily Chriſtian Conflict, while we are ſurrounded with the tempting Objects of this World. And we have need of a Spirit of Fortitude, that we may <hi>quit</hi> our ſelves <hi>like Men,</hi> and preſerve the Dignity of our Natures, <hi>as Men,</hi> and keep up the Dominion of Reaſon and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, over brutal Appetites and Paſſions: for this Purpoſe we muſt be conſtantly arm'd with the Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and Reſolution of Men. This will be a Guard to every Virtue, and a Bulwark againſt every Vice; yea, it is the very Life and Soul, and animating Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of all the Virtues Without Fortitude, Wiſdom will ſoon degenerate into Weakneſs; Temperance expire in Luxury; Meekneſs, ruffle into Paſſion; take away Fortitude, and Juſtice will ſoon warp, Conſtancy will ſoon waver, Charity will ſoon cool, Hope will ſoon flag<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Zeal will ſoon ſlacken, Patience will ſoon tire: In a Word, Fortitude is ſo eſſential to all the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, that without it, they looſe both their Name and Nature.</p>
               <p>Now the ſeveral Inſtances in which we ſhall have Occaſion to exert our Chriſtian Fortitude in this our militant State, are theſe three, viz. In Services, Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and ſpecial Conflicts.</p>

of</hi> Faith <hi>and</hi> Love, <hi>and for an Helmet, the</hi> Hope <hi>of Salvation.</hi> Let a Word or two ſuffice to each of theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Among the militant Graces, <hi>Faith</hi> leads the <hi>Van,</hi> and inſpires Life and Vigour into the reſt. Faith as it acts on Chriſt, who is the Strength of our Hearts, and on the Word of God, the Means of deriving ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Strength from him, is of ſingular Uſe in the ſpiritual Warfare; and though it often meets with hard Struggles, yet it will at laſt bare away the Victory; and therefore the Apoſtle recommends it as the choiceſt Piece of our ſpiritual Armour. <hi>Above all,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>take the Shield of Faith</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Eph. vi. xvi.</note>. Faith is a Chriſtian's <hi>Shield</hi> that encompaſſeth him around, that on which Side ſoever he be attack'd, his Faith will be of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Service for his Defence.</p>
               <p>There are Temptations on the right Hand, and on the Left; the Blandiſhments of worldly Pleaſures, Profits and Honours on the one Hand, and the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and Affrightments of Senſe, Hardſhips and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements on the other; but Faith as it realizes inviſible Things, as it is the <hi>Subſtance of what we hope for, and the Evidence of what we ſee not</hi> 
                  <note n="‡" place="bottom">Heb. xi. 1.</note>, is able to bring preponderating Reaſons to baffle the Force of all Temptations. Againſt worldly Allurements, it can lay in ballance the Pleaſures, Riches, &amp; Honours of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, and ſo brakes the Force of the Enemy from that Quarter: And the everlaſting Puniſhments of a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture State, which Faith apprehends as real, &amp; moſt awful, are more than an over Ballance to all the Terrors of Senſe. Let us therefore <hi>ſtand faſt in the Faith</hi>; and then we ſhall <hi>be ſtrong,</hi> and <hi>quit</hi> our ſelves <hi>like Men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Hope,</hi> the genuine and immediate Offspring of a Chriſtian Faith, ſerves for an <hi>Helmet</hi> in this Warfare, as it ſecures the Head, and keeps up Life and Spirit, and

fortifies Reſolution in the midſt of Temptations and Diſcouragements This is the great Incentive to the Exerciſe of all our active Powers, as it counter-acts, and ſuppreſſes diſpiriting Fears 'Tis Hope that will enable us to renew the Conflict with freſh Vigour, when worſted by the Importunities of the Fleſh. And when Afflictions and Calamities <hi>overflow</hi> and <hi>reach even to the Neck</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Love</hi> is alſo a Principle of Chriſtian <hi>Fortitude,</hi> which, in Conjunction with the two former, will render a Chriſtian impregnable againſt all Aſſaults. This is indeed a working Grace, and ſuited to Labour: hence we often read of the <hi>Work</hi> and <hi>Labour of Love</hi> 
                  <note n="‖" place="bottom">Gal. v. 6. 1 Theſſ. l. 3. Heb. vi. 10.</note>. But meeting with Oppoſition, Love will flame out into Zeal.

                  <note n="*" place="bottom">2 Cor. v. 13, 14.</note>. Love is generous, and publick ſpirited, and will not ſhrink at Dangers, or Difficulties, to ſerve its beloved. <hi>No Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters can quench</hi> it. <hi>Love is ſtrong as Death</hi>

And it is a Precept of our holy Religion, that <hi>we ought to lay down our Lives for the Brethren</hi>

Principle of Love, which on juſt &amp; proper Occaſions, will prompt to the Obſervance of it. Thus we ſee by theſe few Hints, what a Spirit of Fortiude and Manhood, our chriſtian Principles will inſpire into thoſe that are truly acted and influenc'd by them. I come now to the</p>

               <p>And here, omitting wholly the more general Uſes, and Inferences, from what has been diſcours'd, which I tho't to have propounded; I ſhall proceed according to my intended Method, To make a more particular <hi>Application</hi> of the Charge in the <hi>Text</hi> to thoſe of the <hi>Military</hi> Order and Profeſſion; who are concern'd on a double Account to act a manly Part, both as <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and <hi>Soldiers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, in Order hereunto, there are two Principles I ſhall lay down, as the Ground of this Addreſs.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Firſt</hi> is <hi>the Conſiſtency of the Chriſtian with the military Calling and Employment.</hi> And <hi>Secondly,</hi> That <hi>true martial Courage and Valour is greatly befriended and improv'd by the Principles of Chriſtian Fortitude.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> I ſhall lay it down as a Principle, That <hi>th<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>re is no Inconſiſtency of the Military with the Chriſtian Calling</hi>; though the Weapons proper to the one, are <hi>Carnal,</hi> to the other, <hi>Spiritual,</hi> yet that it is lawful and warrantable for Chriſtians, as Members of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Wealth, to bear Arms, and engage in a juſt War under the Conduct and Authority of the civil Magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate; which is a <hi>Point</hi> capable of eaſy Proof, however confidently it has been denied and oppoſed by the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinian</hi> Tribe, and ſundry other, <hi>Sects,</hi> both in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and paſt Ages, being led into this Error, by ſome miſunderſtood, and miſapplied Paſſages of Scripture. Though my Subject does not lead me to conſider the Lawfulneſs of the Soldiers Calling, or to ſettle it as a Point of Conſcience, yet to ſhew the Propriety of this
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:004000_0025_10036739EB5BEE08"/>
Addreſs to Men of that Order, &amp; that it may appear that the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> and the <hi>Soldier</hi> are not Terms incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible. Let me obſerve in a few Words,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That it is beyond Diſpute, that the People &amp; Servants of God under the Old Teſtament (among whom, were divers eminently pious and holy Perſons) took up Arms and made War againſt their Enemies, by a manifeſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Direction and Approbation; which ſhews that the Thing is not in <hi>it ſelf</hi> Unlawful; nor is there the leaſt Hint in the ſacred Writings, that leads us to conclude it to be ſo; on the contrary, if we would form a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by the Light of Nature, it appears reaſonable and juſt, being directed to; and warranted, eſpecially in Caſe of an injuſt Invaſion, by the natural Law of ſelf Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation. Hence,</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let me obſerve, That there is no Alteration made in thoſe Things that are founded on the <hi>Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> or <hi>Nations,</hi> by the Religion of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> of our Saviour. It being very remote from the Deſign of Chriſt, or of the firſt Preachers of the Goſpel, to erect a new civil Polity in the World, or to aboliſh any <hi>Ordinance of Man</hi> for the Preſervation of the Peace and Order of civil Society. As therefore, particular Perſons are allow'd, and required by the immutable, and unrepealable Law of Nature, to repel force by force in neceſſary ſelf Defence; ſo by the ſame Right, Kingdoms and politick Bodies, may lawfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themſelves againſt any injurious, encroaching Enemy, by exerting the Force proper to them, as ſuch: And this warrants, at leaſt a defenſive War. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing but the Lawfulneſs of a <hi>defenſive War</hi> (on Grounds of Nature) againſt an unjuſt Aggreſſor, even this is ſufficient to juſtify the military Employment. The Kingdom which our bleſſed Lord came to ſet up in the World, being of a ſpiritual and heavenly Nature, does not at all interfere with the Rights of Nations, or earthly Kingdoms, but leaves them as fully poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd of them, as it found them. Beſides,</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="24" facs="unknown:004000_0026_100372CAE5B336F0"/>3 There are clear and plain Intimations, in the Writings of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> of the Lawfulneſs of the <hi>military</hi> Calling When our Saviour was queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd concerning his Kingdom, by <hi>Pilate,</hi> he anſwered, (John 18 36) <hi>My Kingdom is not of this World: If my Kingdom were of this World, then would my Servants Fight, that I ſhould not be delivered to the Jews.</hi> Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating, as one obſerves <note n="†" place="bottom">Biſhop <hi>Hopkins</hi> on the ſixth Commandment.</note> 
                  <q>That tho' Wars and Fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were not proper Means to advance the ſpiritual Nature of his Kingdom, yet if the Methods of his Humiliation had permitted him to aſſume the Royal Scepter, his Servants and Followers, might lawfully have Fought to defend his Claim and Title.</q> There is no Prohibition of the Soldiers Employment in the Scriptures of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> (even when the moſt proper Occaſion offer'd) which would not have been omitted, if it were unlawful. The Reply of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> to the Soldiers Demand, <hi>What ſhall we do</hi>? is well known <note n="‖" place="bottom">Luk. iii. 14</note>. This Preacher of Repentance does not inſiſt upon their laying down their Arms, and quitting the Service they were employ'd in, as unlawful, which ſurely, he that ſo freely reproved the Vices of that Age, and call'd upon all Sorts to <hi>bring forth Fruits Meet for Repentance,</hi> would not have fail'd to have done, had there been any thing in that Employment immoral, or inconſiſtent with Repentance, and a pious Life, but inſtead of this, he cautions them only againſt thoſe Vices, which Men of that Profeſſion are moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly guilty of, <hi>Do Violence to no Man</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">To obviate the Miſconſtruction that may be put on theſe Word, <hi>Do Violence to no Man,</hi> as if they intended a Prohibition <hi>Fighting with an Enemy</hi>: It may not be amiſs to note, that it is altogether improper and unuſual, to term Acts of Hoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity or Fighting, in a juſt War, a <hi>doing Violence.</hi> But this being coupled with the other Crime of <hi>falſe Accuſing,</hi> plainly manifeſts, that it is intended as a Caution againſt wronging or invading the Rights of their fellow Subjects, (whom they were ſet to defend) by robbing them of their Money, Goods, and the like; which Soldiers are prone to do, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der colour of military Licence. They are therefore for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to be <q>Injurious to the People among whom they were quartered</q> So Mr <hi>Henry</hi> And how unreaſonable and abſurd had it been in the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> implicitly to allow of their Employment, by permitting them to take <hi>the Wages</hi> proper to it, and in the ſame Breath to forbid them to Fight, (if that be the Meaning of <hi>doing no Violence</hi>) tho' commanded by their Superiour.</note>, <hi>neither ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe

               <p>The Force of this reaſoning may not be evaded by pretending that <hi>John</hi> was a legal Preacher, or that he entred on his Miniſtry before the Goſpel Diſpenſation began; for we are expreſly told, that <hi>the Law</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued <hi>until John,</hi> and <hi>from the Days of John the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt, the Kingdom of God was preached</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Mat. xi. 12, 13, Luk. 16.16.</note>. And the Evangeliſt <hi>Mark</hi> dates the <hi>Beginning of the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> from the preaching of <hi>John</hi> 
                  <note n="‡" place="bottom">Mark i. 1,—4.</note>. <hi>John</hi>'s Miniſtry therefore, was a ſort of Boundary to the legal Diſpenſation, and the Beginning of the Evangelical; and his Doctrine was purely Evangelical, being the ſame for Subſtance, that Chriſt and his Apoſtles after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards preached, even the Doctrine of <hi>Repentance for the Remiſſion of Sins.</hi> Moreover,</p>
               <p>We have the Examples of ſeveral eminent Soldiers, who embraced the Chriſtian Faith, without the leaſt Intimation of their quitting the military Function, or their being directed and order'd to do ſo, either by Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or his Apoſtles.

               <p>Again, For what End can we ſuppoſe, the great Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> (being inform'd of the Conſpiracy of the <hi>Jews</hi> to kill him) ſhould ſo induſtriouſly ſeek to make known his Cauſe to <hi>the chief Captain</hi>

And does not this manifeſtly imply an Approbation of that Order of Men? Would the holy Apoſtle betake himſelf to unlawful Shifts in a Time of Danger?

War is indeed a penal Evil, juſtly to be deprecated by all, a ſevere Scourge wherewith God oftentimes chaſtizes ſinful Nations and Kingdoms; yet conſidering the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of humane Nature, and the Conſtitution of humane Affairs, and the exorbitant Luſts and Paſſions of Men, whence proceed <hi>Wars</hi> and <hi>Fightings,</hi> and the great Power and Influence of <hi>Satan</hi> (the mortal (or rather immortal) Enemy of the Peace and Welfare of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind) in the Kingdoms of this World, it can't other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be expected, but that the Nations will frequently be embroil'd in Wars: And in ſuch a State of Things,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:004000_0030_100372DF96292FF0"/>
who is not ſenſible, that military Men, valiant and expert in War, good Soldiers and well diſciplin'd Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, are not only lawful, but highly neceſſary and Uſeful, and at all times to be encouraged, and juſtly to be eſteemed the Beauty and Ornament, and under God, the Strength and Defence of a People? So that a Chriſtian may not only with a good Conſcience un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake the military Function, when call'd thereunto, but may alſo therein perform eminent Service for God and his Country, by exerting that publick Spirit, that Zeal and Courage, which his Chriſtian Principles inſpire him withal. The Objections made againſt this, from the Commands of Chriſt, requiring an univerſal Love, and peaceable Spirit in his Diſciples and Followers, and forbidding Revenge, duely conſider'd and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd, appear to be of no Weight: For our Saviour forbidding to <hi>reſiſt Evil, (Matt.</hi> 5.39.) intends only to lay a Reſtraint on private Revenge: For the Apoſtle inculcating the ſame Prohibition, (Rom 12 19) <hi>Dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beloved, avenge not your ſelves</hi> &amp;c.) does not include all kind of Revenge, but only <hi>that</hi> between private Men; for he preſently ſubjoin, in the Beginning of the next Chapter, (<hi>Verſe</hi> 4.)

Now War is a kind of publick Revenge, and the being Inſtrumental therein, has no neceſſary Connection with a vindictive Spirit, which the Goſpel forbids; and as to a Spirit of Peace and Charity, which it conſtantly recommends, 'tis certain there is nothing more eſſential to the Temper and <hi>Genius</hi> of Chriſtianity, yet this Temper is not inconſiſtent with the Office of bearing Arms againſt the injurious Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries of ones Country <note n="*" place="bottom">As to that Prediction of the Prophets, (<hi>Iſai</hi> 2 4. and <hi>Mic.</hi> 4 3.) concerning the Nations <hi>beating the Swords into Plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhares,</hi> &amp;c. and their <hi>not learning War any more,</hi> which has been objected againſt the Lawfulneſs of Chriſtians making War; it may be underſtood as a Deſcription of the Nature of the Kingdom of Chriſt, which (whereſoever, and ſo far as it prevails) will remove the Grounds and Occaſions of Wars and Fightings, by extinguiſhing thoſe corrupt Luſts of Men that give riſe to them, and by implanting in their Hearts, oppoſite Principles of Peace and Love. And all that can be gather'd hence, is, that to provoke and ſtir up Wars and Quarrels, is contrary to the Principles and Laws of the Chriſtian Religion, which (were they univerſally entertain'd) would introduce an univerſal Peace and Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony; but by no Means that it is unlawful for a Chriſtian People to make Uſe of Arms in their juſt and neceſſary Defence againſt the violent Encroachments of an Enemy. <hi>Indignum eſt, eſſe inter Chriſtianos, qui vim inferant, ſed non indignum eſt Magiſtratu Chriſtiano, vim illatam propulſare.</hi> Rivet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

For from the Beginning of Chriſt's Church to this Day, it is apparent that the Event has not, in this Senſe, anſwer'd the Prediction, nor have the Nations yet ceas'd to learn and practice War.

               <p>Thus having obſerv'd the Conſiſtency of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> with the <hi>military</hi> Calling (which tho' ſeemingly a Digreſſion, yet being inſervient to my main Deſign, I could not wholly omit it) I ſhall proceed now to obſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That <hi>true martial Courage and Valour is greatly befriended, and improv'd by the Principles of that Chriſtian Fortitude, that is ſo neceſſary and Uſeful in our ſpiritual Warfare.</hi> Strength and Courage, as well as Skill in the military Art, all muſt allow, to be requiſite to an accompliſh'd Soldier. There is indeed a Difference between <hi>military Valour,</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian Fortitude.</hi> The one is more active, the other more paſſive: The one is more ſeen in acting with Vigour and Reſolution, in great and hazardous Enterprizes; the other is more diſcover'd in ſuffering Hardſhips, and Grievances, with Conſtancy of Mind, Faith, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation to God; in ſuſtaining with an unſhaken Firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Spirit, the Aſſaults and Oppoſitions it meets with in a Courſe of Virtue and Holineſs. The former de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends more on bodily Strength, and the Warmth and Sprightlineſs of the natural Conſtitution, ſuited to that external Warfare to which it is apply'd; the latter depends more on the Improvement of the Mind, by the Grace of God's holy Spirit, and thoſe divine Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and Principles, wrought into the Temper of the Soul, that eſtabliſh and ſtrengthen it againſt all Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and Terrors. They both conſpire in a reſolute Contempt of Danger in Adherence to, &amp; Purſuit of a good Cauſe.</p>
               <p>But that which I aſſert is, There is nothing more conduſive to a well temper'd Courage in a Chriſtian
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:004000_0033_100372ED954E25B8"/>
Soldier, than the Principles of his Religion, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire him with Zeal and Fortitude in his ſpritual War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare. True Religion, tho' it lays a Reſtraint on the vain glorious Humour, and baniſhes Pride, Ambition, and falſe Notions of Honour and Greatneſs, that help to generate a ſort of Courage and Boldneſs in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane Men, yet it does not tend to make men Cowards, but truly valiant, whenever there is a juſt Occaſion to exert their Valour. What ſhall we ſay of <hi>Abraham</hi> the Father of the faithful, who with ſo much Courage and Generoſity undertook, with his trained Servants and Allies, to purſue the victorious Army, defeated them and reſcued his Brother <hi>Lot</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Gen. xiv. 14, 16.</note>? The Church of God (as well as the World) has had its Worthies nouriſhed up in the Principles of the true Religion, who have ſignaliz'd themſelves in martial Exploits, with that Juſtice and Honour, Courage and Bravery, Conduct and Succeſs, which perhaps, is ſcarce to be equal'd by the moſt celebrated Heroes in the gentile World; ſuch were <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Joſhua,</hi> the Leaders of the Armies of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and thoſe renouned Champions enrolled in the Catalogue of Believers, by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> Chap. 11.32, 33, &amp;c. <hi>Gideon, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rak, Sampſon, Jeptha</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> who thro' <hi>Faith ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued Kingdoms, wrought Righteouſneſs</hi> (or vindicated the juſt Cauſe of God's People againſt their unreaſonable and tyrannical Oppreſſors) —<hi>out of Weakneſs were made Strong, waxed valiant in Fight, turned to flight the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the Aliens.</hi> And of <hi>Zion</hi> it may be ſaid, this and that brave Man was born and bred there, who has acquired great Fame and Renown by their Valour in the Wars of the Lord. And as that Example of thoſe forementioned Worthies, who were great and eminent Soldiers, reflects an Honour on the military Office; ſo it ſhews that Faith and Piety is not only conſiſtent with, but greatly befriends martial Courage and Succeſs. For it is obſervable, that it was their Faith in God, that
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:004000_0034_1003581079BBB190"/>
Faith which hath ſuch a ſignal Uſe and Influence in the ſpiritual War, to which our Victories over Sin, the World and the Devil, are peculiarly aſcrib'd; it was that Faith, I ſay, which inſpired them with that he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roic Valour, that enabled them to perform ſuch notable Exploits. <hi>Through Faith they ſubdued Kingdoms, wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed valiant in Fight,</hi> &amp;c. True Faith in God and his Word, with the Train of Graces that march under the Conduct of it, Self-denial, Love, Zeal, Hope, Patience, Humility, will not only fit a Man for doing great and acceptable Service to God, but alſo embolden him to face Dangers, and endure Hardſhips and Adverſities, with an unconquerable Reſolution: And having by Faith engag'd the Power and Preſence of God by his Spirit within him, and his Providence about him, he can reſt confident and ſecure, as to the Iſſue of the Conflict.</p>
               <p>Yea, divine Grace many times adds a marvellous Strength and Courage to thoſe that are of a Temper naturally weak and timerous; who (in this Senſe,) <hi>out of Weakneſs have been</hi> made ſtrong.

When in Adherence to the Faith and Hope of the Goſpel, and in the Cauſe of Virtue and Piety, they could bid Defiance to the greateſt Terrors of Senſe, and triumph over all Oppoſition, with an unſhaken Conſtancy. In a Word, The true Chriſtian is the true Hero; and they that act the Chriſtian will not fail to act the Man; all manly Virtues being improved to their higheſt Perfection by the Spirit of Chriſtianity.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>If, together with military Skill, you wou'd alſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell in a truly martial Spirit, becoming the Profeſſion of a Soldier, Learn to quit your ſelves like Men in the Chriſtian Senſe, and be ſtrong.</hi> Put on, and put forth a Chriſtian Fortitude and Magnanimity in the Courſe of your ſpiritual Warfare; and thus you will be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed in the beſt Manner for any hazardous Service, if called to it in a Time of War.</p>
               <p>Let me obſerve, that among the various Changes and Viciſſitudes of humane Affairs, the different and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite Events that do interchangeably ſucceed each other in the Courſe of humane Life, for which <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, <hi>there is a Time and Seaſon</hi> alloted by the Degree of Heaven <note n="†" place="bottom">Eccl. iii. 1, 8.</note>, thoſe which do more eminently affect Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Kingdoms, are <hi>a Time of War and a Time of Peace.</hi> Theſe take their Turns in their Seaſons ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and determined by God, which is an Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition to us, that as War muſt be managed with Views of Peace, ſo a Time of Peace muſt be improved to prepare for War.</p>
               <p>It is now, bleſſed be God, a Time of Peace with us, as it has been for ſome Years paſt; and notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the War, which we have been of late threatned withal, yet it has pleaſed God to direct and ſucceed the publick Counſels of our Nation ſo far, as not only to preſerve the Peace of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Dominions, but alſo through the prudent Mediation of our <hi>gracious Sovereign,</hi> to give an hopeful Proſpect of an happy Period to the War that has of late Years diſturb'd and diſtreſs'd <hi>Europe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>

For which Reaſon, as I heartily concur with thoſe of my Rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end Fathers and Brethren who have ſtood here before me, on theſe <hi>anniverſary Occaſions,</hi> in recommending military Skill and Diſcipline, ſo, at the ſame time, I think it highly proper and needful, particularly to encourage the keeping up the martial Spirit and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, which is more in Danger of ſinking and declin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a Time of Peace, than bare Skill in the Uſe of warlike Weapons.</p>
               <p>Theſe are two different Things, tho' they mutually ſupport and befriend each other; and it is a deſirable Thing that thoſe who excell in military Skill, might alſo excell in true Valour; and on the contrary, that thoſe who excel in a Spirit of Valour, might be endow'd with equal Skill to guide and manage it; yet 'tis known, theſe do not always go together. We read Pſal. 78.9. <hi>The Children of Ephraim being arm'd, &amp; carrying Bows, turned back in the Day of Battle.</hi> Tho' furniſhed with all warlike Accoutrements, <hi>being arm'd, and carrying Bows,</hi> arm'd with the Weapons of War then in Uſe, and well inſtructed, no doubt, in the Uſe of them, yet when it came to a Battle in good earneſt, they made an inglorious Retreat, for want of Spirit and Courage; could not face the Enemy, but <hi>turned back in the Day of Battle.</hi> Wherefore, to acquire and cheriſh this mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Spirit, to be brave and bold in the Face of Danger, is no leſs the Concern of a good Soldier, than to get furniſhed with Skill in the Art of War. And ſince all Occaſion of exerting this Spirit of Valour in any mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Service, is now happily prevented by the Peace

               <p>It is not indeed an hazardous Thing with us, either to undertake a Chriſtian Profeſſion, as it was in the primitive Times of Chriſtianity, when the ruling Powers of the World were ſet in Oppſition to it, or to profeſs it in its ſtricteſt Purity, free from the corrupt Additions of Man's deviſing, as it is at this Day in popiſh Countries. On the contrary, it is both ſafe and honourable. The bare Name and Profeſſion of a Chriſtian is a cheap and eaſy Thing, that requires no great Degree of Courage and Reſolution; but to live up to the Majeſty and Power of our holy Profeſſion, to bear up againſt the Stream of Fleſh and Blood, and the corrupt Maxims, Cuſtoms, and Examples of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate World, in a Courſe of ſelf denying Obedience and Patience, will ſtill try the Sinews of our Souls, and draw out, and exerciſe all our ſpiritual Strength.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, thro' the diſtinguiſhing Favour of Heaven, we in this Land are Strangers to the fiery Tryal, and are not called to give a Proof of our Chriſtian Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and Valour, by <hi>reſiſting unto Blood</hi>

               <p>Be encouraged then, to play the Man in the conſtant Courſe and Exerciſe of your ſpiritual Warfare; that being trained up herein, you may be the better arm'd and prepared for more difficult Encounters and Trials which you may be call'd forth unto. And for your Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection herein, I can offer nothing more pertinent, than the important Advices which precede the Text, in the ſame Verſe, <hi>Watch ye, ſtand faſt in the Faith</hi>; which are both the Means and Evidences of ſpiritual Fortitude. I ſhall briefly conſider and inculcate them as the Means of promoting and increaſing a manly Spirit and Courage, proper to the Chriſtian and the Soldier. Under the former I ſhall offer a few Things in the Nature of Cautions; under the latter, ſome more poſitive Advices.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt</hi> then, <hi>Watch ye</hi>; Keep up a wakeful Senſe of your Danger, and be always on your Guard. This Charge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to all Chriſt's Soldiers. His Kingdom in this World is inviron'd with Enemies; and a Man that hath an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my muſt beware how he ſleeps Security is very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimental, on temporal and ſpiritual Accounts Nothing more manifeſtly tends to throw the Minds of Men into a Conſternation and Confuſion, then unlook'd for Dangers; when Men are ſurpriz'd in their Security, and in no Poſture of Defence againſt ſudden Attacks. Let us not be lull'd aſleep by our preſent Peace, as for
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:004000_0041_100373139CD54190"/>
getting that we are the Objects of the Envy and Spite of our evil Neighbours; or neglecting ſuch Means of our Defence, both by Sea and Land, as may render it dangerous to thoſe that are otherwiſe ſufficiently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to invade and moleſt us when ever an Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity ſhall occur Remember <hi>Laiſh,</hi> a People that <hi>dwelt Careleſs and Secure,</hi> who therefore became an eaſy Prey to the firſt Invaders <note n="†" place="bottom">Judges xviii. 7.27.</note>.</p>
               <p>Much greater is the Danger our Security will expoſe us to on ſpiritual Accounts. Our great Adverſary the Devil is both vigilent and expert, and has manifold Advantages againſt us by Reaſon of our Weakneſs, Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, Unskilfulneſs, and frequent Inadvertencies, thro' the multiplicity of our Diverſions, Buſineſs, Company, Calling, Employment, and Recreations; and he is too vigilant an Adverſary to looſe any of the Advantages he has againſt us: what Reaſon then have we to be conſtantly on our Guard? <hi>Be ſober, be vigilant, becauſe your Adverſary the Devil, as a roaring Lion, walketh about, ſeeking whom he may devour</hi>

And our bleſſed Saviour ſaw it requiſite to caution his own Diſciples againſt ſome of the worſt of theſe Vices; ſaying to them, <hi>Take heed to your ſelves, leaſt at any time your Hearts be over charged with Surfeiting and Drunkenneſs and the Cares of this Life</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Luke xxi 34.</note>. But to proceed to the more poſitive Advices under the ſecond Head.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Stand faſt in the Faith</hi>; and that by a firm Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence to the <hi>Doctrine of Faith,</hi> a conſtant Perſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in the <hi>Grace of Faith,</hi> and an unſhaken Fidelity and Stedfaſtneſs in the <hi>Covenant of Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Adhere firmly to the Doctrine of Faith,</hi> the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Revelation of our Saviour; the great Uſefulneſs whereof in its ſeveral Articles, to eſtabliſh and embol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den the Hearts of Men to encounter Difficulties &amp; Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, I muſt not inſiſt upon: but I cannot forbear obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the two grand Articles of reveal'd Religion, <hi>viz.</hi> The Doctrine of a Sinner's Reconciliation to an offended God by an atoning Mediator, and that of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life hereafter in the Kingdom of Heaven, ſeriouſly improved by Faith, have a peculiar Force above all the great Dictates of moral Philoſophy, to raiſe a Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age that will hold out againſt the moſt threatning Dangers.

Preparations of Wrath he has made againſt the <hi>Time of Trouble, againſt the Day of Battle and War</hi>; and his Courage muſt needs fail him, and his Heart ſink within him; for <hi>can thine Heart endure, or can thine Hands be ſtrong in the Day that he ſhall deal with thee</hi>? Whereas upon the Terms of a Reconciliation to God, it is promiſed, <hi>Thou ſhall not be afraid of Deſtruction when it cometh, yea, thou ſhalt laugh at Deſtruction and at Famine,</hi> Job 5 21, 22 For thoſe who are quieted with Heaven's Smiles may bid Defiance to all the terrible Things of this World. And the Soldier who <hi>having his Feet ſhod with the Preparation of the Goſpel of Peace</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Eph. vi. 15.</note>, and ſupported and animated with the Hopes of a better Life after this, which that Goſpel inſpires, can with an interpid Courage look the King of Terrors in the Face, may reaſonably be ſuppoſed to be beſt prepared of all Men <hi>(Caeteris Paribus</hi>) to face an Enemy in the Field of Battle, with a Preſence of Mind not to be intimidat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by all the <hi>confuſed Noiſe</hi> where with <hi>every Battle of the Warrior is carried on, and with Garments rolled in Blood</hi> 
                  <note n="‖" place="bottom">Iſai. ix. 5.</note>.</p>
               <p>Therefore adhere to the Principles of revealed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; <hi>Stand faſt in the Faith.</hi> Stand faſt in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of Chriſt, which is the only ſolid Ground of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and Fortitude in encountering the Evils that ſurround us in this our warfaring State, and of all our Comforts and Hopes living and dying.</p>
               <p>And indeed this Exhortation, let me note by the Way, ſeems peculiarly ſeaſonable at this Day, when revealed Religion is ſo openly attack'd by Deiſts and Libertines, and prophane Spirits, that ſet their Wits and Mouths againſt the Heavens. The more ſecret and ſubtle Inſinuations of Infidelity that appear in ſome, and the more open and bold Challenges of bare fac'd Infidels<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in others of the Books and Writings of the preſent Age, call upon all Ranks and Orders to be

               <p n="2">2. <hi>Perſevere conſtantly in the Grace of Faith,</hi> without which the Doctrine of Faith will be but of little Uſe. Our Faith is mainly ſtruck at by our ſpiritual Enemies, becauſe all our other Graces, wherein our Strength and Armour of Defence lies, live or die with it: Let Faith therefore be kept up in a lively Exerciſe. It is the Property of this Grace to quiet and confirm the Heart againſt all Fears; and to enable us to ſtand our Ground againſt the Wiles of Satan, and his fiery Darts; and to keep our ſelves untainted from the Impurities, Luſts, and Temptations of this preſent World, and alſo to fortify our Minds againſt viſible Dangers and Terrors. It was the Faith of thoſe great <hi>Heroes</hi> mentioned <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. that enabled them (as was obſerv'd) to triumph over the armed Powers of their viſible Enemies, as well as to perſevere victoriouſly in their ſpiritual Warfare. Faith looks at that God who is inviſible, and ſets him as preſent before us, and reſting itſelf on his almighty Power, Wiſdom, Goodneſs, and Truth, enables the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever to triumph before the Battle. If with <hi>David,</hi> we fix the Eye of our Faith on God, and can ſay of him by an appropriating Act of Faith, <hi>The Lord is my Light and my Salvation whom ſhall I fear? the Lord is the Strength of my Life, of whom ſhall I be afraid,</hi> Pſal 27 1.

Then, tho' with him, we forecaſt in our Minds the moſt amazing Dangers, this our Faith will furniſh us with a Courage to ſurmount them, as it follows, Ver 3 <hi>Tho' an Hoſt ſhould encamp againſt me, my Heart ſhall not fear, though War ſhou'd riſe againſt me, in this will I be confident.</hi> Arm your ſelves therefore with this Faith, which reconciles and reunites this Soul to God thro' Chriſt, and engages his gracious Preſence and Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which will afford an holy Security and Confidence in Caſes of the greateſt Danger and Extremity. <hi>God is our Refuge and Strength—therefore will not we fear though the Earth be removed</hi>

               <p n="3">3. <hi>Abide faithful and ſtedfaſt in the Covenant of Faith.</hi> The Goſpel is propounded to us in the Form of a Covenant, which is the Rule and Warrant of our Faith; wherefore to <hi>ſtand faſt in the Faith</hi> is to continue true and faithful to God in the Duties of the Covenant, as well as to rely on his Truth and Faithfulneſs in the Promiſe of it.

                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Heb. x. 22.</note>. And there is nothing that does more effectually ruin Mens Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, and put a damp on their Spirits, than Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of Guilt and Perfidiouſneſs.

               <p>Theſe Directions, 'tis confeſs'd, are, according to the primary Deſign of the Apoſtle, of more general Uſe to all Chriſtians in all their ſpiritual Conflicts; yet we ſee alſo, by the few Hints I have given, how pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly Serviceable and Uſeful they are to raiſe and maintain a truly maſculine Courage and Boldneſs, proper to an accompliſhed Soldier, which confirms the Obſervation, That <hi>true military Valour is beſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by the Principles of Chriſtian Fortitude.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All that now remains is to point out and preſs the general Intendment of my <hi>Text,</hi> with Reſpect to Chriſtians of all Ranks and Degrees. <hi>Let us be ſtrong, and quit our ſelves like Men, in the Management of our ſpiritual Warfare.</hi> Our Baptiſm is our <hi>military Oath</hi> to be true and faithful to our great <hi>Leader and Commander, the Captain of our Salvation,</hi> in fighting his Battles againſt the Powers of the Kingdom of Darkneſs, which is a Kingdom founded in <hi>Sin</hi> and Rebellion againſt God.

The Conteſt here is for the Dominion of a reaſonable Creature, that the manly Part of our Natures may not be enſlav'd to the brutal; that Reaſon and Conſcience may not be overborn by impertuous ſenſual Appetites, Luſts and Paſſions. In ſtriving for
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:004000_0048_10037332660C3C00"/>
the Maſtery of theſe, let us play the Man, and <hi>fight, not as beating the Air</hi>; but let us <hi>keep under our Bodies, and bring them into Subjection</hi> 
                  <note n="‖" place="bottom">1 Cor. ix 26, 27.</note>, that they may not hinder our Improvements in the Virtues and Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the ſpiritual Life. And let us in our ſeveral Places, with like Vigour and Reſolution, ſet our ſelves to oppoſe the prevailing Corruptions of the preſent Age; the Iniquities that abound and ſpread among us in a fearful Degree; Irreligion and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſs, Swearing, Curſing, Lying, Sabbath Propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, Pride, Licentiouſneſs, Injuſtice, Violence and Contention, Tale-bearing and Slandering, Idleneſs, Luxury, Fornication and Uncleanneſs, Drunkenneſs and Intemperance. Theſe Enemies breaking in like a Torrent on our Land, threaten to ſpoil us of all that is dear and valuable to us, as Men and Chriſtians, as they provoke the great God to become our Enemy, and to Fight againſt us with his Judgments. A War with theſe is neceſſary to our Peace with God, on whoſe Favour our <hi>all</hi> depends; and to the prolonging of our outward Peace and Tranquility.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, ſince we are now, thro' the merciful Indulgence of Heaven, at Liberty from other Wars, let us engage in the vigorous Proſecution of <hi>this War</hi>; a War which is unexceptionably juſt and honourable, and highly agreable to all Chriſtian Charity; a War that requires no Expence of Blood or Treaſure, and in which we may be confident that we ſhall have no Enemies, but ſuch as will <hi>be found to Fight even againſt God.</hi> Let us take Courage then and act like Men, like Champions: Every one hath his Part to act in this War, Magiſtrates, Miniſters and People. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates,</hi> by enacting and executing good Laws againſt Prophaneneſs and Immorality, by brandiſhing the Sword of Juſtice for the Terror of evil doers. <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,</hi> by plying the ſpiritual Artillery of the Goſpel

               <p>But nothing of all this will be likely to be effected to any conſiderable Purpoſe, unleſs we put on Strength and Courage and a manly Reſolution, &amp; exert our ſelves with a lively Zeal and Vigour.

Here <hi>the Battle is</hi> always <hi>to the ſtrong</hi>; tho' it be not ſo in other Wars <note n="†" place="bottom">Eccl. ix. 11.</note> Stand your Ground in a Dependance on the Power and Aids of your glorious Captain, and with a Reſolution not to yield, and you ſhall infallibly get the Day, and tho' your Enemies may inveagle or threaten, they cannot hurt you: None every died in this War, none ſhall die eternally in fighting Chriſt's Battles; adhere faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to his Cauſe and Intereſt, and he has aſſured you of the Victory, he will bring you off Conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors at laſt, and make you more than Conquerors. <note n="‡" place="bottom">Rom. xvi. 20. 1 Cor. xv. 5, 7.</note> Conſider alſo, by ſuch a reſolved manful Reſiſtance, you will recover the true Honour and Dignity of the humane Nature, and the excellent Prerogatives of it, that have been baſely betrayed by Sin By every ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual Reſiſtance, by every act of Self-denial, and laborious Striving againſt the Oppoſition you meet with from Satan, or your own Corruptions, in a Courſe of Duty, you will riſe up more and more towards a State of Perfection, Liberty, Peace and Joy.</p>
               <p>Again conſider, Who are the Spectators of this War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare. Men that are put upon the Trial of their Strength or Skill, before proper Judges, to whoſe good Opinion they are ambitious to commend themſelves,

will be ſure to do their beſt, and exert their utmoſt Endeavours. We are now upon our Trial, and God and Chriſt and holy Angels are Spectators of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict; and think what a pleaſing Thing it is to the great God, to ſee his poor fallen Creatures ſtruggling with the Oppoſition that attends them in a Courſe of Virtue, in aſpiring after the Perfection of their reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Natures, and ſo purſuing the End of their Beings! What a Pleaſure to the Lord Jeſus, to ſee the Power of his Grace magnified in the Weakneſs of a Believer, when he is enabled thereby to ſtand firm againſt the Attacks of his ghoſtly Adverſaries, to ſee his <hi>Strength</hi> put forth to his Praiſe in and by <hi>Babes and Sucklings,</hi> for the <hi>ſtilling of the Enemy and the Avenger</hi>! <note n="‖" place="bottom">Pſal viii. 2.</note> Holy Angels alſo, who <hi>rejoice at a Sinner</hi>'s <hi>Repentance</hi>

               <p>Conſider further, That God, Chriſt, and Angels are not only Spectators of your Conflicts, but alſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to be your powerful Aſſiſtants therein. And <hi>if God be for</hi> you, <hi>who can be againſt</hi> you <note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. viii. 31.</note>? And you have the Mercies and Compaſſions, the Grace and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, the Sufferings, Victories and Triumphs of your Lord Redeemer, his Satisfaction and Interceſſion, to depend on for your Encouragement.

               <p>Laſtly, Conſider the glorious Reward promiſed to the victorious Chriſtian; a Crown of Righteouſneſs, a Crown

of Life and Glory <note n="†" place="bottom">2 Tim. iv. 8. 1 Pet. v. 4.</note>. The Saints who have finiſhed their Warfare, are repreſented in the glorious trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant State, cloathed with white Robes, with Crowns on their Heads, and Palms in their Hands, miniſtring before the Throne to the ſupream King, among the heavenly Courtiers <note n="‡" place="bottom">Rev. vii. 9, 15.</note> But alas! all Language fails to deſcribe the Glories that encircle the victorious Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an; and Spirits that dwell in mortal Fleſh are too weak and narrow to conceive of the Grandeur of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven's Triumphs. The holy Ghoſt is pleas'd to aſſiſt our Imaginations by ſenſible Repreſentations, and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions to earthly Triumphs, which yet Reaſon teaches, muſt be poor Things in compariſon of the heavenly. We muſt realize by Faith what <hi>Eye</hi> has never <hi>ſeen, nor Ear heard.</hi> It is enough that our bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour has promiſed, <hi>Be thou faithful unto the Death, and I will give thee a Crown of Life</hi>

               <p>Be ſtrong then and have a good Heart on't, ye Soldiers of Jeſus Chriſt! Abide true and faithful to your Captain, perſevere in your Conflict with Sins, Corruptions, Temptations, Afflictions, Croſſes, and Oppoſitions, which you muſt expect during your militant State, with Courage and Conſtancy unto the Death; then he will give you the Victory and the Crown, when your Warfare ſhall be fully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, all Enemies ſubdued, and Death (the <hi>laſt</hi> of them) <hi>ſwallowed up in Victory</hi>; and you ſhall put on the Garland of Immortality, and live &amp; reign with him in a glorious undiſturb'd Peace &amp; Reſt for evermore!</p>
