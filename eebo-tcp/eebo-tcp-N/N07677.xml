            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE late Rebellion in the back Inhabitants has been the Occaſion of a Number of Pamphlets being wrote and ſpread in this Colony, ſome of which I have ſeen; the firſt was the <hi>Narrative;</hi> which I'll venture to ſay is a good Thing. Then comes the <hi>Quaker Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mask'd,</hi> a Pamphlet I ſet no more Store by that, than I do by the Principles of the writer:' In anſwer to that another was wrote, 'titled the <hi>Presbyterian Look<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing-Glaſs,</hi> which ſheweth a great deal of ingenuity accompanied with found Reaſons for the publick good.</p>
            <p>AND I am ſorrry the Author made his Period where he did, had he carried his diſcourſe ſo far as to have cleared that Matter with regard to the <hi>Quakers</hi> aſſiſting the Loyal Citizens to ſave the Lives of thoſe <hi>Indians</hi> then in the Barracks; I ſhould not put Pen to Paper on the Subject.</p>
            <p>ALTHOUGH I am not one of that Society myſelf yet I have a Love for them as I have for all other good People that were ſo well adorned with Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tian Zeal and Piety towards GOD; to join as one Man in defence of his righteous Law'; which for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bids the ſhedding of Innocent Blood.—Becauſe e<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>very Perſon is deemed innocent in the Eye of the Law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> untill he is proved Guilty.</p>
            <p>I ſhall quote ſome of the <hi>Moſaic</hi> Law or Laws of GOD, as they ſtand upon holy Record.— And by the Valitidy of thoſe Laws I preſume to try that Act of Cruelty committed on the <hi>Indian</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:009806_0003_0F7A551135AD16C0"/>
at <hi>Lancaſter</hi> by ſome of the back Settlers—the firſt Law I find given to Man by the great Legiſlator was to <hi>Noah</hi> ſoon after he came out of the Ark with his Family.</p>
            <p>"WHO ſo ſheddeth Man's blood, by Man his blood ſhall be ſhed.—<hi>Geneſis.</hi> Chap. 9, 6.—This Law is very explicite and condemns all ſuch who premedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates the Death of his fellow Creature, and executes it Voluntarily in cool blood, for it is not poſſible to conſtrue it otherwiſe, as there is a poſitive Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand with Directions, how a Murderer ſhall be put to Death,—not in the malignant Nature of fallen Man, at their own Option, no but quite otherwiſe; if you will read the 25th Chapter of Numbers, you will find that the Goodneſs of GOD is there diſplayed in a wonderful Manner, you will ſee that he has there given the Law in the moſt ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and extenſive Terms. Not only to the true born <hi>Jew,</hi> but to the Stranger and to the Sojourner amongſt them I ſee no Difference: but an equal Priviledge to both—The <hi>Jews</hi> were commanded to build ſix Cities, three on each Side on the Jordan, which were to be called Cities of Refuge.—Thoſe were to be an Aſylum or Place of Safty unto every Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that had ſlain a Man:—When once fled to thoſe Cities they were not to be puniſh'd in any Sort until they were brougt to their Tryal before the Judges, which I ſuppoſe to be the Sandhackrum ſo called, which was compoſed of ſeventy Men: by which all Matters of Conſequence were deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined. And when theſe Judges were ſeated in the Hall of Judgment, they could not paſs Sentence
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:009806_0004_0F7A5511DD33AD70"/>
upon the Evidence of one Perſon, but at leaſt there muſt be two Witneſſes to take the Life of one Man.
<q>Who ſo killeth any Perſon, the Murderer ſhall be put to death by the Mouth of a Witneſs. But one Witneſs ſhall not teſtifie againſt any one Perſon to cauſe him to die.</q>
—The Law is ſo par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly regardful of Strangers, I cannot with Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction omit the Aſſerting ſome more of it.— which hath an inſeparable Connection with that bleſſed Command of our Saviour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is.—
<q>Do unto all Men as thou would have them do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, for that is the whole Law and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</q>
The Law ſpeaking of Strangers in <hi>Exo. Chap.</hi> 22. <hi>vers</hi> 22, ſayeth,
<q>thou ſhallt neither vex a Stranger nor oppreſs him:</q> And conceive to give it the greater Cenſure on their Minds; the Lord tells them:
<q>For ye were Strangers in the Land of <hi>Egypt.</hi> And if a Stranger ſojourn with thee in your Land, ye ſhall not vex them. But the Stranger that dwelleth with you, ſhall be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you as one born amongſt you, and thou ſhalt love him as theyſelf.</q>
               <hi>Lev.</hi> 19.33. Upon the Whole I muſt conclude that the Priviledges in the civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the jewiſh Nation was as tender to Strangers, and as regardful of their Happineſs as that of the Seed of <hi>Abraham.</hi>—I have coated the Laws, though but a part of thoſe, which promiſe Protection to Strangers and Sojourners equal to thoſe of our own Nation. Were not Men corrupted by ill Principles in Education, and bidding Defiance to Laws, both Moral and Divine,—I queſtion whether there is any Nation of People in the World at this
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:009806_0005_0F7A55125477B730"/>
Time or indeed ever has been: But what has had ſomething of divine Law impreſt upon their Minds in ſuch ſtrong Terms, that they have fell upon Meaſures of ſome Sort to deter every Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon from the executing that horrid Crime; but if perpetrated to puniſh the Criminal even with Death.—Cain Cryed out my puniſhment is greater than I can bare,—There was no out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Law to puniſh him,—What then? An in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Conviction. A wounded Conſcience.— He firſt envied his Brother, and then murdred him the ſame with <hi>Lameck. Geneſis</hi> iv. <hi>vers</hi> 23,
<q>He ſaid unto his Wives <hi>Adah Zillah,</hi> hear my Voice ye Wives of <hi>Lameck,</hi> harken unto my Speach; for I have ſlain a Man to my wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and a young Man to my Hurt.</q>
We read no outward Law at that Time, it being (if the Word may be allowed) in the Infancy of Time before the civil Power was ſo well eſtabliſhed as afterwards. The <hi>Apoſtle Paul</hi> tells us, that there was ſome of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who had not the Law, were a Law unto themſelves,—But why don't every Chriſtian believe it? if he deſerves that Name, for my part, I am confident in that Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief: —And I likewiſe believe, that where the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> is ſpeaking of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> being endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Spirit of Grace, that they by ſtrictly adhering to that in themſelves, walked as order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:009806_0006_0F7A5512E7434500"/>
as thoſe that had the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi>—obey<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing of which is a peculiar Advantage to every Man; a Bleſſing that cannot be taken from him while he himſelf is zelous for his own Good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But if a Man neglects his Duty, and abandons himſelf to Wickedneſs, I believe in Time it may ceaſe ſtriving with him: When Men give themſelves to lying Evils, and by Degree give way to immoral Acts, they become dark and fenſeleſs to any Good; and are willing to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrate any Crime to ſerve their Humors, if it be even Murder itſelf. But thoſe People, al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>though, they have forſaken the Gifts of Grace they cannot fly from a guilty Conſcience, they have broken the Law of God, their Puniſhment is ſuch, that they cannot give themſelves Eaſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> neither can they receive it from another, there is a continual Knawing, as though their Bowels were rent in pieces, with Sights of Sorrow, and perpetual Griefs, that cannot be uttered: A woe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Feeling of the Pains of Hell, and no Relief to be had, but by delivering themſelves up to Juſtice, and praying to God for Mercy, deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he in his Goodneſs would admit of that Sacrifice: And make it acceptable to him, <hi>viz.</hi> The Life of the Body as an Attonement for the Sins of the Soul. <hi>For Blood it defileth the Land and the Land cannot be cleanſed of the Blood that
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:009806_0007_0F7A5513A9952440"/>
is ſhed therein, but by the Blood of him that ſhed it:</hi>—Numbers 35, <hi>v.</hi> 33. Here we ſee how ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite God is reſpecting Murder how than is it, or can it be poſſible that a Chriſtian can here tell of ſo horrid a Crime as that committed at <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſter</hi> without the deepeſt Sorrow mixt with Reſentment; how can a ſolid thinking Man help ſaying, that had I been there at the Time, when the Banditti came, I could have given my All to have ſaved the Life of thoſe Indians. <hi>"A Man lay down his Life for his Friend ſayeth Chriſt."</hi> But do call them Indians Innocent, how is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that Indians can it be innocent? I anſwer, they were innocent, for they had never been convicted by the Laws of God or Man, nor I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve ſuſpected by their Neighbours. They had a juſt Right to all the Privileges and Advantages neceſſary to their Occaſions. Why not, they were certainly our Neighbours dwelling on Lands of their own: But if only Sojourners, we live enjoined by the Royal Law, to take neceſſary Care that they are not Sufferers by us, and that they receive no ill at our Hands, but muſt love them as ourſelves. Here my Bretheren I have produced a Part of thoſe heavenly Statutes, which are binding to us any Part of the Royal Laws; and by the Sanction of theſe very Laws, I ſhall prove that the <hi>Quakers</hi> Aſſiſting the good People
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:009806_0008_0F7A55146CC0E4D8"/>
of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> or His Honors the Governors Requeſt to preſerve the Lives of the <hi>Indians</hi> then in the Barracks, is conſiſtent with Reaſon, agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to our Laws, hath an inſeparable Connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the Law of God, and not repugnant to the Rules of their Society,. In the firſt Place, I conſider God as the alone Source from whence all Good cometh. It may be ſaid, that he has mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted himſelf two Ways. The one by his Prophets and holy Men, in former Ages, who received his Law for the eſtabliſhment, the Happineſs and the Tranquillity of Mankind in their ſeveral Stations of Life. And in the next Place by his holy Spirit, which convinceth to us. Nay it is a plain and undeniable Truth that we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate our Lives and Manners agreeable to the aboveſaid Laws, or we cannot be Chriſtians.— No nor we cannot be Heathens, unleſs be of the moſt abanded and reprobate Sort, which will cry out with <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Lamach,</hi> I have kill'd my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I have kill'd my Neighbour, I am hurt, I am wounded, my Torment is greater then I can bear. I aſſert it to be impoſſible for a faithful Chriſtian to be out of the Reach of this Law, while he is on this Side of Eternity, it's ingrafted in him in ſuch a manner that he cannot ſerve God and Family, omits that, which is the moſt aſſential part of his Duty in civil Society, <hi>viz.</hi> The Safety
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:009806_0009_0F7A5515270C98E8"/>
or Preſervation of his Fellow Creatures Life, then I conclude, that the ſpiritual inſtinct, which the animal part hath a Sympathy which binds the whole Creature to act for the Safety of his Neighbour as that of himſelf,—if any Man, denies this at the ſame Time he denies God—But ſtill the <hi>Quakers</hi> are blam'd,—I ask for what? <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

Surely not to murder their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours in cool Blood:—No ſayeth the <hi>Unmasker,</hi> that's not my Meaning,—Then I ask what? they have foreſook their Principles,—Here it ſeemeth as though I ſhould anſwer for him, and ſay that when my Brethren were coming down from <hi>Lancaſter</hi> under Arms to kill the Indians<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and endeavoured to ſend a Report by their Agents, that their Number was ſeven Times more then they realy were;—Then the <hi>Quakers</hi> join'd with the other <hi>Citizens,</hi> ſome in getting the Cannon to the <hi>Barraks,</hi> ſome few I ſuppoſe, carried Muskets, and were as active as any others in Helping to keep the Indians from being murder'd:—Alaſs; is this the chief Baſis on which their monſtrous Mould Hill is build. why all this is exactly genuine, and agreeable to the beſt Saints principlels on Earth, thoſe Indians had fled to the City of Refuge they had made

the Barracks their Aſylum, they were to be pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tected by the Royal Law,—Then I ſay that e<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>very loyal Subject (preſent) in the Kingdom of Chriſt were bligated to lend their Aſſiſtance,—But why are the <hi>Quakers</hi> blam'd more than any other Denomination, ſeeing the Church, Annabaptiſt and even the Romans join'd as one Man, whoſe Miniſter as I have been told, cautioned his Hearers with whatever you do, don't join the Rebells, but if you act, let it be in behalf of the Province, this was true Loyalty.
<q>Of all Denomination of People that dwelleth upon the Earth, he that feareth God, <hi>i. e.</hi> payeth a juſt Regard to his Laws, and worketh Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eousneſs, ſhall be ſaved.</q>
I think there is no prudent Man that will ſay all they have done for it; was no other than in Obedience to the Law of Heaven in building a City of Refuge, to ſecure their Neighbours from premeditated Murder, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have had Experience in the Inſtance of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> that Walls build with Hands, could be a Place of no Safety, neither do I conceive that any other Meaſures would have ſucceeded, but by honeſtly acting as the royal Law directs.— Hower, this I am ſure, there is no one can make it appear inconſiſtent with the ſtricteſt Rules of Juſtice.—And under the Bleſſing of Heaven, it anſwered all the good Purpoſes deſired—Surely

there is not one hath Reaſon to find Fault with a Building, which when erected ſuits the Builders purpoſe—But this Building is of a more worthy and elegant Nature—This was built by God <hi>his Laws were the Materials and the loyal Citzens of Philadelphia, were his Workman.</hi>

               <hi>Matt.</hi> 1, 11. <hi>Well this is the very Situation my beloved Citizens, that you are in.—This Unmasker has been gathering of filth and flinging at you for ſome weeks paſt but for want of ſkill or ſteady hand he has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatterd his own Garments, that he realy appears to be a dirty Fellow—Although he ſeems to point his Shaft at the Quakers: Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the prudent Reader will undoubtedly ſee that the vindictive Spirit ſtops not, here the Unmasker revealeth the Quakers for acting, becauſe they are Principled againſt war both offenſive and defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive. —Let that be the caſe,—their Principles ſtill remain untoucht in that particular, for here is no War amongſt Men that I know of, but Nation againſt Nation or the King and Parliament one againſt the other, which is called a civil War,— ſhall this be called a War, when a Number of ill minded Men collected into a Body, and threaten Deſtruction to their Neighbours in the ſame Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:009806_0012_0F7A5518F3700B88"/>
I ſay, ſhall this be called War, no it is not War; it is an inſulting Act of Rioters and no other,—then where is the War on the other Side of the Queſtion, can any Nation or People defend themſelves in that of actual defenſive war, when there is no Oponent, what a fallacious way of Argument is this, beſides, can it be thought mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raly poſſible that any religious Society of People, could ſuppreſe ſuch an act of Cruelty in Speculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for they could never think it would be perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated, is that a ſufficient Reaſon for a Society to eſtabliſh a Rule, whereby every member, thus acting muſt be diſown'd,—we'll ſuppoſe the Caſe is as follows—why not a Member of that Society muſt ever uſe any Endeavours, even to ſave the Life of a tender Mother or a ſucking Infant, leaſt he ſhould be thrown over the Hedge. One of the Prophets ſpeaking in the Name of the Lord, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Iſraels offering their Children to Molac. ſayeth, "I never thought of ſuch a thing, neither hath it entered into my Heart." There is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Society in the known World that can make ſuch a Rule to forbid themſelves aſſiſting in ſaving the Lives of their fellow Creatures; let the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Deſtroyers be ſmall or great: But there is no ſuch Rule. Then I ask, how it's poſſible to deviate from or transgreſs a Rule, which has no Being under Heaven. The Apoſtle Paul ſayeth, "where there is no Law, there is no Transgreſſion."

I am well aſſured this Unmasker would have had as much Reaſon to have blam'd the good People of the City, if they had clapt the Indians in the Workhouſe-Yard and ſecured them there, as to have defended them at the Barracks, the odds is none in fact, the ſtone Walls would then have been their Aſyalum. As in the other the Number of Men with their Preparation, was their City of Refuge, but our Workhouſe could have been no more a Place of Safety to them Indians, than Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſter Workhouſe to their Brethren; I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the fundamental of the Quakers Principles, are to be guided and directed in this Life by the Spirit of God: well if ſo, that holy Spirit that gave the abovementioned Law, was the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the ſame God,—then I am ſure there is not any thing can or will argue in ſtronger terms for their tender Principles than their honorable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedures in Philadelphia,—for God is the ſame, his Spirit ehe ſame, his Rule and Sovereignty the ſame:—then whatever Men oppoſes or vili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feyes their Principles in this Race, muſt dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regard the Law, deſpiſe the Spirit that gave it, and bid Defiance to the God of all Fleſh. I ask our Unmasker if he is the Man.</hi>

People in the Manner he hath the Quakers, but this may be only his Mask, for I think it's evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by the Scope of his writing, that he hates his King, his Governor and even his Country too, under the preſent Conſtitution, as ill as he hates the Quakers:—And if Oppurtunity ſerv'd his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination would unmask himſelf, with as much zeal as he has the Quakers, with Bitterneſs of Mind.: I have never been told by any moderate Man, be of what Society he might, that the Quakers have ever been a troubleſome reſtleſs People under any Government, although I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve they have ſuffered the moſt of any religious Society now in the World, and that for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſake only; how zealously ſteady were they at the Time that <hi> King Charles the Firſt</hi> and <hi>Oliver,</hi> when in the Hight of all the Quarrel;—Did the Quakers ever riot, Mutiny or plot againſt the Government.

the Unmasker ſeems to want them to have been Rebels to their God and their King, and ſacrifice their moſt righteous Principles to have pav'd the Way for his Brethren, who intended to offer the Blood of the Indians in the Barracks for a Peace Offering to their great God Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, —But thank Fortune he know them better by this Time, and may plainly ſee that there is more Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty by nine Degrees in the Quakers, than in himſelf and all his Adherents, he tells us he has been unmasking the Quakers, if that be ſo, he has neglected the Beam in his own Eye, while he has been peeping for a Mote in his Neighbours; for I'll venture to ſay, not only his Mask is put off, he is almoſt ſtrip't to the Buff. I think there is but one ſpoted Garment to cover his Body, one pluck more ſtrips him, don't miſtake me my Brethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, it is not my Work or at leaſt, but Part of it.
