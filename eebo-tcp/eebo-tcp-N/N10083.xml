            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> QUITE agree with those who think ministers ought not to bring into the pulpit <hi>dry specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> or <hi>dark abstruse, disputed points,</hi> which have no tendency to make the heart better, and influence the practice: But shall be far from agreeing with any, who may think the subject of the fol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>owing sermons to be such.—If God has given us sufficient evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to determine, <hi>that all the sin and misery in the universe is for the general good of the whole, and shall answer some good end that shall much more than counter-balance the evil;</hi> then doubtless it is of importance, that all should attend to the evidence, and believe this truth.</p>
            <p>It is, I conceive, evident beyond contradiction, that this truth must be believed in order to a true and chearful submission to God's will, as it is manifested in what he does and what he permits. For he who chearfully submits to God's will, submits to it as WISE and GOOD, either seeing it to be so in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance his submission respects, or believing it implicit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: For it is not our duty, or indeed <hi>possible</hi> for us to be reconciled or submit to <hi>absolute evil,</hi> or <hi>evil as such.</hi> But if the sin and misery which take place in the world, are not for the general good of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse, then they are absolutely evil, or evil in every view and sense; and so God's will to permit sin and misery is not WISE and GOOD, and therefore cannot be submitted to.</p>

               </note> is a maxim on which is grounded all implicit submission to God's will, in his providential directing and disposing all events; which we are required to be ready on all occasions, to exercise. So far therefore as this truth is doubted, or out of view; so far there can be no sincere, chearful submission. Is it not then of great importance, that this truth should be maintain'd and held up to view? And that especially at a time, when it seems to be much out of sight to most; and begins to be even called in question by many.</p>
            <p>The more a christian's heart is filled with <hi>true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence,</hi> the more ardently he wishes and seeks the good of the universe; or, which is the same thing, the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And if he should suppose that God had permitted that to take place, which was, on the whole, <hi>a disadvantage to the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverse,</hi> he must divest himself of his benevolence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he could be reconciled or submit to it. And it must therefore be peculiarly satisfying and pleasing, to find the <hi>contrary</hi> reveal'd as a <hi>ce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb n="iii" facs="unknown:012812_0003_0F8ABA9F04BBD678"/>As therefore this truth is of such use and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to christians, it was needful that the objections made against it should be answer'd. Especially that most common one found in the text. The <hi>common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of this objection, and the <hi>plausibleness</hi> with which it appears to many, who do not attend closely to this matter, was the inducement so particularly to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, and shew it's groundlesness and absurdity; which is done in the <hi>second</hi> sermon.</p>
            <p>If we cannot reconcile God's <hi>permitting sin</hi> with his <hi>goodness, holiness</hi> and his <hi>revealed will:</hi> Then the <hi>permission of sin</hi> is a dark and unaccountable af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair to us indeed; and we <hi>cannot</hi> be reconciled to it, or justify God herein. <hi>It becomes us to justify and approve of all God's ways to men;</hi> to see and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge his righteousness in all he does: Yea, it becomes us to be <hi>well pleased</hi> with all God's ways, so far as they are made known to us: For in this way <hi>alone</hi> shall we be able truly to <hi>rejoice that the LORD reigns, and hath done whatsoever pleased him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They who cannot reconcile God's <hi>permission of sin</hi> to his <hi>wisdom, holiness</hi> and <hi>revealed will,</hi> can really understand, and be reconciled to few or none of God's ways to men: For almost all God's conduct towards man, is built upon this, or some way related to it; as all must be sensible on the least reflection.</p>
            <p>If therefore this attempt, imperfect as it is, shall afford any light and help to any, in these important points, the labour and expence will be richly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensated·</p>

               <p>We have another instance in the wickedness of <hi>Pharoah,</hi> king of Egypt. <hi>Pharoah</hi> was an instance of remarkable wickedness.

to convince him that they were sent by the omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent governor of the world. Yea, though when in sore distress, by the hand of God, that was heavy upon him, he repeatedly confessed his sin and promised reformation, if God would deliver him; yet he as often hardned his heart, and broke all his promises.

               <p>Again, the sin of the <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our Lord <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> to death, was the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of great good.

the good of men, and most for the glory of God. Now the death of <hi>Christ,</hi> so full of good to man, and so much to the glory of God, was brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout by the wickedness of man; yea, one of the greatest instances of wickedness that ever was: And not only so, but it could be brought about no other way.

These instances on record are a proof that sin is not in it's own nature such a thing, as that it cannot be improved by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite wisdom to bring about great good. And if it is not, so in it's own nature, nothing can make it so, we have reason to think.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="unknown:012812_0008_0F8ABAA22A82A8F0"/>AND if God is wise and powerful enough, and so <hi>can</hi> make sin in general, yea every instance of it, answer some good end; may we not suppose that he <hi>actually does it?</hi> If God does not want wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and power to do it; we cannot think he will neglect it, or suffer sin to fail of answering a good end, through want of care and attention to this matter. No surely; 'tis not a matter of indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with God, whether sin answers a good end or a bad one, or none at all. To suppose this, would be to suppose the infinitely holy God perfectly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different about <hi>good</hi> and <hi>evil</hi>; yea, perfectly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different about the most interesting and important affair in the universe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Which would be the most unworthy thought of God, as well as the greatest absurdity.</p>
               <p>But as it is of importance that we should all form our opinion right in this matter, let us again turn to the <hi>bible,</hi> and see what further light we can get there in this point.—And here we may observe the following things:—</p>
               <p n="1">I. The bible leads us to look upon the GOSPEL, or the way of salvation by Christ, as a method God has taken to bring good out of the evil of sin in general. The gospel is founded in the sinfulness of man, and takes all it's glory from it; and sin is the occasion of all the good that comes to man, and all the glory that comes to God by it. The great work of the Saviour of the world, is TO BRING GOOD OUT OF EVIL. And I think, the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture leads us to consider the benefits of the gospel as a <hi>greater good</hi> than would have been, had there been no sin. The scripture don't represent the work of redemption, as what God has wrought to <hi>mend</hi> and <hi>patch</hi> up, as well as he could, a world that is spoil'd and ruin'd by sin; as if there would
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:012812_0009_0F8ABAA3A0CD4720"/>
have been <hi>more good</hi> in the world, upon the whole, if there had been no sin, and so no redemption by Christ. No, the work of redemption is represented in scripture as contriv'd and laid out before the world was made, and as the most glorious of all God's works; far more glorious than the work of creation.</p>
               <p>Jesus Christ is said to be ordain'd to the work of redemption, <hi>before the foundation of the world.</hi> (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> i.20.) And the glorious way of salvation, which is called the <hi>wisdom of God,</hi> is said to be <hi>ordain'd before the world.</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> ii.7.) <hi>Christ's</hi> church and people are said to be <hi>chosen in him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the foundation of the World. (Eph.</hi> i.3, 4.) The great favour that comes to believers by the gospel, is said to be given to them <hi>before the world began</hi> (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9.) Thus the scripture leads us to consider the work of redemption as <hi>originally design'd</hi> by God before he made the world, as his greatest and most glorious work; in a view to which he made all things at first. Therefore <hi>all things</hi> are said to be made <hi>for</hi> Christ. (<hi>Col.</hi> i.16.) <hi>For by him,</hi> [i. e. Christ] <hi>were all things created that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, —all things were created by him, and FOR HIM.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>new creation,</hi> i. e. the work of redemption, is said to be far more glorious than the first crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. (<hi>Isai.</hi> lxv.17, 18.) <hi>For behold, I create new heavens, and a new earth: And the former shall not be remembred, nor come into mind,</hi> &amp;c. Now the sin of man is the occasion of these <hi>new hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens</hi> and <hi>new earth:</hi> For the glory of Christ and his works could not have been, had not sin took place. Thus sin in general is the occasion of all that good which is comprized in the work of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:012812_0009_0F8ABAA3A0CD4720"/>
which, according to scripture, so much exceeds all the good which was in the first creation. The world, consider'd as fallen or sinful, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem'd by Christ, is better and far more glorious than it was, consider'd as without sin, according to scripture. Thus we are taught, that God's greatest and most glorious work, is <hi>to bring good out of evil,</hi> to make sin in general, which is the greatest evil, the means of the greatest good.—I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to observe,</p>
               <p n="2">II<hi rend="sup">dly.</hi> The <hi>scripture</hi> not only teaches us, that good is brought out of sin in general, by the work of redemption; but also, <hi>That God makes the sin and final obstinacy of those that perish eternally, the occasion of great good.</hi> That God designs good by this evil, and brings good out of it. This we are particularly taught in <hi>Rom.</hi> ix.22. <hi>What if God willing to shew his wrath, and make his power known, endured with much long-suffering, the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction?</hi> Here we are taught, that God's end in bearing with sinners, and suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to go on in sin to destruction, is the manifestation of his power and wrath: i. e. his own glory: And that he makes their sin and ruin the occasion and means of it; and so brings good out of this evil, even their sinfulness and ruin. And doubtless, the good obtain'd is greater than the evil by which it is brought about; for we can't reconcile it to the wisdom of God, that he should suffer a <hi>greater evil,</hi> for the sake of a <hi>less good.</hi> If God suffers sinners to go on to destruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, that he might hereby shew his wrath, and make his power known; then it is not only certain that God makes the sin and ruin of those that perish, the occasion and means of his own glory; but 'tis also certain, that he counts his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:012812_0010_0F8ABAA586BFB8E0"/>
so great a good, as to overbalance all that evil which he suffers to take place, as a means of that good: So that, upon the whole, there is more good than if there had been no evil. I say, we are <hi>sure</hi> of this; for to suppose the contrary, is to impeach God's wisdom: For to suffer a <hi>greater</hi> evil, for the sake of a <hi>less</hi> good, is as if one should part with a <hi>thousand</hi> pounds for the sake of <hi>ten,</hi> or as the means of procuring <hi>one penny.</hi> Or as if he should endure a <hi>million</hi> degrees of pain, for the sake of <hi>one</hi> degree of pleasure; which, upon the whole, is worse than nothing at all; and is really preferring evil to no e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, or a greater evil to a less: Which is the same with choosing evil for evil's sake; and cannot be supposed of the wise and holy God, without blasphemy.</p>
               <p>Indeed, the instance of <hi>Pharoah,</hi> which we have before consider'd, is a specimen of all obstinate, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent sinners. As God raised him up; i. e. suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd him to go on to such a degree of wickedness, 'till he was ripe for destruction, that in him he might shew his power, and cause his name to be declared throughout all the earth: So he suffers all sinners that finally perish, to go on 'till they are fitted for destruction, that he may glorify himself in them. And 'tis from the instance of <hi>Pharoah,</hi> and what God says of him, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> mentions in the 17th verse, that he is led to say what he does of finally impenitent sinners in general, in the text under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration.</p>
               <p>He who can understand God's dealings with <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roah,</hi> and is reconciled to his suffering him to go on to so great a degree of wickedness, that he might glorify himself in him, and can see God's righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and wisdom in bringing this good out of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roah</hi>'s wickedness; <hi>he</hi> will easily see how God makes the sin of all that are finally impenitent, a means of
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:012812_0010_0F8ABAA586BFB8E0"/>
his own glory; and suffers them to go on to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, that he may answer this end.—</p>
               <p>If any should say,
<q>Though God glorified him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self by the great wickedness and obstinacy of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roah,</hi> and does so by the sin and destruction of all that perish; yet God would be <hi>more</hi> glorified, and he would obtain a <hi>higher</hi> and <hi>better</hi> end, if neither <hi>Pharoah,</hi> nor any sinner went on in wickedness to final impenitence and destruction:</q>
I say, if any should say so; I think, they would contradict the scripture-texts we are considering, or at least deny God's wisdom in his conduct in these instances. God says, he suffer'd <hi>Pharoah</hi> to go on to the length he did in sin, 'till he was ripe for ruin, that he might glorify himself thereby. Now, if he would have had <hi>more</hi> glory, or <hi>as much</hi> if Pharoah had not gone on as he did; then God did not take the <hi>best</hi> method, and use the <hi>best</hi> means to glorify himself by <hi>Pharo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah:</hi> And therefore did not act wisely in seeking to glorify himself by <hi>Pharoah</hi>'s obstinacy and ruin: For wisdom consists in choosing the <hi>best</hi> means, to answer the <hi>best</hi> end. This may be applied to final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impenitent sinners in general.</p>
               <p n="3">IIIdly. <hi>The scripture teaches us, that God makes ALL the sins of men, from the beginning to the end of the world, to answer some good end.</hi> This we are particularly taught in the 76th psalm, 10th verse. <hi>Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee: The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of wrath shalt thou restrain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By <hi>the wrath of man</hi> we are to understand the wickedness of men in general, by which they vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently oppose God, and all that is good. 'Tis here said, that <hi>all</hi> this wrath shall praise God; i. e. shall be to his honor and glory: So that <hi>that</hi> wrath, that wickedness of man which would not answer this end, God will effectually restrain, and not suffer to take
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:012812_0011_0F8ABAA6098D3C78"/>
place. So that by this scripture we are assured, that God is glorified by all the sin that is in the world: God makes it all the occasion of this good. And the reason why God lays the restraints on men that he does, and so prevents there being more sin than there is, is because <hi>more</hi> sin would not answer this end: For God will have nothing in his world but what he can bring good out of, and turn to his own glory.</p>
               <p>Another text which I think is <hi>full</hi> to this purpose, is that noted one (Gen. iii.15.) AND IT SHALL BRUISE THY HEAD. i. e. <hi>The seed of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man shall bruise the serpent's head.</hi> Which is as much as to say, that Christ shall utterly and compleatly disappoint and defeat the devil, in what he had done in introducing sin into the world. But this he would not do, if he did not turn all the sin which the devil had been the means of bringing into the world, into good, by making it the occasion of more, or at least as much good, as there would have been if there had been no sin. If there is <hi>one instance</hi> of sin, which is not turn'd to good, the devil is not herein disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed and defeated; but is gratified finally: His end is answer'd, and 'tis so far just as he would have it. So far he is not conquered by Christ; but he gains his point, and is conqueror himself. If the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil has in any degree marr'd and spoil'd the world, and made it upon the whole worse than it would have been if he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> not introduced sin into it, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding what Christ has done to defeat him; then he has <hi>so far</hi> gain'd his point, and succeeded in the thing he aim'd at: And therefore <hi>so far</hi> he is not defeated, but conquers and reigns.</p>
               <p>So that these words hold forth this truth, in the strongest light; viz. That all the sin in the world, is by Christ made the occasion of good; yea that
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:012812_0011_0F8ABAA6098D3C78"/>
Christ will make sin the occasion of so much good, that the world shall be at least <hi>as good</hi> a world,<note n="*" place="bottom">By the WORLD<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is not meant, <hi>this earth,</hi> or things in the present state only; but the WHOLE UNIVERSE through all it's duration.</note> as if sin had never been introduced: So that satan shall not gain his end in one point, in the least degree; but shall be <hi>wholly</hi> defeated.</p>
               <p>This is the way in which Christ bruises the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent's head, viz. by bringing good out of evil. And the more good he makes sin the occasion of, the more effectually is satan defeated: The greater is Christ's conquest, and the more he triumphs o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the devil. If Christ is able to make sin the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of so much good, as that God shall be more glorified, and this be <hi>a much better world,</hi> than if sin had never come into it; this will be the most deadly and dreadful bruise to satan's head, that can be brought upon it. This will be an overthrow that the devil dreads above all things. To see God greatly glorified, and the world made much better by sin, by which satan sought to dishonour God, and spoil his world; yea to see sin made the means of making God more glorious, and this a better world than could have been if sin had not been introduced: So that sin becomes the occasion of something di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly opposite to that which satan aims at, and seeks to accomplish: and which he above all things hates, and desires to destroy: For satan, I say, to see things turn out so, will be above all things crossing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive to him; and must be the most effectual, the greatest and most glorious conquest over him that can be. This is to bruise his head in the highest degree. There is nothing the devil dreads so much as this; and therefore to prevent things coming to this pass, he has been exerting all his powers, and making un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:012812_0012_0F8ABAA68C6FDA68"/>
attempts in all ages. And therefore we may be sure Christ will accomplish this, <hi>if he can.</hi> He will so bring things about, that God shall be more glorified, and this shall be, upon the whole, a much better world, than if the devil had never at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to dethrone God, and ruin man: And will make sin, by which the devil sought to spoil this world, and rob God of his honour, the occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and means of bringing this about. I say, we may be sure Christ will do this IF HE CAN, and that to a wonderful and even infinite degree. And surely no <hi>christian</hi> can doubt of his power to do it. For this end he came into the world, and became the seed of the woman; for this he hung and died on the cross, by which he <hi>spoiled principalities and powers, and triumphed over them.</hi> By <hi>this</hi> he will effectually and gloriously <hi>destroy the works of the devil,</hi> and <hi>put all his enemies under his feet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus we see how the scripture represents God as making sin the occasion of good; even so as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to bring about <hi>more good,</hi> than would have been without it: And that <hi>every instance</hi> of sin answers some good end, by the wise, over-ruling hand of God. The matter seems to be abundantly plain according to scripture.</p>
               <p>But there may be some yet stumbled at this; it being strange and unaccountable to them, that this should be, upon the whole, a <hi>better</hi> world, than it would have been, had not sin and misery enter'd into it: It being to them one of the greatest para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxes, that <hi>That,</hi> which in itself is the greatest e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, should be productive of the greatest good; the occasion of so much glory to God, and good to the world.</p>
               <p>But such, if any there are, are desired to consider the following things.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="unknown:012812_0012_0F8ABAA68C6FDA68"/>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Our not being able to see how this is, or can be done, is no argument that God cannot do it. Surely infinite power and wisdom can do this, tho' infinitely beyond us. Doubtless God knows how to do this, <hi>Who disappointeth the devices of the craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, so that their hands cannot perform their enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize. Who taketh the wis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> in their own crafti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: And carrieth the counsel of the froward head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long. (Iob</hi> v.12, 13.) This is the peculiar glory of God's wisdom, that 'tis able to bring <hi>such good,</hi> out of <hi>such evil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Let such consider, how shocking and dreadful the thought must be, to suppose, that God has permitted that to come into the world, which has in a measure spoiled it; so that he can by no means remove the evil, recover the damage, and make his world as good as it was before! How could God look on and see this, and be unconcern'd, and possess his infinite felicity? Surely this must <hi>grieve him to the heart,</hi> in a literal sense, and make him <hi>heartily repent,</hi> that he had made a world for satan to destroy; <hi>to destroy,</hi> so that he never could perfectly recover it!</p>
               <p>Should some one of a nice and elegant taste, build a stately palace, and furnish it with every thing pleasant and delightful: And when he had done, his enemy should come and deface it, and throw it into the utmost confusion and deformity; and place, in the midst of it, something exceeding ugly to the view, and most offensive and loathsome to the smell: and he should be unable to remove it, or so contrive to make it answer some good end to himself, as totally to disappoint his enemy; surely this must be very grievous to him. Instead of beauty and pleasure, he must endure the mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a most ugly sight, and nauseous, abominable
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:012812_0013_0F8ABAA74CD95E20"/>
smell; while he has no way to help himself. He would wish a thousand times, he had never struck a stroke to that building; but wish in vain. Now if we suppose God's world is, upon the whole, the worse for sin, do we not represent him to be in the case of such an one, or rather infinitely worse!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We would do well to consider, whether if we don't allow that every instance of sin is the occasion of some great good to over-balance it; o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> whether by supposing, that on the whole, the world is worse for sin, we do not really set something up above God, to rule with him, and even <hi>over</hi> him, in some degree.</p>
               <p>According to the <hi>scripture</hi> representation of this matter, which we have been considering, God is <hi>supreme. He is in the heavens, and hath done what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever pleased him. He doth his will in the army of heaven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and among the inhabitants of the earth: And NONE CAN STAY HIS HAND.</hi> He has all things in his hand, and orders all events in his world; and lets nothing come into it, or take place there, but what is to answer some good end, and serves to make the world <hi>better,</hi> more perfect and excellent than it would have been without it.</p>
               <p>But if si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> has, by coming into the world, marr'd and spoil'd it, so that it will eternally be a <hi>worse,</hi> or less perfect and excellent world, than it would have been if sin had not enter'd; then surely sin did not come in by God's permission: but it was <hi>thrust in</hi> by some one so powerful, that God could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it; and therefore so far was, and continues to be, above and superiour to the Most High!</p>
               <p>The devil design'd to rob God of his honor, and spoil the world he had made, by introducing sin into it; and so to out-do God, and be above him in this instance; and, as it were, take it out of
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:012812_0013_0F8ABAA74CD95E20"/>
God's hands, and reign in it himself. And so far as God, upon the whole, looses any honor by what the devil has done, so far as this world is, upon the whole, <hi>worse,</hi> so far the devil has obtain'd his end, has out-done the Most High, and reigns and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs, and will do so to all eternity. Surely none would <hi>knowingly</hi> represent God in such a dishonor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able light, and ascribe such honor and power to the devil and wicked men; but would much rather say, ALL honor and <hi>power belong unto God</hi>; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice that God is <hi>above</hi> men and devils <hi>in the thing wherein they deal most proudly:</hi> And herein disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers himself to be greater than all others, that would desire to be gods.</p>
               <p>Having thus endeavour'd to illustrate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm this proposition, I shall now make some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections on what has been said, by way of inference.</p>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>This view of the matter helps us to a short, easy and satisfactory way of accounting for God's suffering SIN to come into the world, and permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it to prevail and abound as it has done.</hi> And indeed, it cannot be accounted for in any other way.</p>
               <p>Some of the <hi>heathen,</hi> in order to account for sin's coming into the world, have supposed it to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by two opposite independent principles or beings, a good one, and an evil one: And that all sin and evil is from the evil being, which the good being cannot prevent; and so has no hand, even in <hi>permitting</hi> sin.</p>
               <p>And some who have the advantage of divine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, give but a very little better account of the matter; while they suppose God <hi>could not</hi> prevent sin taking place among his creatures: That God made a number of intelligent creatures, that he could not controul and keep from sin, if he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued them in being, and <hi>free agents,</hi> and treated
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:012812_0014_0F8ABAA80BC4D140"/>
them according to the nature and capacity of such. And so the world has been in a great measure spoil'd and ruin'd by SIN, introduced by the <hi>Free agency</hi> of the creature, which could not be restrain'd and controul'd by God. But how this can be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled with the scripture, or the wisdom, supremacy, and infinite happiness of God, I think they have never yet shewn.</p>
               <p>But if God saw that sin's entering into the world, would be the <hi>best</hi> means of answering the <hi>greatest</hi> and <hi>best</hi> ends, would be the occasion of the greatest good, a means of the world's becoming <hi>better,</hi> more excellent and glorious than otherwise it would be; then it is easy to see why he should determine to suffer it to take place, even though at the same time he knew how to prevent it, and could easily have done it. For the sake of the great good, which God saw SIN would be the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ccasion of, by his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal, he was <hi>quite willing</hi> to suffer it to take place among his creatures, and therefore <hi>permitted it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>OBJECTION. Is not this to make God do evil that good may come, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> greatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns in the text?</p>
               <p>ANSWER. By no means. Surely God does not <hi>do evil</hi> in <hi>permitting</hi> his creatures to sin, but on the contrary, acts wisely and holily herein. The <hi>creature</hi> does the evil, and not GOD. The crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture's aims and ends in <hi>committing</hi> sin, are wicked and vile; but God's aims and designs in <hi>permitting</hi> the creature thus to act, are wise and holy. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God does not do evil that good may come; but all <hi>He</hi> does is <hi>good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>OBJ. But does not this represent God as <hi>willing</hi> and <hi>chusing</hi> SIN, and so <hi>taking pleasure</hi> in it? <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o suppose which, would be the highest blasphemy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="unknown:012812_0014_0F8ABAA80BC4D140"/>ANS. This does not represent God as taking pleasure in sin, and willing and chusing it <hi>for it's own sake,</hi> in itself consider'd; but he is willing sin should take place, for the sake of <hi>something else,</hi> viz. The great good that it will be the occasion of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing. This is nothing contrary to God's hating sin infinitely, consider'd as 'tis in itself, in it's own nature, as consisting in the disposition, views and aims of the sinner; as such, it is the abominable thing which God hates.</p>
               <p>There seems to be no great difficulty in making this distinction. We are obliged to make the same, with regard to <hi>natural evil,</hi> or pain and suffering. This is as <hi>truly</hi> (tho' not in the same sense and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, I say, as <hi>really</hi> contrary to God's nature and will, in itself consider'd, as <hi>moral evil.</hi> Yet God is so far reconciled to it, for the sake of the good to be obtained by it, that he is quite willing it should take place; yea, inflicts it in millions of instances, with his own hand. Thus it pleased God to <hi>bruise</hi> his own son, to put him to the most amazing pain and torture; not because he delights in pain and misery, in itself consider'd; but he chose thus to put his son to pain, for the sake of the good to be answer'd thereby. In this view of things, God was quite willing his son should suffer, and was pleased with it. Whereas, if there had been no good to be answer'd thereby, it would have been infinitely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to God's nature and will, that his son should be put to such extreme pain. Thus the permis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of sin can be accounted for, as easily as we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for the sufferings of Christ, and in the same way: viz. That God <hi>chose</hi> they both should take place, and therefore suffer'd them to take place, for the sake of the great good they are the means of.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="unknown:012812_0015_0F8ABAA903A22918"/>If any should say,
<q>seeing God <hi>chose</hi> that his own son should be put to the most extreme suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, and looked on and was pleased with it: And seeing he will inflict such amazing pain on the damned to all eternity; it seems that the pain and misery of his creatures <hi>suits</hi> him, is agreeable to his will, and he really takes pleasure and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in it.</q>
I say, if any one should argue in this form, he would talk as consistently, and as much to the purpose, as he who says,
<q>That seeing God <hi>chose</hi> to permit sin, therefore sin is agreeable to his will, and he delights in it.</q>
—Both may be easily answered thus:—God wills neither sin nor misery for their own sake; they being, in themselves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd, abstracted from all connections and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, most contrary to his nature and will: And was there no good end to be answer'd by sin or misery, God would have forever kept them both out of his world; but since they become the occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and means of so much good, he suffers them both to take place.</p>
               <p>If God had no good end to answer by the sin of man, he would have taken eff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ctual care to keep him from sin: But as he intended to make this evil the occasion of so much good, he <hi>willingly</hi> suffer'd it to take place. <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>GOD doubtless sought a GOOD in his determination to permit sin. And if this was not a good, which he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make sin the occasion of, and which could not be so well answer'd any other way, and <hi>for the sake of which</hi> he permitted it; then he permitted it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s being <hi>in itself</hi> a good, and so <hi>for it's own sake.</hi> This doctrine therefore, that God permits sin for the sake of the good he will make it the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> so far from representing God as taking plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

"The wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ks of God are all very GOOD."
And another should object,
"that if so, then God is an EVIL being,"
he would talk with as much reason and propriety, as those who make the objection above.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>There is no inconsistence in supposing, that God may hate a thing as it is in itself, and consider'd simply as evil, and yet that it may be his will it should come to pass, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering all circumstances —God don't will sin as sin, or for the sake of any thing evil; though it be his pleasure so to order things, that he permitting, sin will come to pass, for the sake of the great good that by his disposal shall be the consequence. His willing to order things so that evil should come to pass, for the sake of the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good, is no argument that he don't hate evil, as evil: And if so, then it is no reason why he may'nt reasonably forbid evil as evil, and punish it as such.</q>

What reason then has the benevolent heart to sink and despond, though sin abounds and threatens to bear all down before it; and every thing is to his view in the utmost disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and confusion?

               <p>They who have a sincere regard for God's honor, and a tender concern for his church and interest in the world, need some special support in dark and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil times.

It seems strange that such persons can be ignorant that they are the <hi>very successors</hi> of those, who made the objection St. <hi>Paul</hi> is confront<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in our text; and are risen up in <hi>their stead,</hi> to oppose <hi>Christ</hi> and his apostles. That they may be sensible of this, and that such language, which militates so directly against all God's ways to a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful world, may be no more heard, and their mouths effectually stopped, is what I am now endeavouring.</p>
               <p>I hope therefore, I shall have the <hi>serious</hi> and <hi>close</hi> attention of all my hearers, while I endeavour to confirm and illustrate this truth, and set it in as clear and striking a light as I am able.</p>
               <p>And I shall attempt this by calling in the united help both of <hi>scripture</hi> and <hi>reason.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>FIRST, I desire it may be observed, that the truth of this proposition is clearly and abundantly taught in <hi>scripture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>holy bible,</hi> the <hi>best</hi> of books, the best, and <hi>only</hi> infallible guide to us fallen creatures, in this dark, sinful world, in these important matters, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords us sufficient light and help in the point before us: And therefore in enquiring into it, I shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to keep your eyes on <hi>this book,</hi> and build all my arguments upon it. <hi>To the law and to the testimony: If they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.</hi> (Isai. viii.20.)</p>
               <p>The scripture not only teaches us in general, that sin is most <hi>unreasonable,</hi> and altogether <hi>inexcusable</hi>; most offensive to God, and of most dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, pernicious and destructive to those who
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:012812_0017_0F8ABAACA4D20680"/>
commit it: I say, it not only teaches this; but also, that <hi>those very instances</hi> of sin, which have been the occasion of the greatest good, were, at the same time, very offensive and provoking to God, and brought his awful judgments upon those who were guilty of it; and in many instances proved the means of their destruction.</p>
               <p>What says, the scripture of the sin of <hi>Ioseph</hi>'s brethren?—Though God <hi>meant it unto good,</hi> and it was the occasion of so much good, their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, which was the <hi>candle of the Lord,</hi> God's witness in their breasts, accused them of guilt, and charg'd it home upon them, when they were in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tress. (<hi>Gen.</hi> xlii.21, 22.) And even after they saw and shared in some of the great good that came of this evil, they don't excuse themselves for what they had done; neither did their father <hi>Iacob,</hi> to his dying day, excuse them. But the guilt of this sin, still lies on their consciences; and they, by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of <hi>Iacob</hi> their father (which is as though God had directed them) go and confess their sin to <hi>Ioseph,</hi> and ask his forgivness. (<hi>Gen.</hi> l.15, 16, 17.) And though <hi>Ioseph</hi> forgave them, so far as he had any c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ncern with it; yet he plainly intimates, that they were very guilty in God's sight, and must have pardon of him, or they would be undone. (See verses 19, 20, 21.) <hi>And Ioseph said to his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, fear not: For am I in the place of God?</hi> &amp;c. As if he had said,
"Fear no evil from <hi>me</hi>; I shall not take vengeance on you, for your injurious treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of me; I will not put myself in God's place: Vengeance belongeth unto God, and therefore I will not avenge myself. But you had need to see to it that your peace is made with God, or you may expect to feel <hi>his</hi> vengeance."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="unknown:012812_0018_0F8ABAAD51D429C8"/>We have another instance of this in <hi>Pharoah.</hi> His sin, as we have heard, was the occasion of great good. Yet his conduct is represented as exceeding vile and criminal; most offensive and provoking to God, and that for which he was at last dreadfully destroyed.</p>
               <p>And the <hi>Iews</hi> putting our Lord <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> to death, which was the occasion of such infinite good, is represented as the most <hi>horrid</hi> crime, infinitely provoking to God, and of destructive consequence to them as a nation. Of <hi>Iudas,</hi> who had a great hand in this by betraying him unto them, our Lord says, <hi>It had been good for that man, if he had not been born.</hi> (Mat. xxvi.24.) His own conscience soon felt the weight of his crime; and in the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most horror he confess'd, <hi>he had sinned in betraying innocent blood</hi>; cast the money he had received as the reward of his iniquity, down in the temple, and went away and hang'd himself; and went <hi>straight</hi> to hell, which the scripture speaks of as <hi>his own place.</hi> (Act. i.25.) And there he now is, welter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in that burning lake, as a due reward for that horrid crime. It avails him nothing to plead,
"That thus it must be that the scripture might be fulfilled."
It does not in the least extenuate his crime, nor is it any relief to him, that the innocent blood which he betray'd, washes away the sin of the world, and has become the salvation of thous<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ds. And the Jews as a nation, by the hand they had in this, brought upon themselves the high displeasure of heaven, and most severe and awful judgments; which I have not room here particularly to mention.</p>
               <p>Thus we see that the sins of men, which, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to scripture, God over-rules for the greatest good, are at the same time exceeding criminal, and very provoking to God; and greatly expose men
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:012812_0018_0F8ABAAD51D429C8"/>
to God's wrath, and often bring it upon them. From which it appears, that God being judge, sin's becoming the occasion of the <hi>greatest good,</hi> does not at all extenuate or lessen the crime; or render those that commit it <hi>the less</hi> guilty, or afford any excuse to them; and therefore, that there is not from hence the least encouragement to sin. We here see how God looks upon the matter, and how he will treat men in such cases: And we are sure his judgment is according to truth; and consequently, that the proposition we are upon, is true. Therefore they who think that if good comes of sin, so far sin is excusable, and there is no harm or danger in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting it, are under a great and sad delusion.</p>
               <p>But, if it be needful, yet farther light may be offer'd, in this matter, from the <hi>holy scripture.</hi> This will appear to all that will observe, That 'tis the <hi>vileness</hi> and <hi>inexcusable criminalness</hi> of sin, and the <hi>ill-desert</hi> of the sinner that is the <hi>very occasion,</hi> in many instances, of its answering the good end it does, according to the account the <hi>bible</hi> gives of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. So that if the sin was in any degree excusable, and did not render the person that is guilty of it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely ill deserving, and so justly expose him to the dreadful wrath of God, it could not answer the good end it does. This is plain, because the good end that sin answers, in many instances, is the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play of God's glory, by his pouring out his wrath on the sinner, and punishing him for it.—We have an instance of this in <hi>Pharoah.</hi> One great and good end answer'd by his sin, was by God's taking occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion thereby to shew his power, and cause his name to be declared th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ughout all the earth, by pouring out his wrath on <hi>Pharoah,</hi> for his sin: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if <hi>Pharoah</hi> had not <hi>deserved</hi> this wrath for his sin, this end could not have been answer'd by it.
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:012812_0019_0F8ABAAE11137D90"/>
So we are told (<hi>Rom.</hi> ix.22.) that the great good that is answer'd by sinners obstinacy and final im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitence, is by God's shewing his wrath, and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his power known in punishing them eternally for their wickedness. <hi>What if God willing to shew his wrath, and make his power known,</hi> &amp;c. If sin was not infinitely criminal, and did not render those guilty of it infinitely ill-deserving, it would not <hi>fit</hi> them for that destruction in which God shews his wrath, and makes his power known.</p>
               <p>Surely all will see how, in this case, the scripture unites the <hi>ill-desert</hi> of the sinner, and his destruction for sin, with the good end answer'd by it; <hi>unites</hi> them, I say, so that they cannot be seperated. So that to say, sin's answering a good end, renders it excusable and harmless, is expresly, in words, to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate what God has joined together: Yea, things which are, in their own nature, inseperably united, so as necessarily to imply each other. If God's glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying himself by punishing sin, renders sin harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, and not deserving of punishment; then here is the <hi>greatest contradiction.</hi> For if sin deserves no punishment, God cannot glorify himself in punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. So that, according to this, by the good end's being answer'd, it is at the same time, <hi>by it's being answer'd,</hi> absolutely defeated and <hi>not answered.</hi>
               </p>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ntradiction and absurdity is such a notion as this, viz. That if sin is the occasion of good, it deserves no punishment. And 'tis direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contrary to those scriptures which represent the ill-desert of sin as essential, in order to answer the good end it does; and teach, that sin becomes the occasion of good, in many inst<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ces, by it's render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men the proper subjects of divine wrath: Which it could not do, if it's being the occasion of good, render'd it harmless, and men excusable for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="unknown:012812_0019_0F8ABAAE11137D90"/>But tho' the scripture is thus clear and express in this mater, yet there may be some, who don't see into the <hi>reason</hi> of it: They cannot see, why sin's being the occasion of so much good, does not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present it as harmless, and afford encouragement to sin, that those good ends may be answer'd. I shall therefore,</p>
               <p>SECONDLY, give the REASONS of it, and shew <hi>why it is so</hi>: Still directing your eye to the <hi>holy scripture,</hi> as our help and guide.</p>
               <p>And here I ask your attention to the following particulars:</p>
               <p n="1">I. The good ends answer'd by sin, is no excuse for it, nor does in the least extenuate it's guilt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause sin is still the same in it's own nature, as if it answer'd no good end. Sin, as it consists in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to truth and reason, and the law of God, is in it's <hi>own nature</hi> most unreasonable, ugly and hateful, and therefore criminal and inexcusable; and the consequences of it, whether good or bad, alter not the <hi>nature</hi> of it. Tho' sin be the occasion of never so much good, yet 'tis in it's own nature a contradiction to truth and reason; and therefore is in itself odious, vile and criminal. Sin is therefore, consider'd in it's own nature, as consisting in the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable</hi> disposition, views and aims of the sinner, infinitely hateful to God; and he is at an infinite distance from feeling any temptation or encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to it. And therefore all the good God brings out of sin, does not in the least abate his hatred of it, or make him look upon it a whit the less cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal; and consequently does not at all abate his anger at the sinner, and disposition to punish for sin. And if men looked upon things in this light (as they do, so far as they see the truth) and had an answerable disposition of mind, they would not hate
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:012812_0020_0F8ABAAECCE06EB8"/>
sin the less, because of the good that 'tis the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of, or imagine themselves at all the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusable therefor on this account. Moreover,</p>
               <p n="2">II. It is not owing to any <hi>good tendency</hi> in sin, in itself consider'd, that it becomes the occasion of good. As sin's being made the occasion of good, does not change the nature of it, so neither does it alter it's natural tendency. The natural tendency of sin, is to the greatest evil; it is big with infinite mischief. Sin aims and tends to dishonour God, and dethrone him; to fill the world with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most disorder, confusion and misery; yea, even to spoil and destroy the universe: So as to make the whole, both creator and creatures, infinitely worse than nothing. Sin <hi>tends</hi> to make God infinitely dishonourable, and infinitely miserable, and would <hi>actually do so,</hi> if God was not able to prevent it. And it tends to make the creature eternally miserable, and it's tendency to this is so great and strong, that this would be the infallible consequence, if God did not interpose and prevent.</p>
               <p>Now, God's over-ruling this, which tends to so much evil, which has an unalterable and almost infinite tendency to infinite evil, does not make this tendency to evil a whit more excusable, or the less vile and mischievous, as it is in itself; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in no degree removes the guilt and ill-desert of it. No thanks to sin, that any good comes of it: This is no argument in it's favour, as it is not owing to it's harmlesness or good tendency in itself, but to the over-ruling hand of God, who by his infinite wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and unconquerable power, turns that to good, which in itself tends only to evil, and is full of dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poison.</p>
               <p>If the conduct of a man towards his neighbour, has a most direct tendency in itself to hurt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:012812_0020_0F8ABAAECCE06EB8"/>
him, tho' the mischief is prevented by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-ruling providence of God, or the kind interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of some wise and able friend; yea, is by such interposition turn'd into the greatest good to him; this does not render such conduct in any degree the more harmless or excusable, or in the least lessen the guilt and ill-desert of it. This truth I suppose every one discerns, who is come to the years of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, it being a plain dictate of common sense: And I see no difficulty in applying it to the case before us. If the person's conduct toward his neighbour, so full of mischief, and tending direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to his ruin, looks not the better in itself, and is not in the least more excusable, for it's being over-ruled to the good of his neighbour; then surely, the good which God brings out of sin, affords no excuse for sin, which is in it's own nature and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, infinitely mischievous, and full of deadly evil. I proceed to observe,</p>
               <p n="3">III. As sin, in it's own nature and tendency, is as odious, vile and mischievous, as if no good came of it; so the disposition, aim and end of the sinner, is as hateful and vile, as contrary to God and all good, as if no good came of the sin he commits.</p>
               <p>As sin in its own nature tends to mischief, so the sinner, who is the author of it, aims at that which is unreasonable, mischievous and destructive. If the sinner could have his will, none of the good which God brings out of sin would follow, but all the mischief imaginable. St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, "The carnal mind is ENMITY against God. (<hi>Rom.</hi> viii.7.) The disposition of the sinner, the whole bent of his mind is in opposition to God, and his glory, and all the good that God is seeking. Now the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position and aim of the sinner is not the better, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause God prevents the mischief sought taking place,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:012812_0021_0F8ABAAF8B9CC358"/>
and turns all into good; but the sinner's disposition and end in what he does, is as vile, inexcusable and deserving of God's wrath, as if no good had fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed.</p>
               <p>Thus, <hi>Ioseph</hi>'s brethren <hi>thought evil against their brother</hi>; and were disposed to injure him. They car'd not for his welfare, but aim'd to put him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a state of servitude and misery, and thus prevent his dreams coming to pass. Therefore their dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition and aim in what they did, was most unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable, and contrary to God's design, and so to all that good, which their selling him was the means of. And now, who can have a better thought of the conduct of <hi>Ioseph</hi>'s brethren, or esteem their crime in selling him at all the less, because of the good which God brought out of it, so contrary to their intentions.</p>
               <p>We are not wont, in the least to excuse men for their bad designs, and their attempts to do mischief, because they are not able to bring their designs to pass; and the mischief they aim at and attempt to do, does not actually follow. Yea, if their disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and endeavour to do mischief, is the occasion of good; this don't excuse them in our view.</p>
               <p>One <hi>Verenus</hi> gave his neighbour a dose of poison, with an intent to take away his life; and thought he had effected what he aimed at: But, contrary to his expectation and desire, by means of the skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful application of an able physician, the poisonous dose did him no hurt; but on the contrary, became the mean<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of removing a dangerous disease he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour'd under, and so of lengthening out his life many years. But no thanks to <hi>Verenus</hi> for all this: Not one was found, who excused him on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the good his neighbour had received. No, the whole heighbourhood cried out of him as a
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:012812_0021_0F8ABAAF8B9CC358"/>
                  <hi>guilty, murderous wretch.</hi> And verily in this they spoke the common sense of all mankind; for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-sense teaches mankind, in judging how far any one is criminal, not to determine this so much by what is the <hi>consequence</hi> of what he has done, but by the <hi>deed itself</hi> which he has done, and his aim and design therein. <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>And if sin is in its own nature, as ugly and hateful; and in its own natural tendency, as pernicious and destructive to the universe; and the disposition of the sinner is as vile and criminal, as contrary to God and all good, as if no good came of it: Then there is as much reason why it should be hated, detested and abhor'd; why we should be asham'd of it, humbled for it, and renounce it for ever, as if God did not over-rule it for good. And in this, GODLY SORROW essentially consists· Let the <hi>christian</hi> consult his own heart, and he will doubtless find, that 'tis in <hi>this view</hi> of sin he repents, and lies in the dust before God.</p>
                     <p>Therefore, whatever GOOD comes of sin, it tends not in the least to prevent <hi>godly sorrow,</hi> as some have imagined.</p>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p n="4">IV. Though every sin is made the occasion of great good, yet this affords not the least encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to sin; because all do not share in this good; and no one that lives in allowed sin, has any evidence that it will be the occasion of good to him; but has reason greatly to fear the contrary.</p>
               <p>There are multitudes to whom sin is never the occasion of any good; but it proves to them an infinite evil, even their eternal undoing. They are not the better for all the good that God brings out of sin. They have no benefit of the good which their own sins are the occasion of; but sin proves to them (what it is in itself, and in its natural ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency) infinitely mischievous and destructive.</p>
               <p>Thus it was to <hi>Pharoah.</hi> His wickedness was the occasion of great good; but he had none of the benefit of it. His sin was as pernicious and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive to him, as if it had answer'd no good end
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:012812_0022_0F8ABAB13B490468"/>
at all. This was the occasion of his dreadful over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw, and no doubt, of his eternal perdition. This was the case with <hi>Iudas:</hi> He shar'd in none of the good his sin was the occasion of, but perished in his wickedness. And this is true of every finally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent sinner. They see not when good comes, and have no part or lot in this matter; but by their sin become <hi>vessels of wrath fitted to destruction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And no one that allows himself in sin, has any evidence that this will not be his case. Such have no reason to determine but that every sin they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit will cost them infinitely dear, as they may suffer God's wrath for it to all eternity. And this they have all reason to fear and expect, as the way of allowed sin is the way to destruction; as really so, as if sin never answer'd any good end. Yea, they know not but the <hi>next sin</hi> they commit will be their eternal undoing, as it may provoke God to swear in his wrath, that they shall never enter into his rest; to give them up to inevitable ruin.</p>
               <p>Seeing then, the way of sin is the way to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, and none that allow themselves in sin have any evidence, or any reason to expect, that sin will turn to their good; but have the greatest reason to fear and expect the contrary; they have no encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to sin, because God does over-rule all sin so as to make it the occasion of good: For what is this to them, so long as, so far as appears, they are like to have no part nor lot in it? Yea,</p>
               <p n="5">V. They are in the utmost danger of having sin become an unspeakably greater evil to them, than if God had not made it the occasion of so much good.</p>
               <p>What God has done to bring good out of the evil of sin, makes sin vastly more dreadful to those that continue in it, than it would have been had not God done this. Their having the offers of salvation by
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:012812_0022_0F8ABAB13B490468"/>
Christ, in consequence of this, will render their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance in sin much more dreadful than otherwise it would be. And the good that sin is the occasion of by being a means of God's glory, and the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the happiness of the blessed, will greatly ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate their misery who continue in sin; and make it of vastly more awful consequence to them, than if none of this good had been brought out of sin.</p>
               <p>This is evident; for the more God is glorified, the more his perfections are discovered to intelligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, the more miserable they <hi>must</hi> be, who are doom'd to the eternal hatred and anger of this God; for the more they see of God, the more dreadful his wrath will be to them. And the more happiness the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed enjoy, the more sensible the damned will be of what they have lost by sin; and consequently the more miserable.</p>
               <p>Satan will doubtless be eternally more miserable, than if God had not taken occasion, by his introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing sin into the world to glorify himself, and make this a better world than it was before. So all men that continue in sin to final impenitence, will be more miserable, the more good their sin is made the occasion of: So that this will be not only no good to them, but an infinite evil.</p>
               <p>Now surely, that which makes the continuance in sin infinitely more dreadful than otherwise it would have been, gives it a more deadly sting, and so makes it more dangerous and awful, can be no encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to continuance in sin; but on the contrary, the greatest imaginable discouragement.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. God's bringing the greatest good out of the evil of sin, gives no encouragement or licence to sin, because the method God has taken to do this is so contriv'd, that at the same time it makes sin the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of good, it serves to shew the infinite hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:012812_0023_0F8ABAB32AA80370"/>
and ill-desert of sin, and the awful consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of it to the impenitent sinner.</p>
               <p>The greatest good that comes by sin, is brought about by the sufferings and death of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> the son of God. In this way the serpent's head is bruised, the works of the devil are destroyed, man is saved and God is glorified. The death of <hi>Christ</hi> redeems the world, and is the foundation of the new creation, which so much exceeds the old, by which the world is so much better and more glorious than it would have been if sin had never enter'd. Now by the sufferings and death of Christ, God has dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered his hatred of sin, his inflexible resolution to punish it, and the dreadfulness of his wrath, and so the awful consequence of perishing in sin, and set them in a most clear and striking light. God has shewed his strict and awful justice, his inflexible re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution to punish sin; so that he will <hi>by no means clear the guilty,</hi> by punishing his own son, when he espoused the cause of sinners, and stood in their place. And in the sufferings of the son of God, is shewn the dreadfulness of God's wrath; and so the awful consequence of continuing in sin: <hi>For if these things are done in the green tree, what will be done in the dry?</hi> Thus God has contriv'd that the very method he has taken to bring infinite good out of sin, should be above any thing else a means of discovering how infinitely hateful and criminal sin is; and how certain and awful is the punishment of it: And so exhibit the greatest discouragement to sin, and the strongest motives to holiness.</p>
               <p>God has given a more bright and affecting ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation to the world, of his hatred of sin; of the infinite ill-desert of it, and how destructive to the impenitent sinner, in the death of Christ, than could have been given in any other way. And
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:012812_0023_0F8ABAB32AA80370"/>
now, how can God's thus making sin the occasion of good, be any excuse for sin, or afford the least encouragement to it? Surely, every considerate person must own, that G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>'s <hi>thus</hi> bringing good out of sin, is so far from rendering sin excusable, or affording any encouragement to it; that hereby he has render'd sin <hi>most inexcusable,</hi> and done that, which tends above any thing else, to deter men from it.</p>
               <p>Mankind have now, as I may say, infinitely more to teach them God's hatred of sin, and the infinite punishment it deserves, the certainty of God's pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing it, and the dreadfulness of his wrath, than they would have had, had he not redeem'd the world by Christ. And does this encourage men in sin? Surely no—nothing could have been better contrived to make men <hi>stand in awe, and sin not.</hi> The grace of <hi>God</hi> that brings salvation from sin, and makes sin, the means of infinite good by the death of Christ, is so far from giving the least encouragement to sin, that it in the strongest manner, teaches men to deny all ungodliness, and every worldly lust, and to live soberly, righteously and godly in this present world. (<hi>Tit.</hi> ii.12.)</p>
               <p n="7">VII. The good that God brings out of sin, can be no encouragement to commit sin, because as far as a man is inclined to sin, <hi>so far</hi> his heart is oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to that good which God brings out of sin: And on the other hand, as far as a person delights in, and has a heart to seek and promote that good which God brings out of sin, <hi>so far</hi> he has a heart to hate and forsake sin, and practise holiness.</p>
               <p>It is therefore one of the greatest contradictions to suppose, that the good which God brings out of sin, should be an inducement or encouragement to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit sin. For this is for a man to take encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:012812_0024_0F8ABAB34C734950"/>
to commit sin, from holy views and ends; or to love and choose sin, out of love to holiness: Which surely is the greatest absurdity and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction imaginable. 'Tis the same as to say, the more holy a man is, the more he is inclin'd to sin; or the more he is like God, the more he resembles the devil!</p>
               <p>The good that God brings out of sin, suits and pleases his heart; and therefore 'tis a good, agreable to infinite holiness, as what that acquiesces in and seeks. And as far as men are pleased with, value and seek that good; <hi>so far</hi> they are conform'd to infinite holiness, i. e. are themselves so far holy: And therefore so far hate sin, and renounce it: <hi>So far</hi> they are dead to sin, sin is destroyed in them. Now, what a contradiction is it to say that <hi>that</hi> which destroys sin, and roots it out of the heart, is at the same time a motive and encouragement to sin; So far as a man sincerely desires and seeks the good which God brings out of sin, as what suits his heart; so far he acts from right motive, and a right end: And therefore so far <hi>is right,</hi> i. e. in the exercise of holiness; and consequently so far hates and renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces sin, yea <hi>cannot sin.</hi> How then can this promote sin, and be an encouragement to it?</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> argues in this manner, in answer to the same question we are upon. (<hi>Rom.</hi> vi.1, 2.) <hi>What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound? God forbid!</hi> (says he) <hi>How shall we that are dead to sin, live any longer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in?</hi> Q. D. "This is an absolute impossibility. So far as you see and seek the glory of God in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of his grace; so far you are dead to sin, sin is kill'd and destroy'd in you: For the nature and tendency of sin is to dishonour God, and abuse and trample on his grace. How then can we that are
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:012812_0024_0F8ABAB34C734950"/>
                  <hi>dead</hi> to sin, as we are, if we desire God's glory in the exercise of his grace, <hi>live</hi> any longer therein? This would be to seek to destroy the very thing, we are at the same time seeking to promote; which is the greatest contradiction. As well may we talk of a dead man's performing the functions of life: Yea, as well may the actions of <hi>life</hi> spring from <hi>death,</hi> as their foundation and cause; and so a man <hi>live, purely</hi> because he is <hi>dead.</hi>—</p>
               <p>The carnal mind, the heart of the sinner, is enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty against God; and so is an enemy to the glory of God, and that happiness which consists in holiness, which God makes sin the occasion of. The heart of the sinner, I say, desires not this good, but is an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy to it; and consequently the sinner never does any thing with a true design and desire to promote it. Therefore, though sin is the means of promoting this good; yet this neither is, nor can be any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement to a man to commit sin; unless a man can desire to promote that which he hates, and is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all things averse to; and out of a sincere desire to promote it, does that, which has a most direct ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to the contrary, and is the most perfect exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of enmity against it.</p>
               <p>Thus we see it is absolutely impossible in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of things, that a man should do evil that good may come; or commit sin, that he may promote that good which God makes sin the occasion of: And therefore impossible in the nature of things, that the good which God brings out of sin, should be any encouragement to sin. Because so far as any one is a friend to that good, and desires and seeks it; so far he is an enemy to sin, and necessarily avoids it: And so far as he is disposed to sin, and loves it; so far he pays no regard to the good God brings out of it; but is an enemy to it. If therefore any one pretends,
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:012812_0025_0F8ABAB40C7D53A0"/>
that he does evil that good may come of it; that the good which God brings out of sin is a motive and encouragement to him to commit sin; we are sure it is <hi>only a pretence,</hi> and <hi>cannot</hi> be true: But he commits sin, because he loves it, and seeks a good which is opposite to that which God seeks in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting sin.</p>
               <p>Joseph's brethren, being enemies to the fulfilment of his dreams, which God design'd to bring about by means of their selling him, could not be induced and encouraged to sell him for a slave, from a view of answering this end. No, they aim'd at some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing directly contrary to this; and if they had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, they sold him into slavery, out of a desire that his dreams might be fulfilled; <hi>Ioseph</hi> would have known it was a piece of gross hypocrisy. For if they had desired his dreams should come to pass, they would have lov'd him, and been tender of him; and therefore would have had no heart to exercise that cruelty towards him, they were guilty of.</p>
               <p>This may be further illustrated (if it is not plain enough already) in the instance of <hi>Pharoah.</hi> It was impossible that he should do as he did, if he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd and sought the good God intended to answer by him. If he had desir'd that God's name should be glorified, and his church and people be safe and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, he would not have refused to hearken to the GOD of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> nor trample on his authority, and bid defiance to him as he did; but would have cheerfully obeyed all his commands. And he would not have oppressed <hi>Israel</hi> as he did: And therefore it was not possible he should commit the sin he did, with a design and desire that this good might come of it. No he was an enemy to that good which God design'd; and therefore <hi>acted</hi> like an enemy, and committed the great wickedness he did.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="unknown:012812_0025_0F8ABAB40C7D53A0"/>And this is the case with all that live in sin. They love sin, and commit it, because they are ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the good which God brings out of sin. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make them friends to that good, and their aims and designs conformable to God's, and this will cure them of allowing themselves in sin, and make them renounce it forever. Therefore, I say, it is absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impossible that a man should allow himself in sin, that good may come of it; (I mean the good that God designs by sin.) And therefore whatever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences any may make to this, we may be sure it is not so.—</p>
               <p>Indeed, men aim at and seek GOOD, in all the sin they commit. Something, which appears to them to be good; which they aim to obtain by sin, is always the motive and inducement to sin. But this is always a good, which is not only of a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent kind from that which God seeks, but directly contrary to it.</p>
               <p>But here the following question may arise in the minds of some, viz.</p>
               <p>QUEST. If God <hi>permits</hi> sin for the sake of the good he brings out of it; and so aims at this good in <hi>permitting</hi> sin: Why may not men aim at the <hi>same</hi> good in <hi>committing</hi> sin; and so sin for the same end for which God permits it? How can it be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for a man to aim at the same thing in <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting</hi> sin, that God aims at in <hi>permitting</hi> it?</p>
               <p>ANS. That this <hi>cannot be,</hi> is owing to the nature of sin itself. 'Tis because sin is what it is; viz. <hi>An opposition to God in his ways, his inclinations, ends and designs.</hi> In this, sin essentially consists; even in the opposition of men's hearts, in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations and ends, to God's inclination and designs. Therefore, when it is ask'd, Why a man cannot commit sin, for the same end, for which God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:012812_0026_0F8ABAB4CDF9D9B0"/>
it? It is just the same as to ask, Why a man may not have the <hi>same</hi> end and design that God has, in that <hi>very</hi> act which consists in <hi>opposing</hi> God's aims and designs? That is, Why a man's aims and designs may not be the same with God's, which at the same time are perfectly contrary thereto? Which is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to ask, Why the most perfect contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may not be consistent?</p>
               <p>The more men's inclinations, ends and designs, are conformable to God's, and the more they see what the inclination of God's heart is, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand his ends and designs; the more they are pleas'd with them and with all God's ways, and the more they see God's wisdom in permitting sin: And therefore, the more pleas'd they are with his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting sin, for the ends he does. But this is so far from making them <hi>like sin,</hi> or <hi>love</hi> it, and be well-pleased with it; that the more they are pleas'd with God's conduct in permitting sin, the more they hate sin, the more contrary it is to their hearts. God is infinitely holy in permitting sin: And the more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men are, and so, the more they hate sin, the more well-pleas'd they are with God's permitting sin, and the more they fall in with his designs herein.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Paul,</hi> now in heaven, approves of, and is pleas'd with God's permitting sin, for the sake of the good he makes it the occasion of, in a much higher degree than when on earth. He is <hi>perfectly</hi> pleas'd with it now. And the more he is pleas'd with it, and falls in with God's ends and designs herein, the further he is from sinning, and the more impossible it is that he should be guilty of it.</p>
               <p>Thus I have endeavoured to lay before you, my hearers, the evidence of the proposition I undertook to prove. And now leave it with every one of you to judge for yourselves; Whether there is not evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:012812_0026_0F8ABAB4CDF9D9B0"/>
enough from scripture and reason, abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to convince every honest, attentive mind, that sin's being the occasion of the greatest good, affords no excuse for sin: And whether it has not been now even <hi>demonstrated,</hi> that this can give no encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to sin.</p>
               <p>I have dwelt the longer on this point, because I think it of importance that it should be well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood. May the great head of the church grant that we all <hi>may be filled with the knowledge of his will, in all wisdom and spiritual understanding</hi>; that we <hi>may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect will of God:</hi> And so have a heart to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand and approve all God's ways.

                  <head>IMPROVEMENT.</head>
                  <p>The view we have had of this subject opens the way to the following remarks.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="47" facs="unknown:012812_0027_0F8ABAB58EA54868"/>REMARK I. <hi>God's holiness is exercised even in the permission of sin.</hi> God's permitting sin was as high an exercise of holiness, as any we can think of. This remark is grounded on what has been observ'd and prov'd, viz. That sin is the occasion of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting the greatest good of the universe.</p>
                  <p>The holiness of God primarily consists in LOVE, or benevolence to himself, and to the creature; in the exercise of which, he seeks his own glory, and the happiness of the creature: Or, in one word, he seeks the good of the UNIVERSE, as comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both creator and creatures. And <hi>this</hi> God aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at and sought in permitting sin, as much as in any act whatever; and therefore this was an exercise of holiness, even to permit sin. For God permitted sin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he saw that this was the best way to promote this end, and accomplish the highest good of the universe.</p>
                  <p>If this was not the case; if there is not, on the whole, more good in the universe, than there would have been, if God had not permitted sin to enter into the world; then it cannot be shewn, how it is consistent with God's holiness to permit sin. But if this is the case, as the scripture represents it to be; then the permission of sin is not only <hi>consistent</hi> with God's holiness, but God's <hi>not permitting</hi> it would be inconsistent with holiness: For not to permit sin in this case, would be to neglect and slight the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est good, and prefer it to a less; which is inconsist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with true love to the universe. The permission of sin therefore is so far from being inconsistent with God's holiness, that his holiness influenced him to permit sin, and herein is eminently exercised, and gloriously manifested.</p>
                  <p>OBJ. But God could not permit sin out of love to ALL; for sin certainly is not for the good of <hi>all,</hi> but proves the eternal ruin of multitudes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="48" facs="unknown:012812_0028_0F8ABAB6A2158278"/>ANS. The greatest good of the <hi>whole,</hi> may be inconsistent with the good of every <hi>individual.</hi> God seeks the greatest good of the <hi>whole:</hi> This his holiness, his love to himself and the creation, leads him to. It does not follow that there is, on the whole, less good in the universe by means of sin; because <hi>some,</hi> yea, a great number are eternally miserable by it. Notwithstanding this, God may be more glorified; yea, there may be more happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness among creatures, than if sin had never taken place. For though sin is the means of the eternal misery of many, yet it may be the means of increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the happiness of others to so great a degree, as that, upon the whole, there shall be more happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, than if there had been no sin. <note n="§" place="bottom">If this is a <hi>paradox</hi> to the reader, he may find this matter illustrated, and set in a <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>rational</hi> view by the Rev. Mr. <hi>Bellamy,</hi> in his sermons on <hi>The wisdom of God i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>OBJ. But where is the <hi>justice</hi> of making a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber miserable, in order to promote the good of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; even though we grant there is, upon the whole, more good than if there had been no sin?</p>
                  <p>ANS. They who are made miserable by sin, are <hi>justly</hi> miserable. Sin is their own fault; and for it they deserve eternal destruction: And therefore God does them no wrong in casting them into hell; they have but their desert. And the good that sin is the means of to others, does not alter the case as to them, and make their misery unjust. We may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to this case the words of St. <hi>Paul</hi> (Rom. xi.22.) Here we may <hi>behold the goodness and severity of God</hi>: On them which fall into destruction, <hi>seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>; but on them which are saved, <hi>goodness.</hi> God exercises <hi>severity</hi> towards some; but it is a <hi>just seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>: 'Tis <hi>as just</hi> as if no good came to others by means of sin.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="49" facs="unknown:012812_0028_0F8ABAB6A2158278"/>Let none then object against God's permitting sin, as if it was inconsistent with his holiness; as if it made him the author of sin, and representing him as delighting in sin, &amp;c. For it is most evident to those who will impartially consider the matter, that God's holiness is as much exercised, and as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally appears in his permitting sin, as in any of his conduct whatsoever.</p>
                  <p>If any should here say, that I mistake the matter; that these objections are not made against God's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting sin. This is a <hi>fact</hi> that none can dispute: And all must grant, God may permit sin and yet be holy. God had a right to permit sin, as he was by no means obliged to withhold all his creatures from sinning. I say, if any should talk in this form, I would ask, what it is then that they object against, as inconsistent with God's holiness?</p>
                  <p>Do they object against God's permitting sin, <hi>for the sake of the good he saw he could make it the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of?</hi> Do they think <hi>this</hi> inconsistent with God's holiness, that he should aim at a good end in permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting sin? Surely none can think so; for God's holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in permitting sin <hi>consists</hi> in his aiming at, and seeking good thereby. So that God's permitting sin for the sake of the good that should come thereby, is so far from being inconsistent with his holiness, that it is the <hi>very thing</hi> in which his holiness is exercised in permitting sin: And if he could permit sin, and aim at and seek no good thereby; there would be no holiness in permitting sin: Yea, it would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent with holiness.</p>
                  <p>To say, That God's seeking good by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sin, is inconsistent with his holiness, is the same as to say, That God's exercising holiness, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Is God's DETERMINING to permit sin the thing that is inconsistent with holiness? Are there any who allow that God may permit sin, and be wise and holy in so doing; but at the same time imagine his <hi>determining</hi> to permit sin is inconsistent with his holiness, makes him the author of the sin he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines to permit?—</p>
                  <p>One would think, none could make a difficulty of this, and think and talk in this form, if this did not seem to be <hi>actually</hi> the case with some. They make great objections against <hi>something</hi>; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present it as a horrible doctrine, inconsistent with God's holiness, making him the author of sin, and what not!

They own God has actually permitted sin; but will not believe God ever <hi>determined</hi> to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> it; because this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects on his moral character, and makes him the author of sin.</p>
                  <p>To remove this difficulty therefore, I would say a few words;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> I would ask, Whether any can possibly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of God's permitting sin, without <hi>determining</hi> to permit it? Surely God determines to do, all he does. Therefore to say, God did not determine to permit sin, is the same as to say, He did not permit sin. If then God has permitted sin, he certainly <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined</hi> to permit it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> If God had a right to permit sin, and is wise and holy in so doing; then he had a right to
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:012812_0029_0F8ABAB70B806988"/>
                     <hi>determine</hi> to permit sin, and is wise and holy in deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining to permit it. If any piece of conduct, is, in itself proper and wise; then <hi>determining</hi> to conduct so, cannot be wrong. Therefore to say, That God's determining to permit sin is not wise and holy, is to say, That <hi>permitting</hi> sin is not wise and holy. For there can be no harm in determining to do that, in doing which there is no harm: But on the contrary, a determination to do that which is w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>e and holy, is a wise and holy determination.</p>
                  <p>Some may perhaps think, I have not touch'd the difficulty there is in this matter yet. They believe God has permitted sin for wise and good ends, and therefore that he <hi>determin'd</hi> to permit it. But, they say, some hold that God DECREED to permit sin; and it is God's DECREE in this case, which they object against, as little better than blasphemy, as it seems to make God the author of sin.</p>
                  <p>To this I would say, I am willing to leave the word DECREE out of the question, and not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist upon it, or so much as mention it, as 'tis a word that is become hateful and frightful to many. They have, by some means or other, affixed such horrible ideas to it, that it cannot be used without giving them great disgust. I indeed suppose that to <hi>decree</hi> to permit sin, and to <hi>determine</hi> to permit it, is <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely</hi> one and the same thing; they being only two different words to denote one and the same idea. However, I am willing to drop the word <hi>decree,</hi> and have no contention about it. They who are recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to God's permitting sin, and his doing it for wise and good ends; and so believe that this is not inconsistent with his holiness; but that the permissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of sin is itself an exercise of infinite holiness; they consent to all I am endeavouring to make evident in this remark. And though they may be insensible
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:012812_0030_0F8ABABA25AA9FB8"/>
of it, they indeed consent to all that is implied in the doctrine of God's decreeing to permit sin. And what then is become of the frightful objection against the doctrine of God's decrees, as if it made God the author of sin, which we so often hear from great and small, learn'd and unlearn'd?—I trust, it cannot stand the test of scripture and reason; but being impartially examined, appears groundless and most absurd: Which I humbly think is in some measure manifest by what is said above.</p>
                  <p>The truth is, all this noise is, at bottom, made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God's <hi>permitting sin</hi>: By proving God's ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness in <hi>this</hi> therefore, the objection is wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molished. <note n="*" place="bottom">

                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is love to God, and love to man (<hi>Matth.</hi> xxvii.37, 38, 39.) Which love is principally exercised in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring and seeking God's glory and the good of man. But God in permitting sin, desired and sought his own glory and the good of man; and therefore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised the same disposition, that his law requires of man; and willed and chose the same thing, which he requires man to will and choose in his law. And therefore, the more a man obeys God's law, reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his word, the nearer conform'd he is to God's disposition and will, which he exercised in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sin.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="54" facs="unknown:012812_0031_0F8ABABACC3467A8"/>Now this being so 'tis a conclusive argument, that God's will in permitting sin, is the <hi>same,</hi> or perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly consistent with his will revealed in his law. For 'tis a maxim that never fails,
"That if any two things agree with a third, they also agree with one another."
If therefore the holiness of man, which is a conformity to God's law, is also a conformity to God's disposition and will exercised in permitting sin; then God's disposition and will in permitting sin, and his law, are conformable one to the other.</p>
                  <p>God's permission of sin was an act of benevolence to the universe, in which he sought the good of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in general. The sum of what God's law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of man, is benevolence to being in general. Therefore God's law is a true expression of his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position and will, which he exercised in permitting sin, and is indeed the <hi>very same</hi> will expressed and revealed, requiring man to conform thereto. Or thus—</p>
                  <p>God seeks his own glory and the good of the creature, in permitting sin; and so his permitting sin is an exercise of holiness. But if God's dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and will exercised in the permission of sin, is a holy disposition and will; then it must be agreeable to his revealed will, for that is a holy will. God's revealed will is but an expression of his holiness; and therefore 'tis but an expression of his holiness, which he exercised in permitting sin, which consisted in his disposition and will; and consequently is perfectly agreeable to it.</p>
                  <p>I trust my hearers see the force of this argument, which I am endeavouring to state. The argument cannot be got rid of, I think, but by denying that God seeks the general good of the universe in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting sin, which I trust none will do, who believe

                  <p>Well may we join with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and cry out, <hi>O the depth of the riches both of the knowledge and wisdom of God!</hi> Satan thought, when he had se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced man, he had gain'd his point; had disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and as it were out-done and over-match'd the Almighty, and spoiled, and rob'd him of the world he had made.

But <hi>he</hi> shall be wholly disappointed and defeated; and it shall appear in the end, that he has by this only been an instrument of promoting my great and good designs. Sin, which above all things, strikes at my throne; aims to dishonour me, and in its own nature has a direct tendency to spoil and ruin the works of my hands; and which is in itself infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely mischievous and hateful: Even this greatest and most deadly evil, I will make the special means of my own exaltation and honor. From <hi>this</hi> I will take occasion to fill the earth with my glory, and make it a much better world than it was before: And herein I will manifest and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play my <hi>infinite wisdom,</hi> to be matter of enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, wonder and admiration to millions, to all eternity.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And God by thus exalting and glorifying himself, and happifying the redeemed by means of sin, has at the same time <hi>condemned sin</hi>; shewn his hatred of it, and reveal'd his wrath against it: And set this in a far more convincing and striking light, than he would have done, if he had not thus brought good out of sin. This God has done, by bringing all this about by the sufferings and death of Christ. If the sinner had been saved without any satisfaction made to divine justice, and regard to the honor of God's law, which by sin was violated; sin would not have been suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently condemned; But the holy law of God would rather have been disgraced. In this therefore, there would have been no manifestation of God's holiness and hatred of sin. But by saving sinners, through the sufferings and death of <hi>Christ,</hi> God's justice and holiness shine brighter, than if there had never been any sin, or all sinners had been damned eternally.
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:012812_0032_0F8ABABB8D4B4260"/>
And God's hatred of sin, and love of righteousness, are set in the most advantageous light: And the evil nature of sin, and the infinitely dreadful conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of continuing in sin, appear in the clearest and most affecting view: Tending above all things to make men affraid of sin, and lead them to hate it, and renounce it for ever.</p>
                  <p>The gospel is so calculated to discourage sin and promote holiness, at the same time that it brings the greatest good out of sin; that whoever understands it, and believes the truth of it, is thereby transform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the holy image of God. (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> iii.18.) Thus the gospel is so far from encouraging sin, that 'tis the great instrument in the hand of God of turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men from sin to holiness. Yea, God hath so contriv'd things in the gospel, that it becomes the means of making men <hi>much more</hi> holy than they would have been, if they never had sinned; and it advances their happiness by discovering God's holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and promoting their's.</p>
                  <p>God has so contrived things, that sin is not only the occasion of displaying his holiness; but the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of <hi>more</hi> holiness in the creature, than if it had never taken place. How is satan disappointed and deleated herein! While his sin, and the sin which he introduced among mankind, is made the means of a most bright display of God's holiness; and of filling heaven with more holiness, and so with more happiness to all eternity, than otherwise there would have been.</p>
                  <p>How infinitely above all creatures in <hi>wisdom</hi> does God appear in this work! This is by way of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency, THE WISDOM OF GOD; as St. <hi>Paul</hi> stiles it (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> i.24.) Well may we then rejoice and glory in this gospel, and say with St. <hi>Paul</hi> (Rom. i.16, 17, 18.) <hi>I am not ashamed of the gospel of
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:012812_0033_0F8ABABC4D887270"/>
Christ: For therein is the righteousness of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed.</hi> And at the same time the sinner is saved from sin by faith in Christ, <hi>the wrath of God is,</hi> in the clearest manner, <hi>revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Into these things the angels desire to look. And 'tis <hi>here</hi> that they see and learn the <hi>manifold wisdom of God.</hi> (Eph. iii.10.)</p>
                  <p>Indeed, this is seen but <hi>in part</hi> now by angels and men. The more bright display of it will be made at the consummation of all things; when this work of God shall be brought to perfection, and the good that shall be brought out of sin, shall be seen in all its fulness and glory. And as the <hi>Iews,</hi> to whom the wickedness of <hi>Haman</hi> was the occasion of so much good, had their sorrow turn'd into joy, and their mourning into a good day,—and had many a day of feasting and joy upon this occasion: So shall <hi>this</hi> be the occasion of joy among millions, while they give all the praise and glory to the ONLY WISE GOD, through Jesus Christ, for ever and ever.</p>
                  <p>I shall in the next place improve this subject in <hi>expostulating</hi> a little with two sorts of persons.</p>
                  <p>FIRST, With those who will not allow that God makes sin the occasion of good, and that he did therefore permit sin, that he might bring good out of it, and say that such a doctrine gives a full licence, yea the greatest encouragement to sin. Such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, whenever they hear this doctrine taught, cry out of it as tending to encourage sin. They say,
"If this is true, then the best way is for all to sin as much as they can, that good may come of it; for the more sin the better, &amp;c."</p>
                  <p>If such persons well consider'd what has been said on this subject, I think they must be convinced of
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:012812_0033_0F8ABABC4D887270"/>
the gross and dangerous mistake they have made. And that this conviction may be fastned on the mind of every such one, I would offer the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things by way of expostulation.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. I intreat you to consider, how contrary to <hi>all reason</hi> this is.</p>
                  <p>It has been proved, I think, beyond all contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, That though sin is made the occasion of the greatest good; yea, though all things consider'd, there is more good in the universe than if sin had not enter'd: Yet this does not render sin at all the less criminal, or afford any excuse to it: But, on the contrary, it appears undeniably evident that God has taken such a method to bring good out of sin, that he has hereby exhibited to all intelligencies, the greatest possible discouragements to sin, and set it in a most odious and criminal light. Yea, it is evident to a demonstration, that it is in the nature of things absolutely impossible that any one should be induced to sin by the good that God brings out of it. And will you <hi>still</hi> go on to assert, that God's bringing good out of sin, is an encouragement to it, and gives full liberty to all to go on in sin?—If you do so, you must, so far as I can see, first lay aside your own reason and conscience; and will hereby prove that you are not to be <hi>reason'd</hi> with. For it is in vain to reason with men, who will pay no regard to reason.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. Consider how contrary this is to the <hi>holy scripture.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nothing is clearer in the bible, than that God brings good out of sin, and that God permits sin for the sake of the good he makes it the occasion of. The bible is built on this plan. In this consists the glorious work of redemption, which is the chief subject of the whole bible: In <hi>this</hi> the wisdom and

                     </gap>ppear, and are display'd; and on <hi>this</hi> all our well-grounded hopes are built: The great good we hope for, is a good, that is to be brought out of sin. And the bible teaches us, at the same time, how odious and criminal sin is, and offers the greatest discouragements to sin, and motives to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness. Our text is most directly against you. If you will carefu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ly read it over, you will find your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves pointed out, and expresly condemned in it. I don't see how you can well make a declaration more contrary to the bible, than <hi>this</hi> which is so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten found in your mouths. And it is quite evident that you cannot really like such a book as the bible is; however you may <hi>pretend,</hi> or even yourselves <hi>think</hi> you do.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. Such would do well to consider, how very dishonourable this is to GOD; yea, how <hi>directly</hi> they speak against him.</p>
                  <p>That sin is come into the world, and that the world is full of it, they cannot deny. But they will not allow that God permitted it; but it came in contrary to his will and design, as what he could not prevent. Or if he did permit it, they will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him to have any <hi>good end</hi> in permitting it; but he permitted sin, he knew not why, or rather for some bad end! For at the same time it would have been better if he had not permited it! And now he has permitted sin, out of no good end, or since sin has come into the world in spite of him, as he could not prevent it; they will not allow him, to make the <hi>best</hi> of it, and bring good out of it: Because, if he does so, he will excuse and justify the sinner, and give all imaginable encouragement to sin, and make himself unreasonable and unrighteous in forbidding and punishing it!</p>

                     </gap> God is this! Surely this is not the <hi>true</hi> GOD.—How impotent and weak, how contemptible is such a God! How disappointed, and unhappy, while outdone, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd and triumph'd over by his greatest enemy; and he not able to help himself! If things were so, they would be so far, just as the devil would have them. He would be glad to fill the world with sin, in spite of God: He would rejoice to have God's hands tied, so that he could not prevent sin. Or if he could prevent it, and so it must come in by his permission, he would have God permit it without proposing any good end in it; or without being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to answer any by it. The devil would be glad to have it so, that God could not bring any good out of sin, without at the same time encouraging sin, and excusing the sinner. Thus, this sets the devil up, as doing his will, at least on earth, and as having power above the almighty! Power to fill the world with sin and mischief, which God could not prevent! Or if he could, now he has suffer'd it to take place, can by no means help himself in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by making it answer some good end.</p>
                  <p>What mean and unworthy notions must such have of God! They degrade him almost as low as the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols of the <hi>heathen,</hi> which have eyes, but see not; hands, but handle not; feet, but walk not, &amp;c. They represent him, either as not seeing the bad consequences of sin, or unable to prevent them, tho' they were seen, or bring any good out of sin: And so as having, in a great degree, lost the world he had made!</p>
                  <p>God grant none of us may have such dishonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able thoughts of him! No,
"<hi>OUR</hi> GOD is in the heavens,—he hath done whatsoever he pleased. He doth according to his will in the army of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,

                     </gap> the inhabitants of the earth: And none can stay his hand, or say unto him, What doest thou? And those that walk in pride, he is able to abase."
He was infinitely able to keep sin out of the world he had made; and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly He <hi>permitted</hi> it to take place, and that because he saw it would be the occasion of the greatest good, an <hi>advantage</hi> to the universe. And he is continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally governing the world, and ordering all events so as to answer the great and good ends, he proposed in the permission of sin: And will in the end, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly accomplish all the purposes and desires of his heart. And at the same time he brings good out of sin, he more clearly discovers his hatred of sin, and it's desert, and exhibits greater discouragements to sin, and stronger motives to holiness, than if no good had been brought out of sin. The devil shall be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly and perfectly defeated and overthrown, with all finally impenitent sinners, and God shall be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified by all they have done; and elect angels and men shall reap advantages from it to all eternity. That SUCH a GOD reigns, may well be matter of joy to all: And let those who think and speak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, repent and reform, and give glory to GOD.</p>
                  <p>SECONDLY, I would expostulate in a word or two, with those who make a handle of this doctrine, that sin answers some good ends, to excuse and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage themselves and others in sin. They take it for granted that all sin answers some good end, and profess to believe that this is a doctrine of the bible; and often speak of this as a palliation and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse for their sin, and the sin of others; and as if this was an inducement to it. Now such (if any such are here) are desired seriously to consider the following things.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="63" facs="unknown:012812_0035_0F8ABABDCB8D2358"/>I. By drawing, and acting upon such a consequence, you renounce the bible. For, as has been shewn, nothing can be more contrary to the scripture than this. Now by renouncing the bible, you renounce the doctrine from whence you pretend to draw this consequence, and take encouragement to sin; and so build upon nothing at last: For in your very building, you pull down the foundation you pretend to build upon.
"The bible,"
you say
"teaches that sin is made the occasion of good."
Very well so it does.
"Well then,"
you say,
"this is a great encouragement to sin: Let us sin that good may come."
But this you know the bible disallows of. And if the bible is not to be minded in this case, then it is not to be depended upon when it reveals the doctrine from which you draw this consequence, and encourage yourself to sin. Thus men must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict <hi>themselves,</hi> as well as the bible, in order to make any such improvements of this doctrine.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. You do not value and desire that good which God brings out of sin; and therefore never felt any encouragement from this to sin: As it has been proved, that no man ever did, or possibly can do. As therefore you pretend to that which is impossible, it is nothing but pretence and hypocrisy in you. You care nothing about God's glory, and the holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and happiness of the angels and saints: You are after a good of your own, which has no relation to this good. If you could promote a million de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of the good, which God makes sin the occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of, by lifting up your finger, you would not do it. Surely then, this was never any encouragement to you to sin.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. They who thus abuse this doctrine, are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly in the way to eternal destruction. And if you continue thus to abuse this glorious truth of the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:012812_0036_0F8ABAC0DA9FB068"/>
all your days, you will fall under the condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion denounced against such in the text; and the justice of God will shine bright in your eternal dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. You will not see when good comes, or have any part or lot in this matter, as your heart is not right with God, but in direct opposition to him. You will be shut out in darkness, where there is weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, wailing and gnashing of teeth. But CHRIST's throne shall be guiltless, and established in righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; and on his seed shall be light and peace and joy forever. God will be forever glorified, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer his own ends in your eternal damnation.</p>

                     </gap>nclude all with a word of EXHORTATION.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. Let all hence be exhorted to seek after the knowledge of God's ways, and a heart to justify and approve of them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> Seek after the knowledge of God's ways.</p>
                  <p>It becomes us to cry after knowledge, and lift up our voice for understanding; to seek her as silver, and search for her as for hid treasures, if by any means, we may find the knowledge of GOD. But how shall we find the knowledge of God? Why no other way, but by searching into his WORKS, as they are held up to our view in creation, providence, and divine revelation. 'Tis by understanding God's WAYS, that we come to the knowledge of God. God discovers himself to creatures only by his ways and works. These are the glass held forth in the bible, in which the glorious God is exhibited to crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. And it becomes us to search into them with diligence, care, and painful study. <hi>The works of God are great,</hi> sought out <hi>of all them that have plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure therein.</hi> (Psal. iii.2.) They are SOUGHT OUT, with diligent application of mind, and <hi>earnest</hi> inquiry. He that is slothful, and inattentive to these matters, he, I say, is <hi>the brutish man that knoweth not: And
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:012812_0036_0F8ABAC0DA9FB068"/>
the fool, that doth not understand this.</hi> (Psal. xcii.6.)</p>
                  <p>It is to be lamented, that so many are no more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitive after the truth; are even too lazy and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less to enquire and examine for themselves; and so make no proficiency in christian knowledge: But are quite ignorant, and groping in the dark, in the midst of the rich means of instruction we enjoy. St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks to christians as under obligation to make proficiency in knowledge; and blames them much, that when FOR THE TIME they OUGHT to be teachers of others, they had need that one should teach them AGAIN the first principles of the ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of God. And exhorts them not to rest in the knowledge of the <hi>first principles</hi> of christianity, but to go on to perfection. (<hi>Heb.</hi> v.12. vi.1.)</p>
                  <p>I know it is insisted on by many as a maxim of importance,
"That we content ourselves with the PLAIN, INDISPUTABLE things of religion; and not meddle with dark, intricate &amp; disputable points."</p>
                  <p>But this is, I think, as much as to say,
"Be sure to take no pains to enquire into, and understand what you know not already; but be content to live and die in ignorance."
For what is there <hi>plain</hi> to a person, which he does not already know? And what is there which is not <hi>dark</hi> and <hi>unintelligible,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til by THOUGHT and application of mind, it is understood? And what peculiar doctrine of christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity is there, that is not disputed, or looked upon dark and intricate by some?</p>
                  <p>I have different, and I trust <hi>better</hi> advice to give you, my hearers. Search the scriptures daily, that you may know whether these things are so. Strive to <hi>grow</hi> in knowledge, that you may not be babes but strong men, who by reason of use, have your judgment exercised to discern both good and evil.
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:012812_0037_0F8ABAC18E8FB8E0"/>
And in order to this, prove, examine ALL THINGS, and hold fast that which is good.</p>
                  <p>The most of God's ways revealed to us in the bible, have respect to sin, or do some way relate to it (such as his permitting it, punishing it, redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men from it, and bringing good out of it:) If therefore we don't understand <hi>this,</hi> we know but little of God and his ways. Let us then search the bible: And at the same time constantly and earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cry to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ather of lights, that he would teach us his ways; and <hi>open our eyes to behold the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful things in his</hi> word.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Seek a <hi>heart to approve</hi> of all God's ways. This will lay the best, and indeed the only founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>rightly knowing</hi> God's ways. This is, in a true sense, to have an understanding heart: In this true wisdom consists. Knowledge will be easy to him who has <hi>this</hi> understanding; while the <hi>scorner</hi> (whose heart opposes God's ways) seeketh wisdom, and findeth it not. (<hi>Prov.</hi> xiv.6.)
"The MEEK (who have a humble, pliable, submissive heart) will God guide in judgment: And the meek will he teach his way."
(<hi>Psal.</hi> xxv.9)
"Who is WISE (truly holy) and he shall understand these things? Prudent, and he shall know them? For the WAYS of the LORD are <hi>right,</hi> and the <hi>just</hi> shall walk in them: But the <hi>transgressors</hi> shall fall therein."
(<hi>Hos.</hi> xiv.9)
"None of the wicked shall understand, but the WISE shall understand."
(<hi>Dan.</hi> xii.10.) He who has a heart to do God's will, he is most likely to know of the doctrines he enquires into, whether they be of God or not; he cometh to the light. But he whose heart opposes God's ways, hateth the light, and holds the truth in unrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; or turns aside to error and delusion, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces falshood because he <hi>loves to have it so.</hi> How
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:012812_0037_0F8ABAC18E8FB8E0"/>
unhappy is the man, who has <hi>a lie in his right hand,</hi> and cannot deliver his soul, because his <hi>heart,</hi> his corrupt heart, <hi>has turned him aside</hi> from the truth! This, it is to be feared, is the sad case of many at this day. They have no heart to LOVE the truth, therefore God has left them to <hi>strong delusion, to believe a lie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>God's professing people of old said, <hi>his ways were not equal.</hi> God's ways did not suit their hearts at all. And they are as contrary to the unsanctified heart now, as they were then, and are doubtless as much oppos'd and murmur'd against, tho' under a pretence that they <hi>are not</hi> God's ways.—</p>
                  <p>Let us then be greatly concern'd to have our hearts <hi>right with God.</hi> To this end may God take away the heart of stone, and give us an heart of flesh, in which his laws are written; and by this <hi>direct our hearts into the love of God</hi> as he is revealed in his word!</p>
                  <p n="2">II. What has been said on this subject, may be improved as a motive to all to give themselves up to God through <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi> To trust in him for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from all the evil of sin; from sin itself, and from all the evil consequences of it: And that you may share in all that great good that God makes sin the occasion of.</p>
                  <p>Thus to save and bless sinful man, Christ came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, suffer'd and died: And of this we now have the offer. If you give yourselves up to Christ, you shall be compleatly saved from all your sins. He will deliver you from the awful wrath of God, and all the dreadful evils that are coming on an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly world. He will wash you, and make you clean. He will deliver you from all sorrow, and wipe all tears from your eyes. He will bestow all the blessings on you that you can wish for. He will cloath you with glorious robes, with a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness

He will cause you to sit down on his throne, and make you to share in his honor, glory and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness. In sum, you shall share in all the good that is brought out of sin, and be eternal gainers, by the sin and misery that has filled the world. O, let no sinner disregard and slight these kind and advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous offers: Let him not neglect the gl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="3">III. Let all hence be excited to seek and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to promote the same ends that G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

God seeks these ends in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of his holiness; and we have no other way to seek them but in holy exercises, in keeping God's commands. All that God has done in permitting sin, and bringing good out of it, all that he has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in his word, and all that he will do to the end of the world, tends to excite to holiness. Let us then seek to be holy as he is holy.

            <head>APPENDIX To the Second EDITION of the foregoing SERMONS.</head>
            <byline>BY THE AUTHOR.</byline>
            <p>WHEN these sermons were first published, it was not thought that any of the true friends of JEHOVAH and his kingdom would be offended with the doctrine, that things, even all the sin that has taken place in his dominions, shall, on the whole, be no injury to his kingdom, but be over-ruled by him for the great advantage and glory of it forever: Yea, it was presumed that this truth would be matter of great joy to all such, and that they would attend to the abundant evidence which we have of it in the word of God, with a peculiar pleasure. But, however unaccountable it may be, numbers of these professed friends to God, his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, happiness and kingdom, have appeared greatly displeased with this doctrine; and have spoken much against these sermons, chiefly because it is there asserted and vindicated.</p>
            <p>Mr. Dana <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>now Doctor Dana) appears to be one of these, by what he published some years ago in his sermon on "the inscrutability of divine provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence." There he has the following words.
"That
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:012812_0039_0F8ABAC30BDE8360"/>
sin has been of great <hi>adva<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tage</hi> to the creation, through divine interposition, some (of confused heads, but sufficiently opinionated) have undertaken to shew. But to prove that the happiness of the creation would have been less, provided sin had never entred into the world, they must first be able to tell us what would in fact have been, had all reasonable beings continued innocent—which neither men nor angels can."
P. 48.</p>
            <p>Every one, I suppose, who has seen the title of the preceeding sermons, will be at no loss in deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining who the author had a particular reference to in these words; though he has, I suppose inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertently, made a material alteration by using the word <hi>creation</hi> instead of <hi>universe,</hi> which includes all existence, created and uncreated. How far the words in the parenthesis shew the clearness of the author's head, and his great candor and humility, the reader will judge. Be this as it may, I think I have good g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ound to say, that if instead of this parenthesis, he had shewed wherein the confusion of the head, or the weakness of the arguments offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in support of this doctrine, was to be discovered, he would have given more satisfaction to all his judici<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>us, candid readers. But this he has not essayed to do. Yea, so far from this was he, that he has asserted, over and over again, what is really the same thing which he so severely censures in the words just quoted.</p>
            <p>He particularly considers the permission of sin as an important article in which the divine provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is concerned, and allows that God did permit sin, when he might have prevented it. (P. 47.)— And he says
"the plan of his administration is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form and fixed; in which the best adapted means are improved to accomplish his general design,
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:012812_0039_0F8ABAC30BDE8360"/>
which is <hi>plainly benevolent.</hi> (P. 46.) The general view of his administration is therefore <hi>benevolent:</hi> His wisdom and power are therefore employed in carrying on designs of <hi>the greatest good.</hi>"
(P. 61) If God in his providence, and therefore in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sin, in every instance of which his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is concerned, is benevolent, and designs the <hi>greatest good</hi>; then the permission of si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, does promote this design, and answer this end, and is necessary in order to the greatest good: For it is impossible that God should design the <hi>greatest good,</hi> or any good at all, in suffering that to take place in his providence, which is of no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to the universe; or, which is the same, if there is less good than there might have been, had not sin been permitted. If sin is not, by God's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposition, an advantage to the universe, but God's kingdom, taken in its whole extent, would have been much better, more happy and glorious, if sin had not been permitted, then there could be no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent design in permitting it; and God is so far from carrying on designs of the greatest good in this that less good was preferred to a greater, which is really the same thing with preferring evil to good.</p>
            <p>And this author not only asserts, as above; but he very justly observes that it is necessary we should believe that God is <hi>good</hi> in every instance of his providence, in order to acquiesce in it, and exercise proper and cheerful submission. His words are these.
"As a foundation of a rational acquiescence in the providence of God, we must lay this down as a principl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

(P. 60.)— According to this, we can have no reason to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiesce in God's providence in permitting sin, any

further than we have "clear and abundant proof" that he is good in permitting it. But if sin, every instance of it, does not, by God's direction and over-ruling hand, answer some good end; but it would have been much better on the whole, if sin had not been permitted; then God exercises no good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in the permission of sin; and consequently there is no ground of acquiescence in God's providence, respecting this very important, and most interesting affair, to which most instances of God's providence in this fallen world have some respect.</p>
            <p>Is it not a little unaccountable that this author should stigmatize his brethren as "of confused heads, and sufficiently opinionated" for asserting what is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly implied in what he himself says; and which is the only foundation, according to his own account, of all true submission to God's providence? It must be left with him to account for it, and reconcile this palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble inconsistence; or rather retract which part of it he pleases.</p>
            <p>Indeed, this doctrine, That sin is by God's inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position and over-ruling hand, an advantage to the universe, must be received, unless we call in question God's infinite wisdom, power and goodness, or deny his universal providence, which is really the same thing. This author says, that in order to prove this,
"they must first be able to tell us what would in fact have been, had all reasonable beings continued innocent."
How absurd is this! How inconsistent with the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject he is upon (the inscrutability of divine providence) and with most he says in other parts of his sermon! Blessed be God! We have a more sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e and short way to prove this. God is infinite in power, wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and goodness, and in the exercise of these per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections permits all the sin that takes place in his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions; therefore we are sure that all the sin which
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:012812_0040_0F8ABAC3F30497B8"/>
takes place shall answer some wise and good end, and is, on the whole, such an advantage to the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse, that there will be eternally more good than could have been, had there been no evil. We may be just as sure of this as we are that God reigns infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely blessed, omnipotent, infinitely wise and good; and that the bible is a revelation from him. <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>Archbishop Sharp has fully asserted this doctrine in his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon from Psal. 97.1. preached before the King and Queen, 1693.

               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:012812_0041_0F8ABAC48B8693A8"/>The author of a late piece, intitled
"An exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the late reverend president Edwards's en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry on freedom of will,"
has a section
"on the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed advantage of moral evil to the universe."
(Part II. sect. V. pag. 72.) He appears sufficiently disposed to oppose and disgrace this doctrine; but he has not offered any argument against it, which does in the least confute what president Edwards pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished on that head, and is not fully obviated and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered in the foregoing sermons; which I think e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very careful judicious reader will perceive. Why did he not particularly attend to Mr. Edwards's arguments, and point out their fallacy and weakness, instead of suggesting things in a loose declamatory way, which have been thoroughly confuted by writers on that subject<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Had he looked their argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments fairly in the face, and so much as attempted an answer, he would have been worthy of some at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. But, in the room of this, he has m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>st grosly misrepresented Mr. Edwards in two instances, in this short section (as he has done in other parts of his book) which I think ought to be particularly noticed, in justice to the truth and to Mr. Edwards. This author here says that Mr. Edwards asserts,
"that moral evil is not of a <hi>bad, but good tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</hi>"
(P. 72.) Whereas Mr. Edwards has asserted no such thing, nor any thing like it. Mr Edwards's words, from which I suppose this author took oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to make the above assertion, as a quotation from him, are these.
"'Tis not of <hi>bad tendency,</hi> for the supreme Being thus to order and permit that moral evil to be, which it is best should come to pass. For that it is of a good tendency, is the very thing supposed in the point now in question. Christ's crucifixion, though a most horrid fact in them that perpetrated it, was of most glorious ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:012812_0041_0F8ABAC48B8693A8"/>
as permitted and ordered by God." (Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry into freedom of will, p. 276.) Who can help seeing that what Mr. Edwards says here, is consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with the greatest bad tendency of moral evil; in itself considered. This tendency, however strong and malignant, is counteracted and over-ruled by infinite power, wisdom and goodness. And thus considered in God's hands, and permitted by him, it answers good ends. In a word, 'tis not the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of sin, as such, that Mr. Edwards is here speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of; but the tendency of God's permitting it, and holding it in his hands, and over-ruling it to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer his own wise and good ends by it. How this author could make the above assertion, in the form of a quotation from Mr. Edwards, is yet unaccoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.</p>
            <p>He also insinuates that Mr. Edwards in his book which he has undertaken to examine, holds,
"That the happiness of the creature is the sole end of the creation."
(Pag. 78, 79.) Since there is not any thing like this in Mr. Edwards's whole book; and in his dissertation
"Concerning the end for which God created the world,"
published since his death, he has asserted and laboured to prove the contrary, is it not unaccountable that this author should take it in his head to make such a representation? I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, when I read this paragraph over, and observe what artful studied method he has taken, in order to fasten such a sentiment on Mr. Edwards, and make president Clap appear inconsistent with himself, I am persuaded every discerning reader of an honest mind, will conclude the author had good reason to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal his name.</p>
            <p>The longer I live, and the more I attend to the word of God, and the nature of true religion, the more I am confirmed in the belief of the truth and
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:012812_0042_0F8ABAC79F497DB0"/>
importance of the principal subject of the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sermons; viz. that sin shall be the occasion of the greatest good: That God's perfections shall be manifested in an unspeakably more bright and glorious manner and degree; his kingdom shall be more glorious; and there shall be immensely more holiness and happiness forever, than could have been, if sin had not been permitted: And that every instance of it is so far under God's direction, that it is over-ruled to answer some wise good end, which could not have been so well answered any other way. And the more convinced I am that this truth is suited to support and comfort all the true friends and servants of Christ: Nor can I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive how there can be any ground of true support and consolation to them who are displeased with this doctrine; and can't but desire their eyes may be opened to see that truth, which has been the support and joy of God's people in all ages; and in which great numbers, I trust, are now rejoicing on earth, and in heaven!</p>
