            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>OUR worthy Anceſtors, whoſe names are held in religious Remembrance amongſt us, for their labours of love and the hardſhips which they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured in their endeavours to eſtabliſh the pure and genuine doctrines of Jeſus Chriſt, ſet out with this one fundamental doctrine, That the Light in every man's breaſt was the true Light of Chriſt; and if duly attended to would lead us out of the errors, miſtakes and prejudices which had corrupted the religious principles of mankind in general, ſo that we ſhould no longer walk in darkneſs, nor follow the lying and deceitful Vanities of this World; but that we ſhould be enabled by the divine principle of Grace and Truth to reſiſt the Temptations of the Devil, and to overcome thoſe fleſhly and worldly luſts which hold the people of this World in captivity to Sin.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:014019_0003_0F9286F6761C3410"/>THEY taught in the demonſtration of the Spirit and with power, that nothing was ſo great an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle to the growth of this divine Principle as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſincerity and a diſregard to Truth, and they therefore exhorted all men in ſingleneſs and ſincerity of heart, to attend to the internal Teacher, and carefully to avoid every deviation from Truth or appearance of deceit—They ſaw in the light of Divine Wiſdom the inconſiſtency of a Chriſtian Profeſſion with every degree of cunning and guile, either in words or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. And their honeſt and upright teſtimony in this reſpect expoſed them frequently to the inſults and moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kery of wicked men. Indeed ſo earneſt were theſe Moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers to catch them in ſome deviation from Truth, that they often aſked them the moſt ſilly queſtions, trying if they could thereby enſnare them in their words; but they witneſs, that the Good Hand was with them, and preſerved them from ſpeaking any thing contrary to Truth in their anſwers.—And,</p>
            <p>THEY have left to all men a moſt certain and ſtanding evidence of their carefulneſs to avoid even the leaſt appearance of Untruth in many "forms of ſound words" now uſed among us, whereby they avoided the poſſibility of being found guilty of any falſhood in their converſations, engagements or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes; and were enabled to preſerve the Teſtimony of Truth clear and unſpotted—</p>
            <p>THUS by a ſcrupulous and conſcientious adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the leadings of Truth in the minuteſt things, our forefathers attained to a ſtrength and ſtability in religion which enabled them to bear up againſt the many trials and ſevere perſecutions, which were ſuffered to come upon them for the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:014019_0004_0F9286F7312FDBA0"/>
of their faith, and the exaltation of the Truth which they profeſſed—And by the openneſs, ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and ſteadfaſtneſs of their conduct, they at laſt obtained this teſtimony, even from their enemies, <hi>that they were an innocent, inoffenſive and well meaning people.</hi> And tho' they were expoſed to much in human and cruel treatment on account of their religious profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and in deriſion were called <hi>Quakers,</hi> yet the Virtuous integrity of their lives, and their ſtrict and ſimple adherence to Truth, by the bleſſing of that God who dwells with the <hi>ſingle-hearted,</hi> and hates all hypocriſy and lies, enabled them to perſevere and to ſupport their Teſtimony, and at laſt procured them relief from almoſt every thing which the Pure Light in their minds could not ſuffer them to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to, or partake of.</p>
            <p>I therefore felt a ſtrong inclination to lay this part of their conduct before you, that you might be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabled to ſee the ſteps whereby our antient Friends attained a ſtedfaſtneſs in the Truth, and that having their example before our eyes, and ſeeing the bleſſing nd ſucceſs which attended them, we might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited to follow their footſteps; eſpecially at this time of trial, which the Lord hath permitted to try our Faith, and to ſhew who are his and who are not. —Suffer me then to ſtir up the <hi>pure Mind</hi> in each of us by way of remembrance, to excite all ſuch who are truly engaged in the work of an inward and ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al reformation, to take care to preſerve themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotted, to be cautious not to ſuffer their minds to be led aſtray on the one ſide or the other, and by all means to avoid the artifices and cunning of thoſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who, forſaking the divine leadings, ſtudy to turn e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very diſpenſation of Providence to the worldly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:014019_0005_0F9286F8032A41C8"/>
of the ſociety, by bowing to the wicked while in authority, and thereby wounding their own conſciences, and in the end bringing diſhonour on our teſtimony and the principles which we profeſs.</p>
            <p>THERE is nothing more certain both from the declarations of Scripture and the experience of Friends, eſpecially ſuch as adhered ſteadily to the Light of Grace in their own hearts, than that the duty of a truly ſpiritual man conſiſts in declining to take part on either ſide in any political contention or quarrel, in conſtantly renouncing all worldly po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, and in patiently waiting for deliverance from the Lord—And ſo far have the ſpiritually minded men of former ages been from appearing anxious to preſerve the favour of thoſe in power, by any ſeeming compliance with their arbitrary proceedings, that they have found it their duty to remonſtrate againſt their oppreſſions, and to denounce the Vengeance of him who hates all injuſtice and cruelty againſt them, unleſs they repented—And the boldneſs and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian plainneſs with which our worthy Anceſtors re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved the oppreſſors of their day, is ſurely the ſtrongeſt proof of their integrity of heart.</p>
            <p>THIS part of their behaviour, if duly attended to, will enable us to perceive the difference between them and ſome amongſt us, who at preſent are high in profeſſion; but whoſe conduct and the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle regard which they ſhew to the moſt eſſential prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of our Religion will, if approved by the ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, not only ſubject us to the juſt cenſure of the World, but render us entirely unworthy of that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with which the divine Goodneſs hath hitherto bleſſed us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:014019_0006_0F9286F8AC5D77B8"/>THAT I may not be wanting in my duty, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear willing to condemn our leading Friends with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out advancing proofs of their guilt, I would not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly requeſt you to remember, that what the colonies contend for, <hi>is their right,</hi> and by Friends acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be ſo, and then tell me, whether our laſt Yearly Meeting Epiſtle is not a moſt ſtriking and ſhameful deviation from that honeſt boldneſs and plainneſs of ſpeech which diſtinguiſhed our anceſtors, and whether the ſcriptures of Truth, or the hiſtory of Friends can ſhew ſuch another teſtimony againſt rulers who ſeemed determined to carry their unjuſt and oppreſſive meaſures into execution by <hi>fire</hi> and <hi>ſword</hi>—Aſk the Prophets of old in what lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage they ſpoke to the men in power when they acted unjuſtly. Conſult the firſt founders of our ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, men who ſpent their lives in eſtabliſhing the principles which we profeſs, and then declare whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they ſpoke ſuch language to thoſe in power.— If they did not, if they acted with a boldneſs at that time unknown, and, in the utmoſt plainneſs of ſpeech, denounced the Judgments of God againſt oppreſſion in their Rulers, and if their language was not ſuch as the leading members of our ſociety ſpeak at this time, let us calmly conſider which has the beſt title to that Divine Guidance and Inſpiration which makes the moſt diſtinguiſhed principle of our profeſſion.</p>
            <p>MY appeal is to the honeſt hearted, who are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to examine their own conduct and the conduct of our leading men in the Light of divine Truth— To ſuch alone I addreſs myſelf, and from them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone I expect a true and genuine reply—Whether did thoſe ancient Friends, amongſt whom the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:014019_0007_0F9286F96EE5A938"/>
founder of this province ſtood foremoſt, who called upon the People to aſſert their rights and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured them that then was the time; or our Meeting for Sufferings, who lately called upon our Elders to deal with every one of the ſociety who joined with the people to defend their rights, act under the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the divine Spirit?—I firmly perſuade myſelf, that every ingenuous mind which regards the Teſtimony of Truth, and attends to the Witneſs in his own heart, will readily determine to whom the preference is due—And an honeſt attention and obedience to that witneſs will always enable him to oppoſe that ſpirit which is not of God—For if the Goſpel directs us to yield up a part of our right rather than to enter into contention about it, much more does it command us not to ſtrike hands with the oppreſſor. A righteous and juſt man may <hi>defend</hi> his property; but he is a villain who either attempts unjuſtly to deprive him of it, or abets the man who does.—</p>
            <p>THIS Epiſtle when conſidered as a religious pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication, given forth by a people heretofore remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for their ſteady oppoſition to, and bearing teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony againſt oppreſſion in their rulers, is highly blamable, but when compared to the piece, intituled, "The Teſtimony, &amp;c." it becomes innocent and laud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. For what think ye my friends will the world ſay when they behold this Teſtimony? with what indignation muſt that Holy Spirit whoſe leadings we profeſs to follow, view a publication, given forth as it were under the ſanction of all the Friends in both provinces with a manifeſt deſign to juſtify the oppreſſive meaſures of government, and to brand with the worſt of epithets, thoſe whoſe greateſt fault
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:014019_0008_0F9286FA333B43D0"/>
is, that they contend for their right in a pacific manner?</p>
            <p>THESE things have pained my heart, and filled my mind with ſorrow and affliction, and I could not reſt until I had in ſome meaſure pointed out their inconſiſtency with our profeſſion, leſt you, whoſe earneſt and continual waiting for the divine manifeſtations may have prevented from attending to public affairs, ſhould, thro' a confidence in the ſincerity of thoſe who have given forth this teſtimony, be induced to give your approbation thereto, and thereby bring a reproach upon Truth and the principles we profeſs to the world.</p>
            <p>FOR there are ſome things aſſerted therein, which I fear will be a reproach to our ſociety as long as they remain upon record; becauſe they have ſo ſlight a foundation in truth, that the whole conduct of Government and of the people is a proof of the contrary. I cannot therefore help looking forward with anxious diſtreſs, and viewing with anguiſh of ſpirit the Gulf into which they are about to plunge the ſociety by a haſty forſaking of the true path, and forgetting to wait upon the Guidance of that Spirit which alone can perſerve us from the ſnares of the world and ſupport us in the hour of Temptation.</p>
            <p>WHILE men, who ſeemed to be employed to ſow diviſions amongſt the people, and who openly appeared to pay no regard to truth, have for ſome months paſt continued to condemn the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic proceedings as ſubverſive of all Government, and calculated to throw off all allegiance to the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:014019_0009_0F9286FAF73EE608"/>
King, and to aſſert that all our grievances might have been redreſſed had we applied in a legal and conſtitutional manner, I did not ſuffer my mind to be troubled on account of their falſhoods—I thought Truth could ſuffer but little from men who paid no regard to a good Conſcience—And I knew the juſt cauſe of the people would not be injured by their repreſentations; for Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion knowing them to be employed by themſelves, could not conſider their declarations and aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as truths to be depended on; but only as means employed to ſerve their cauſe.</p>
            <p>BUT when I beheld a People, whoſe religious ſtandard is truth and ſincerity, incautiouſly drawn in by thoſe, who call themſelves their repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives, to aſſert that,
<q>From their paſt experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the clemency of the King and his roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al anceſtors they have grounds to hope and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that decent and reſpectful addreſſes, from thoſe who are veſted with legal authority, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting the prevailing diſſatisfactions and the cauſe of them, would avail towards obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing relief, aſcertaining and eſtabliſhing the juſt rights of the people, and reſtoring the public tranquility; and deeply lamenting that contrary modes of proceeding have been pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued; which have involved the Colonies in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, and appear likely to produce Violence and Bloodſhed, and threaten the ſubverſion of the conſtitutional government, and of that liberty of conſcience, for the enjoyment of which, our anceſtors were induced to encounter the manifold dangers and difficulties of croſſing the ſeas, and ſettling in the Wilderneſs,</q>—I
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:014019_0010_0F9286FBBA7B9E60"/>
felt an involuntary ſigh ariſe within me, and I could not repreſs the emotions of my ſpirit—</p>
            <p>FOR would not any one, who did not know the true ſtate of the proceedings of the colonies, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on reading ſuch a paragraph, extracted from the public Teſtimony of the people called Quakers, imagine, that no attempt had ever been made by our aſſemblies to obtain a redreſs of our grievances; but that immediately upon our firſt notice of their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence we had broken out into the utmoſt violence and moſt daring oppoſition to Government—But let the following detail of facts ſhew the injuſtice, not to ſay falſhood, of ſuch a repreſentation.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as the acts of parliament of which we complain were known in America, the Aſſembly of the Maſſachuſetts Bay ſent a decent reſpectful addreſs to the King, complaining of the infringe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their rights, and praying for a redreſs; and to add the greater weight to their petition, they wrote circular Letters to all the other Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies on the continent, requeſting them to join them in addreſſes to his Majeſty.</p>
            <p>THIS the Aſſemblies of Rhode-Iſland and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence Plantations, Connecticut, New-York, New-Jerſey, Lower Counties, and Virginia all joined them in—The other Aſſemblies highly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved the Meaſure as well as thoſe who petition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and only declined petitioning for the preſent until they knew the fate of the applications they had made by their agents before the arrival of the Circular Letter:—However, every Aſſembly from Nova-Scotia to the Florida's petitioned
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:014019_0011_0F9286FCA7921C98"/>
ſome time after, as any one may ſatisfy himſelf by conſulting their proceedings for the Year 1768.</p>
            <p>Now, here was a fair experiment made of that mode of application for redreſs, which our repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives (as they call themſelves) ſo ſtrongly hint had never been tried, and of the ſucceſs of which, they appear ſo confident, and wherein e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Aſſembly from Nova-Scotia to the Florida's united.—But what was the conſequence? Did the King pay any regard to their applications and addreſſes, tho' conceived in the moſt decent and manly terms? No. The Miniſter, (Hillsbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough) as ſoon as he heard of the meaſures which the Maſſachuſetts-Bay Aſſembly had taken, ſent a circular Letter to all the Governors of the other colonies, deſiring them to uſe their utmoſt endeavours to prevent their Aſſemblies from join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with that of the Maſſachuſetts-Bay, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning their circular Letter as a meaſure of a moſt dangerous and factious tendency, calculated to inflame the minds of his Majeſty's good ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in the colonies, to promote unwarrantable combinations, and to excite and encourage open oppoſition to, and denial of the authority of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and to ſubvert the true principles of the conſtitution; and therefore he exhorted the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Governors to exert their utmoſt influence to defeat this flagicious attempt to diſturb the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic peace—And to add the greater weight and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity to theſe proceedings of the Miniſtry, and the more effectually to frighten the colonies into a tame ſubmiſſion, and make them ſick of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to join in petitioning for redreſs of grievances, the Houſe of Lords was employed to
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:014019_0012_0F9286FD3146DA58"/>
reſolve in the moſt violent manner againſt their proceedings.—</p>
            <p>SUCH a repreſentation of their conduct, and the meaſures perſued at home in conſequence thereof, alarmed our Aſſemblies; and they, in juſtification of their meaſures, paſſed a few reſolves expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of the innocency, prudence and conſtitution<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allity of their meaſures, and aſſerting their right to join in petitioning his Majeſty, denying the factious tendency of the Circular Letter and the Right of parliament to tax the colonies, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring, That the Right of taxing the colonies remained in themſelves alone—This was all they did in oppoſition to all the diſreſpect and contempt thrown upon their juſt and modeſt applications to the Throne; yet this ſo enraged the court of Great-Britain, that the miniſtry ſent expreſs orders to the Governors of the reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Colonies to diſſolve every Aſſembly which refuſed to reſcind the reſolves they entered into on the occaſion.—Diſſolutions highly injurious to the colonies accordingly took place—and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the miniſter had committed ſome blunders, which ſhewed his ignorance of the conſtitution of ſome of the colonies, and expoſed his political a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities, there ſoon followed another letter from his Majeſty, ordering the Governors to lay no more of the Miniſters letters before our Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies; but only ſuch parts as they ſhould have his Majeſty's expreſs commands for.—Thus are our Aſſemblies for the future to be excluded from the knowledge of the true ſource of their calamities and the ſpirit of the miniſtry, except only ſuch part of it as they may gueſs at from the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:014019_0013_0F9286FF90717518"/>
conduct of their Governors—Nay the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter was ſo diſſatisfied with the conduct and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions of our aſſemblies, as well as with the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour of their agents, that he told one of the agents, the buſineſs of the colonies would never be well done until it came to be tranſacted by the Governor and Miniſter only; and that he ſaw no advantage in the Aſſemblies having agents.— This I think needs no comment—for if that could take place, the complaints of the people would be for ever ſhut out from the ear of the King.—In this ſituation of our affairs, had not our Aſſemblies prudently dropped the matter, and left the people to take it up in the manner they ſhould judge beſt, it is highly probable we muſt, long 'ere now, either have ſubmitted to ſlavery, or come to an open rupture.—</p>
            <p>THIS treatment of our aſſemblies, and the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of diſſolving them which then took place, and has continued ever ſince, as is evident from the diſſolution of the Virginia aſſembly laſt May, &amp;c. effectually put it out of their power to do any thing in their legiſlative capacity, and left us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any reſource except in the ſpirit of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple—And ſo ſenſible were friends, as well as all ranks of people at that time, of the abſolute neceſſity of either ſubmitting to ſlavery or exert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves in ſome other way for our relief, that our Merchants, amongſt whom are ſome of the moſt reſpectable Friends, who but a few Months before refuſed to enter into a Non-impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation agreement, now came into it with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt cheerfulneſs, and adhered to it with the utmoſt fidelity, as is evident from their conduct and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:014019_0014_0F92870187648848"/>
at that time.—From the ſeveral Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers publiſhed in the Appendix you will be able to judge for yourſelves of the truth of the facts I have here related.</p>
            <p>WHAT I have already related, I doubt not, has fully ſatisfied you of the King's diſpoſition to hearken to American Petitions; but when I add to this, that the town of Boſton, at a legal meeting, moſt earneſtly and humbly petitioned the King to grant them an opportunity of clearing themſelves from the unjuſt repreſentations which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived their Governor (Bernard) had made of their conduct, by laying before them thoſe let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of his wherein they ſtood accuſed of riots and tumultuous meetings, and that this their juſt and equitable requeſt met with a Fate which adds little honour to Government, or the Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the King, That their Governor was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to diſſolve their aſſemblies as often as they attempted to enter on the ſubject of their Grievances, by aſſurance from the miniſtry, that he need not fear their withdrawing his ſupport, for that he ſhould be provided for—That this proviſion has been actually made accordingly— When I call to your Minds, that their petition to have their late governor removed, for his having not only followed the ſteps of his wicked prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor, but even exceeded him, was treated with every indignity poſſible to be ſhewn upon the occaſion, except being burned by the hand of the common Hang-man—and that every ſpeech from the throne, ſince the year 1768, which mentions America, breaths the ſame ſpirit which prompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Miniſter at that time to diſſolve our aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies for daring to petition the King, I
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:014019_0015_0F928701C6035268"/>
think it will put it beyond all doubt, that there was not, nor is to this day, the leaſt relief to be expected by America from the petitions of our repreſentatives.—</p>
            <p>BUT that the King's diſpoſition to hear the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions of his people may be more fully known to, and underſtood by you, I will lay a few facts before you which are not connected with our preſent diſpute.—The Aſſembly of Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia petitioned to have a ſtop put to the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Slaves from Africa, a matter which Friends as a ſociety, (and to their honour) have much at heart—their petition was rejected—and a number of reſpectable inhabitants in this City the next year applied to our Houſe of Aſſembly, praying them to back the Virginia petition by one from our Houſe; but our Aſſembly declined it, giving for reaſon, that they knew it would not be regarded, and they did not think it prudent to bring the practice of petitioning into further contempt, by uſing it when there was not the leaſt hope of ſucceſs:—Yet, that they might teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify their approbation of the meaſure, they paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed an act laying an additional duty of Ten Pounds on every Negroe brought into the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince for ſale—but this act met with the fate of the Virginia Petition—it was rejected by the Crown! The city of London petitioned, remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated, and petitioned again on the affair of the Middleſex election; but without ſucceſs—Fifteen Counties (in England) joined them; but they met with no better fate—The city of London pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioned againſt the paſſing of the Quebec bill; but to no purpoſe.—Whence then have thoſe,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:014019_0016_0F928705714480C8"/>
who call themſelves our repreſentatives, their "paſt experience" of the clemency of the King, and his readineſs to hear the petitions of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? I muſt confeſs, that no part of his public conduct affords any thing but the ſtrongeſt proof of his determination to hear none of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of his people—but to treat them with contempt as often as they dared to offer them. I will not deny his Clemency to the two Kenne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and to Balf and M'Quirk, the two Chair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men concerned in the riots at Brentford, who were tried for being preſent at and aiding in the murder of George Clarke—The evidence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whom by all accounts was ſhort, clear and poſſitive; they were therefore convicted and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſentence of Death— but his moſt gracious Majeſty reſpited them during his pleaſure, which I believe yet remains, and for no other reaſon that has ever been aſſigned, as far as I know, but becauſe they were then in the ſervice of the Miniſtry—and aſſiſted them in what they did to carry the election in that place.—</p>
            <p>THESE being the facts from which his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's clemency towards the colonies is to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimated, and this the only experience they could have had—I aſk, whether the paragraph which I have extracted from "the Teſtimony" is true or falſe? My dear friends, we are to anſwer to God and to the witneſs within us for every part of our conduct—let us then ſeriouſly bring this "Teſtimony" to the Touchſtone, and try if we can approve it and be guiltleſs:—And if we cannot, let us not ſhrink back with fear, but
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:014019_0017_0F92870634AE4C30"/>
truſt in God, follow the Light in our hearts, and renounce all hypocriſy and lies.</p>
            <p>IT may be obſerved, that I have ſaid, the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony publiſhed by thoſe who "call themſelves our repreſentatives;" and it may be aſked if they were not really the repreſentatives of our ſociety, and appointed for this particular purpoſe? It ſeems to be inſinuated that they were. All I can ſay to it is, that I never heard of their being appointed for this purpoſe, or of their being the repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of our ſociety—but that they were only a ſtanding committee of intelligence and advice for ordinary occaſions—Our ſociety in theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces being repreſented by our General Yearly Meeting, and by no other body of men.—I know of no law by which theſe meetings are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed—yet I think them legal meetings, and ſhould think it a high inſult upon us, were they branded with ſuch Names as theſe, Combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, Inſurrections, Conſpiracies, and Illegal Aſſemblies:—For as Francis Howgil, a man who was one of the greateſt Ornaments of our ſociety both for the Purity of his Life and Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, whoſe ſermons will be admired as long as our chriſtian Profeſſion ſhall remain, and whoſe Title to divine Inſpiration few amongſt us will queſtion, well obſerves in his advice to the army, &amp;c. "It is not names, Titles, Denominations and Words, that can alter the Nature of Things. A Tyrant will call every Oppoſition to his Will by the name of <hi>Treaſon and Rebellion;</hi> but," as the good man juſtly remarks, "the Lord is ſo far from accounting it ſuch, that he is the very Means of raiſing up that Oppoſition and ſupporting it
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:014019_0018_0F9287071660E5A8"/>
while it continues to withſtand arbitrary Power, and to aim at nothing but the Welfare and Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the People."</p>
            <p>I WELL remember the ſolemnity with which a worthy elder, late of the city of Burlington, at the time when this meeting for ſufferings was firſt appointed and eſtabliſhed, expreſſed his fear of the dangerous uſe which that meeting might make of their appointment, and moſt ſeriouſly and weightily preſſed the Yearly Meeting to limit and reſtrict their proceedings, expreſsly, to Matters of diſcipline and caſes of ſufferings; and am well aſſured it was never deſigned to meddle with po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litics—Happy had it been for the ſociety, had this meeting for ſufferings given due attention to the ſimple, manly and forcible Chriſtian Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of a worthy member of it, who, during the debates on the preſent teſtimony, adviſed and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated that meeting "not to mix politics with religion," aſſerting, that they were "diſtinct and ſeparate things."</p>
            <p>HAD this teſtimony been deſigned ſimply for the purpoſe of clearing the ſociety of the odium which may be thrown upon us by the world, where was the Neceſſity of branding the conduct of others with ſuch opprobrious terms? Why has it been tranſlated into German, and handed thro' Lancaſter County with ſo much care? Does not this look as if we rather meant to blacken the proceedings of other people than to juſtify our own conduct?</p>
            <p>UPON what principles can the conduct of ſome
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:014019_0019_0F928707AFB881C8"/>
of the members of the meeting be accounted for? What obligation could there be upon any member of it to engage, to a ſervant of the Crown, that ſomething of the kind of this teſtimony ſhould be publiſhed, and even allow him to aſſure Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Gage that he might depend on its being done—And, immediately after the publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, to hand a large number of them to that ſervant of the Crown to forward to the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral? How muſt theſe men feel who have been forward in this ſhameleſs tranſaction, if, from an apprehenſion in the Miniſtry of a diviſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, they ſhould proceed to the ſhedding of blood? Let the blood which may be ſhed in the conteſt be upon their heads! but let the ſociety be held guiltleſs—Let us, my friends, enquire who were the ſupporters of this dangerous mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and guard againſt them—The mark of Cain be upon them!</p>

               <p>YOUR Majeſty's faithful ſubjects, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives of your province of the Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts-Bay, with the warmeſt ſentiments of loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, duty and affection, beg leave to approach the throne; and to lay at your Majeſty's feet

their humble ſupplications in behalf of your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſed ſubjects the people of the province.</p>
               <p>Our anceſtors, the firſt ſettlers of this country, having with the royal conſent, which we humbly apprehend involves the conſent of the nation, and at their own great expence, migrated from the mother kingdom, took poſſeſſion of this land, at that time a wilderneſs, the right whereof they had purchaſed for a valuable conſideration, of the council eſtabliſhed at Plymouth, to whom it had been granted by your Majeſty's royal predeceſſor King James the firſt.</p>
               <p>From the principles of loyalty to their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, which will ever warm the breaſt of a true ſubject though remote, they acknowledge their al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance to the Engliſh crown: and your Majeſty will allow us with all humility to ſay, that they and their poſterity, even to this time, have afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed frequent and ſignal proofs of their zeal for the honour and ſervice of their Prince, and their firm attachment to the parent country.</p>
               <p>With toil and fatigue, perhaps not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by their brethren and fellow-ſubjects at home, and with the conſtant peril of their lives, from a numerous, ſavage and warlike race of men, they began their ſettlement, and GOD proſpered them.</p>
               <p>They obtained a charter from King Charles the firſt; wherein his Majeſty was pleaſed to grant to them and their heirs and aſſigns forever, all the lands therein deſcribed, to hold of him and his royal ſucceſſors in free and common ſocage; which we humbly conceive is as abſolute an eſtate as the ſubject can hold under the crown. And in the ſame charter, were granted to them and their poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:014019_0022_0F92870A69A2BCB8"/>
all the rights, liberties, privileges and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities of natural ſubjects, born within the realm.</p>
               <p>This charter they enjoyed, having as we moſt humbly conceive punctually complied with all the conditions of it, till in an unhappy time it was vacated. But after the revolution, when King William and Queen Mary, of glorious and bleſſed memory, were eſtabliſhed on the throne; in that happy reign, when to the joy of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and its dependencies, the crown was ſettled in your Majeſty's illuſtrious family, the inhabitants of this province ſhared in the common bleſſing: Then they were indulged with another charter; in which their Majeſties were pleaſed for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, their heirs and ſucceſſors, to grant and confirm to them as ample eſtate in the lands or territories as was granted by the former charter, together with other the moſt eſſential rights and liberties contained therein; the principal of which, is that which your Majeſty's ſubjects within the realm have ever held a moſt ſacred right, of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taxed only by repreſentatives of their own free election.</p>
               <p>Thus bleſſed with the rights of Engliſhmen, through the indulgent ſmiles of heaven, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the auſpicious government of your Majeſty and your royal predeceſſors, your people of this province have been happy and your Majeſty has acquired a numerous increaſe of loyal ſubjects, a large extent of dominion, a new and inexhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtible ſource of commerce, wealth and glory.</p>
               <p>With great ſincerity, permit us to aſſure your Majeſty that your ſubjects of this province, ever have and ſtill continue to acknowledge your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:014019_0023_0F92870AF7E36F20"/>
high court of parliament the ſupreme le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative power of the whole empire. The ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintending authority of which is clearly admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in all caſes, that can conſiſt with the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental rights of nature and the conſtitution; to which your Majeſty's happy ſubjects in all parts of your empire conceive they have a juſt and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitable claim.</p>
               <p>It is with the deepeſt concern that your hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſuppliants would repreſent to your Majeſty, that your parliament, the rectitude of whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions is never to be queſtioned, has thought proper to paſs divers acts impoſing taxes on your Majeſty's ſubjects in America, with the ſole and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs purpoſe of raiſing a revenue. If your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's ſubjects here ſhall be deprived of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and privilege of voluntarily contributing their aid to your Majeſty, in ſupporting your go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and authority in the province, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending and ſecuring your rights and territories in America, which they have always hitherto done with the utmoſt chearfulneſs; if theſe acts of parliament ſhall remain in force; and your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's commons in Great-Britain ſhall continue to exerciſe the power of granting the property of their fellow-ſubjects in this province, your peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple muſt then regret their unhappy fate in having only the name left of free ſubjects.</p>
               <p>With all humility we conceive, that a repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of your Majeſty's ſubjects in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince in the parliament, conſidering their local circumſtances, is utterly impracticable. Your Majeſty has heretofore been graciouſly pleaſed, to order your requiſitions to be laid before the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives of your people in the general aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,

who have never failed to afford the neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry aid to the extent of their ability, and ſometimes beyond it; and it would be ever grievous to your Majeſty's faithful ſubjects to be called upon in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny way that ſhould appear to them to imply a diſtruſt of their moſt ready and willing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance.</p>
               <p>Under the moſt ſenſible impreſſions of your Majeſty's wiſe and paternal care for the remoteſt of your faithful ſubjects, and in full dependance on the royal declarations in the charter of this province, we moſt humbly beſeech your Majeſty to take our preſent unhappy circumſtances under your royal conſideration, and afford us relief in ſuch a manner as in your Majeſty's great wiſdom and clemency ſhall ſeem meet.</p>

               <p>THE Houſe of Repreſentatives of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince have taken into their ſerious conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, the great difficulties that muſt accrue to themſelves and their conſtituents, by the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſeveral acts of parliament impoſing duties and taxes on the American colonies.</p>
               <p>As it is a ſubject in which every colony is deeply intereſted, they have no reaſon to doubt but your houſe is duly impreſſed with its impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; and that ſuch conſtitutional meaſures will
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:014019_0025_0F92870DAB9F7EE8"/>
be come into as are proper. It ſeems to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, that all poſſible care ſhould be taken that the repreſentations of the ſeveral aſſemblies, upon ſo delicate a point, ſhould harmonize with each other: The Houſe therefore hope that this letter will be candidly conſidered in no other light than as expreſſing a diſpoſition freely to communicate their mind to a ſiſter colony, upon a common concern, in the ſame manner as they would be glad to receive the ſentiments of your or any other Houſe of Aſſembly on the continent.</p>
               <p>The houſe have humbly repreſented to the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, their own ſentiments: That his Majeſty's high court of parliament is the ſupreme legiſlative power over the whole empire: That in all free ſtates the conſtitution is fixed; and as the ſupreme legiſlative derives its power and authority from the conſtitution, it cannot over-leap the bounds of it, without deſtroying its own foundation: That the conſtitution aſcertains and limits both ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty and allegiance; and therefore his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's American ſubjects, who acknowledge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves bound by the ties of allegiance, have an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitable claim to the full enjoyment of the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental rules of the Britiſh conſtitution: That it is an eſſential unalterable right in nature, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted into the Britiſh conſtitution, as a funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental law, and ever held ſacred and irrevocable by the ſubjects within the realm, that what a man hath honeſtly acquired, is abſolutely his own, which he may freely give, but cannot be taken from him without his conſent: That the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can ſubjects may therefore, excluſive of any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of charter rights, with a decent firmneſs
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:014019_0026_0F9287111F225640"/>
adapted to the character of freemen and ſubjects, aſſert this natural conſtitutional right.</p>
               <p>IT is moreover their humble opinion, which they expreſs with the greateſt deference to the wiſdom of the parliament; that the acts made there, impoſing duties on the people of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, with the ſole and expreſs purpoſe of raiſing a revenue, are infringements of their natural and conſtitutional rights; becauſe, as they are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented in the Britiſh parliament, his Majeſty's commons in Britain, by thoſe acts, grant their property without their conſent.</p>
               <p>This Houſe further are of opinion, that their conſtituents, conſidering their local circumſtances, cannot, by any poſſibility, be repreſented in the parliament; and that it will forever be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable that they ſhould be equally repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there, and conſequently not at all; being ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated by an ocean of a thouſand leagues: That his Majeſty's royal predeceſſors, for this reaſon, were graciouſly pleaſed to form a ſubordinate le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative here, that their ſubjects might enjoy the unalienable right of a repreſentation. Alſo that conſidering the utter impracticability of their ever being fully and equally repreſented in parliament, and the great expence that muſt unavoidably at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend even a partial repreſentation there, this Houſe think, that a taxation of their conſtituents, even without their conſent, grievous as it is, would be preferable to any repreſentation that could be admitted for them there.</p>
               <p>Upon theſe principles, and alſo conſidering that were the right in the parliament ever ſo clear, yet for obvious reaſons, it would be beyond the rule of equity, that their conſtituents ſhould be taxed
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:014019_0027_0F9287126276CCB8"/>
on the manufactures of Great-Britain here, in addition to the duties they pay for them in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, and other advantages ariſing to Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain from the acts of trade; this Houſe have preferred a humble, dutiful and loyal petition to our moſt gracious Sovereign, and made ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation to his Majeſty's miniſters, as they apprehended would tend to obtain redreſs.</p>
               <p>They have alſo ſubmitted to conſideration, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any people can be ſaid to enjoy any degree of freedom, if the crown, in addition to its un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted authority, in conſtituting a governor, ſhould appoint him ſuch a ſtipend as it ſhall judge proper, without the conſent of the people, and at their expence; and whether, while the judges of the land, and other civil officers, hold not their commiſſions during good behaviour, their having ſalaries appointed for them by the crown, independent of the people, hath not a tendency to ſubvert the principles of equity, and endanger the happineſs and ſecurity of the ſubjects.</p>
               <p>In addition to theſe meaſures, the houſe have wrote a letter to their agent Mr. DeBert, the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of which he is directed to lay before the miniſtry; wherein they take notice of the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the act for preventing mutiny and deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which requires the governor and council to provide enumerated articles for the King's march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing troops, and the people to pay the expence: And alſo the commiſſion of the gentlemen ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed commiſſioners of the cuſtoms to reſide in America, which authoriſes them to make as many appointments as they think fit, and to pay the appointees what ſums they pleaſe, for whoſe malconduct they are not accountable—From
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:014019_0028_0F92871308842530"/>
whence it may happen that officers of the crown may be multiplied to ſuch a degree as to become dangerous to the liberty of the people, by virtue of a commiſſion which doth not appear to this Houſe to derive any ſuch advantages to trade, as many have been led to expect.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the ſentiments and proceedings of this Houſe; and as they have too much reaſon to believe that the enemies of the colonies have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented them to his Majeſty's miniſters and the parliament, as factious, diſloyal, and having a diſpoſition to make themſelves independent of the mother country, they have taken occaſion, in the moſt humble terms, to aſſure his Majeſty, and his miniſters, that with regard to the people of this province, and as they doubt not of all the colonies, that the charge is unjuſt.</p>
               <p>The Houſe is fully ſatisfied that your aſſembly is too generous and enlarged in ſentiment, to believe, that this letter proceeds from an ambition of taking the lead, or dictating to the other aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies: They freely ſubmit their opinion to the judgment of others, and ſhall take it kind in your Houſe, to point out to them any thing fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which may be thought neceſſary.</p>
               <p>This Houſe cannot conclude, without expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their firm confidence in the King, our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon head and father, that the united and duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſupplications of his diſtreſſed American ſubjects, will meet with his royal and favourable accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>THE Houſe of Burgeſſes of this colony proceeded, very ſoon after they met, to the conſideration of your important letter, of the 11th of February 1768, written in the name and by order of the Houſe of repreſentatives of your Province; and I have received their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular directions to deſire you to inform that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Houſe, that they applaud them for their attention to American Liberty, and that the ſteps they have taken thereon, will convince them of their opinion of the fatal tendency of the acts of parliament complained of, and of their fixed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to concur with the other colonies in their application for redreſs.</p>
               <p>After the moſt deliberate conſultation, they thought it their duty to repreſent to the parliament of Great-Britain, That they are truly ſenſible of the happineſs and ſecurity they derive from the connexions with, and dependance on Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and are under the greateſt concern that any unlucky incident ſhould interrupt that ſalutary harmony, which they wiſh ever to ſubſiſt. They lament that the remoteneſs of their ſituation often expoſes them to ſuch miſrepreſentations, as are apt to involve them in cenſures of diſloyalty to their Sovereign, and the want of a proper reſpect to the Britiſh parliament: whereas they have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged themſelves in the agreeable perſuaſion, that they ought to be conſidered as inferior to none of their fellow ſubjects in loyalty and affection.</p>
               <p>That they do not affect an independency of their parent kingdom, the proſperity of which
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:014019_0030_0F9287148DF73200"/>
they are bound to the utmoſt of their abilities to promote, but cheerfully acquieſce in the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of parliament to make laws for preſerving a neceſſary dependance, and for regulating the trade of the colonies. Yet they cannot conceive, and humbly inſiſt, it is not eſſential to ſupport a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per relation between a mother country and colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies tranſplanted from her, that ſhe ſhould have a right to raiſe money from them without their conſent, and preſume they do not aſpire to more than the natural rights of Britiſh ſubjects, when they aſſert, that no power on earth has a right to impoſe taxes on the people, or take the ſmalleſt portion of their property, without their conſent, given by their Repreſentatives in Parliament. This has ever been conſidered as the chief pillar of the conſtitution; without this ſupport no man can be ſaid to have the leaſt ſhadow of liberty, ſince they can have no property in that, which another can by right take from them when he pleaſes, without their conſent.</p>
               <p>That their anceſtors brought over with them intire, and tranſmitted to their deſcendants, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and conſtitutional rights they had enjoyed in their native country; and the firſt principles of the Britiſh conſtitution were early engrafted into the conſtitution of the colonies. Hence a legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive authority, ever eſſential in all free ſtates, was derived, and aſſimilated as nearly as might be to that in England; the executive power and the right of aſſenting or diſſenting to all laws reſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the crown, and the privilege of chooſing their own repreſentatives continued to the people, and confirmed to them by repeated and expreſs ſtipulations. The government thus eſtabliſhed,
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:014019_0031_0F92871681DD14D0"/>
they enjoyed the fruits of their own labour with a ſerenity which liberty only can impart. Upon preſſing occaſions they applied to his Majeſty for relief, and gratefully acknowledged they have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently received it from their mother country: Whenever their aſſiſtance was neceſſary, requiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have conſtantly been made from the crown to the repreſentatives of the people, who have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with them to the utmoſt extent of their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities. The ample proviſion made for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the civil government, in the reign of King Charles the ſecond, and at his requeſt, and the large ſupplies voted during the laſt war, upon requiſitions from his Majeſty and his royal grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father, afford early and late inſtances of the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of the aſſemblies of this colony, and are ſufficient proofs that the parliament of Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain did not, till lately, aſſume a power of impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taxes on the people for the purpoſes of raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a revenue.</p>
               <p>To ſay that the Commons of Great-Britain have a right to impoſe internal taxes on the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of this continent, who are not and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be repreſented, is in effect to bid them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for a ſtate of ſlavery. What muſt be their ſituation ſhould ſuch a right be eſtabliſhed? The colonies have no conſtitutional check on their libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality in giving away their money, cannot have an opportunity of explaining their grievances, or of pointing out the eaſieſt method of taxation, for their doom will generally be determined be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are acquainted that the ſubject has been agitated in parliament, and the commons bear no proportion of the taxes they lay upon them. The notion of a virtual repreſentation, which would
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:014019_0032_0F928718ADBDD2D8"/>
render all our rights merely ideal, has been ſo often and ſo clearly refuted, that nothing need be ſaid on that head.</p>
               <p>The oppreſſive ſtamp-act confeſſedly impoſed internal taxes, and the late acts of parliament, giving and granting certain duties in the Britiſh colonies, plainly tend to the ſame point. Duties have been impoſed to reſtrain the commerce of one part of the Empire that was likely to prove in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious to another, and by this means the welfare of the whole promoted; but duties impoſed on ſuch of the Britiſh exports as are neceſſaries of life, to be paid by the coloniſts on importation, without any view to the intereſts of commerce, but merely to raiſe a revenue, or in other words to compel the coloniſts to part with their money againſt their inclinations, they conceive to be a tax internal to all intents and purpoſes. And can it be thought juſt or reaſonable, reſtricted as they are in their trade, confined as they are in their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, obliged to purchaſe theſe very neceſſaries at the Britiſh market, that they ſhould now be told they ſhall not have them without paying a duty for them?</p>
               <p>The act ſuſpending the legiſlative power of New-York, they conſider as ſtill more alarming to the colonies, tho' it has that ſingle province in view. If the parliament can compel them to furniſh a ſingle article to the troops ſent over, they may, by the ſame rule, oblige them to furniſh cloaths, arms, and every other neceſſary, even the pay of the officers and ſoldiers, a doctrine replete with every miſchief, and utterly ſubverſive of all that's dear and valuable: For what advantage can the people of the colonies derive from their
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:014019_0033_0F928718E150F610"/>
right of chooſing their own repreſentatives, if thoſe repreſentatives when choſen, not permitted to exerciſe their own judgments, were under a neceſſity (on pain of being deprived of their legiſlative authority) of enforcing the mandates of a Britiſh parliament.</p>
               <p>This, Sir, is a ſketch of their ſentiments, as they are expreſſed in a petition to his Majeſty, a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial to the Right Honourable the Lords Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and Temporal, and in a remonſtrance to the Knights, Citizens and Burgeſſes of Great-Britain in parliament aſſembled. In all theſe proceedings the council of this colony have concurred, and have directed their agent, James Abercromby, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> to join Edward Montague, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> the agent for this colony, in applying for redreſs of the grievances they ſo juſtly complain of. Copies were delivered to the preſident of the council, now commander in chief, who is deſired to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them to the ſecretary of ſtate appointed by his Majeſty to manage the affairs of North-Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, and Mr. Montague is enjoined to conſult the agents of the other colonies, and to co-ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate with them in every meaſure that ſhall be thought neceſſary to be taken on this critical point.</p>
               <p>They truſt they have expreſſed themſelves with a firmneſs that becomes freemen pleading for eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential rights, and with a decency that will take off every imputation of faction or diſloyalty. They repoſe entire confidence in his Majeſty, who is ever attentive to the complaints of his ſubjects, and is ever ready to relieve their diſtreſs; and they are not without hopes that the colonies unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a decent and regular oppoſition, may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail on a new Houſe of Commons to put a ſtop

               <p>YOUR letter, directed to the Speaker of the Honourable Houſe of Repreſentatives of the Province of South-Carolina, dated the 11th of February laſt, is juſt now come to my hands.</p>
               <p>The commons Houſe of Aſſembly of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, ever attentive to the rights and privileges of themſelves, and their conſtituents in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and the liberties of America in general, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their laſt adjournment,
<q>Ordered, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of correſpondence, to write to the agent in Great-Britain, and inſtruct him to join with the agents of the other provinces in America, in obtaining a repeal of the ſeveral acts of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, which have lately been paſſed, laying duties in America; and to endeavour to prevent
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:014019_0040_0F92872115031AC8"/>
the clauſe for billeting ſoldiers in America, from being inſerted in the next mutiny act which ſhall be paſſed. And that they do further inſtruct the agent, to join the agents of the other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, in all matters where the general inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of North-America is concerned.</q>—In conſequence of this order, I have the pleaſure to acquaint you, that the committee of correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence have, by letter of the 15th of April laſt, given ample inſtructions to Mr. Garth, the agent, on theſe important points.</p>
               <p>The Houſe adjourned on the 12th of April laſt, and have been ſince prorogued; and as the time of their exiſtence by law, will expire on the 18th of September next, I think that they will not meet again; but that they will be ſpeedily diſſolved, and writs be immediately iſſued for the election of a new Aſſembly; for which reaſon, I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid, I ſhall not have an opportunity of laying your letter before the preſent Houſe; but this, I hope, will not be attended with any inconvenience, as the ſteps are already taken, which you have ſo fully and warmly recommended.</p>
               <p>Perſuaded, that notwithſtanding the invidious light, in which his Majeſty's faithful colonies have been repreſented to their mother country, the time will ſoon come, when they will have a fair and candid hearing, the conſequence of which muſt be a relief from all their grievances.

               <p>YOUR reſpected favour of the 11th Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary came to my hand only a few days ſince. I am ſorry it is not in my power to give you ſo full and ſatisfactory an anſwer thereto, as the importance of the ſubject requires: The members of the preſent Aſſembly of this province have but lately been elected, and though the writs were returnable, and the Houſe required to meet the firſt of this month, yet our Governor thought proper, prior thereto, to prorogue the Aſſembly until November; for this reaſon, Sir, I can only, for the preſent, reply to your favour as a private perſon, or late Speaker, and inform you, that before the diſſolution of the laſt Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, the Houſe took under conſideration the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral late acts of Parliament for impoſing taxes and duties on the American colonies, and being ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly affected thereby, ordered their committee of correſpondence to inſtruct our provincial agent, (Mr. Benjamin Franklin) to join earneſtly with the other colonies agents in ſoliciting a repeal of thoſe acts, and in remonſtrating againſt any acts of the like nature for the future: This inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath been tranſmitted to Mr. Franklin, and I have no doubt but he will punctually obſerve it. When the aſſembly meets I will lay your favour before the Houſe; and I am aſſured ſuch meaſures will be purſued in conſequence thereof as will manifeſt their regard for conſtitutional liberty, and their reſpect for the Houſe of Repreſentatives of the province of Maſſachuſetts-Bay, whoſe wiſe and ſpirited conduct is ſo juſtly admired.

               <p>As his Majeſty conſiders this Meaſure to be of a moſt dangerous and factious Tendency, calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to inflame the Minds of his good Subjects in the Colonies, to promote an unwarrantable Combination, and to excite and encourage open Oppoſition to, and a denial of, the Authority of Parliament, and to ſubvert the true Principles of

               <p>The repeated Proofs which have been given by the Aſſembly of your Colony of their Reverence and Reſpect for the Laws, and of their faithful Attachment to the Conſtitution, leave little Room in his Majeſty's Breaſt to doubt of their ſhewing a proper Reſentment of this unjuſtifiable Attempt to revive Diſtractions, which have operated ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally to the Prejudice of this Kingdom and the Colonies, and accordingly his Majeſty has the fulleſt Confidence in their Affections, and expects they will give him the ſtrongeſt Proofs on this and every other Occaſion.</p>

a full Aſſembly had not continued, and inſtead of that ſpirit of prudence and reſpect to the conſtitution, which ſeemed at that time to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence the conduct of a large majority of the members, a thin Houſe, at the cloſe of the ſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſhould have preſumed to revert to and reſolve upon a meaſure of ſo inflammatory a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as that of writing to the other colonies on a ſubject of their intended repreſentation againſt ſome late Acts of Parliament.—His Majeſty conſiders this ſtep as evidently tending to create unwarrantable combinations, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite an unjuſtifiable oppoſition to the conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal authority of Parliament, and to revive thoſe unhappy diviſions and diſtractions which have operated ſo prejudicially to Great-Britain and the Colonies—After what paſſed in the former part of the ſeſſions, and after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared ſenſe of ſo large a majority when the Houſe was full—His Majeſty cannot but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider this as a very unfair proceeding, and the reſolutions taken thereupon to be contrary to the real ſenſe of the Aſſembly, and procured by ſurpriſe; and therefore it is the King's plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, that ſo ſoon as the General Court is again aſſembled at the time preſcribed by the charter you ſhould require of the Houſe of Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives in his Majeſty's Name, to reſcind the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution that gave birth to the circular letter from the ſpeaker, and to declare their diſappro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of and diſſent to that raſh and haſty pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding.</p>
               <p>His Majeſty has the fulleſt reliance on the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of his good ſubjects in the Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts-Bay, and has obſerved with ſatisfaction

that ſpirit of decency and love of order which has diſcovered itſelf in the conduct of the moſt conſiderable of its inhabitants, and therefore his Majeſty has the better ground to hope that the attempt made by a deſperate faction to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turb the public tranquility, will be diſcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced, and that the execution of the meaſure recommended to you will not meet with any difficulty.</p>
               <p>If it ſhould, and if, notwithſtanding the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions which may be juſtly entertained of the ill conſequences of this factions ſpirit which ſeems to have influenced the reſolution of the Aſſembly at the concluſion of the laſt, the new Aſſembly ſhould refuſe to comply with his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's reaſonable expectations, it is the King's pleaſure you ſhould immediately diſſolve them, and tranſmit to me, to be laid before his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, an account of your proceedings thereon, to the end his Majeſty may, if he thinks fit, lay the whole matter before his Parliament, that ſuch proviſions as ſhall be found neceſſary may be made, to prevent for the future a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of ſo extraordinary and unconſtitutional a nature.—It is not his Majeſty's intention that a faithful diſcharge of your duty ſhould operate to your own prejudice, or to the diſcontinuance of any neceſſary eſtabliſhment—proper care will be taken for the ſupport and dignity of government.</p>

               <p>We are told that the act impoſing duties on glaſs, paper, &amp;c. "is inexpedient; but that ſuch had been the unjuſtifiable conduct of ſome in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica, that the adminiſtration were of opinion the preſent juncture was not a proper ſeaſon for a repeal."</p>
               <p>It were to be wiſhed that adminiſtration would never err, or that thoſe affected by the errors of government would make known their complaints in a way the leaſt offenſive; but as from the frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of human nature neither is to be expected, it would become perſons in power to conſider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther even the "unjuſtifiable behaviour" of thoſe who think themſelves aggrieved will juſtify a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance in a meaſure confeſſed to be wrong. Certain it is that the wiſdom of government is better manifeſted, its honour and authority bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter maintained and ſupported, by correcting the
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:014019_0051_0F92872A0A3D8178"/>
errors it may have committed, than by perſiſting in them, and thereby riſking the loſs of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects affections.</p>
               <p>We are at a loſs to know what behaviour the miniſter refers to, or who thoſe are with whoſe behaviour he is diſguſted. The Americans think that no people, who have any regard for liberty, could in their circumſtances ſhew a more reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful behaviour. It is true, they cannot acquieſce in the Parliament's claim to tax them; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering themſelves as Britiſh ſubjects, who cannot of right be taxed but by their repreſentatives, and knowing that the loſs of this privilege involves in it a loſs of liberty, they conceive that earneſt and direct applications againſt acts of parliament, which deſtroy it, not only juſtifiable, but neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and that their peaceable ſubmiſſion to ſuch acts, till the reſult of their applications is known, is the greateſt proof they can give of their affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for their parent country, and reſpect for the parliament of Great-Britain.</p>
               <p>The adminiſtration, it ſeems, "are firmly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to oppoſe a repeal with their utmoſt ſtrength, while it ſhall be inſiſted on by threats from our ſide."—We are apprehenſive that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in power were greatly abuſed, and that the people of America have been groſly miſrepreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſome who wiſh well neither to Britain nor America; otherwiſe the ſteps which they have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to obtain redreſs could never be looked on as threats. It is very unfortunate that the diſpute, which we fondly hoped was buried, and would have for ever lain dormant under the repeal of the Stamp-Act, is again revived by the late acts for raiſing a revenue in America.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="unknown:014019_0052_0F92872A38BADF78"/>In a diſpute of ſo important a nature, in which liberty is concerned, it is not to be wondered if free born Britiſh ſubjects are warmed, and if every ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is urged that can have any weight to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure to them a bleſſing they ſo highly prize. Threats they never intended, but as all the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican colonies were equally affected, it was thought that their joint petitions would have more weight; and for this end the ſeveral aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies communicated their ſentiments to each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: This ſtep, to the inexpreſſible ſurpriſe of all America, is repreſented by Lord Hiliſborough in a late letter as a flagicious attempt, a meaſure "of a moſt dangerous and factious tendency, &amp;c." The diſſolution of aſſemblies that followed this letter, and the meaſures purſued to inforce the Acts in America, awakened the fears, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperated the minds of the people to a very great degree.</p>
               <p>They therefore determined not only to defeat the intent of the Acts, by refraining from the uſe of thoſe articles on which duties were laid, but to put a ſtop to the importation of goods from Great-Britain. Heretofore they had almoſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely confined themſelves to the uſe of Britiſh manufactures, and from their affection to Great-Britain ſhewed a fondneſs to imitate her faſhions; but matters being now carried with ſo high a hand, they tho't it improper and injudicious to indulge that humour. This is the only threat we know of, and if this is ſufficient to engage the miniſtry to oppoſe a repeal of the acts, we apprehend the miniſtry muſt by a change of meaſures endeavour to regain the affections of the
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:014019_0053_0F92872AEA5AE158"/>
people before they can be induced to alter their determination.</p>
               <p>But we are told, that "if a proper diſpoſition appears in the colonies, and their merchants in a ſucceeding ſeſſion ſhall think proper to petition parliament on the principle of inexpediency only, there was every reaſon to believe that no part of Adminiſtration will object to the repeal." In a matter of ſo great conſequence we ſhould have been glad if the miniſter had declared what "the proper diſpoſition" is which he expects from the colonies.</p>
               <p>The Americans conſider themſelves as Britiſh ſubjects, entitled to all the rights and privileges of freemen. They think there can be no liberty without a ſecurity of property; and that there can be no property if any can, without their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, deprive them of the hard earned fruits of their labour.</p>
               <p>They know that they have no choice in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of members of parliament, and from their ſituation never can have any. Every act of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament therefore that is made for raſing a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in America, is, in their opinion, a depriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them of their property without their conſent, and conſequently are invaſions of their liberty.</p>
               <p>If then the acts cannot be repealed while the miniſtry objects, and if to remove the objections the Americans muſt give up their ſentiments, we muſt candidly confeſs we have little hopes of a repeal ever taking place; much leſs it is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that the merchants will preſume to petition parliament on the principle of inexpediency only, when every aſſembly on the continent are apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for a repeal on the principle of right. The
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:014019_0054_0F92872ED20F5E08"/>
merchants are too ſenſible how jealous the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans are of their liberty ever to hazard ſuch a ſtep. We apprehend that advantage may have been taken from a ſuppoſed diſunion of the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and therefore think it our duty to inform you, that the merchants of this province have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways agreed with the other coloniſts in opinion, "that the late revenue acts were unconſtitutional;" though they refuſed to adopt a meaſure which at one time they believed to be premature. They were ſenſible that mutual intereſt is the beſt ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of nations; that by trade and commerce the union between Great-Britain and the colonies is beſt preſerved. They knew that multitudes in Great-Britain would be ſuffers by a ſuſpenſion of trade with her; they were willing therefore to try what could be done by a memorial to their friends in England, who had ſo generally, and to ſo good purpoſe, interpoſed before, and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted ſo much to the repeal of the ſtamp act; but no ſooner were they apprized that no hope re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained of a repeal in this ſeſſion, than they una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly entered into the very agreement which ſome months before, when propoſed to them, they had declined.</p>
               <p>This agreement being formed on mature delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, we are of opinion the people of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince will firmly adhere to it. We are glad to hear the idea of raiſing taxes in America begins among all ranks with you, of every party, to loſe ground: Happy had it been for both countries if it had never been ſtarted: However, if the acts complained of are repealed, and no other of the like nature are attempted hereafter, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unhappy jealouſies will, we believe, quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:014019_0055_0F928730C43B2CF8"/>
ſubſide, and the people of both countries in a ſhort time return to their uſual good humour, confidence and affection.</p>
               <p>As it is uncertain whether the parliament, if they ſhould think proper to repeal the acts, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a duty on tea, paper, glaſs, &amp;c. imported into America, will directly enter into a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our other grievances, we muſt content ourſelves for the preſent with bearing our teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony againſt the ſeveral regulations of which we complained in our memorial, and earneſtly requeſt you to uſe your endeavours to obtain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs of thoſe matters whenever you imagine there is a probability of ſucceeding. We are, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,</p>
