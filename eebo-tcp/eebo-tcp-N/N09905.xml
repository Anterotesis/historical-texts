            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>AN ORATION.</head>
            <p>WHEN we turn over the hiſtoric page, and trace the riſe and fall of ſtates and empires; the mighty revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which have ſo often varied the face of the world ſtrike our minds with ſolemn ſurprize, and we are naturally led to endeavor to ſearch out the cauſes of ſuch aſtoniſhing changes.</p>
            <p>THAT Man is formed for <hi>ſocial life,</hi> is an obſervation which upon our firſt enquiry preſents itſelf immediately to our view, and our reaſon approves that wiſe and generous principle which actuated the firſt founders of civil government; an inſtitution which hath its origin in the <hi>weakneſs</hi> of individuals, and hath for its end, the <hi>ſtrength and ſecurity</hi> of all: And ſo long as the means of effecting this important end, are thoroughly known and religiouſly attended to, Government is one of the richeſt Bleſſings to mankind, and ought to be held in the higheſt veneration.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:012600_0005_0F8B3BBBA5D93198"/>
IN young and new-formed communities, the grand deſign of this inſtitution is moſt generally underſtood, and moſt ſtrictly regarded; the motives which urged to the ſocial compact cannot be at once forgotten, and <hi>that</hi> equality which is remembered to have ſubſiſted ſo lately among them, prevents thoſe who are cloathed with authority from attempting to invade the freedom of their Brethren; or if ſuch an attempt is made, it prevents the community from ſuffering the offender to go unpuniſhed: Every member feels it to be his intereſt, and knows it to be his duty, to preſerve inviolate the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution on which the public ſafety depends<note n="*" place="bottom">Omnes ordines ad conſervamdam rempublicam, mente, voluntate, ſtudio, virtute, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </note>, and is equally ready to aſſiſt the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> in the execution of the laws, and the <hi>ſubject</hi> in defence of his right; and ſo long as this noble attachment to a conſtitution, founded on free and benevolent principles exiſts in full vigor in any ſtate, <hi>that</hi> ſtate muſt be flouriſhing and happy.</p>
            <p>IT was <hi>this</hi> noble attachment to a free conſtitution, which raiſed ancient Rome from the ſmalleſt beginnings to that bright ſummit of happineſs and glory to which ſhe arrived; and it was the loſs of <hi>this</hi> which plunged her from <hi>that</hi> ſummit into the black gulph of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy and ſlavery. It was <hi>this</hi> attachment which inſpired her ſena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors with wiſdom; it was <hi>this</hi> which glowed in the breaſts of her heroes; it was <hi>this</hi> which guarded her liberties, and extended her dominions, gave peace at home and commanded reſpect abroad: And when <hi>this</hi> decayed, her magiſtrates loſt their reverence for juſtice and the laws, and degenerated into tyrants and oppreſſors—her ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:012600_0006_0F8B3BBDA7862DE8"/>
forgetful of their dignity, and ſeduced by baſe corruption, betrayed their country—her ſoldiers regardleſs of their relation to the community, and urged <hi>only</hi> by the hopes of plunder and rapine, unfeelingly committed the moſt flagrant enormities; and hired to the trade of death, with relentleſs fury they perpetrated the moſt cruel murders, whereby the ſtreets of imperial Rome were drenched with her <hi>nobleſt</hi> blood—Thus <hi>this empreſs</hi> of the world loſt her dominions abroad, and her inhabitants diſſolute in their manners, at length became contented <hi>ſlaves;</hi> and ſhe ſtands to this day, the ſcorn and deriſion of nations, and a monument of this eternal truth, that PUBLIC HAPPINESS DEPENDS ON A VIRTUOUS AND UNSHAKEN ATTACHMENT TO A FREE CONSTITUTION.</p>
            <p>IT was <hi>this</hi> attachment to a conſtitution, founded on free and benevolent principles, which inſpired the firſt ſettlers of this country:—They ſaw with grief the daring outrages committed on the free conſtitution of their native land—they knew that nothing but a civil war could at that time reſtore it's priſtine purity. So hard was it to reſolve to embrue their hands in the <hi>blood</hi> of their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, that they choſe rather to quit their fair poſſeſſions and ſeek another habitation in a diſtant clime—When they came to this new world, which they fairly purchaſed of the Indian natives, the only rightful proprietors, they cultivated the then barren ſoil by their inceſſant labor, and defended their dear-bought poſſeſſions with the fortitude of the chriſtian, and the bravery of the hero.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:012600_0007_0F8B3BBEAB868848"/>
AFTER various ſtruggles, which during the tyrannic reigns of the houſe of STUART, were conſtantly kept up between right and wrong, between liberty and ſlavery, the connection between Great-Britain and this Colony was ſettled in the reign of King William and Queen Mary by a compact, the conditions of which were expreſſed in a Charter; by which all the liberties and immunities of BRITISH SUBJECTS were confirmed to this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, as fully and as abſolutely as they poſſibly could be by any human inſtrument which can be deviſed. And it is undeniably true, that the greateſt and moſt important right of a Britiſh ſubject is, that <hi>he ſhall be governed by no laws but thoſe to which he either in perſon or by his repreſentative hath given his conſent:</hi> And this I will venture to aſſert, is the grand baſis of Britiſh freedom; it is interwoven with the conſtitution; and whenever this is loſt, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution muſt be deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Britiſh conſtitution</hi> (of which ours is a copy) is a happy compound of the three forms (under ſome of which all govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments may be ranged) <abbr>viz.</abbr> Monarchy, Ariſtocracy, and Democracy: Of theſe three the <hi>Britiſh Legiſlature</hi> is compoſed, and without the conſent of each branch, nothing can carry with it the force of a law: In moſt caſes, either the ariſtocratic or the democratic branch may propoſe a law, and ſubmit it to the deliberation of the other two; but, when a law is to be paſſed for raiſing a tax, that law can origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate only in the democratic branch, which is the Houſe of Commons in Britain, and the Houſe of Repreſentatives here—The reaſon is obvious: They, and their conſtituents are to pay much the largeſt
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:012600_0008_0F8B3BBEE9DA66B8"/>
part of it, but as the ariſtrocratic branch, which in Britain, is the Houſe of Lords, and in this province, the Council, are alſo to pay ſome part, THEIR conſent is neceſſary; and as the monarchic branch, which in Britain is the King, and with us, either the King in perſon, or the Governor whom he ſhall be pleaſed to appoint to act in his ſtead, is ſuppoſed to have a juſt ſenſe of his own <hi>intereſt,</hi> which is <hi>that</hi> of all the ſubjects in general, HIS conſent is alſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and when the conſent of theſe three branches is obtained, the taxation is moſt certainly legal.</p>
            <p>LET us now allow ourſelves a few moments to examine the <hi>late acts of the Britiſh parliament for taxing America</hi>—Let us with candor judge whether they are conſtitutionally binding upon us:—If they are, IN THE NAME OF JUSTICE let us ſubmit to them, without one murmuring word.</p>
            <p>FIRST, I would aſk whether the members of the Britiſh Houſe of Commons are the Democracy of this Province? if they are, they are either the people of this province, or are elected by the people of this province, to repreſent them, and have therefore a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional right to originate a Bill for taxing them: It is moſt certain they are neither; and therefore nothing done by <hi>them</hi> can be ſaid to be done by the democratic branch of our conſtitution. I would next aſk, whether the Lords who compoſe the ariſtocratic branch of the Britiſh legiſlature, are Peers of America? I never heard it was (even in theſe extraordinary times) ſo much as pretended,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:012600_0009_0F8B3BBFA76962D0"/>
and if they are not, certainly no act of <hi>theirs</hi> can be ſaid to be the act of the ariſtocratic branch of our conſtitution. The power of the monarchic branch we with pleaſure acknowledge, reſides in the King, who may act either in perſon or by his repreſentative; and I freely confeſs that I can ſee no reaſon why a PROCLAMATION <hi>for raiſing money in America</hi> iſſued by the King's <hi>ſole</hi> authority, would not be equally conſiſtent with our conſtitution, and therefore equally binding upon us with the <hi>late acts of the Britiſh parliament for taxing us;</hi> for it is plain, that if there is any validity in <hi>thoſe acts,</hi> it muſt ariſe altogether from the monarchical branch of the legiſlature: And I further think that it would be at leaſt as equitable; for I do not conceive it to be of the leaſt importance to us by <hi>whom</hi> our property is taken away, ſo long as it is taken without our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; and I am very much at a loſs to know by what figure of rhetoric, the inhabitants of this province can be called FREE SUB<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>JECTS, when they are obliged to obey implicitly, ſuch laws as are made for them by men three thouſand miles off, whom they know not, and whom they never have impowered to act for them; or how they can be ſaid to have PROPERTY, when a body of men over whom they have not the leaſt controul, and who are not in any way accountable to them, ſhall oblige them to deliver up any part, or the whole of their ſubſtance, without even aſking their conſent: And yet, whoever pretends that the late acts of the Britiſh parliament for taxing America ought to be deemed binding upon us, muſt admit at once that we are abſolute SLAVES, and have no property of our own; or elſe that we may be FREE-MEN, and at the ſame time under a neceſſity of obeying the <hi>arbitrary commands of thoſe</hi> over
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:012600_0010_0F8B3BC06809FC18"/>
whom we have no controul or influence; and that we may HAVE PROPERTY OF OUR OWN, which is entirely at the diſpoſal of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Such groſs abſurdities, I believe will not be reliſhed in this enlightened age: And it can be no matter of wonder that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple quickly perceived, and ſeriouſly complained of the inroads which theſe acts muſt unavoidably make upon their <hi>Liberty,</hi> and of the hazard to which their <hi>whole property</hi> is by <hi>them</hi> expoſed; for, if they may be taxed without their conſent even the ſmalleſt trifle, they may alſo without their conſent be deprived of every thing they poſſeſs, although never ſo valuable, never ſo dear. Certainly it never entered the hearts of our anceſtors, that after ſo many dangers in this then deſolate wilderneſs, their hard-earned property ſhould be at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of the Britiſh parliament; and as it was ſoon found that this taxation could not be ſupported by reaſon and argument, it ſeemed neceſſary that one act of oppreſſion ſhould be enforced by another, and therefore, contrary to our juſt rights as poſſeſſing, or at leaſt having a juſt title to poſſeſs, all the <hi>liberties</hi> and IMMUNITIES of Britiſh ſubjects, a ſtanding army was eſtabliſhed among us in time of peace; and evidently for the purpoſe of effecting <hi>that,</hi> which it was one principal deſign of the founders of the conſtitution to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, (when they declared a ſtanding army in time of peace to be AGAINST LAW) namely, for the enforcement of obedience to acts which upon fair examination appeared to be unjuſt and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional.</p>

THE ruinous conſequences of ſtanding armies to free communities may be ſeen in the hiſtories of SYRACUSE, ROME, and many other once flouriſhing STATES; ſome of which have now ſcarce a name! Their baneful influence is moſt ſuddenly felt, when they are placed in populous cities; for, by a corruption of morals, the public happineſs is immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately affected; and that this is one of the effects of quartering troops in a populous city, is a truth, to which many a mourning parent, many a loſt, deſpairing child in this metropolis, muſt bear a very me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy teſtimony.—Soldiers are alſo taught to conſider arms as the only arbiters by which every diſpute is to be decided between con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending ſtates;—they are inſtructed <hi>implicitly</hi> to obey their comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, without enquiring into the juſtice of the cauſe they are engaged to ſupport: Hence it is, that they are ever to be dreaded as the ready engines of tyranny and oppreſſion.—And it is too obſervable that they are prone to introduce the ſame mode of deciſion in the diſputes of individuals, and from thence have often ariſen great ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſities between <hi>them</hi> and <hi>the inhabitants,</hi> who whilſt in a naked defenceleſs ſtate, are frequently inſulted and abuſed by an armed ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery. And this will be more eſpecially the caſe, when the troops are informed, that the intention of their being ſtationed in any city, is to OVERAWE THE INHABITANTS. That, <hi>this</hi> was the avowed deſign of ſtationing an armed force in this town, is ſufficiently known; and WE, my fellow-citizens have ſeen, WE have felt the tragical effects!—THE FATAL FIFTH OF MARCH 1770, CAN NEVER BE FOR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GOTTEN—The horrors of THAT DREADFUL NIGHT are but too deeply impreſſed on our hearts—Language is too feeble to paint the emotions of our ſouls, when our ſtreets were ſtained with the BLOOD
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:012600_0012_0F8B3BC26F7F83F0"/>
OF OUR BRETHREN,—when our ears were wounded by the groans of the <hi>dying,</hi> and our eyes were tormented with the ſight of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled bodies of the <hi>dead.</hi>—When our alarmed imagination preſented to our view our houſes wrapt in flames,—our children ſubjected to the barbarous caprice of the raging ſoldiery—our beauteous virgins expoſed to all the inſolence of unbridled paſſion,—our virtuous wives endeared to us by every tender tie, falling a ſacrifice to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> worſe than brutal violence, and perhaps like the famed LUCRETIA, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted with anguiſh and deſpair, ending their wretched lives by their own fair hands.—When we beheld the authors of our diſtreſs parading in our ſtreets, or drawn up in regular <hi>battalia,</hi> as though in a hoſtile city; our hearts beat to arms; we ſnatched our weapons, almoſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved by one deciſive ſtroke, to avenge the death of our SLAUGH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TERED BRETHREN, and to ſecure from future danger, all that we held moſt dear: But propitious heaven forbad the bloody carnage, and ſaved the threatned victims of our too keen reſentment, not by their diſcipline, not by their regular array,—no, it was royal GEORGE's livery that proved their ſhield—it was that which turned the pointed engines of deſtruction from their breaſts.<note n="†" place="bottom">I have the ſtrongeſt reaſon to believe that I have mentioned the only circumſtance, which ſaved the troops from deſtruction. It was then, and now is, the opinion of thoſe who were beſt acquainted with the ſtate of affairs at that time, that had thrice that number of troops, belonging to any power at open war with us, been in this town in the ſame expoſed condition, ſcarce a man would have lived to have ſeen the morning light.</note> The thoughts of vengeance were ſoon buried in our inbred affection to Great-Britain, and calm reaſon dictated a method of removing the troops more mild than an immediate recourſe to the ſword. With united

efforts you urged the immediate departure of the troops from the town—you urged it, with a reſolution which enſured ſucceſs—you obtained your wiſhes, and the removal of the troops was effected, without one drop of <hi>their blood</hi> being ſhed by the inhabitants!</p>
            <p>THE immediate actors in the tragedy of THAT NIGHT were ſurrendered to juſtice.—It is not mine to ſay how far they were guilty! they have been tried by the country and ACQUITTED of murder! And they are not to be again arraigned at an earthly bar: But, ſurely the men who have promiſcuouſly ſcattered <hi>death</hi> amidſt the <hi>innocent</hi> inhabitants of a populous city, ought to ſee well to it, that they be prepared to ſtand at the bar of an OMNISCIENT JUDGE! And all who contrived or encouraged the ſtationing troops in this place, have reaſons of eternal importance, to reflect with deep contrition on their baſe deſigns, and humbly to repent of their impious machinations.</p>
            <p>THE infatuation which hath ſeemed for a number of years to prevail in the Britiſh councils with regard to us, is truly aſtoniſhing! What can be propoſed by the repeated attacks made upon our free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, I really cannot ſurmiſe; even leaving juſtice and humanity out of the queſtion, I do not know one ſingle advantage which can ariſe to the Britiſh nation, from our being enſlaved:—I know not of any gains, which can be wrung from us by oppreſſion, which they may not obtain from us by our own conſent in the ſmooth channel of commerce: We wiſh the wealth and proſperity of <hi>Britain;</hi> we contribute largely to both.—Doth what we contribute loſe all its value,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:012600_0014_0F8B3BC513FFA4E8"/>
becauſe it is done voluntarily? The amazing increaſe of riches to <hi>Britain,</hi> the great riſe of the value of her lands, the flouriſhing ſtate of her navy; are ſtriking proofs of the advantages derived to her, from her commerce with the Colonies; and it is our earneſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that ſhe may ſtill continue to enjoy the ſame emoluments, until her ſtreets are paved with AMERICAN GOLD; only, let us have the pleaſure of calling it our own, whilſt it is in our hands;—but this it ſeems is too great a favor—we are to be governed by the <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute commands of others, our property is to be taken away without our conſent</hi>—if we complain, our complaints are treated with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt; if we aſſert our rights, that aſſertion is deemed inſolence; if we humbly offer to ſubmit the matter to the impartial deciſion of reaſon, the SWORD is judged the moſt proper argument to ſilence our murmurs!—But, this cannot long be the caſe—ſurely, the <hi>Britiſh</hi> nation will not ſuffer the reputation of their juſtice, and their honor, to be thus ſported away by a <hi>capricious miniſtry;</hi> no, they will in a ſhort time open their eyes to their true intereſt: They nouriſh in their own breaſts a noble love of Liberty, they hold her dear, and they know that all who have once poſſeſſed her charms had rather die than ſuffer her to be torn from their em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces—They are alſo ſenſible that <hi>Britain</hi> is ſo deeply intereſted in the proſperity of the colonies, that ſhe muſt eventually feel every wound given to their freedom; they cannot be ignorant that more dependence may be placed on the affections of a BROTHER, than on the forced ſervices of a SLAVE—They muſt approve your efforts for the preſervation of your rights; from a ſympathy of ſoul they muſt pray for your ſucceſs: And I doubt not but they will e'er long

alarming dangers; neither the ravenous beaſts that ranged the woods for prey; nor the more furious ſavages of the wilderneſs; could damp their ardor!—Whilſt with one hand, they broke the ſtubborn glebe; with the other, they graſped their weapons, ever ready to protect her from danger.—No ſacrifice, not even their own blood, was eſteemed too rich a libation for her altar! God proſpered their valour, they preſerved her brillancy unſullied, they enjoyed her whilſt they lived, and dying, bequeathed the dear inheritance, to your care. And as they left you this glorious legacy, they have undoubtedly tranſmitted to you, ſome portion of their noble ſpirit, to inſpire you with virtue to merit her, and courage to preſerve her; you ſurely cannot, with ſuch examples before your eyes, as every page of the hiſtory of this country affords;<note n="*" place="bottom">
