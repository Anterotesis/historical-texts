            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A SERMON.</head>
            <p>THERE is a paſſage in Sacred Writ, which has been revived in my remembrance during the ſilence of this meeting, and the train of reflections which it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, has ſeal'd inſtruction to my mind, and furniſh'd me with renewed cauſe of humiliation and gratitude; <hi>"Men and Brethren, what ſhall we do to be ſaved?"</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Every perſon who ſeriouſly believes in the exiſtence of a God, in a future ſtate, and in the awful doctrine of rewards and puniſhments, cannot be indifferent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting what may be his lot, when he ſhall be diſpoſſeſſed of this frail Tabernacle of clay which he now inhabits, and which is approaching to the period of its diſſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; it cannot be a matter of indifference to him, whether he ſhall finally receive the irrevocable ſentence of "go ye curſed into the regions of irremediable miſery;" or <q>come ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for the righteous, enter thou into the Joy of thy Lord, and into thy maſters reſt.</q> This concern has prompted many to enquire what is eſſentially neceſſary for them to believe and practiſe in order to render them the proper objects of divine complacence and furniſh them with a well grounded hope of a glorious and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py immortality. Many of the honeſt and ſincere of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Nation under Heaven, have formed different ideas
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:015796_0003_0F9A2BD8D18C66B0"/>of the requiſites to ſalvation, and of courſe have <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> as different meaſures to accompliſh that deſirable end. It is not my preſent buſineſs, to particularize any of thoſe various ſyſtems of Faith, which are adopted by any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty amongſt mankind; it is not to controvert matters, in which ſincere men of the various denominations moſt ſurely believe; but rather to recommend them always to ſtand open to conviction, and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> attention to thoſe rules of conduct, which appear to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> moſt agrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the will of Heaven. I ſhall therefore addreſs my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to thoſe, in whatever religious ſociety they are found, whoſe honeſt inquiries have not yet been attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſufficient conviction, or led them clearly to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive what are the terms on which their future hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs depends, and who are therefore looking one upon another, whilſt this important queſtion is found, at leaſt in their hearts if not in their mouths <q>Men and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren what ſhall we do to be ſaved?</q>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall not preſume arrogantly to dictate to any reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing matters of ſo important a concern as that of the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Soul; every Man ſhould exerciſe thoſe talents with which the Father of lights has endued him, in a cloſe and ſincere attention to the voice of the internal Teacher, and in the diſcovery of thoſe truths both prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical and ſpeculative which have an immediate relation to the happineſs of a Being circumſtanced as he is. I ſhall ſimply propoſe thoſe things which from my own expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience as an individual appear to me worthy of God for their Author, and worthy of Man's moſt ſerious atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It is an indiſputable truth that we made not our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: <q>We are thine offspring, thou haſt made us and not we ourſelves,</q> ſays the prophet in his appeal to God. The matter which forms the univerſe, the vehicles which the ſoul informs, and the intellectual powers and facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties we poſſeſs, derived their being from the eternal maintain of all power and intelligence, whom we cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racterize
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:015796_0004_0F9A2BD991978658"/>by the awful names of Jah, Jehovah and God. It is alſo clear to me that we were brought into exiſtence with the benevolent deſign of finally ſuſtaining the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluent dignities of Glory, Honour, Immortality and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life; the Lord Almighty hath in unſpeakable mercy promiſed, that after we have endured a ſeaſon of proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on earth, a conflict with our paſſions excited by numerous cauſes, and a fight of afflictions, we ſhould finally receive a glorious reward, a perpetuity of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed felicity in the unknown regions of eternity. But this deſirable and excellent end is not to be effected, by what is generally call'd fate, the laws of neceſſity, or the arbitrary will and power of the Author of our exiſtence. God has conſtituted us free and intelligent beings, and endued us with faculties capable of apprehending and practiſing thoſe duties which he makes the condition of our final acceptance with him he offers, but does not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, happineſs on his creatures; he ſhows us the ſpiritual Canaan, he gives us power to poſſeſs it, but does not compel us to enter into it; good and evil are clearly ſet before us, but our election is not conſtrained to either; the ſovereign of the univerſe is no reſpecter of perſons, for of one blood he made all nations that dwell on the face of the earth; they ſtand in the ſame relation to the univerſal Father, Shepherd and Biſhop of Souls, who tenderly invites the whole race of Mankind to inherit the Joy of his Salvation. To this doctrine the holy Apoſtle bore an ample and explicit teſtimony: <q>Of a truth, ſaid he, I perceive that God is no reſpecter of perſons, but in every nation thoſe who fear him and work righteouſneſs ſhall be accepted of him.</q>— <q>If ye live after the fleſh ye ſhall die, but if through the ſpirit ye mortify the deeds of the body, ye ſhall live.</q> This is a propoſition that relates to every individual in the vaſt community of Mankind, however circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, whether bond or free, or in whatever climate he reſides.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:015796_0005_0F9A2BDA4F2A2BF0"/>
All this indeed may be acknowledg'd both by thoſe within and without the audience of my voice, who are yet in doubt what they ſhall do to be ſaved with an everlaſting ſalvation; they want to be intormed of the preciſe ideas that ſhould be affixed to the conditions contained in the text, though perhaps they readily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the terms life and death imply future happineſs and miſery. I ſhall therefore attempt according to the ability I am endued with, to give you my thoughts on the important ſubject in queſtion at this time. To "live after the fleſh" is to live in the gratification of our animal appetites and paſſions, beyond the bounds of reaſon, temperance and ſobriety, which as it frequently introduces numerous diſorders into the animal ſyſtem, and aggravates the infirmities to which theſe corruptible bodies are incident, ſo it affects the good of ſociety, and renders unfit for thoſe contemplations and that felicity which is adapted to the dignity of rational and immortal ſpirits, beings whom God in his wiſdom has made a little (and perhaps but a little) lower than the Angels, and who would crown them with a ſuperior glory, honour and happineſs than that which animal gratifications can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer on their deluded votaries. Whilſt we are in the body we muſt expect to find thoſe appetites, affections and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions which belong to our nature; but theſe are to be reſtricted within the bounds of virtue, and attended to in proportion to our exigencies and neceſſities, of which the divine principle which God has graciouſly implanted in our hearts ought to determine.</p>
            <p>This principle of intelligence although call'd by a variety of names in the different profeſſions amongſt Men, is the ſame in nature throughout all Mankind. It is the ſpirit in Man that giveth a right underſtanding; it is the light that more or leſs enlightens every Man; it is the word of God in the heart; the word of faith which the Apoſtle preach'd to the Gentiles; it is the
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:015796_0006_0F9A2BDB0F3CB9F0"/>Grace that hath appear'd to all Men, teaching them to deny ungodlineſs and the worlds juſts, and to live ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly, righteouſly and godly in this preſent world; and finally it is the ſupreme reaſon, the law of truth and rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, the teſt of virtue and vice, which God himſelf hath erected in the hearts of all Men; and happy are thoſe who hear and obey it in all things.</p>
            <p>I would not be underſtood to mean that this principle of which I am ſpeaking is deſigned to inſtruct us in all truths which the human mind may attempt to inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, or to give a clear inſight into thoſe numerous ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative ſubjects, which have, not only unprofitably em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd mankind and diverted their attention from more ſubſtantial objects, but which have perplexed and divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them from generation to generation; but by the exerciſe of it we may apprehend thoſe truths that belong to us, and have an eſſential relation to the important end of our exiſtence; of which truths the Father of ſpirits has enabled us to judge; this is imply'd by the queſtion which our Lord himſelf propoſed to a people miſled by the traditions of their fathers, and who had taken for doctrine the commandments of men, <q>yea and why judge ye not for yourſelves, what is right?</q>
            </p>
            <p>Various are our obligations and duties, religious, rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and ſocial, ariſing trom our various connections, natural and divine: The relation we ſtand in to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of our being is that of Children; filial fear, obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and worſhip is therefore our indiſpenſible duty to him, in our conduct at all times, throughout our whole lives. The relation which our fellow creatures ſtand in to us is that of brethren, children of the ſame univerſal Father, and formed for the ſame glorious and happy and; juſtice, charity and brotherly kindneſs are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our indiſpenſable obligations unto mankind. There are alſo various accidental relations, ſuch as father, governor, maſter, ſervant and numerous others, all
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:015796_0007_0F9A2BDBCF8D9140"/>which have their coreſpondent duties. Thus far per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the perſons whom I immediately addreſs at this time may concur with me in ſentiment, but they as well as I, are perhaps conſcious of having fail'd in nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous inſtances of diſcharging their religious duties to God and their ſocial duties to mankind. We have all ſinned and fallen ſhort of the glory of God! we have multiplied our tranſgreſſions without number! and our iniquities riſe before us as a thick cloud! which obſcures the brightneſs of that eternal Sun of righteouſneſs, which would otherwiſe illuminate our underſtandings with its marvellous light. Who, therefore, (ſays the illuminated penitent ſoul) ſhall deliver us from the body of this death? who ſhall take from us the weight of our ſins under which we groan inceſſantly? who ſhall ſave us from the wrath to come? "Men and Brethren what ſhall we do to be ſaved?" The condition of our recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation and redemption are very clearly expreſs'd in the ſacred oracles of truth; the placability of the divine nature is repeatedly aſſerted; he is repreſented to us in the adorable character of a God of mercy, long ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and of unſpeakable kindneſs; as a Being ready to blot out our tranſgreſſions from the celeſtial regiſter, on our ſincere repentance, and to remember them no more.</p>
            <p>This important and intereſting doctrine was typified under the Law, ſpoken of by the Prophets, and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly aſſerted by the Son of God, who is our Mediator with the Father, and the hope of our future Glory. In his character was diſplayed to Mankind, in the moſt eminent and ſtriking manner, the provident care, mercy and goodneſs of God toward the whole rational creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; who like ſheep have gone aſtray from the univerſal ſhepherd and biſhop of Souls, who have widely wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered from the paths of purity and holineſs, which are ways of pleaſantneſs and peace; that path of the
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:015796_0008_0F9A2BDC9091FD38"/>juſt Man, which (like the luminous orb as it ariſes in our hemiſphere) ſhines with increaſing refulgency, ſplendour and brightneſs, till it arrives at the meridian altitude of a gloriouſly perfect day! This path leads all who ſteadily purſue its direction, by degrees of experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, through the wilderneſs of this world to the grand and ultimate end of our Creation, to that compleat frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of bliſs that is figuratively repreſented to us by <q>a City that hath foundations, whoſe builder and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker God is;</q> a City <q>whoſe Walls are ſalvation, and whoſe Gates are eternal praiſe;</q> a City that hath no need of the elementary light of Sun, Moon and Stars, "for the Lord God and the Lamb are the light thereof" a City where God reigns triumphantly amongſt his ſaints, and is to them an inexhauſtible fountain of light and felicity; there the weary pilgrim finds an end of all his anxiety and labour, and receives the reward of his faith, the fruition of his hopes, even the ſalvation of his Soul.</p>
            <p>The important meſſage which Chriſt had in commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from his Father and our Father, from his God and our God, was, that he compaſſionated his Creatures, encompaſs'd with the diſtreſſes which their ſins had brought upon them, that he will'd not their everlaſting ſeparation from him the ſource of happineſs, that he was willing they ſhould be reconciled to him; he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore call'd upon them to <hi>Repent and be converted that their ſins might be forgiven them, and that they might finally enter into his reſt.</hi> This was the intereſting doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine which the Saviour of Man promulgated, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py are thoſe who hear and obey it. <q>Repent and be converted that your ſins may be forgiven you.</q> It is not the aſſent of the lip and of the tongue to the glorious truths of the Goſpel; but a ſurrender of the will and affections, a renovation of heart, and conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity to the divine Image, which can alone gain us admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion into the New Jeruſalem, the City of God.</p>

If we take an impartial ſurvey of our paſt lives, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view our frequent revoltings, and compare our conduct with the convictions we have often received of right and wrong, virtue and vice, there is ſcarcely a Soul preſent but muſt feel ſome degree of remorſe, ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of repentance for the turpitude of his morals, and his want of love, obedience and gratitude to ſo gracious a Father, who has encompaſs'd us with bleſſings, and preſerved us by his providence from the earlieſt period of our lives to the preſent hour; we muſt (I ſay again) upon ſerious retroſpection, poſſeſs ſome degree of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; but unhappily for us the impreſſions that are made on our minds by ſuch a review of our actions, are frequently eraſed by the influence which a variety of creaturely objects are ſuffer'd to have upon us, and like the early dew they ſoon paſs away. Thoſe who have been cleanſed in ſome degree by the water of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, are often deſiled again by the repetition of that iniquity which in the moments of their humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they had determined to renounce and forſake, they are again caught in the ſnare of their luſts, and capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated by thoſe objects which have a tendency to alienate their affections from the ſupreme good. Thus when the force of conviction again ſounds the awakning alarm, they are ready to query with ſurpriſe and anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iety <q>what is to be done in this afflictive dilemma to which our inconſtancy to our virtuous reſolutions has reduced us? ſhall we deſpair of that divine mercy we have ſo often abuſed of that goodneſs we have ſo long trifled with?</q> God forbid! rather proſtrate your Souls at the Throne of Grace, and humbly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore the continued mercy of the univerſal parent, as a Father pitieth his Children, ſo he pitieth them that fear him; he knoweth our frame, he remembereth that we are but duſt; beſeech him therefore to ſend forth help from his holy ſanctuary, that you may be ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:015796_0010_0F9A2BDE10F80650"/>to renew and keep your Covenants with him; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain from the commiſſion or evil, and wait on him in the ſilence of all fleſh; ſince it hath pleaſed him again to enlighten your darkneſs, and thus to give you to ſee yourſelves as you are ſeen of him; he may alſo be pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to inflame your hearts with that celeſtial fire which purgeth away all the intellectual ſith and droſs, that prevents the aſcent of the Soul godward, and renders it an unſit habitation for his holineſs to dwell in. As our backſlidings have frequently corrected us and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd our minds with anxiety, let our future conduct directed by his Grace, atone for what is paſs'd, and by a converſation ordered aright, let us glority our Father who is in Heaven.</p>
            <p>I feel at this ſeaſon the influence (in degree) of that celeſtial Charity which breathes through Immanuel to the whole creation of God, wiſhing ſalvation to every Soul that inhabits the earth; in which I intreat you (as a being ſubject to the ſame infirmities which you ſometimes unavailably deplore) <q>repent and be conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;</q> repentance you have frequently experienced, but too little I fear of that eſſential converſion which the Goſpel of Jeſus propoſes, 'tis highly probable that ſome perſons preſent have ſeen the neceſſity of that reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of heart and reformation of manners intended by converſion, but urged by the powerful prevalency of their luſts, would if poſſible find ſome other remedy for a wounded conſcience, than that which the ſimplicity of the Goſpel requires, as a neceſſary prelude to the favour of God; like the young Man in the Goſpel, they have been animated with a deſire to be enroll'd amongſt the diſciples of Jeſus, who are called Heirs of God and Co-heirs with Chriſt of that inheritance which is incorruptable and full of Giory; they have aſked counſel of the wonderful counſellor, addreſling him with this important queſtion, <q>what good thing ſhall I do,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:015796_0011_0F9A2BDECFE5D300"/>that I may inherit eternal life?</q> yet when the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changable terms of ſalvation have been propoſed, when they have been 'told that they muſt part with all their Idols, they have gone away ſorrowful, the terms have appear'd too hard for them to comply with; and like Naaman who wanted to be cur'd of his Leproſy, and was ſtagger'd at the thought of taking ſo long a journey as the Prophet directed, are crying out <q>are not Abana and Pharphar rivers of Damaſcus better than all the waters of Iſrael, may I not waſh in them and be clean?</q> thus numbers amongſt Mankind are ſtriving to elude the meaſures which the Goſpel of Jeſus enjoins, and are ſubſtituting others in their ſtead, which are better adapted to ſooth the carnal mind, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent that mortification which human nature ſhrinks from.</p>
            <p>Man is deſirous to poſſeſs the crown of eternal life, but not to bear the Croſs; he would indeed reign with Chriſt, but not ſuffer with him; he would accompany him to the mount of transfiguration, but not to Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotha; he would be his attendant at his Glorification, but not in the awful ſcene of his Humiliation.</p>
            <p>Divers have wander'd as from mountain to moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and from hill to hill, ſeeking for the living in the Sepulchres of the Dead, they have ſometimes adpoted one creed, and ſometimes another, practiſed external ordinances, and comply'd with empty forms, addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing themſelves frequently to guides as blind and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent as themſelves with this awful enquiry <q>Men and Brethren what ſhall we do to be ſaved?</q> "I ſay again, "repent and be converted," for this is the only way to find ſalvation to your Souls; no external ceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, no verbal confeſſions, nor any change of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions merely, can accompliſh this repentance and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, and afford you the conſequent reward of a glorious immortallity, this important work of ſalvation
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:015796_0012_0F9A2BDF9056B958"/>muſt be effected in man, by the powerful operation of the Holy Ghoſt, which is a conſuming fire to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe part in Man, to the corrupt and perverſe will, which would not that Chriſt ſhould reign in his Kingdom, and that God ſhould be all in all. It is the Baptiſm of fire (of which John's was but a type) which diſcriminat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the pure from the impure, gathers the Wheat into the Garner but conſumes the chaff with unquenchable burnings.</p>
            <p>In the world there are many voices which correſpond not with the voice of Chriſt, the only Shepherd of Souls (whom we ought to hear and obey in all things) but are the voices of thoſe who preach for hire and divine for Money; who look for their gain from their reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive quarters; and as to ſuch conſcien ous Men who cannot put into their mouths, they are ready to make war againſt them; theſe have found it for their worldly intereſt to lead the deluded people from, rather than to Chriſt, that glorious High Prieſt of the Chriſtian Religion; they have attempted to render that myſterious which the Holy Ghoſt has left clear, and to perplex the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings of Mankind with vain metaphyſical ſpeculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, without making them either wiſer or better. This claſs of Men whoſe God is their belly, and whoſe Glory is their ſhame, have indeed proved phyſicians of no real value; inſtead of laying the Axe to the root of the corrupt Tree, they have only attempted to lop off ſome of its branches; they have preſcribed emolients, where the moſt ſearching <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

There are others who aſſum-the Office of Miniſters, the purity of whoſe intentions my Charity will not permit me to doubt, who like a Man that attempts to anſwer a queſtion before he has
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:015796_0013_0F9A2BE0510BC118"/>fully heard it, have too precipitately embark'd in the important work of inſtructing Souls relative to the affairs of ſalvation; theſe are like Ephraim <q>a Cake not turn'd,</q> are not yet inſtructed in the way of God perfectly, and whilſt they are teaching others, had need themſelves to be taught, what are the firſt principles of the Oracles of God; they have run on the Lord's errand unſent, and therefore have not eſſentially profited the people; they have taken upon them to guide thoſe who are inquiring what they ſhall do to be ſaved, and have led them indeed from the confines of Egypt, but leave them (undirected to the ſpiritual Moſes) to wander in uncertainty and to compaſs a mountain of doubts in the wilderneſs. May he Lord Almighty in his mercy gather theſe who are wandering as ſheep without a Shepherd, and lead them in o the ſacred incloſure of his fold, into eternal ſafety.</p>
            <p>Let it not be thought from any thing I have ſaid, that I look upon all thoſe who appear girded with the linen Ephod, of other Chriſtian ſocieties, either as Impoſtors, or the deluded votaries of Antichriſt; I free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declare, that I doubt not but many of them have had a diſpenſation of the Goſpel committed to them, and although they may be bias'd by the prejudice of education and the traditions of their Fathers, yet the root of the matter ſeems to be in them; and I eſteem theſe (in whatever ſociety they are found or in whatever veſtments they are cloath'd) as my Brethren in the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip of the everlaſting Goſpel of Chriſt; yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not direct the ſearcher after truth who is penſively enquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what he ſhall do to be ſaved, to the Miniſtry of any Man; but would rather recommend him to the immediate teaching of the word nigh in the heart, even the ſpirit of God; this is the only infallible teacher, the primary adequate rule of faith and practice, and will lead thoſe who attend to its dictates into the peaceable
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:015796_0014_0F9A2BE1100F1968"/>paths of ſafety and of truth. <q>Ye need not (ſays the holy Apoſtle to the Church formerly) that any Man teach you, ſave as this anointing teacheth, which is truth and no lie;</q> ceaſe therefore from Man whoſe breath is in his noſtrils, and whoſe exiſtence is but a vapour, for wherein is he to be accounted of? as a falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble being he is liable to frequent deceptions, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore liable to deceive; whereas the ſpirit of God cannot be deceived, neither will it deceive any Soul that yields itſelf to its Government and obeys its dictates.</p>
            <p>O ye penitent Prodigals! my Soul earneſtly longs for your reſtoration to the mercy and favour of God! ye who are reduced by your wanderings in the wilderneſs of this world to a ſtate of extream poverty, to the want of that bread that comes down from the celeſtial Regions above, which alone can nouriſh the Soul up unto eternal Life! ye who are attempting to ſatisfy the cravings of an immortal ſpirit with the ſpiritleſs huſks and ſhells of an empty profeſſion of Religion! look towards your Father from whom you have revolted; remember that in his Houſe there is bread enough and to ſpare; there your Souls may be repleniſh'd with ever enduring ſubſtance: Return, O Houſe of Iſrael! and ſeek the face of your everlaſting friend and Father! he has in unſpeakable kindneſs declared that he will be found of thoſe who ſeek him in ſincerity of heart, and that as many as knock at the Gate of mercy for an entrance, ſhall be admitted to his preſence, and receive the remiſſion of their Sins.</p>
            <p>The humble addreſs which the Prodigal made to his Father (in that excellent parable given us by Chriſt) the Father's return to it, and the manner of his reception into favour, is exceedingly expreſſive of the becoming, penitence of the one and the mercy of the other; <q>I have ſinned againſt Heaven and in thy ſight, and am no more worthy to be called thy Son, make me
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:015796_0015_0F9A2BE1CF9F0600"/>therefore as one of thy hired Servants.</q> The injur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed parent compaſſionates his diſtreſs, takes the Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal in his arms, owns him for his Son; orders the fatted Calf to be kill'd, and rebukes the envy of his elder Brother with, <q>this my Son was dead but is alive again, was loſt but is found!</q> O the height and depth! of the goodneſs and mercy of God! look unto him all ye ends of the earth and be ye ſaved.</p>
            <p>Before I conclude, I find it in my Heart to addreſs another claſs in this Meeting, a claſs who have earneſtly ſought and happily found him of whom Moſes and the Prophets did write, Jeſus of Nazareth the Immanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us; you who once were ſcatter'd as ſheep without a ſhepherd, on the barren mountains and deſolate hills of an empty profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but the Great Shepherd of Souls hath gather'd you within the ſacred Incloſure of his Sheepfold, and you are under the peculiar protection of the Lord Almighty, you hath he pluck'd as brands out of the burning, and redeem'd to himſelf with the ſaving ſtrength of his right Arm; may you ever remember his unutterable mercy, and dedicate the remaining moments of life to the honour of his Name. My Soul ſalutes you in the endear'd affection of the Goſpel of peace, and wiſhes your eſtabliſhment in Righteouſneſs, that you may abide in holy patience the fiery tryal of your faith through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the days of your Pilgrimage on earth, and become as fixed pillars in the celeſtial building, the houſe of God, that ſhall go no more out.</p>
            <p>If ye abide in the word of faith by which ye have been taught, the malice of Men nor Devils, nor all the united powers of darkneſs, ſhall be able to pluck you out of the hand of him, who is your Judge, your King your Protector, your Father and your everlaſting Friend When the earth ſhall be wrap'd together as a ſcroll, and the Sun and Moon be darkned, when every Conſtella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:015796_0016_0F9A2BE29015FB20"/>of the Heavens ſinks into everlaſting obſcurity, and the Elements of this world ſhall melt with fervent heat; you will poſſeſs an habitation within the ſuperior regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a new Heaven and a new Earth, where the Lord your Righteouſneſs dwells.</p>
            <p>Many of pretended wiſe, learned and prudent who have ſought to climb up ſome other way, rather than to enter by Chriſt, who is the door (by the conditions which he has propoſed) into the ſheepfold, may pity you as fools, or ridicule you as enthuſiaſts, count your lives madneſs, and your end to be without honour, but they will one day be aſtoniſh'd at the ſtrangeneſs of your Salvation, when they ſee to their confuſion that you are finally number'd amongſt the Children of God, and that the lot of your Inheritance is amongſt the Saints. In the World you are to expect tribulations of various kinds; pain, ſickneſs, temptations and diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments invade the breaſt of the moſt righteous and temperate amongſt Men; the cup of mixture (more or leſs impregnated with the wormwood and the gall) is the lot of all Men, deſign'd doubtleſs to affect a value<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able purpoſe, by him who afflicts not willingly, nor without a righteous and benevolent cauſe, the Children of Men; as the Heavens are higher than the Earth ſo are the ways of Almighty Wiſdom higher than our ways, and his thoughts than our thoughts! We ſee a little, and but a very little of the amazing univerſal plan of his Government over rational and immortal ſpirits. It lies beyond the reach of the moſt exalted human faculties to comprehend his wiſdom, throughout the righteous adminiſtration of his Providence, which is unſearchable! It is our duty as frail dependant beings to meet every diſpenſation of his Providence with that reſignation of ſpirit, which inceſſantly breathes the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble language of "not my will O Lord! but thine, be done in all things!" Under the evils which we feel and
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:015796_0017_0F9A2BE34FED6C50"/>which our prudence could not prevent, let us <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

This is not the place of your reſt, but a ſtate of probation, a painful pilgrimage, a Land of pits and ſnares, through which lies a narrow Path to the regions of eternal Peace.</p>
            <p>The Soul by reaſon of its connection, with the body, incloſed within the walls of fleſh, cannot extend its views and employ its faculties on divine objects, without frequent interruption; but when the days of its captivity are accompliſh'd, it will be capable of a more glorious expanſion in the Kingdom of Immortallity, and (if bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the inſcription of Holineſs) will be put in poſſeſſion of that Joy which is unſpeakable and full of Glory. Therefore in all thoſe calunities to which we are ſubject in the houſe of our pilgrimage, we have a place of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge to flee to, where ſafety is alone to be four is though indeed we muſt feel in degred as Men, yet <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> of Chriſtians, who are looking for a better Country, a more excellent Inheritance in that City whoſe Inhabitant cannot ſay "I am Sick."</p>
            <p>Be ye therefore ſtedfaſt, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, foraſmuch as ye know than your labour ſhall not be in vain. Be ye in your ſeveral ſtations in the Church, and the world, as way-marks to the honeſt inquirers who are aſking their way to Zion, and from a true ſenſe of their condition are crying out "what ſhall we do to be ſaved?" ſhew forth by your example of Charity, Sobriety, Temperance and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Life, that you are redeem'd from the ſpirit of the world, that lies in wickedneſs; be not captivated by

            <p>Finally, my Brethren, farewell! I commend you to God, the Shepherd of Iſrael, and to the word of his Grace; this is alone able to build us up in the moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faith, to direct our feet in the way of Righteouſneſs and Peace; and finally to put us in poſſeſſion of a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Inheritance amongſt the ſaints, that will never fade away.</p>

            <p>A SOLEMN ſummons which the Almighty gave through his Prophet Joel, to a People whom he had known above all the families of the Earth, (at a time when they had revolted and departed in Heart from him) has been revived in my mind; with an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion that the ſame authority requires the repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication of it in this day, to a People likewiſe highly favour'd of him; and who have in like manner depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from their firſt love.</p>

As I am about to conclude (perhaps finally conclude) my labours amongſt you in this Quarter; I would que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with ſome, with many that are preſent, whether they have not heard intelligibly the ſound of the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, calling them with a degree of certainty, to ariſe and prepare themſelves for the Battle. My Brethren and Siſters, amongſt whom I have been conſtrain'd in the overflowings of the Fathers Love, to labour in a private capacity, breaking (I hope I may ſay) a little bread from houſe to houſe—the everlaſting Goſpel has been preach'd amongſt you with all the force of pathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic energy, with all the tenderneſs of divine compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; let it not be ineffectual! The Goſpel meſſage has been deliver'd with ſuch indubitable clearneſs, that your judgments have been convinced, you have aſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to "the Truth as it is in Jeſus;" ſuffer not the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions it has made on your minds to be ſpeedily eraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Far, very far, be it from me to think highly of myſelf, to exalt the Officer, the Miniſter. I would not that you ſhould hold any Man's perſon in high eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. I am deeply ſenſible that to me belongs "bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing confuſion of face," but I magnify mine of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and the power of him who has ſeen meet to employ me therein; I would endeavour to exalt in your view the adorable goodneſs and condeſcenſion of the great Author of all mercies, in that he has cauſed the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet to be renewedly ſounded in your borders; hear its important meſſage with ſuitable attention; let it rouſe and prepare all the ranks in the Armies of our Iſrael, to engage in the glorious Cauſe of our God. Let the Daughter of our Zion ariſe from the bed of Indolence; from the lethargic ſtupor of a fatal forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs; from all the deadning benumbing gratifications of ſenſuality, and ſhake herſelf from the duſt of the earth, that ſhe may come up to the help of him who hath called her with an high and holy calling.

<pb n="22" facs="unknown:015796_0021_0F9A2BE65186F040"/>is blown in her ſtreets, the alarm has been heard by all, Oh! let not its language be rendered unintelligible by the multiplicity of trivial things that too much ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorb the minds of many.</p>
            <p>I am fully perſuaded that the gracious Viſitation of humbling melting goodneſs, has been afreſh extended to individuals preſent, in (I had almoſt ſaid) a very me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable manner; nor will I recall the expreſſion, for if it is not treaſured up in your remembrance now, for your proſit and advantage, it will be memorable in that awful approaching period, when every neglected mercy will appear deeply engraven, as a dread <q>Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing on the wall,</q> againſt us. Let me therefore tenderly intreat you, with all the warmth of unutterable affection, as a Brother, as a fellow Pilgrim, through the viciſſitudes of time to the unmix'd Joys of a happy eternity, that you will no longer neglect the offers of Mercy, or turn a deaf ear to the reproofs of Inſtruction. I feel my mind covered with that boundleſs Love, that wiſhes, that ardently deſires, you may indeed be wiſe for yourſelves: For although I may be deficient in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny qualifications of a Goſpel Miniſter, I am not want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in that pure diſintereſted Love, which ſeeks not yours but you. <q>Blow the trumpet in Zion; ſanctify a Faſt.</q> If we were but enough attentive to the ſound of the Trumpet, we ſhould ſee the abſolute neceſſity of this ſanctified faſt; a faſt from every of thoſe deluſive pleaſures, thoſe ſlaviſh attatchments, that render the mind inſenſible of Good. <q>Call a ſolemn Aſſembly.</q> This branch of the ſummons (may ſome ſay) belongs only to a few, and we have no ſhare in the duty it enjoins. I confeſs I am of another opinion: I think every Individual has a ſhare in the Inſtruction couch'd in it. "Call a ſolemn Aſſembly." Oh! you active ones, ſtop a while in your ſwift carreer; make a ſolemn pauſe; ſtand collected from every object that
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:015796_0022_0F9A2BE70F111228"/>can gratify or delight the ſenſual part; labour diligently to aſſemble all the powers and faculties of your Souls, that they may be ſanctified by him who gave them. I believe there is no uſeleſs, dead, unactive member in the Church of God; and thoſe that can thus aſſemble the collected attention of a redeemed mind, devoted to do the divine will, have an undoubted right from the higheſt Authority to call an holy convocation. <q>We can do nothing againſt the Truth but for the Truth,</q> was the language of ſome formerly, who had indeed ſanctified an acceptable Faſt. I much deſire that thoſe who perhaps cannot be ſo active in promoting this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Cauſe amongſt the Sons of Men, as ſome who are called into more eminent ſtations in the Church, may by a circumſpect care over all their words and actions, ſee that they do nothing againſt the Truth. "Call a ſolemn aſſembly; gather the People." How ſcatter'd are many of the members of this Quarter! ſcatter'd indeed as ſheep without a ſhepherd! diſperſed up and down in the dark vale of inſenſibility and ſelf-forgetfulneſs! many upon the barren Mountains of an empty profeſſion; <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to all ſenſe of religious fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; unacquainted with that holy union in which is the bond of Peace! How many are the Gallios I have met with amongſt you, who (a as! it may be ſaid) care for none of theſe things! Oh you Elders! who are or might have been as Pillars in the Lords Houſe; you delegated Shepherds, who might have adorned the firſt ranks in the armies of our Iſrael, if you had not ſat down and taken up a reſt ſhort of thoſe glorious abodes, which are prepared for them that ſteadily perſevere in the line of divine appointment—to you the call is, "Gather the People."</p>
            <p>"Am I my Brothers keeper!" let it ſuffice for me that I look to myſelf, and that my own Family is in tolerable order, is a language that too much prevails.
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:015796_0023_0F9A2BE7D18D3D88"/>But Oh! that you had the Cauſe of God more at heart that you were more engaged to gather the People that you might with a Fatherly care overlook thoſe whoſe minds at preſent reſemble the barren deſert, the uncultivated wilderneſs; that you might comfort and encourage them that tread the gloomy ſcenes of an adverſe allotment, as it were cut off from every Joy, and alive to each painful ſenſibility; how would it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort many of theſe, if an experienced friend was now and then to drop into their families, and at times ſpeak a word, in the opening of divine wiſdom, ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their ſeveral ſtates: I believe it would be a great means of gathering the People. Why ſhould your care be circumſcribed within the narrow limits of your own Families (altho' they ſhould certainly be well regulated) but you might be more extenſively ſervicea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, if thus engaged in the care of the Houſhold of God. I am perſuaded that the divine wing would be over you, and a Bleſſing would attend your labours. 'Tis not a time for us to dwell unconcerned in our ceiled Houſes, when the Houſe of God lies waſte. We have, many of us, the ſame tender connections as you; I myſelf have the ſame endearing attachments as <hi>ſome</hi> of you, the ſame ties of domeſtic Love, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps as deeply ſenſible of all their force, as ſome of you; not leſs attentive to every relative and ſocial duty, than ſome of you; my Nature is not harſh, my Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples much leſs ſo; yet I am made willing to leave all, to come and labour with you; if ſo be I might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental to rouſe any to a more ardorous purſuit of their everlaſting Intereſt; and I can freely acknowledge, with humble thankfulneſs, that I never more fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced my Peace to ſlow as a River; never could with greater Joy ſay <q>return Oh! my Soul to the place of thy reſt, for the Lord thy God hath dealt bountifully with thee,</q> than when I have been thus
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:015796_0024_0F9A2BE891327B28"/>engaged in extenſive private labours; viſiting the ſick; reviving the ſorrowful; encouraging the diſconſolate; ſtrengthening the weak; watching over and carefully admoniſhing the giddy incautious Youth; and I doubt not but you would have the reward of Peace in your own boſoms, if as heads of the ſociety you were more often thus employ'd in endeavouring to <q>gather the People.</q>
            </p>
            <p>"Sanctify the Congregation; aſſemble the Elders." I have been deeply concern'd to ſee ſome of the Elders ſo deficient in filling the line of divine appointment. If they were more frequently engaged to aſſemble un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the holy influence of that power in which they ſhould move, they would many of them be command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to "blow the Trumpet in Zion;" but I know of no ſtate harder to ſpeak to or more difficult to reach, than that of an Elder whoſe mind is overgrown by the earthly nature; <q>Oh! Earth, Earth, Earth! hear the word of the Lord.</q> I don't recollect any other inſtance in ſacred writ, where attention is demanded in a ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar manner; "Oh! Earth, Earth, Earth!" thus thrice repeated, plainly ſignifying the great difficulty there is in reaching to thoſe, who are as it were buried in the earth, whoſe minds are fixt in it.</p>
            <p>"Gather the Children." You that have the riſing Youth under your care, let me call upon you, let me intreat you to "gather the Children;" gather them from all the bewitching enticing allurements of the world, gather their attention to that of God in their own minds. Oh! how have I ſecretly <hi>mourned</hi> to ſee the poor Children ſo ſorrowfully neglected; ſo unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed; ſo much eſtranged to that holy divine principle, which would ſo exceedingly beautify and enrich them! but alas! how few Parents are rightly qualified to teach their Children the law of divine love; to inſtill into their tender minds proper ſentiments, to cultivate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:015796_0025_0F9A2BEA18AAD5A8"/>them thoſe impreſſions that would be of everlaſting advantage; and if the Children, when the gracious viſitation of the Father of mercies moves upon their hearts, warming and animating them with the Love of Virtue, raiſing the ſecret ſigh, and begetting deſires after Heaven and Holineſs: I ſay if the Children ſhou'd then aſk the negligent parent; <q>what is this ſecret ſomething which I feel; this principle which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes my mind with the love of Virtue? what is it? what value ſhall I ſet upon it?</q> How then can you give them ſuitable inſtruction? you cannot teach them obedience to its ſacred dictates, when your own example ſpeaks a language quite oppoſite: Oh! why ſhould the Sea Monſter be brought againſt you <q>the Sea Monſter draweth forth the breaſt to her Young but the Daughter of my People is become cruel! but the Daughter of my People is become cruel as the Oſtrich in the Wilderneſs that leaveth her Eggs in the Sand to be hatched by the beams of the Sun, and conſidereth not that the Foot of the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger may cruſh them!</q> the Daughter of my Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple hath left her tender Offspring to the uncertainty of being accidentally benefited, or I ſhould rather ſay, to the Mercy of God, unaſked, unſought, expoſed to all the dangers of a dreary Wilderneſs, unaided unaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted by the Care of a natural Parent! The Tongue of the ſucking Child cleaveth to roof of its Mouth for thirſt! the Children aſk Bread and there is none in many Families to break it, they want to be nouriſhed by the ſincere Milk of the word, but alas! <q>the Daughter of my People is become cruel!</q> Oh! you Parents, you delegated Shepherds, what account will you have to render when the Lord of the whole Earth ariſeth to make inquiſiton for Blood!</p>
            <p>Bear with me my beloved Friends; flattery and ſmooth tales may pleaſe Fools, but they will not pleaſe
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:015796_0026_0F9A2BEA24B3A528"/>him whom I deſire to ſerve in the Goſpel of his Son. All that is within me is moved, while I thus earneſtly expoſtulate with you on behalf of the dear Children; ſuffer me to intreat you, for God's ſake, for your own Souls ſake, for the ſake of the Cauſe of Truth, "Gather the Children, and thoſe that ſuck the breaſt;" thoſe that are filling themſelves with the Worlds con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, with the intoxicating pleaſures and amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of a degenerate age; wean them from theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights; gather them to the knowledge of themſelves, to a ſenſe of the Mercies that are offered them by the great Author of Mercies antient and new. <q>While thy Servant was buſied hither and thither the Man made his eſcape,</q> was the vain excuſe of the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer to whoſe cuſtody a certain Captive was committed with this charge, <q>take care of this Man till I come, and if thou let him go, thy life ſhall go for his life.</q> No plea of other engagements, nor even the want of ability to diſcharge our duty towards our Offspring will ſtand us in any ſtead; if, when the Almighty queries with us <q>What haſt thou done with thoſe Lambs I left under thy care in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, thoſe tender Offsprings I gave thee in charge!</q> we have through neglect, through un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>watchfulneſs ſuffered him or her to go, but we ſhall moſt certainly, ſtand accountable for his or her Life. I ſaid want of ability, becauſe I aſſuredly believe, that want of ability will be ſo far from a palliation of our Crime, that it will rather increaſe our condemnation; can we plead want of ability to him who is always ready to furniſh us with it, if we are but willing to receive it at his Hand!</p>
            <p>I am of opinion reſpecting many of our Youth, that if they had been properly inſtructed, and carefully watched over, if they could have ſeen the beauty of Holineſs ſhine in the example of their Parents, they
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:015796_0027_0F9A2BEAD1D51040"/>would not have gone out ſo widely as they have. Oh you Parents of both ſexes, an important truſt is repoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in you; example your Childern in the practice of Piety; example ſpeaks louder, much louder, than pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept; its influence is far more extenſive. And while on the one hand you are excited to a faithful diſcharge of your duty towards them, by the certain hope of a glorious reward; ſo on the other hand, the powerful ties of natural affection, the warm ſolicitude for the happineſs of thoſe you love, muſt ſtir up to diligence in the work and ſervice appointed you.</p>
            <p>"Gather the Children." If after your attentive care has been employed, for their preſervation; if after by the forceable voice of example, you have called them to the perfecting of holineſs in the fear of God, they <hi>will</hi> go, they <hi>will</hi> turn aſide into the byways and crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed paths of ſin and iniquity, they muſt ſtand by their own choice; you have redeemed your Souls, and will be found in your lots at the end of time, a ponderous Crown awaits you, you will cloſe your eyes, and open them to the boundleſs fruition of unmixt Joy, in a happy eternity.</p>
            <p>We do ſometimes with ſorrow obſerve, the unweari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed labours of a Parents love, beſtowed without the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired effect; 'tis <hi>mournful</hi> to ſee Children pierce with bitterneſs and anxiety the breaſt that has been their ſupport in their infantile years; to fill that eye with ſorrow, that has dropt over them the tear of maternal fondneſs! 'tis a cruel thing for a Child to mingle Gall and Wormwood, in the cup of a Parent deſcending to the Grave; let us be aſſured that their own portion of Gall and Wormwood will be doubly increaſed thereby, in the ſolemn hour of juſt Retribution! But, Oh belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Youth! I earneſtly deſire that you may never thus widely deviate from the paths of rectitude; 'tis on you the hope of the preſent age muſt ſhortly devolve; may
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:015796_0028_0F9A2BEB90BEF4F0"/>you wiſely chuſe an early ſubmiſſion to the holy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline of the Croſs of Chriſt, that you may come up as an Army for God. Conſider the uncertainty of your ſtay here; conſider the important buſineſs of Life; and let the love of every unprofitable delight, be ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up in the arduous purſuit of Glory, Honour, Immortality and Eternal Life. We are daily inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the powerful eloquent language of Mortality; Death invades all ranks, ſnatches thoſe of all ages from the buſy ſtage of life, ſhe that was yeſterday ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with nuptial Joys, muſt tomorrow be confined within the cold incloſure of the ſilent Grave. <q>Let the Bridegroom go forth of his chamber, and the Bride out of her Cloſet;</q> let the young, the joyous, thoſe that are in the bloom of life, leave every thing that tends to retard their progreſs towards the City of the Saints ſolemnity; let them relinquiſh their moſt exalted ſatisfactions, rather than neglect to lay hold on the Joys of God's Salvation; which are unutterably more deſirable, than all the ſin-pleaſing gratifications that this World can beſtow.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Let the Prieſts the Miniſters of the Lord weep between the Porch and the Altar;</q> this ſhould not be confined to thoſe only whoſe mouths may be open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed publickly amongſt you, for it belongs to all thoſe who Preach to others by the regularity of a Godly life and converſation; although we are favourd with a living miniſtry of divine appointment, who dare not fill the ears of Men with a repetition of unfelt Truths, nor amuſe them with the unprofitable productions of of an empty mind, but are concerned to diſcharge themſelves faithfully <q>as ſtewards of the myſteries of God</q> yet let them be joined by all thoſe that mourn for the deſolation of Zion; by all that wiſh Peace within her Walls and proſperity within her Palaces. Let us weep between the Porch and the Altar, ſaying
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:015796_0029_0F9A2BEC51C122B0"/>
               <q>Spare thy People O Lord! and give not thy Heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to reproach, that the Heathen ſhould rule over them! wherefore ſhould they ſay among the People, where is their God?</q> If we are thus unitedly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged on behalf of our Iſrael it may be that the Lord will again "be jealous over his land" with an holy jealouſy, for I cannot think that a People whom he has raiſed by his own invincible power, and ſo ſignal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly placed his name amongſt, were ever deſigned to be only the tranſcient Glory of a couple of centuries; I am ſtill revived by a ſecret Hope of better times, when our Zion ſhall again put on her beautiful Garments; and in her, and with her, ſhall ariſe Judges as at the firſt, and Counſellers and Lawgivers as at the beginning; let us weep between the Porch and the Altar; let us interceed for the People that the land may yet be ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed! the gracious ear of our Heavenly Father is ſtill open to the ſupplications of his Children, and I believe he will yet <q>be jealous over his Land and pity his People.</q> The time approaches when the great daſher in pieces will more and more come up amongſt us, and may all who are broken by him, wait to be healed by the ariſing of his Love; I ſhall not live to ſee it, but I live in the Faith, and I believe I ſhall die in the Faith, that the Lord of Hoſts will yet beautify the place of his Feet, that our <q>Zion will yet become an Eternal excellency, and Jeruſalem the praiſe of the whole Earth!</q>
            </p>
            <p>Let us weep between the Porch and the Altar with unwearied interceſſion, for <q>the Lord will yet be jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous over his Land and pity his People.</q> The bowels of adorable Compaſſion yet yearn over his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, with all the tenderneſs of a Fathers Love, <q>How ſhall I give thee up O Ephraim? How ſhall I make thee as Admah and ſet thee as Zeboam?</q> How ſhall I cut thee off from being a People before me? by this
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:015796_0030_0F9A2BED113B7020"/>moving and pathetic language would the Great Father of the Univerſe induce you to return to the Arms of everlaſting Mercy! And if we who are placed as Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in Zion faithfully diſcharge the truſt repoſed in us, we ſhall be made Inſtrumental in gathering the ſcattered and diſperſed Sheep, from the Eaſt and from the Weſt, from the North, and from the South, to the great Shepherd, to the one Sheepfold; and finally ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain an admitance into thoſe glorious Manſions where the morning Stars join in Singing Hallelujahs! and where all the Sons of God forever ſhout for Joy.</p>
            <p>Now unto the King Eternal, Immortal, Inviſible, the only God! be Honour and Praiſe for ever and ever.</p>
