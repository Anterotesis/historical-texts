            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>ARLACKSMITH in a country town, while ſhoeing a horſe, was gazed at by a number of negroes as they were paſſing by; being a little piqued at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>A tradeſman, whoſe love of money made him perſcribe, as beneficial to his ſervants" health, and his own profit, the practice of early riſing, one morning gave a poor black man a ſevere ſcolding for ſuffering the ſun to ſhine on him while in bed—concluding his lectures with a ſevere threat, if he ſhould ever after find him not up at ſun riſe. "At ſunriſe, maſſa?" aſked the honeſt African, in the native ſimplic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of his ſoul—it was worth a caſket of dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds to him—"At ſunriſe, maſſa? But ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, maſſa, the ſun riſe before day light—what ſhall I do den, ſir?" The maſter made no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, and Sambo was diſmiſſed.</p>

            <p>Mr. Mackenzie, who has ſometimes been called the Scots Addiſon, is by profeſſion an attorney. He was lately in company with ſir William Howe, in the Highlands of Scotland. After dinner, the conveſation happened to turn upon poiſon; the various effects of different ſpecies were mentioned, and among others, thoſe of ratſbane and laurel water. "We ſay in England," ſaid the general to Mr. Macken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zie, "that ratſbane will not kill a lawyer."— "And we ſay in Scotland," replied the wit, "that ſome generals are in no danger from laurel."</p>
            <p>Some years ſince, one Tom Hide, an Indian, famous for his cunning, went into a ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="7" facs="unknown:028720_0005_0FDA61A7A709C640"/>Brookfield, in Maſſachuſetts, and after a little talk, told the landlord, he had been hunting, had killed a fine fat deer, and that if he would give him a quart of rum, he would tell him where it was.—The landlord did not wiſh to let ſlip ſo good an opportunity to obtain the veniſon, and immediately meaſured the Indian his rum—"Well," ſays Tom, "do you know where the great meadow is?" "Yes"—"Well, do you know where the great marked maple tree that ſtands in it, is?"—"Yes"—"Well there lies the deer." Away poſted the tavern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er with his team, in queſt of his purchaſe: He found the meadow and the tree; but his ſearchings after the deer were in vain; and he returned no heavier, but in chagrin, than he went. Some days after, he met the Indian, and violently accuſed him of a deception. Tom heard him out, and with the coolneſs of a philoſopher replied, "did you find the mead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ow, as I ſaid?"—"Yes," "and the tree?"— "Yes"—"and the deer?"—"No."—"Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good," continues he—"you found two truths to one li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>A certain trading juſtice in Boſton, notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for his profeſſional ingenuity, ſome time ſince employed a poor man to ſaw a load of wood, for which he agreed to give him eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen pence. The man, in order to be more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditious in the buſineſs, ſtripped off his coat and laid it in the ſtreet.—After finiſhing the job, he found, to his ſurpriſe, that the coat had vaniſhed, and aſking the juſtice, who had been at the door, nearly the whole time, if he had ſeen any thing of it—the worthy magiſtrate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, "he had found a coat in the ſtreet," and
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:028720_0006_0FDA61A925B50BB0"/>producing it deſired to know, "if he could ſwear to the property;" on the poor man's an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering in the affirmative, he proceeded to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter the oath: After which, on reſtoring the coat, he ſhrewdly obſerved to the poor fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that they were now clear of each other, the price of the work being eighteen pence, and his fees amounting to the ſame.</p>
            <p>Dr. F—, being in England in the year 1775, was aſked by a nobleman, what would ſatisfy the Americans? He anſwered, that it might eaſily be compriſed in a few re's, which he immediately wrote on a piece of paper.— Thus,

            <p>Some years ſince, an Indian reſided in the metropolis of a neighbouring ſtate; he gained his ſubſiſtence by his induſtry, and being a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry handy fellow, he was frequently employed by many in the city, particularly by the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernor. The Indian, whoſe name was Joſeph, took the liberty of enquiring of the governor, how it came to paſs he had ſo many fine things about him and never worked any? The gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernor
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:028720_0007_0FDA61AB92904DD8"/>replied that he got them by headwork. Joe wiſhed to be inſtructed in the myſtery, but was informed his ſcull was too thick for it. Some time after, Joe was ſent for by the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernor, who demanded to know what he would have for killing a calf? Joe ſaid, he would do it for two ſhillings: He was deſired to go to the ſtable and perform the buſineſs; he went, cut the calf's throat, and left him lying there: after ſome delay he went to the houſe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his pay: Soon after the governor went to ſee how his veal looked, but was aſtoniſhed to find the calf lying dead, and nothing more done to it. He ſent for the Indian, repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him ſeverely for treating him ſo. Joe inſiſted that he had complied fully with his agreement; ſaying he had killed the calf, and that for two ſhillings more he would dreſs it, aſking the governor if that was not ſomething like headwork?</p>
            <p>Some years ago, immediately after the ſhock of a tremendous earthquake had alarmed the inhabitants of Grenada, the converſation turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the governor's table, upon the latent oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of the above phaenomenon; after every one of the company had aſſigned it to a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cauſe, an old negro woman was aſked, what was her opinion on the ſubject; ſhe replied, "ſhe thought the Great God was paſſing by, and the earth had made him a curtſy."</p>
            <p>Several runaway negroes being condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be hanged, one was offered his life, on condition of being the executioner. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed it: he would ſooner die. The maſter fixed on another of his ſlaves to perform the office. "Stay," ſaid this laſt, "'till I prepare
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:028720_0008_0FDA61AEC671B820"/>myſelf." He inſtantly retired to his hut, and cut off his wriſt with an axe. Returning to his maſter, "now," ſaid he, "compel me, if you can, to hang my comrades."</p>
            <p>During the late war, an elderly gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman from New-York, who was at bottom a ſtaunch loyaliſt, but ſo fond of argument, that he would occaſionally take up the ſubject of the war and argue upon it either pro or con— being once at a coffeehouſe in London, when that topic was in agitation, and then defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cauſe of the Americans, one of the company, more ſanguine than the reſt, round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſerted, there could be no doubt of conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Americans, notwithſtanding the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority of their numbers; for that one Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhman could drive an hundred of them.— Pray, do you think ſir, ſaid the Yankee, you could atchieve ſo noble an exploit? Perhaps not, replied the hero, upon ſo great a number— Could you drive fifty?—No—Could you drive twenty?—No—Could you drive one?— O yes, by G—d, I could do that eaſily at any time.—Then, ſir, ſaid the old gentleman, as you are an Engliſhman, and I am an American, if you pleaſe, drive me. The political brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gadocia, drew in his horns, and ſneaked off.</p>
            <p>Colonel Cockburn roſe from a private ſoldier to the rank which he enjoyed when St. Euſtatius was retaken.—Of this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance he was continually boaſting, and upon occaſions where it proved more pride than humility.—One day in the iſland of St. Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatius, he was reviewing his troops, and took notice of a man in the ranks who was exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively dirty.—Going up to him, he ſaid, "how

            <p>A perſon of the name of Palmer, who was a lieutenant in the tory new levies, was detected in the camp at Peek's kiln.

            <p>A lady in Charleſton, South Carolina, ſaid, before one of her little girls, that Mrs. T—(a roſy widow, whom they viſited in the next ſtreet) was a very good ſort of a woman, and a very entertaining companion, when ſhe had not a drop in her eye.</p>
            <p>A few days after, Mrs. T— came to the houſe, and little Charlotte took more notice of her than ſhe uſually did. She ſtared in her
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:028720_0010_0FDA61B2835C84F8"/>face, indeed, in ſo pointed a manner, that the lady could not help being deſirous of knowing, "what ſhe ſaw in her countenance, to occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſo critical an examination."</p>

            <p>A gentleman riding out one morning early in a place where he happened not to be acquainted; coming up by the ſide of a young woman who was carrying a pig in her arms, and hearing it ſcream violently, addreſſed her thus: "why, my dear, your child cries amaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly!" The young woman, turning round, and looking him in the face, ſaid, with a ſmile upon her countenance, "I know it, ſir, it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways does ſo, when it ſees its daddy."</p>
            <p>As a gentleman, in a certain coffee houſe, was writing a letter to his friend, there being a good deal of company preſent, a pert young fellow poſted himſelf behind him.— The gentleman concluded his letter with theſe words: I ſhould write more, but there is an impudent puppy looking over my ſhoulder.— The macaroni inſtantly turned upon his heels, and exclaimed aloud, "I'll be d—d if I was looking over your ſhoulder."</p>
            <p>The great Mr. Dalmahoy went in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with a friend lately to bedlam, to ſee the lunatics there.

Dalmahoy took the ſtraw, and the oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er throwing himſelf into an attitude, made ſeveral paſſes through the grate, which Dalma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoy humoured. At laſt the madman dropped his ſtraw, and ſaid, "you have diſarmed me: but if you are a man of honor you will permit me to take up my ſword again." Dalmahoy ſaid, "by all means." The madman ſtooped, but inſtead of the ſtraw, took up a large jordan, and daſhed the contents in Dalmahoy's face, crying out, "there, d—n you, go and tell your king what a ſtinking admiral he pitched upon to fight with me."</p>

When on his trial, an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer aſked him what could induce him to take away his horſe? To which he replied, "he ran away with him."

            <p>When George Whitfield firſt came to Charleſton in South Carolina, the Rev. Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander Garden was epiſcopal miniſter of that place.

After the news of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the ſtamped paper had arrived in England, the miniſtry again ſent for the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:028720_0022_0FDA61D144AB4448"/>to conſult with him, and conclude with this propoſition, that if the Americans would engage to pay for the damage done in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the ſtamped paper, &amp;c. the parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would then repeal the act. To this the doctor anſwered, that it put him in mind of a Frenchman, who having heated a poker red hot, ran into the ſtreet, and addreſſing an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſhman he met there, "hah, monſieur, voulez vous give me de plaiſir et de ſatisfaction, and lete me runi dis poker only one foote up your backſide?" "What!" ſays the Engliſhman:— "Only to lete me runi dis poker one foote up your backſide." Damn your ſoul," replies the Engliſhman. "Welle, den, only ſo far," ſays the Frenchman, pointing to about ſix inch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of the poker.—"No, no," replies the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſhman—"damn your ſoul; what do you mean?" "Well, den, ſays the Frenchman, will you have de juſtice to paye me for de trouble and expence of heating de poker?"— "dam me, if I do," anſwered the Engliſhman, and walked off.</p>
            <p>A member of the general court of Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts, who, from accuſtoming himſelf to take a nap after dinner, when at home, could not diſpenſe with the cuſtom, when attending to give laws to a mighty people, not long ſince occaſioned much ſport in the houſe, by the following incident. A day was aſſigned for the ſecond reading of a lumber act: As this intereſted our ſleeper, he requeſted a friend, who ſat next him, to awaken him, if the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion of the bill ſhould be introduced, while he was aſleep. This his friend promiſed him: But, happening to go out for a few minutes,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:028720_0023_0FDA61D32A6856A8"/>the bill was called for; and after a ſhort de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, was committed. Immediately after, the bill for preventing fornication was brought forward. This occaſioned ſome debate, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which the ſleeper's friend returned. Find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the lumber bill was diſmiſſed, he thought he might indulge his friend in his nap. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, as ill luck would have it, he trod upon the toe of this votary to Morpheus, who ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed it a ſignal for waking: immediately rouſing himſelf, he rubbed his eyes, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about, perceived a pauſe in the debate— on which he aroſe and addreſſed the ſpeaker as follows: "Sir, I wiſh to ſpeak a few words on the bill now in queſtion. It affects, Mr. Speaker, my conſtituents very much; for <hi>above half of our town get their living by it.</hi>

            <p>Mr. Quin happening to call at a friend's houſe near Bath, which was not quite finiſhed, found only the ſervant at home; however, Quin being rather hard preſſed in a certain way, told the fellow to ſhew him the little<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe; "Yes, ſir, ſaid the ſervant, the houſe is little, but it is very compact."—"I mean, ſaid Quin, your neceſſary houſe."—"I believe, ſir, ſaid the ſervant, when my maſter comes down, he will find it very neceſſary, and much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable to lodgings." Quin was almoſt out of all patience, and exclaimed, "Tis your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency I mean, ſir." "Yes, ſir; I can aſſure you, ſir, as I ſaid before, tho' ſmall, it is very

It paſſed very well, and the next day the lady ſent him a pair of colours, with her compliments, and this remark, "That it was an ill wind that blew nobody good."</p>
            <p>It is reported of lord chief juſtice Holt, who had been very wild in his youth, that being once upon the bench at the old Bailey, a fellow was tried and convicted of a robbery on the highway, whom the judge remembered to have been one of his former companions.

            <p>In the northern exertions laſt war, for raiſing men to ſerve his Britiſh majeſty, it was too cuſtomary for the Lairds and Highland chiefs to compel their vaſſals into the ſervice by main force, when they would not go by fair means.— A little diſturbance of this ſort happening one day, and a crowd enſuing, a perſon ſtopt to aſk what was the matter? Nae thing at aw, cried a Scot, they are only forcing a mon to turn volunteer.</p>
            <p>When the Britiſh and American armies were near each other in the neighbourhood of Germantown, five Heſſian ſoldiers, who had ſtraggled into the woods, and loſt their way, were met by an Iriſhman, who was a private in general Waſhington's army: He immediately preſented his piece, and deſired them to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render; they ſuppoſing that he was ſupported by a party, did as he directed, and threw down their arms. He then marched them before him to the American lines, and brought them to head quarters. General Waſhington won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered at the ſpirit and atchievement of the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and aſked him, how he, a ſingle man, could capture five?

Some time ſince, a perſon on his travels through Coventry, in the ſtate of Connecticut, ſtopped at the houſe of the Rev. Joſeph Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington, D. D. and acquainted the doctor, that he had been preaching at Suſquehannah for a conſiderable time, but was ſo unfortunate as to be driven from his poſſeſſions by the Indians, who had deſtroyed his property. He added that he was on his way to Maſſachuſetts, where he had ſome friends, and aſked charity of the doctor. The latter was liberal and hoſpitable to the ſtranger, and told him as it was Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, and it would be improper for him to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel on the Sabbath, he might refreſh himſelf at his houſe both days. The offer was accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and Dr. Huntington invited his gueſt to aſſiſt him next day in the duties of his func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but he declined, alledging as a reaſon, that his cloths were not ſufficiently decent to appear in the pulpit. To obviate this diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, the doctor offered him a ſuit of clothes almoſt new. The objection being removed, the pretended clergyman agreed to aſſiſt his brother, and, in order to prepare himſelf, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to be left alone that evening, to ſtudy his diſcourſe. A ſire was accordingly made in his bed chamber, whither he repaired with his new garb, at the ſame time acquainting the doctor, that he muſt ſtudy till late at night, and hoped no noiſe he might make would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turb the repoſe of the family. Sunday morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing came, and the <hi>preacher</hi> being ſent for to breakfaſt, was not to be found. He had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped in the night, <hi>a la fourdine,</hi> and carried off the clothes, ſo well ſuited to his newly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed clerical dignity, leaving behind him the

            <p>A mad man having broke from confinement, was parading through the ſtreets of Boſton, with a loaded muſket, which he had ſeized, and ſwearing that he would kill the firſt man that attempted to ſtop him. Governor Leveret ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing towards him, accoſted him thus, "Ho, brother ſoldier, have you learned your exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe?'—He anſwered, "Yes," "Then ſtand to your arms, while I give the word of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand'." The man ſeemed pleaſed, and ſtood bolt upright, with his gun ſhouldered. The Governor then began—"Poiſe your firelock; reſt your firelock—order your firelock; ground your firelock." The man obeved. "Face to the right about; march." As ſoon as he began to ſtep, the Governor advanced, took up his gun, and beckoning to the byſtanders, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly ſeized him, and carried him to the place of confinement.</p>

            <p>Two perſons in company laid a wager which of them could reach the higheſt; a third, who was remarkable for tricking and taking in the unwary in the way of buſineſs, got up and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed a bet of two bottles to one, that he could reach higher than any of them.

            <p>The epithets and figures that ſome people make uſe of in telling a ſtory, are truly ridic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulous and laughable.

"You the hangman," ſhrieked the countryman in a fright. "Yes," ſaid the dean, "and expect to hang nine more next Saturday at Tyburn, one of whom is to be drawn and quartered." The fellow waited for no further reply, but flew out of the bed with the violence of a man in fits, burſt open the door, tumbled down ſtairs in the dark, and awaked the landlord with the noiſe, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded what was the matter.—"Matter," cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the farmer, "by all the devils in hell, I have been put to bed with the hangman, and never diſcovered it till this inſtant; is this the way you uſe ſtrangers; for God's ſake open the door and let me get into the ſtreet." The landlord thinking him mad, turned him out into the ſtreet without breeches or coat, and the dean was left to enjoy the ſucceſs of his contrivance.</p>

De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous one day to cut his way ſhorter, Mr. Hume took it into his head to paſs over a temporary one, which had been erected for general accommodation, till the new one could be completed. Unfortunately, part of the temporary one gave way, and our illuſtrious philoſopher found himſelf ſtuck in the mud. On hearing him call aloud for aſſiſtance, an old woman haſtened to the ſpot, from whence the found ſeemed to proceed; but perceiving who he was, refuſed giving him any help. "Why, (cried ſhe) are you not Hume, the atheiſt?" "Oh no! no! no! (returned the philoſopher) I am no atheiſt! indeed you miſtake, good woman, you do indeed!" "Let me hear then (returned the woman) if you can ſay the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief."—Mr. Hume accordingly began the words, I believe in God, &amp;c. and finiſhed them with ſo much propriety, that the old wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, convinced of his chriſtian education, charitably afforded him that relief, which otherwiſe ſhe would have thought it a duty of religion to deny him.</p>

            <p>A diſpute which happened ſome time ſince about a box at the opera houſe in Paris, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned a ſuit before the tribunal of the marchals of France: This tribunal receives complaints againſt military men upon affairs of honour, and in all caſes in which military officers are accuſed of having behaved in a manner unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming gentlemen.

<pb n="67" facs="unknown:028720_0065_0FDA623AA73E43C0"/>to ſpeak in perſon in ſupport of his charge.

He did not think proper at firſt to name the accuſed in his ſpeech, but took an effectual way of mortiſying the general, by ſhewing which of the marechals was not the accuſed, and by mentioning the moſt memorable exploits of each. "It is not, (ſaid he) of marechal ſuch an one that I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain; it is not of marechal Broglio, who ſo gloriouſly diſtinguiſhed himſelf in the laſt German war; it is not marechal Clermont Tonnerre, who has rendered his name ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous by the moſt maſterly retreats; it is not marechal de Contades, ſo renowned for his victories; it is not marechal de Richeliou, who took Minorca: He of whom I complain, never took a place in his whole life but my box at the opera houſe," and here he named the accuſed.

Why, ſays he, let her hire a horſe, and invite you to take her away, and let her get up before, and you behind, that it may not be ſaid that you rode away with her, but ſhe with you: and let her go to the miniſter, and tell him, it is her deſire to be married to you, and ſo get a licenſe accordingly; and when you are marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, then be ſure to bed, and I'll warrant you ſhe is your own.

            <p>A gentleman that had a great wit, and was well beloved among the great ones, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore invited often among them, but it ſeems had a very great leg; he being at a Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's table, greedily catched at a goblet of wine.

            <p>A fellow who was a very great glutton, yet forſooth had a very great mind to be married; that is, to marry a very rich widow, and to that end, by his letters got admittance, and when he came, ſhe ſaw the man was comely e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and well clad: But ſeeing him two or three times feed ſo largely, he aſked a friend of here, what he was? He ſaid, he was a great glutton: And when he came to ſpeak with her about the matter, he proteſted he loved her as well as he did his own foul. By my troth,

            <p>A devout gentleman being very earneſt at his prayers in the church, it happened that a pickpocket being near him, ſtole away his watch, who having ended his prayers, miſſed it, and complained to his friend, that his watch was loſt while he was at prayers.

            <p>King James being in his progreſs at Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtock, in Oxfordſhire, the king finding it to rain ſo one morning that he could not ride a hunting, had got ſome of the nobility and gentry together, reſolving to be merry: And one humour was, that the king having that morning a fine curveting horſe given him, which kind of horſe he never liked in his life, told them. That he that could tell the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt lie, ſhould have that horſe. So one told one lie, and another another; and ſeveral had told others, ſo that there was great laughing; and juſt in the midſt of this mirth, in comes a country fellow, complaining to the king that ſome of his ſervants had wronged him: Well, well, ſays the king, we'll hear of that anon: Come, come hither amongſt us, and you muſt know that he that can tell the greateſt lie, ſhall have that horſe. Truly Sir, ſays he, an't pleaſe your Grace, I never told a lie in all my life. With that, ſays the king, give him the horſe, give him the horſe, for I am ſure that is the greateſt lie that has been told today.</p>
            <p>An honeſt man that was a true cavalier was, when he came from the wars, ſo reduced that

            <p>Two gentleman travelling into the country, one of them had a hundred pounds in his portmanteau; alighting from his horſe by a woodſide to eaſe his body, a fellow comes out of the wood upon him, with a rabbit in his hand, deſiring the gentleman to buy it of him; but he refuſed him, telling him, he knew not what to do with it, being troubleſome to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: Whereupon the fellow whiſtles, and out comes a ſecond, Says the firſt to him, Robin, the gentleman ſays, he won't buy the rabbit. How is that, ſays the ſecond? But he muſt buy the rabbit; and then he whiſtles, and out comes two more; to whom the ſecond ſays, Why, the gentleman refuſes to buy the rabbit. How! refuſe it, ſaid they? But he muſt not refuſe it; for he ſhall buy the rabbit. The gentleman looking one of them earneſtly in the face, knew him to be a goldſmith that liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in London: upon which he replied, Well, Sirs, if I muſt buy the rabbit, pray what is the price of it? Says the goldſmith, only your money in the portmanteau. That's very dear, replied the gentleman, to give a hundred pounds for a rabbit. That's very true, ſaid the goldſmith, were it an ordinary rabbit; but you never ſaw a fatter in your life, and that is the price, and you ſhall buy it. Well, ſays the
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:028720_0101_0FDA6291231B1750"/>gentleman, if I muſt it, there's your money; ſo they gave him the rabbit. The gentleman mounts his horſe, and in a little riding, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes his friend, to whom he ſays, ſince you left me, I have bought a rabbit, and we'll have it for ſupper; you ſhall pay me what the rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit coſt me, and for the roaſting, and I'll find liquor to it. With all my heart, replies his friend. Coming to the Inn at night, it was accordingly done. Supper being ended, he aſked him, what he gave for the rabbit? Why truly, ſays the gentleman, I had it cheap, it coſt me but a hundred pounds. A hundred pounds! ſaid his friend, ſure you can't be in earneſt! Upon that he tells him all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding ſtory; and withal that he did not doubt but to receive his money again; for he was well aſſured he knew one of them. Coming up to London a little time after, he acquaints two or three friends more of this adventure, and they all agree to get a parcel of builion ſilver, and ſend for this goldſmith to a tavern near his houſe, and offer it for ſale to him: They did ſo; the gentleman placing his friends in the next room, the goldſmith comes upon the ſummons. Sir, ſays the gentleman, I have ſome bullion ſilver, which I deſire you to buy: What do you aſk an ounce for it, ſays the goldſmith? Seven ſhillings and ſixpence. Why, Sir, that's a price was never known, and I ſhall not throw away my money at that rate. So the gentleman knocks with his foot, and in comes one of his friends, to whom he ſays, Ralph, This man ſays he won't buy the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="104" facs="unknown:028720_0102_0FDA629270EA00D0"/>the ſilver. And ſo knocking with his foot, in comes two more, and he tells them the ſame. How! Will you not buy the ſilver? Sir, you muſt, and ſhall buy the ſilver. The guilt of the goldſmith's former fact flying in his face, he returns the gentleman his hundred pounds, and gives him and his friends a treat of ten pounds more, to prevent them from publiſhing it to the world.</p>

            <p>A poor countryman had ſo ſpent his time in true and honeſt pains, contented and not murmuring, that fortune ſeemed to ſmile upon him, as oft as he came to worſhip at her tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whither he often reſorted; the gracious looks of the goddeſs encouraged him to aſk ſomething more than before he uſed; and yet conſidering with himſelf, that too bold a vota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry might be repulſed, he modeſtly bounded his requeſt with his ſuit, that her goodneſs would confer three wiſhes upon him, which from the oracle was anſwered, Ratified, wiſh and be happy.

            <p>During the late war, an Engliſh frigate hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come up the Patomack, a party was land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who ſet fire to and deſtroyed ſome gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men's houſes on the Maryland ſide in ſight of Mount Vernon, Gen.

            <p>In the year 1785, a farmer of Bucks' coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, aſſiſted by his people, working in harveſt, killed a rattleſnake; and ſoon after having occaſion to go home, took up by miſtake his ſon's jacket, and put it on; the ſon was a ſtripling, and both their jackets were made of the ſame kind of cloth.

The ſignal was immediately given, he was conſigned to eternity, under the impreſſion of this noble ſentiment: And it is remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that the hangman, as he deſcended from his duty, was killed by a ſhot from the Britiſh piquette. Such conduct, however, proves the inconſiſtency of the human character; nor is it eaſy to conceive, how a mind, ſo ſolicitous to preſerve its dignity in a matter merely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal, ſhould have condeſcended to engage in a treachery, deſtructive to publick confidence and allegiance.</p>
            <p>During the late war, an old citizen of Charleſtown happened to fall into the hands of a party of Britiſh troops, in one of their excurſions to Dorcheſter. On the party's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning towards town, they ſtopped to refreſh themſelves at a plantation on Gooſe creek; and the ſoldiers began to jeer their priſoner for rebelling againſt the king. He not wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to offend them (as his life had been threatened, and they were then preparing a halter for a priſoner) anſwered, that he had enjoyed many happy days under the reign of George the ſecond, and ſome agreeable mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſince the preſent gentleman came to the crown. The commanding officer, a Caledoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, who was ſuppoſed to be aſleep, imagining the priſoner intended to degrade ſhe royalty of his king, jumped up in a violent rage, and aſked how he had the audacions aſſurance of
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:028720_0112_0FDA62A9A5B32F20"/>preſuming to call the king a gentleman, and told him that if ſuch another word eſcaped his lips, he would inſtantly cut him to atoms. The priſoner being terrified at the menaces of this highland butcher, replied, that he had no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of caſting any reflection on his maj<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſty, as he had always <hi>ſuppaſed</hi> him to be a gentleman.</p>
            <p>The Peruvians had a cuſtom, on the death of any diſtinguiſhed perſon, to inter along with him to keep him company, the ſervant that had been attached to him in his life. A young man who had loſt his maſter, and who had alſo loſt an eye, was ſelected to have the honour of accompanying him to the other world: But not being ambitious of the prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, he exclaimed—"Do you know what you are doing?

The Peruvians conſulted, and the young man ſaved his life.</p>
            <p>The following example of laudable pride in a ſoldier, was mentioned in a letter from an officer of the American army, written ſoon after the battle of Monmouth.—A ſoldier in that memorable action, fell into the hands of the Engliſh cavalry, when one of them knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him down, and attempted to picrce him through the back with his ſword.—"Strike me in the heart," ſaid he, turning br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The day on which the federal convention agreed to the new conſtitution, preſented to

He replied that he had, but not with a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular attention. The Doctor then obſerved that painters had been puzzled to paint a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle ſun in ſuch manner that the ſpectator could determine whether it was a riſing or a ſetting ſun; he added, that he had viewed the picture before mentioned as often as he had been in the hall, and never had been able to come to a determination, but now he was ſure it was a riſing ſun.</p>
            <p>When governor Johnſton was preſident in Weſt Florida, at a publick meeting of the Indians and commiſſioners for determining the provincial boundaries, he plied the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chems ſo briſkly with liquor, that they were, according to the old ſaying, as great as kings. Meeting the next morning with one of the Indian chiefs, he aſked him what he thought of the liquor he had drank. "It ſeems to me," ſays the copper coloured warrior, "to be a juice extracted from the tongues of wom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en and the hearts of lions; for, after drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing freely of it, I was as loquacious as a wom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, and felt as bold as a lion."</p>
            <p>About fifty years ago, the general aſſembly of New hampſhire uſed to fit in a tavern. A countryman happened to come into Portſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth to buy nails, and was enquiring at the ſhops for ſingle tens. A waggiſh fellow, known by the name of doctor Moſes, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearing him, directed him to the tavern,
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:028720_0114_0FDA62ADA499ACB8"/>where he told him were plenty of ſingle tens. The man went, and inquired of two members who happened to be in the porch—they deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it an inſult on the honour of the houſe, and made a complaint to the ſpeaker. The man was taken into cuſtody and laid the blame on Moſes. He was then ſent for, and having acknowledged the fact, was ordered to receive the ſpeaker's reprimand and aſk pardon on his knees. Moſes obeyed, and having performed his humiliation, as he was riſing from the floor, bruſhed his knees with his hand, and exclaimed, a dirty houſe! a dirty houſe!</p>
            <p>An Indian chief of the Creek nation, being once appointed to negociate a treaty of peace with the people of Southcarolina, was deſired by the governor and council to ſpeak his mind freely, and not to be afraid, for he was among friends.

            <p>At the ſiege of Liſle, in queen Anne's time, upon an attack on ſome of the outworks, the grenadiers of the 15th regiment of foot, were obliged to retire, by the ſpringing of a mine, or by the ſuperiority of the enemy's fire. In this retreat, the lieutenant of thoſe grenadiers, remarkable for his ill treatment of them, was wounded, and fell. The grenadiers were paſſing on, nor heeded his entreaties to help him off. At laſt he laid hold of a pair of ſhoes that was tied to the waiſtbelt of one of them: The grenadier, regardleſs of his ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and in reſentment of his former ill uſage, took out a knife from his pocket, with which he cut the ſtring, and left them with him, with this remarkable expreſſion. "There! There is a new pair of ſhoes for you, to carry you to hell."</p>

            <p>While a ſailor's ſentence was pronouncing, who committed a robbery on the highway, he raiſed a piece of rolled tobacco to his mouth, and held it between his teeth. When the ſentence was finiſhed, he bit off a piece of the tobacco, and began to chew it with great unconcern.—"Sirrah!

            <p>Foote, whoſe talent lay in lampooning and mimickry, even in his early days, had once got the knack of imitating a late general offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, in the ſhrug of his ſoldiers, the liſping of his ſpeech, and ſome other things, for which the general was remarkable, ſo that it grew a common topick among his acquaintance, who uſed to ſay, "Come Sam, let's have the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral's company."

            <p>When Lewis XIV. came to the throne, he was remarkably obſtinate, and it could not be known whether he took advice of any one. He had no publick council, nor any private counſellor.

Johnſon growing piqued at this neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, abruptly left the houſe, and from that hour reſolved to break off all acquaintance with him. Some time after this, lord Cheſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field endeavoured all he could to recover Johnſon's friendſhip, by writing two eſſays in favour of his dictionary, in a periodical paper then publiſhing, called "The World," as well as by other indirect ſolicitations; but all in vain: Johnſon was not only reſolved, but wrote his lordſhip word ſo, in a very remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble letter, wherein, with great dignity and phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophick pride, he begged leave to be diſmiſſed his patronage and acquaintance.

"Serviceable to me, ſir!" ſays the author, "In no reſpect whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever: I had been for years failing round the world of literature, and juſt as I was getting into the chops of the channel, his lordſhip ſends out two little cocko<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The late lord Courtney, who was of one of the oldeſt families in Britain, being married to a miſs Clack, who was much inferior in point of birth, a converſation took place (at which the late biſhop of Exeter was preſent) on the diſparity of the match. "What is your ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection?" ſays the biſhop to a lady who took the principal lead in the converſation. "Want of family, my lord"—"Want of family," ech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oed the biſhop, "why I'll prove her of a better family than his lordſhip.

            <p>Dr. Johnſon being engaged by Mr. Oſborne, a bookſeller, to tranſlate a work of ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, he thought it a reſpect which he owed his own talents, as well as the credit of his employer, to be as circumſpect in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of it as poſſible. In conſequence of which, the work went on (agreeably to Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne's ideas, who meaſured moſt things by the facility with which they were done) rath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſlowly: Accordingly he frequently ſpoke to Dr. Johnſon of this circumſtance; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a man of a coarſe mind, ſometimes by his expreſſions, made him feel the ſituation of dependence. Dr. Johnſon, however, ſeemed to take no notice of him, but went on accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:028720_0126_0FDA62CDB074FBC8"/>to that plan he had preſcribed to himſelf. Oſborne, wiſhing to have the book out to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer ſome temporary purpoſe, and perhaps ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritated by what he thought an ignorant delay, one day went into the room where Dr. John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was, and abuſed him in the moſt illiberal manner: Amongſt other things he told him "he had been much miſtaken in his man; that he was recommended to him as a good ſcholar, and a ready hand; but he doubted both: For that Tom ſuch a one of the Old Baily (if he could rely on his ſobriety) would have turned out the work much ſooner, and that being the caſe, the probability was, that by this here time, the edition would have mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed off."</p>
            <p>Dr. Johnſon heard him for ſome time un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved; but at laſt, loſing all patience, he ſeized up a huge folio, which he was at that time conſulting, and aiming a blow at the bookſeller's head, ſucceeded ſo forcibly, as to ſend him ſprawling to the floor: Oſborne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmed the family with his cries; but, Dr. Johnſon, clapping his foot on his breaſt, would not let him ſtir, till he had expoſed him in that ſituation; and then left him with this triumphant expreſſion:</p>

            <p>The following is an account of the courage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous behaviour of one Gillit a French quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter, who going home to his friends, had the good fortune to ſave the life of a young wom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, attacked by two ruffians. He fell upon them, ſabre in hand, unlocked the jaw of the firſt villain, who held a dagger to her breaſt, and at one ſtroke pared the nails of the other, (who was armed with a piſtol) juſt above the wriſt. Money was offered by the grateful pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; he refuſed it; they offered him their daughter, a young girl of 16, in marriage; the veteran, then in his 73d year, declining, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, "Do you think that I have reſcued her from inſtant death, to put her to a lingering one, by coupling ſo lively a body with one worn out with age?"</p>
            <p>A French officer at a general review before the king, dans la plaine des Sablons in Paris, while he was running on horſeback through the ranks, happened to let his hat fall on the ground; a ſoldier picking it up with a drawn ſword, made a hole into it, which put the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer in ſuch a violent paſſion, that he declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he would ſooner have the ſword through

            <p>Mr. Helvetius had a ſecretary named Bau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dot, who had known him from his infancy: And preſumed from this circumſtance to treat him with as much rude familiarity as a four pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptor would treat his pupil. One of the chief pleaſures of this captious and ill temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man, was to cenſure the conduct, the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, the character and the works of this mild and indulgent philoſopher. His ſtrictures were always concluded with ſevere and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal ſatire. Having once attended with great patience to the railings of Baudot, he went to his lady, one of the moſt virtuous and amiable

            <p>Soon after lord Cheſterfield came into the privy council, a place of great truſt happened to become vacant, to which the king and the duke of Dorſet recommended two very differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent perſons.

            <p>When doctor Samuel Johnſon made the tour of Scotland, in 1773, he was admitted, ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ali gratia, into the fraternity of ſages, known at Edinburgh by the title of the Phyſico Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical Society. The converſation, as uſual, turned upon a very abſtruſe point of meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſicks, viz. Whether a man would accept of exiſtence by choice, or whether the Deity, to carry on the preſent ſyſtem of things, muſt not compel him to exiſtence by neceſſity? After many hours ſpeech in the moſt ſubtle and acute refinements of logick, the whole company turned their eyes on the doctor, and requeſted to hear his ſentiments. His an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer was couched in his uſual cynical ſtrain. "For my part, I think the ſolution of the queſtion ultimately depends on the ſingle cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, of conſidering under what denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of country the ſuppoſed ſubject for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence was to be diſcriminated.

            <p>Dr. Johnſon coming up Fleet ſtreet, at about two o'clock in the morning, was alarmed by a perſon ſeemingly in great diſtreſs. He fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the voice for ſome time, when, by the glimmer of an expiring lamp, he perceived an unhappy female, almoſt naked, and periſhing on a truſs of ſtraw, who had juſt enough to tell him, "ſhe was turned out by an inhuman landlord in that condition, and to beg his char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itable aſſiſtance not to let her die in the ſtreet." The doctor, melted at this ſtory, deſired her to place her confidence in God, for that under him he would be her protector. He accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly looked out for a coach to put her into; but there was none to be had: His charity, however, was too ſtrong to be cooled by ſuch an accident. He kneeled down by her ſide, raiſed her in his arms, wrapped his great coat about her, placed her on his back, and in this condition carried her home to his houſe.</p>
            <p>Next day her diſorder appearing to be vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real, he was adviſed to abandon her; but he replied, "that may be as much her misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune as her fault; I am determined to give her the chance of a reformation;" he accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly kept her in his houſe above thirteen weeks, where ſhe was regularly attended by a phyſician, who recovered her.</p>
            <p>The doctor, during this time learned more of her ſtory, and finding her to be one of thoſe

            <p>During the protectorſhip of Oliver Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, a deſign was formed for reeſtabliſhing the Jews, with full liberty to carry on trade, and exerciſe their religion; but though this affair met with violent oppoſition from the heads of the different ſectaries, yet Oliver ſo far carried his point, as to encourage a ſmall body of them to ſettle in their old quarter, under the direction of Manaſſeh Ben Iſrael, a great rabbi, who ſoon built a ſynagogue and publickly performed divine worſhip. The intelligence which the protector received, from time to time, by means of the extenſive correſpondence and cloſe amity everywhere maintained throughout the univerſe among the ſcattered remains of the Jewiſh nation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed not a little to the ſucceſs of his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes

Accordingly, when the ſhip paſſed by Dover, Smith ſent, and demanded leave to ſearch her. The Dutch captain replied, That none but his maſters ſhould ſearch him. Upon which Smith ſent him word again, that he had ſet up an hour glaſs, and if he did not ſubmit to the ſearch before it was run out, he would ſink him. The Dutchman ſeeing it was in vain to contend with ſuperior force, ſubmitted in time; and ſo all the money was found. The next time Cromwell ſaw lord Orrery, he told him, he had his intelligence from that ſeemingly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn Jew, he ſaw him go to ſome days before.</p>

Morris replied, that there was little or nothing; or at leaſt little or nothing worth notice: That there was indeed a thing come out called an Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay on Man, the firſt epiſtle, threatening more, for he had read it, and it was a moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bomicable piece of ſtuff, ſhocking poetry, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferable philoſophy, no coherence, no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion at all. If I had thought (continued he) that you had not ſeen it, I would have brought it with me. Upon this Mr. Pope frankly told him, "that he had ſeen it before it went to preſs, for it was his own writing, a work of years, and the poetry ſuch as he thought proper for the expreſſion of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; on which ſide he did not imagine it would ever have been attacked, eſpecially by any man pretending to knowledge in the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of numbers." This was like a clap of thunder to the miſtaken bard: He reached his hat, and with a bluſh and a bow, took his leave of Mr. Pope, and never more ventured to ſhew his unlucky face there again.</p>

The king told him he had no intention to ſell him, but if it would oblige him he would treat with him on the ſame ſpot the next morning. The corporal, thruſting out his hand, cried, a match; to which the king conſented, and rode off, giving private orders that no puniſhment ſhould be inflicted upon the corporal, but that he ſhould be brought before him the next morning. In the morning, when the poor fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low was told what had paſſed, and conducted to the king's tent, he was ſeized by a dreadful panick, leſt his inſolence and drunkenneſs might coſt him his life. Into the preſence, however, he was carried; and the king, who

No, an't pleaſe your majeſty, ſays the fellow, that man went away at three o'clock this morning.

               </gap> to them. It happened one day when the council were met, and had ſat ſome time in expectation of his majeſty, that the duke of Lauderdale, who was a furious ungovernable man, quitted the room in a paſſion, and acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally met with Killegrew, to whom he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed himſelf irreverently of the king: Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legrew bade his grace be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ay a wager of a hundred pounds, that he
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:028720_0138_0FDA62F4244314C0"/>would make his majeſty come to council in leſs than half an hour. Lauderdale being a little heated, and under the influence of ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, took him at his word: Kill egrew went to the king, and without ceremony told him what had happened; and added, "I know your majeſty hates Lauderdale, though the neceſſity of your affairs obliges you to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have civilly to him; now if you would get rid of a man you hate, come to the council, for Lauderdale is a man ſo boundleſsly av<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aricious, that rather than pay the hundred pounds loſt in this wager, he will hang him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and never plague you any more." The king was pleaſed with the archneſs of this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, and anſwered, then Killegrew, I'll poſitively go; which he did.</p>
            <p>The biſhop of Soiſſous in France, who valued himſelf on the politeneſs of his addreſs, and was remarkable for never having uttered a rude expreſſion, was once, by an indiſcretion, guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a piece of rudeneſs, ſufficient to make his good breeding be called in queſtion: And which ſhews the precaution that is neceſſary to be uſed in ſpeaking to ſtrangers. This pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late was come at court, where obſerving a lady, who was extremely corpulent, talking to the queen, and at the other end of the room a very genteel youth of a very promiſing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, both of whom were utter ſtrangers to him, he addreſſed himſelf to the young gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, and with a ſoft inſinuating air, after ſome compliments, aſked him if he knew who that Fat Sow was, who was in diſcourſe with
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:028720_0139_0FDA62F5655115D8"/>her majeſty? Yes, my lord, replied the youth, with great modeſty; that Sow is the ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadreſs of Sweden, and mother to the little pig who has the honour to ſpeak to your lordſhip. At this anſwer the biſhop was ſtruck with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, and humbly begged pardon, adding, that he could not help feeling the greateſt eſteem for a perſon, who had with ſuch mildneſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked him for his brutality.</p>
            <p>A few nights ſince I was in company (ſays the writer) with a gentleman that was in the road of Algiers ſome years ago, and was an eye and an ear witneſs to the following ſtory. One day as ſome chriſtian captives, who had been ranſomed, were going to be diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the town cruizers brought in a Swediſh veſſel; one of them hearing it was of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and being from thence himſelf, was very deſirous to ſee the crew, when to his great ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe he ſaw his own father (who was maſter of the ſhip) in the company: The ſon knew the father, but the father who had loſt him when a youth, knew not his ſon, having long given him up as dead. The ſon diſcovered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to the father who embraced him with great tenderneſs: But the recollection of their ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſoon interrupted their joy, and introduced lamentation and deſpair.—At length the young man addreſſed himſelf to his father in this manner: "The ſlavery you are going into, will be inſupportable to you, and ſoon put an end to your life, the thoughts of which are worſe than death to me. I have been here a great many years, and know the country, the people and their work; if they will accept of
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:028720_0140_0FDA62F6E4CC4DA8"/>me in your room, I will go back into ſlavery, and you ſhall go home again:—I know if I ſhould be able to raiſe friends, I ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed;—if not—God's will be done!" The Moors readily accepted the exchange; ſo the father returned to freedom and his home, and the ſon to toil and ſlavery. A memorable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of filial piety.</p>
            <p>The vicar of Bray, in Berkſhire, being a catholick under the reign of Henry VIII. and a proteſtant under Edward VI. a catholick a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain under queen Mary, and a proteſtant in the reign of queen Elizabeth, was reproached as the ſcandal of his gown, by turning from one religion to another; "I cannot help that:" replied the vicar, "but if I changed my religion, I am ſure I have kept true to my principle, which is, to live and die the vicar of Bray."</p>
            <p>Philips, the noted harlequin, was taken up in London on ſuſpicion of debt, and dealt with the officer in the following manner: He firſt called for liquor in abundance, and treated <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll about him, to the no ſmall joy of the bailiff, who was rejoiced to have a calf that bled ſo well, (as they term it.) Harlequin made the honeſt bailiff believe he had ſix dozen of wine ready packed up, which he would ſend for, to drink while in cuſtody, and likewife allow him ſixpence a bottle for drinking it in his own chamber. Shoulderdab liſtened to the propoſal with pleaſure. The bailiff went to the place, as directed, and returned with joy, to hear that it was to be ſent in the morning early. Accordingly it came by a porter, ſweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:028720_0141_0FDA62FE720EE548"/>under his load: The turnkey called to his maſter, and told him the porter and hamper were come in: Very well, ſaid he, then let nothing but the porter and hamper out. The porter performed his part very well: Came heavily in with an empty hamper, and ſeemed to go lightly out, with Philips on his back. He was diſhampered at an alehouſe on the water ſide, croſſed the Thames, and ſoon after embarked for Ireland. He was very fond of this trick, and would take pride in his project, which was contrived long before he was taken, to be ready on ſuch an emergency.</p>
