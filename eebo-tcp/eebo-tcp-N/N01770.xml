            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Deſire to premiſe a few things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the following <hi>Dialogues,</hi> and the Occaſion of their Publication. As to the <hi>Dialogues</hi> themſelves they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a rich and precious ſtore of ſpiritual Knowledge and godly Comfort. They ſpeak to the Hearts of Men in a very eaſie and familiar manner, ſo that the meaneſt <hi>Plough-man,</hi> the very meaneſt of God's People may underſtand them. They treat of that deep but comfortable Doctrin, (that <hi>Soul-pierceing</hi> Doctrin to the wicked and unregenerate, but <hi>Soul-refreſhing</hi> and <hi>Heart-comforting</hi> Doctrin to the Saints, to all righteous and godly Folk;) I mean the Doctrin of <hi>Election</hi> and <hi>Predestination.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now as to the Occaſion of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication of theſe <hi>Dialogues.</hi> Alas <hi>Chriſtians!</hi> I fear there is too, too great Occaſion for them. The many pernicious (and I fear (Alas!) <hi>Soul-destroying</hi>) Books that have been handed up and down in the <hi>Country</hi> as well as <hi>City,</hi> to poiſon and debauch Men's

Minds, call aloud for theſe <hi>Dialogues</hi> (or other ſuch like Diſcourſes) to rectifie Men's Opinions in theſe Matters. There have been many wicked Books written (by the inſtigation of the <hi>Old Serpent</hi> who goes about to deceive) which put falſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, &amp; horrid <hi>Anti-chriſtian</hi> Gloſſes upon <hi>the beſt of Books,</hi> the Fountain of all true and divine Wiſdom, I mean our holy and <hi>precious Bible.</hi> Theſe <hi>Dialogues</hi> will rightly inſtruct Men concerning the true <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Doctrines</hi> of <hi>Election</hi> and <hi>Predeſtination.</hi> Theſe, theſe plain but <hi>Heart-enlightening Dialogues</hi> will ſhew Thee (<hi>Chriſtian Reader</hi>) what was the Opinion of the holy <hi>Martyrs</hi> of the Church in the firſt and pureſt Ages of <hi>Christianity</hi> concerning theſe Doctrines; &amp; oh!

Here I cannot but take notice of the ſad and deplorable Degeneracy of Mankind, who are grown (many of them) to that Height of <hi>malicious ſcorning</hi> of others who happen (tho' <hi>conſcientiouſly</hi>) to diſſent from them, that they will neither read the Books publiſh'd by ſuch Men, <hi>nor ſuffer others to read them, if they can help it:</hi> This, this is an <hi>unchristian-like Practice.</hi> This is ſo unlike the <hi>kind Dealing</hi> which <hi>Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> always makes uſe of, and ſo like the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Practice of the <hi>Synagogue</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> that we <hi>Christians</hi> ought to abhor it. For the <hi>Papiſhes</hi> will Suffer no Books of the <hi>Protest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants</hi> (whom they call <hi>Hereticks</hi>) <hi>to be Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their Countries,</hi> neither will they ſuffer their <hi>Diſciples</hi> (or rather <hi>Slaves) to read them:</hi> I ſay <hi>Slaves,</hi> becauſe thoſe <hi>Maſters</hi> who will not ſuffer their <hi>Proſelytes</hi> to make En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry whether the Doctrines they teach

               <hi>That two abſolute Contradictions canno both be true, but the Will of the true God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd to us in holy Scripture is an abſolute Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to thoſe stoical and fatal Schemes; Therefore it is impoſſible that thoſe Schemes can be true.</hi> The <hi>Minor</hi> is prov'd to a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration in the following Sheets.</p>
            <p>Before I conclude this <hi>Preface,</hi> I beg leave to give a little Advice to thoſe Perſons into whoſe hands theſe Papers may fall, that they wou'd not, if they happen to find any Thing <hi>diſpleaſing to them,</hi> immediately throw them out of their Hands; it may be they may take Offence without Reaſon; but I entreat them to read them quite thro', leſt they be guilty of <hi>Injuſtice,</hi> by giving Sentence <hi>before the Trial of the Matter.</hi> I conclude with an hearty Deſire that theſe Papers may be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively read over, <hi>and for this Reaſon,</hi> becauſe they will rightly inſtruct Thee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning ſome of thoſe Things in <hi>Paul's</hi> Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which <hi>Peter</hi> ſays are hard to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, which they that are unlearned &amp; unſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wreſt, as <hi>they</hi> do alſo the other Scriptures unto their own Deſtruction. <hi>Ye therefore, belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, ſeeing ye know</hi> theſe Things <hi>before, beware lest ye alſo being led away with the Error of the wicked, fall from your own Stedfaſtneſs.

               <p>You eaſily apprehend the Difference betwixt <hi>Justice</hi> and <hi>Cruelty. God</hi> is <hi>Justice,</hi> but ther is nothing of <hi>Cruelty</hi> in his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. <hi>Cruelty</hi> is delighting in the Miſery of another, without any regard to a Fault committed. As Envy is repining at the <hi>Proſperity</hi> of another, let him deſerve it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo well; for an <hi>envious</hi> Man cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to ſee any other in a better Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on than Himſelf.

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Now I underſtand. <hi>God</hi> puniſhes in <hi>Justice,</hi> as He is the Supream <hi>Judge</hi> of the World. But if He made <hi>Creatures</hi> on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to <hi>damn</hi> them, this has all the Notion we can have of <hi>Cruelty.</hi> And if He put it out of their Power not to <hi>ſin,</hi> and left them no <hi>Free-will</hi> to <hi>chuſe</hi> whether they would <hi>ſin</hi> or not, ſee not how this can be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil'd to <hi>Juſtice.</hi> Therefor I think no Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is capable of <hi>ſinning</hi> but what has <hi>free-will. Sin</hi> being the <hi>Inclining</hi> of the <hi>Will</hi> to <hi>Evil,</hi> and not to <hi>Good.</hi> Which if I have no Power to do, I can neither do <hi>Good</hi> nor <hi>Evil.</hi> I have no Title to <hi>Reward,</hi> nor am I lyable to <hi>Puniſhment.</hi> And what a <hi>Jest</hi> wou'd it be in you, if you ſhou'd pretend to <hi>argue</hi> with me, to <hi>promiſe</hi> or <hi>threaten,</hi> to perſwade me to do ſuch a Thing, if you
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:002100_0013_0FBB817105FDD040"/>
knew before-hand that it was <hi>impoſſible</hi> for me to do it? Suppoſe you ſhou'd tye me Hand &amp; Foot, throw me into a <hi>Priſon, bolt</hi> and <hi>fetter</hi> me down to the Floor, lock the Doors faſt upon me, and then <hi>ſet-fire</hi> to it,—then <hi>preach</hi> to me in at the Window, and uſe moſt <hi>pathetical</hi> Exhortations to me to come out, and why wou'd I ſtay there to be <hi>burn'd?</hi> And ſhou'd <hi>Swear</hi> to me, <hi>as I live I don't deſire your Death, nor have any Pleaſure in it;</hi> and ſhou'd <hi>promiſe</hi> me great <hi>Rewards</hi> if I wou'd come out; wou'd not this be <hi>inſulting</hi> my <hi>Miſery,</hi> and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Aggravation of <hi>Cruelty</hi> that is poſſible to be imagin'd? Yet this is the <hi>Notion</hi> thoſe rigid <hi>Calviniſts</hi> wou'd have us entertain of the <hi>Goodneſs</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> of all his gracious <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,</hi> and of his <hi>Threatnings</hi> to us, if we forſake not our <hi>Iniquities,</hi> and deliver our ſelves out of that <hi>Priſon</hi> and <hi>Bondage</hi> of <hi>Sin</hi> into which we had caſt our ſelves, by our habitual wicked Courſes. This is the Caſe, as they put it. And I have made it eaſie to my ſelf to apprehend it, by this familiar Example I have given, that I ſee it before my Eyes, and <hi>detest</hi> and <hi>abhor</hi> it! But ſtill I have a Queſtion to ask upon this Point. We ſay in the <hi>Collect</hi> for the <hi>Second Sunday</hi> in <hi>Lent,</hi> That <hi>we have no power of our ſelves
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:002100_0014_0FBB81742A68F2E8"/>
to help our ſelves.</hi> Is not this the Caſe I put of the <hi>Priſon?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, fully. If we conſider our <hi>Help</hi> as only from <hi>our ſelves.</hi> When Man had fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len by his <hi>Rebellion</hi> againſt <hi>God;</hi> he was no ways able to deliver himſelf either from the <hi>Dominion</hi> of <hi>Sin,</hi> or from the <hi>Priſon</hi> of <hi>Death</hi> to which it was <hi>doom'd.</hi> But <hi>Chriſt</hi> our bleſſed <hi>Saviour</hi> enter'd into that <hi>Priſon</hi> in our <hi>Nature,</hi> and in our <hi>Stead,</hi> and made full <hi>Satisfaction</hi> for all the <hi>Sins</hi> of that <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> to be apply'd to all who laid hold up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, by a <hi>true</hi> and <hi>lively Faith,</hi> and a ſincere <hi>Repentance</hi> for their <hi>Sins.</hi> He open'd the <hi>Priſon-Doors,</hi> and preach'd Deliverance to all who wou'd accept of his <hi>Salvation.</hi> And to thoſe who are <hi>willing,</hi> he gives the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of his <hi>Grace,</hi> to help their <hi>Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities.</hi> And this is neceſſary to all the Actions of our Life. Without this, we can neither do a good <hi>Deed,</hi> nor think a good <hi>Thought.</hi> So that all the <hi>Glory</hi> is ſtill to <hi>Him.</hi> Yet <hi>ſomething</hi> is ſtill leſt for <hi>us</hi> to do. We muſt <hi>work</hi> with <hi>Him,</hi> becauſe He <hi>works</hi> in <hi>us</hi> both to <hi>will,</hi> and to <hi>do.</hi>

               <p>Thus then I take it. If I <hi>manure</hi> my Ground never ſo well, yet without the <hi>Sun</hi> it will not bear. On the other
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:002100_0015_0FBB817595971598"/>
Hand, if I do not <hi>prepare</hi> my Ground, the <hi>Sun</hi> will not bring a <hi>Crop</hi> I did not <hi>ſow.</hi> Nay it is the <hi>Sun</hi> too which, with my <hi>Labour,</hi> do's prepare the Ground, and <hi>fit</hi> it to receive the <hi>Seed.</hi> So that in Effect all is from the <hi>Sun,</hi> both to prepare the <hi>Earth,</hi> and enable it to bring forth the <hi>Seed.</hi> Yet our <hi>Labour</hi> is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, not as what <hi>produces</hi> any Thing, but only to <hi>remove</hi> what hinders the <hi>Production.</hi> Now I compare the <hi>Sun</hi> to the <hi>Grace</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> without which we can do nothing. And our <hi>Working,</hi> tho' it can <hi>produce</hi> nothing of it ſelf, yet it prepares the <hi>Heart</hi> to receive the <hi>Influence</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi> of <hi>Righteouſneſs.</hi> So that, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, he that <hi>planteth</hi> is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, nor he that <hi>watereth,</hi> but <hi>God</hi> who giveth the Encreaſe. And this was the <hi>Baptiſm</hi> of <hi>Repentance</hi> St. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> was ſent to <hi>preach,</hi> to turn the <hi>Hearts</hi> of the <hi>Fathers</hi> to the <hi>Children,</hi> and the <hi>Hearts</hi> of the <hi>Children</hi> to their <hi>Fathers,</hi> to ſoften the <hi>Ground</hi> of the <hi>Heart,</hi> to take out thoſe <hi>Stones</hi> and <hi>Hardneſs</hi> which wou'd hinder it to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the <hi>Seed</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel.</hi> For THEY who are proof againſt even <hi>Natural Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> are deaf to all the <hi>Charms</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel.</hi> And this was truly <hi>preparing</hi> the Way to our <hi>Saviour,</hi> to <hi>fit</hi> and <hi>diſpoſe</hi> Men to receive his <hi>ſelf-denying Doctrine.</hi> This is a <hi>prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
                  <pb n="7" facs="unknown:002100_0016_0FBB817849774378"/>
and <hi>preparing Grace;</hi> which whoſo <hi>reſiſts,</hi> nips the <hi>Seed</hi> in the <hi>Bud,</hi> and brings no <hi>Fruit</hi> to <hi>Perfection.</hi> In vain then do theſe <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable Servants</hi> plead their own want of <hi>Strength</hi> as an <hi>Excuſe,</hi> while they reſiſt that <hi>Grace</hi> which is offer'd them for an <hi>Help.</hi> Suppoſe I was <hi>lame,</hi> and cou'd not go where my <hi>Life</hi> depended upon it.

us, <hi>after the Manner of Men,</hi> which in the <hi>Schools</hi> is call'd, <hi>ad Captum,</hi> that is to our <hi>Capacities.</hi> For otherwiſe we cou'd not <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand</hi> them. We have no words that can <hi>properly</hi> expreſs the <hi>infinit Nature</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> He is <hi>eternal</hi> and dwells in <hi>Eternity,</hi> but we have no words but of <hi>Time.</hi> We cannot conceive a <hi>Duration</hi> without <hi>past, preſent,</hi> and <hi>to come,</hi> yet theſe cannot be in <hi>God.</hi> For then He muſt have a <hi>Beginning,</hi> and wou'd <hi>gain</hi> or <hi>loſe</hi> in Proceſs of Time, as we do. All Things are <hi>preſent</hi> to Him. Therefor wherever <hi>Fore</hi> or <hi>After</hi> is attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to <hi>God</hi> in <hi>holy Scripture,</hi> we muſt take that Word <hi>ad Captum,</hi> becauſe ther is no <hi>Fore</hi> or <hi>After</hi> in <hi>God.</hi> Such is the Word <hi>Pre-Deſtination,</hi> or <hi>Fore-Ordaining,</hi> or <hi>Fore-Knowing.</hi> God <hi>knows</hi> all Things. But He <hi>fore-knows</hi> nothing, becauſe all Things are <hi>Preſent</hi> to Him.

<pb n="9" facs="unknown:002100_0018_0FBB817AE2CC5728"/>
if we ſhould <hi>argue ſtrictly</hi> and <hi>properly</hi> from ſuch Expreſſions, we muſt deny the <hi>Being</hi> of a <hi>God,</hi> for ſuch <hi>Paſſions</hi> are totally <hi>incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent</hi> with the <hi>Being</hi> of a <hi>God.</hi> Now if I ſhou'd argue from God's being ſaid to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,</hi> that He is <hi>changeable,</hi> and 20 other Conſequences might be drawn from thence, What wou'd Dr. <hi>Edwards</hi> ſay to me? Wou'd He not tell me, that I was <hi>totally</hi> out of the Way, and ought not to draw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch Conſequences from a Word that was only <hi>ad Captum.</hi> The ſame I ſay to Him as to <hi>Predestination,</hi> which is only <hi>ad Captum,</hi> and no more a <hi>Scripture-Word,</hi> than God's <hi>repenting,</hi> &amp;c. And if He will not give me leave to draw <hi>Conſequences</hi> from the <hi>one,</hi> neither will I give him leave to draw <hi>Conſequences</hi> from the <hi>other,</hi> both being equally <hi>abſurd.</hi> And let Him ſhew me a reaſon more for the <hi>one</hi> than the <hi>other,</hi> if He can.

But the <hi>Perplexities</hi> of this Diſpute have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſen from taking the Word in the <hi>ſtrict</hi> and <hi>literal</hi> Senſe, without any <hi>as if,</hi> or <hi>Compariſon</hi> in the Caſe, or any <hi>Allowance</hi> for a Word <hi>ad Captum:</hi> But down-right ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a Time <hi>past</hi> in <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>Decree</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready <hi>past,</hi> concerning Things <hi>to Come</hi> with <hi>God.</hi> Which <hi>Abſurdity</hi> being granted, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers follow <hi>in-extricable</hi> on both ſides.

the Diſpute, ſo remove the firſt <hi>Abſurdity,</hi> and all clears up on both ſides.

               <p>Sir, I underſtand. And if others wou'd take notice of what you have ſaid, it would ſtop our arguing and wrangling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, while it is plain we ſet out upon a wrong Foundation, in applying <hi>past</hi> and <hi>future</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> which is only as to us. And it is of <hi>God only</hi> we ſpeak, when we ſpeak of his eternal <hi>Decrees</hi> before <hi>Man</hi> was made. For <hi>Man</hi> was not then in the Caſe, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than as all <hi>future</hi> Things are <hi>preſent</hi>
                  <pb n="12" facs="unknown:002100_0021_0FBB8181B74DE5E0"/>
with <hi>God.</hi> But if we will apply this to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, then it will follow, that I was <hi>born</hi> before I was <hi>born,</hi> even from <hi>Eternity,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe my <hi>Birth</hi> was then <hi>preſent</hi> with <hi>God.</hi> And my <hi>Death</hi> is now <hi>preſent</hi> with <hi>Him,</hi> therefor I am now <hi>Dead!</hi> And when I am <hi>dead,</hi> I am not <hi>dead,</hi> becauſe all live to Him! Thus we apply to our ſelves what we call his <hi>Fore-Decrees,</hi> and ſay that the <hi>Freedom</hi> of our <hi>Will</hi> is now ty'd up by them. Therefor let me make this Experiment. Let us leave the Word <hi>Fore</hi> out of the Diſpute, and ſay only, that God <hi>ordains</hi> the <hi>Puniſhment</hi> of <hi>Wickedneſs,</hi> and the <hi>Reward</hi> of <hi>Vertue;</hi> and ther is no <hi>Difficulty</hi> at all in this. But when we ſay (in the rigid <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinistical</hi> Senſe) that <hi>God Fore-ordains,</hi> there comes in all the Confuſion.</p>

               <p>The Account you gave me laſt Time, Sir, of <hi>Predestination</hi> has ſatisfy'd me, that in the <hi>Scripture-ſenſe</hi> of the Word, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken only <hi>ad Captum,</hi> as you expreſs it, it is a moſt <hi>comfortable Doctrin,</hi> and full of Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to all good <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> But that the rigid <hi>Calvinistical</hi> Notion of it, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences they draw from it, are not only moſt <hi>abſurd,</hi> but likewiſe <hi>blaſphemous</hi> againſt <hi>God.</hi>

               <p>And the <hi>Effects</hi> of it (ſome of which I have ſeen) among the common <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> are terrible. For their <hi>Heads</hi> being perpetually fill'd with the abſtruſe Notions of <hi>Predeſtination, Election, Reprobation,</hi> and <hi>Secret Decrees</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> and that they have no <hi>Free-will</hi> or <hi>Choice</hi> what to do, but muſt go on as it is <hi>ſecretly Decreed.</hi> This, as it of common Conſequence makes Men careleſs; (for why ſhou'd they <hi>ſtruggle</hi> when ther is no <hi>remedy,</hi> and their <hi>Sentence</hi> is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy paſt, and that <hi>ir-revocably?</hi>) So it is obſervable, that more of THESE dye in <hi>Deſpair,</hi> than of any other ſort of People.

ſhall I do for <hi>Aſſurance!</hi> And when the <hi>Merits</hi> and <hi>Satisfaction</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> has been <hi>preach'd</hi> to them, they wou'd ſay, <hi>alas!</hi> What is that to me, if I be not one of the <hi>Elect?</hi> For <hi>Christ</hi> dy'd <hi>only</hi> for the <hi>Elect.</hi> (This is another of their <hi>Doctrines,</hi> purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant to their <hi>Notion</hi> of <hi>Predeſtination,</hi> that the <hi>Decrees</hi> of <hi>God</hi> may not be fruſtrated.)

               <p>I thank God my <hi>Faith</hi> (which I have learn'd in the Church of <hi>England</hi>) is this, That <hi>Chriſt</hi> dy'd for all Mankind, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently for <hi>me</hi> in particular.

               <p>I Hope Sir, that what you have ſaid of <hi>Predeſtination</hi> will ſatisfie others as well as it has me. <hi>First,</hi> that the whole Diſpute, as manag'd by the <hi>Calvinists,</hi> is all built upon a wrong <hi>Foundation,</hi> even by their own <hi>Confeſſion,</hi> in arguing <hi>ſtrictly</hi> from Words <hi>ad Captum,</hi> and which they confeſs to be ſo; and will not ſuffer the like to be done in any other Caſe. Therefor that they ought to ſtop their Diſputes upon this Point, till they can find <hi>proper</hi> Words to ſpeak by, if they will ſpeak <hi>properly</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> And theſe Diſputes ought to ceaſe for a ſecond Reaſon you have given, which is, that they are <hi>uſeleſs,</hi> becauſe whatever the <hi>ſecret Decrees</hi> of <hi>God</hi> may be ſuppos'd to be, yet that they cannot <hi>go against</hi> or <hi>invalidate</hi> his Will declar'd openly in the <hi>holy Scriptures,</hi> for that wou'd be to <hi>contradict</hi> Himſelf. Therefor that we may work in <hi>Hope,</hi> and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully apply our ſelves to the <hi>performing</hi> of what He has <hi>commanded</hi> us; with full <hi>Trust</hi> and <hi>Aſſurance</hi> in what He has <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd,</hi> without <hi>perplexing</hi> and <hi>intangling</hi> our ſelves in theſe <hi>Diſputes</hi> about his <hi>ſecret
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:002100_0029_0FBB8191E38BCEC8"/>
Decrees;</hi> for they muſt go according to his <hi>reveal'd Will.</hi> In this we are <hi>ſure,</hi> and therefor theſe <hi>Diſputes</hi> are at the beſt <hi>uſeleſs</hi> to us; but of moſt pernicious <hi>Conſequence</hi> when taken by the wrong Handle, as you have fully ſhew'd. But ther is one Thing wherein Dr. <hi>Edwards</hi> and the <hi>Predestinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> do very much boaſt, they ſay that their Doctrin is agreeable to our 39 <hi>Articles;</hi> and therefor that our <hi>Clergy</hi> have <hi>apoſtatiz'd</hi> (as Dr. <hi>Edwards</hi> words it) from the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> and that the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> are the true <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> becauſe they hold <hi>Predeſtination,</hi> and are againſt <hi>Free-will,</hi> as they ſay our <hi>Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> likewiſe ſpeak. Now tho' this be no Argument as to the Doctrin it ſelf, yet to thoſe of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> it is of very great <hi>Conſequence,</hi> as well to vindicate the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> as to ſtop the Mouths of <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> which are all open upon us on this Account.</p>

               <p>The 17th <hi>Article</hi> is of <hi>Predeſtination.</hi> And keeps to the <hi>Scripture-Phraſe</hi> of God's <hi>ordaining before the World began,</hi> of <hi>calling</hi> whom he <hi>fore-knew, justifying, ſanctifying</hi> them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which is to be underſtood in the <hi>ſame</hi> and no <hi>other</hi> ſenſe than as theſe Words are us'd in <hi>holy Scripture,</hi> which all agree to be <hi>ad Captum,</hi> as we have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours'd it before. And theſe Expreſſions of <hi>Scripture</hi> are, according to our Capacities and Manner of ſpeaking, as this <hi>Article</hi> ſays, <hi>full of ſweet, pleaſant and unſpeakable Comfort to godly Perſons.</hi> But then this <hi>Article</hi> checks the <hi>Curioſities</hi> of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute (which is what I have been bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming) and ſays, <hi>For curious and carnal Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons lacking the Spirit of Chriſt, to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually before their Eyes the Sentence of God's Predestination, is a most dangerous Down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal, whereby the Devil doth thrust them ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into Deſperation, or into Wretchleſneſs of most unclean Living, no leſs Pernicious than Deſperation.</hi>

               <p>THer is one Point remaining that follows from that of <hi>Predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> we have been upon; in which I wou'd have you, <hi>Country-man,</hi> to be well ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and therefor muſt examin you a little upon it. Theſe <hi>Predeſtinarians</hi> placing all upon the eternal <hi>Decrees</hi> of <hi>Election</hi> and <hi>Reprobation,</hi> allow not of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> or that <hi>Christ</hi> dy'd for <hi>All.</hi> Becauſe, ſay they, if <hi>Chriſt</hi> dy'd for the <hi>Reprobate,</hi> it was totally in vain, and the End of his

                  <hi>Sufferings</hi> muſt be fruſtrated as to them. Beſides that he cou'd not intend or deſign to <hi>Save</hi> thoſe whom <hi>God</hi> had <hi>Reprobated</hi> by an <hi>eternal Decree.</hi>
               </p>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>As to <hi>eternal Decrees,</hi> enough has been ſaid to that already, that ther is no arguing from it, being only Words <hi>ad Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> and therefor not to be <hi>strictly</hi> and <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly</hi> taken. So I diſmiſs that Point. But now as to <hi>univerſal Redemption,</hi> the <hi>Scripture</hi> is plain, which ſays, That <hi>Christ dy'd for all.</hi> And <hi>wou'd have none to periſh, but all to come to the Knowledge of the Truth.</hi> And <hi>as in Adam all dye, even ſo in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive.</hi> And many other ſuch like Texts.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>But all are not made <hi>alive,</hi> that is, in <hi>Christ,</hi> ſo as to be <hi>Saved,</hi> for many <hi>periſh.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Yet <hi>Christ</hi> dy'd even for thoſe who <hi>periſh.</hi> As it is ſaid 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.11. in the Caſe of giving <hi>Scandal</hi> to a weak Brother. <hi>And thro' thy Knowledge ſhall the weak Brother pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, for whom Christ died?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now I help my ſelf to underſtand this, by a familiar Example. Suppoſe you came to a <hi>Priſon,</hi> and taking a Liſt of all the <hi>Debtors,</hi> ſhou'd pay all their <hi>Debts, Coſts,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:002100_0036_0FBB819F82307490"/>
Charges</hi> and all. And opening the <hi>Priſon-Doors,</hi> ſhou'd tell them, they were all at LI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BERTY who wou'd <hi>accept</hi> of it, and <hi>come out</hi> in ſuch a Time. After which the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon-Doors</hi> ſhou'd be <hi>lock'd</hi> again, and they ſhou'd be kept there, 'till they had paid the <hi>uttermost Farthing.</hi> Upon this, ſome thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully accept of your Goodneſs, and <hi>come out.</hi> But ther are others, who deſpiſe your <hi>Mercy,</hi> or will not <hi>believe</hi> you, or underſtand not the <hi>pleaſure</hi> of <hi>Liberty,</hi> but prefer the ſordid Life of a <hi>Priſon,</hi> the <hi>Pot</hi> and the <hi>Pipe,</hi> and will not <hi>come out.</hi> Which is the very <hi>Condemnation</hi> our <hi>Saviour</hi> ſpoke of when He ſaid, that <hi>Light was come into the World, but Men loved Darkneſs rather than Light, becauſe their Deeds were evil.</hi> The <hi>Light</hi> was offer'd to all. But ſome lov'd <hi>Darkneſs</hi> better. It is ſaid that <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> are ſet before us, yet ſome chuſe <hi>Death.</hi> An <hi>Habit</hi> of <hi>Sinning</hi> contracts a Love to it, that we are loth to leave it.</p>
               <p>The Application is this. The <hi>Debt</hi> of thoſe <hi>Priſoners</hi> who Stay'd in the <hi>Priſon</hi> was pay'd as well as of thoſe who came out. And as the <hi>Releaſe</hi> of the one is wholly owing to Him who pay'd the <hi>Debt;</hi> ſo the <hi>Condemnation</hi> of the other, lies wholly at his own Door, becauſe, He wou'd not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:002100_0037_0FBB81A10BF94308"/>
of his <hi>Liberty. Something</hi> was left to the <hi>Priſoners</hi> to do, <hi>to chuſe whether they wou'd come out, or stay in.</hi> God (tho' a God of infinit Mercy) will not ſave us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our Will. This ſhews <hi>Free-will.</hi> But ther is no <hi>Merit</hi> in us, when we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of his <hi>Salvation.</hi> We pay not a <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> of the <hi>Debt,</hi> He pays it all. And all the <hi>Thanks</hi> and the <hi>Glory</hi> is to Him. But if He did not pay my <hi>Debt,</hi> how cou'd I be blam'd for ſtaying in the <hi>Priſon,</hi> when my <hi>Debt</hi> lay ſtill upon me, that I cou'd not get out? How cou'd I be call'd <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful</hi> to Him who <hi>pay'd</hi> nothing for me, nor ever did <hi>deſign</hi> it? And how can wicked Men be blam'd for <hi>trampling</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Foot the Blood of the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> for <hi>deſpiſing</hi> and <hi>reſiſting</hi> his <hi>Grace,</hi> if He Shed <hi>no Blood</hi> for them, nor ever gave them any <hi>ſaving Grace?</hi>

               <p>I deſire Dr. <hi>Edwards</hi> (or any One of his Opinion) to anſwer this. But this brings me to another Point which follows in the Train of <hi>Conſequences</hi> of theſe Mens Notion of <hi>Predestination.</hi> For from the <hi>eternal Decrees,</hi> as they put it, they infer that ther can be no failing from <hi>Grace,</hi> becauſe this might defeat the <hi>Decree.</hi> And therefor that Men cannot
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:002100_0038_0FBB81A2785BDF28"/>
finally <hi>reſiſt</hi> his <hi>Grace,</hi> or fall from it. This minds me of a remarkable Paſſage told by Dr. <hi>Bates,</hi> who wrote the <hi>Elen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus Motuum nuperorum in Anglia.</hi> He as a Phyſician was call'd upon to aſſiſt that Night that <hi>Oliver</hi> (that Chriſtian Heroe in ſome Mens Eſteem) prov'd a true <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverer</hi> of his Country. The <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper</hi> was in great <hi>Agonies</hi> of <hi>Mind,</hi> often <hi>ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> and ask'd them if they ſaw any Thing? At length He calls for his <hi>Chaplains.</hi> And the firſt Queſtion He ask'd them was, <hi>If there was any falling from Grace?</hi> To which being anſwered, NO,—<hi>then,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I am ſafe.</hi> For He ſuppos'd that ſome Time or other in his Life he might have had a little <hi>Grace.</hi> And then his <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation,</hi> with the <hi>Murder</hi> of the <hi>King</hi> his <hi>Royal</hi> and <hi>Religious Maſter,</hi> and <hi>Devastation</hi> of <hi>three Kingdoms,</hi> beſides much <hi>Blood-ſhed</hi> abroad, and the <hi>Overthrow</hi> of the <hi>establiſh'd Church,</hi> cou'd do him no Hurt! This is a ſhort Way of quieting <hi>Conſcience!</hi> and to lull Men aſleep in their <hi>Sins!</hi> Thus poor <hi>Souls</hi> are deluded by theſe <hi>Doctrins</hi> of <hi>Decrees!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In Conſequence of which it is a <hi>Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im</hi> with them, that <hi>God ſees no Sin in his Elect.</hi> Which is indeed, that the <hi>Elect</hi> cannot <hi>ſin.</hi> They ſay that <hi>David</hi> was nothing out of
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:002100_0039_0FBB81A41DBCD6B8"/>
God's Favour while he continued in his Sin, more than before he <hi>committed</hi> it, or than after he <hi>repented.</hi> Nay ſome of them have wrote expreſly againſt <hi>Repentance,</hi> as being a <hi>Derogation</hi> from the <hi>Decrees</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> &amp; ſuppoſing 'em to be <hi>conditional.</hi> Whence others have likewiſe ſpoke againſt <hi>Good-Works.</hi> What! Do we think that any Thing we can do, can reverſe or alter the <hi>Decrees</hi> of <hi>God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as they think the <hi>Elect</hi> cannot <hi>ſin,</hi> ſo they ſay that others can do nothing elſe but <hi>ſin.</hi> Thus the ſame Actions are <hi>Sin</hi> in <hi>One,</hi> and <hi>Piety</hi> in the <hi>other.</hi> As the <hi>Poet</hi> ſaid,

               <p>Your Remark is juſt, Country-man. This was the chief Reaſon, that made that <hi>Arch-Heretick,</hi> that <hi>uncircumcis'd Philiſtine,</hi> their infamous Mr. <hi>James Peirce,</hi> who is one of the chief of theſe <hi>Infidels,</hi> I ſay it was chiefly his Inclination to this <hi>Hereſie</hi> that made him ſo loudly exclaim againſt the <hi>Festivals</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of our excellent <hi>Church;</hi> particularly againſt our <hi>Bowing,</hi> in the <hi>publick Aſſemblies,</hi> at the moſt <hi>ſolemn.</hi> and <hi>devout</hi> Mention of the <hi>Name</hi> of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver bleſſed JESUS.</p>
               <p>This made him ſay, in his <hi>Vindication</hi> of the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> page 531. <q>But we can ſee no Reaſon why we ſhou'd rather bow at the Name of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> than at the Name <hi>God, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah, Christ, or Saviour,</hi> which is the ſame with <hi>Jeſus.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Therefor in Anſwer to this arrogant and <hi>inſulting Infidel,</hi> and to all other Enemies of our holy <hi>Christian Faith,</hi> I will inſtruct Thee my <hi>Christian Friend</hi> concerning the true
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:002100_0043_0FBB81AC8F0DBAB0"/>
Reaſon of that <hi>laudable</hi> and truly <hi>Pious</hi> Cuſtom, I mean <hi>that</hi> of <hi>reverently Bowing</hi> in the publick Aſſemblies of <hi>Christians,</hi> at the <hi>ſolemn</hi> Mention of the Sacred <hi>Name</hi> of the <hi>holy,</hi> the <hi>ever-bleſſed</hi> and always to be adored JESUS,</p>
               <p>The Word JESUS ſignifies a <hi>Saviour,</hi> and is the <hi>proper</hi> Name of OUR <hi>bleſſed Saviour,</hi> who had this Name given Him by the <hi>Angel,</hi> before He was conceiv'd in the <hi>Womb.</hi> So that this is his <hi>Perſonal</hi> Name. The Word <hi>Christ</hi> denotes <hi>only</hi> his <hi>Office,</hi> as He was the <hi>anointed</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> which that <hi>Word</hi> ſignifies.</p>
               <p>Now, there was in the <hi>Apostles</hi> Time, a Set of <hi>Hereticks,</hi> as <hi>Cerinthus</hi> and his <hi>Followers,</hi> who deny'd <hi>This Jeſus</hi> to be the <hi>Christ.</hi> They ſaid that <hi>Christ,</hi> or the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> (for they made no Diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) dwelt in <hi>Jeſus,</hi> as in other holy Men. That it deſcended upon Him at his <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> but left Him on the <hi>Croſs,</hi> which made Him cry, <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forſaken me?</hi> Againſt theſe the <hi>Apostles</hi> wrote. And the Burden of their Arguments was to prove that THIS <hi>Jeſus</hi> is the <hi>Christ.</hi> As St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid, (<hi>Act.</hi> 2.36.) <hi>Therefore let all the Houſe of Iſrael know aſſuredly, that God hath made
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:002100_0044_0FBB81ADEAA8EDD0"/>
that ſame Jeſus whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Chriſt.</hi> And St. <hi>John</hi> ſays, (<hi>Joh.</hi> 20.31.) <hi>Theſe Things are written, that ye might believe that Jeſus is the Chriſt, the Son of God.</hi> And 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.22.) <hi>Who is a Liar, but he that denieth that Jeſus is the Chriſt?</hi> Wherefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, (<hi>Phil.</hi> 2.10.) <hi>That at the Name of</hi> JESUS <hi>every Knee ſhould bow.</hi> This was owning HIM to be the <hi>Christ.</hi> Which is truly to be a <hi>Christian.</hi> And the <hi>Bowing</hi> at any <hi>other Name,</hi> do's not ſhew this. To bow at the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>God</hi> do's not diſtinguiſh me from a <hi>Jew,</hi> a <hi>Mahometan,</hi> or an <hi>Heathen,</hi> who all acknowledge a <hi>God.</hi> And to bow at the Name of <hi>Chriſt</hi> or the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> do's not ſhew but that I may be a <hi>Jew,</hi> for they own a <hi>Christ,</hi> and expect him yet to come. But they expreſly deny that <hi>this</hi> JESUS is the Chriſt. And (alas!) we have the ſame Cauſe of diſtinguiſhing our ſelves at this Day, where many that ſhelter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under the Name of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> (ay, and good <hi>Proteſtants</hi> too) are profeſs'd <hi>Deiſts,</hi> and <hi>blaſpheme</hi> that worthy <hi>Name</hi> by which we are called, ſaying, <q>The old Romans did him Juſtice to puniſh Him with the Death of a Slave.</q> — (Oh! curſed Blaſphemy!) This is taken out of a Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:002100_0045_0FBB81AF5F5C80E0"/>
entit'led, <hi>The Growth of Deiſm,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd and recommended by the infamous and execrable <hi>Tyndal</hi> in his blaſphemous Book of the <hi>Rights;</hi> (which Book of the <hi>Rights</hi> is highly valued by many of the <hi>Diſſenters.</hi> — Unhappy Men!) And we ſhall not diſtinguiſh our ſelves from theſe by <hi>Bowing</hi> at the Name of <hi>God.</hi> Then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, the <hi>Quakers</hi> do expreſly deny the Man <hi>Jeſus</hi> to be the <hi>Christ,</hi> they run in directly with the <hi>Hereſie</hi> of <hi>Cerinthus,</hi> and ſay that <hi>Chriſt</hi> or the <hi>Light</hi> dwelt in <hi>Jeſus,</hi> they make <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Jeſus</hi> to be <hi>two.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for <hi>Bowing</hi> at the Name of <hi>Chriſt</hi> will not diſtinguiſh us from theſe. But <hi>Bowing</hi> at the Sacred Name of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> is owning THAT <hi>Perſon,</hi> THAT Man <hi>Jeſus</hi> to be the <hi>Chriſt.</hi> And nothing leſs than this (owning <hi>Chriſt</hi>) can denominate a Man to be a <hi>Chriſtian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I don't ſay it is <hi>neceſſary</hi> or an <hi>Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> always to <hi>bow</hi> at the Name of <hi>Jeſus.</hi> But I hope I may ſay from the <hi>Authorities</hi> and <hi>Reaſons</hi> I have offer'd, that ther can be no <hi>Harm</hi> in it, far leſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Superstition.</hi> That it is highly <hi>decent</hi> and a <hi>Profeſſion</hi> of our <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi> And that THOSE who refrain from it out of a <hi>Principle,</hi> give Grounds of <hi>Suſpicion, that

they are not ſound in the Faith,</hi> and lean more to the <hi>Deiſts, Socinians</hi> or <hi>Principles</hi> of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> than to the <hi>Chriſtian Church.</hi> At leaſt they give Countenance to theſe <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Chriſtianity,</hi> while they joyn with them in refuſing this <hi>Publick Atteſtation</hi> which the Church gives of her <hi>Faith</hi> in the <hi>crucify'd</hi> JESUS.

            </opener>
            <p n="1">I. WHEN I heard of your well order'd Love and Charity in God, being full of joy I deſired much to ſpeak unto you in the Faith of Jeſus Chriſt. For hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been thought worthy to obtain a moſt Excellent Name, in the Bonds which I carry about, I ſalute the Churches; wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in them a Union both of the Body &amp; Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt, our Eternal Life: <hi>As alſo</hi> of Faith and Charity, to which nothing is preferred: But eſpecially of Jeſus and the
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:002100_0049_0FBB81B5F9CBBB08"/>
Father; in whom if we undergo all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries of the Prince of this preſent World, and eſcape, we ſhall enjoy God.</p>
            <p n="2">II. SEEING then I have been judged worthy to ſee you, by DAMAS your moſt Excellent Biſhop; and by your <hi>very</hi> worthy Presbyters BASSUS, and APOLLONIUS; and by my Fellow Servant SOTIO the Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con; in whom I rejoyce, foraſmuch as He is ſubject unto <hi>his</hi> Biſhop as to the Grace of God, and to the Presbytery as to the Law of Jeſus Chriſt; <hi>I determined to Write unto you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. WHEREFORE it will become you alſo not to uſe your Biſhop too familiarly upon the account of his Youth; but to yield all Reverence to Him according to the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God the Father: As alſo I perceive that your Holy Presbyters do; not conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Age, which indeed to appearance is Young; but as becomes thoſe who are Prudent in God, ſubmitting to Him, or rather not to Him, but to the Father of <hi>our Lord</hi> Jeſus Chriſt the Biſhop of us All. It will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore behove you, with all Sincerity, to obey your <hi>Biſhop;</hi> in Honour of Him whoſe pleaſure it is <hi>that you ſhould do ſo.</hi> Becauſe he that <hi>does not do ſo,</hi> deceives not the Biſhop whom he ſees, but affronts him that is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible.
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:002100_0050_0FBB81B797335C90"/>
For whatſoever of this kind <hi>is done,</hi> it reflects not upon Man, but upon God, who knows the Secrets of <hi>our Hearts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">IV. IT is therefore fitting, that we ſhould not only be called Chriſtians, but be ſo. As ſome call <hi>indeed their Governour,</hi> Biſhop; but yet do all things without Him. But I can never think that ſuch as theſe have a good Conſcience, ſeeing they are not gather'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether throughly according to <hi>God's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">V. SEEING then <hi>all</hi> things have an End, there are theſe two indifferently ſet before Us, Death and Life: And every one ſhall depart unto his proper place. For as there are two ſorts of Coins, the one of God, the other of the World; and each of theſe has its proper Inſcription engraven upon it; <hi>So alſo is it Here.</hi> The Unbelievers are of this World; but the Faithful, through Charity, have the Character of God the Father by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt: By whom if we are not readily diſpoſed to Die after the likeneſs of his Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, His Life is not in Us.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. FORASMUCH therefore as I have in the Perſons before-mentioned, ſeen all of you in Faith and Charity; I exhort you that ye ſtudy to do all things in a Divine Concord: Your Biſhop preſiding in the place of God;
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:002100_0051_0FBB81BA55C6CC70"/>
your Presbyters in the place of the Council of the Apoſtles; and your Deacons moſt dear to Me, being intruſted with the Miniſtry of Jeſus Chriſt; who was with the Father be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all Ages, and appeared in the End <hi>to us.</hi> Wherefore taking the ſame Holy Courſe, <hi>ſee that</hi> ye all Reverence one another: And let no one look upon his Neighbour after the Fleſh; but do ye all mutually love each other in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. Let there be nothing that may be able to make a Diviſion among you; but be ye united to your Biſhop, and thoſe who Preſide over you, to be your Pattern and Direction <hi>in the way</hi> to Immortality.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. AS therefore the LORD did nothing without the Father, being united to Him; neither by Himſelf nor <hi>yet</hi> by his Apoſtles; So neither do ye do any thing without your Biſhop &amp; Presbyters: Neither endeavour to let any thing appear rational to your ſelves apart; but being come together into the ſame place, have one <hi>Common</hi> Prayer; One Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication; One Mind; One Hope; in Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, and in Joy undefiled. There is One Lord Jeſus Chriſt, than whom nothing is Better. Wherefore come ye all together as unto one Temple of God; as to one Altar, as to one Jeſus Chriſt; who proceeded from one Father, and exiſts in One, and is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd <hi>to One.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">
               <pb n="43" facs="unknown:002100_0052_0FBB81BD02A7A448"/>VIII. BE not Deceived with Strange Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrins; nor with Old Fables which are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable. For if we ſtill continue to live ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Jewiſh Law, we do confeſs <hi>our ſelves</hi> not to have received Grace. For even the moſt Holy Prophets lived according to Chriſt Jeſus. <hi>And</hi> for this cauſe were they perſecuted, being inſpired by his Grace, to convince the Unbelievers and Diſobedient that there is one God who has manifeſted Himſelf by Jeſus Chriſt his Son; who is his Eternal Word, not coming forth from Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, who in all things pleaſed Him that ſent Him.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. WHEREFORE if they who were brought up in <hi>theſe</hi> antient Laws came <hi>never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs</hi> to the Newneſs of Hope; no longer obſerving Sabbaths, but keeping the Lord's Day, in which alſo our Life is ſprung up by Him, and through his Death, whom <hi>yet</hi> ſome deny: (By which Myſtery we have been brought to Believe, and therefore wait that we may be found the Diſciples of Jeſus Chriſt, our only Maſter:) How ſhall we be able to live Different from Him; whoſe Diſciples the very Prophets themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, did by the Spirit expect Him as their Maſter. And therefore He whom they juſtly waited for, being come, raiſed them up from the Dead.</p>
            <p n="10">
               <pb n="44" facs="unknown:002100_0053_0FBB81BE6A0412B0"/>X. LET us not then be Inſenſible of his Goodneſs; for ſhould he have dealt with us according to our Works, we had not now had a Being. Wherefore being become his Diſciples, let us learn to live according to the <hi>Rules</hi> of Chriſtianity: For whoſoever is called by any other name beſides this, He is not of God. Lay aſide therefore the Old, and Sour, and Evil Leaven; and be ye changed into the New Leaven, which is Jeſus Chriſt. Be ye ſalted in Him, leſt any one among you ſhould be Corrupted; for by your Savour ye ſhall be Judged. It is Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd to <hi>Name</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, and to Judaize. For the Chriſtian Religion did not imbrace the Jewiſh, but the Jewiſh the Chriſtian; that ſo every Tongue that Believed might be gathered together unto God.</p>
            <p n="11">XI. THESE things, my Beloved, <hi>I write unto you;</hi> not that I know of any among you that lye under this Error: But as one of the leaſt amongſt you I am deſirous to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warn you that ye fall not into the Snares of Vain Doctrine: But that ye be fully inſtructed in the Birth, and Suffering, and Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt, our Hope; which was accompliſhed in the Time of the Government of <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> and that moſt truly and certainly; and from which God
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:002100_0054_0FBB81C07A7879B0"/>
forbid that any among you ſhould be turn'd aſide.</p>
            <p n="12">XII. MAY I <hi>therefore</hi> have Joy of you in all things, if I ſhall be worthy of it. For tho' I am Bound, yet I am not worthy to be compared to one of you that are at Liberty. I know that ye are not puffed up; for ye have Jeſus Chriſt in your Hearts. And eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially when I commend you, I know that ye are Aſhamed, as it is written, <hi>The Just Man condemneth himſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="13">XIII. STUDY therefore to be confirm'd in the Doctrine of our LORD, and of <hi>his</hi> Apoſtles; that ſo whatſoever ye do, ye may proſper both in Body and Spirit; in Faith and Charity; in the Son, and in the Father, &amp; in the <hi>Holy</hi> Spirit; in the Beginning, &amp; in the End: Together with your moſt worthy Biſhop, and the well-wrought Spiritual Crown of your Presbytery, and your Deacons <hi>which are</hi> according to God. Be ſubject to your Biſhop, and to one another, as Jeſus Chriſt to the Father according to the Fleſh; and the Apoſtles both to Chriſt, and to the Father, and to the <hi>Holy</hi> Ghoſt; that ſo ye may be united both in Body and Spirit.</p>
            <p n="14">XIV. KNOWING you to be full of God, I have the more briefly exhorted you. Be mindful of me in your Prayers, that I may
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:002100_0055_0FBB81C22A6C0028"/>
attain unto God; and of the Church that is in <hi>Syria,</hi> from which I am not worthy to be called. For I ſtand in need of your joint-Prayers in God, and of your Charity, that the Church which is in <hi>Syria</hi> may be thought worthy to be nouriſh'd by your Church.</p>
            <p n="15">XV. THE <hi>Epheſians</hi> from <hi>Smyrna</hi> ſalute you; from which place I write unto you; (being preſent <hi>here</hi> to the Glory of God, in like manner as you are,) who have in all things refreſh'd me; together with <hi>Polycarp</hi> the Biſhop of the <hi>Smyrnaeans.</hi> The reſt of the Churches, in the Honour of Jeſus Chriſt, ſalute you.
