            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>BUSINESS of importance requiring the preſence of Monſieur de St. Claire in the Weſt-Indies, Madame, after his departure, propoſed to retire with her little family to a ſmall manſion of their's in the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainous parts of Switzerland. This lady, who was the beſt of mothers, reſolved not to reviſit Paris till her huſband's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn:</p>
                     <p>To hearts affectionately attached to each other, a ſeparation is always painful; and ſuch was that a Monſieur and Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ame
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:036274_0006_1008690E47DE9A48"/>
de St. Claire, who ſeemed to live but in each other's ſociety, and the dear circle that formed their domeſtic felicity.</p>
                     <p>The buſineſs which required this ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, could not, in all probability, be ſettled before the expiration of two years; an interval which this amiable parent had determined to devote to the education of her family; a taſk ſhe would not have reſigned even to her deareſt friend, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving the inſtruction of her children to be a mother's <hi>firſt</hi> duty.</p>
                     <p>Her's were lovely—but they were not without failings, and to theſe, a fooliſh fondneſs had never rendered her inſenſible.</p>
                     <p>The eldeſt, a beautiful girl about twelve years of age; a boy, one year younger; and a roſy ſprightly darling of ſeven, were the whole of the "Little Family."</p>
                     <p>"I am ſorry we are going to leave Paris," ſaid Clara, as ſhe followed her mother to the carriage, "it is ſo cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>here;</hi> and in the country, where one fees no one, it will be very <hi>dull.</hi>" "It depends much upon ourſelves," replied
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:036274_0007_1008690FC8D9BB58"/>
Madame de St. Claire, "whether we ſhall find it ſo. We are going to a ſituation beautiful by nature, and I have not an idea but its delightful ſcenes will furniſh us with a ſpecies of amuſement, though very different, yet far more pleaſing and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive than any which the pleaſures of this gay city could afford." "I love the country," exclaimed Henry, "and have not the leaſt doubt of our being very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable." "And I am ſure," cried Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miline, "I ſhall be happy wherever mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma is."</p>
                     <p>For three days, they proceeded on their journey without any interruption. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having travelled a few hours before ſunriſe on the morning of the fourth, on paſſing ſome rugged ground, the wheel of the carriage ſuddenly gave way. Fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately they received no injury from the accident, which had happened in a place where no aſſiſtance could be procured. They were ſome miles diſtant from any town, and at a loſs what courſe to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue; when Henry, pointing with his fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:036274_0008_1008691215E364C0"/>
exclaimed, "Look, mamma, I think there muſt be ſome houſe near; is not that ſmoke I ſee between thoſe trees?" He was not miſtaken. It proceeded from the chimney of a cottage not very far diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, whither they diſpatched a ſervant, to know if it could afford them accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation, while the carriage was repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. During his abſence, they ſeated themſelves on a little hillock at the ſide of the road. The children amuſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with obſervations on every object that became viſible in the yet imperfect diſtance; till the riſing ſun burſting with new ſplendor on the diſtant mountains, and leaving the valleys beneath ſtill al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt concealed in aërial ſhade, attracted all their attentions: "Look, look, ſiſter, at the ſun!" cried Henry, "we ſhould not have ſeen ſuch a glorious ſight at Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris. Is it not charming, mamma? for theſe three mornings we have ſeen the ſun riſe." "It is, indeed, a ſcene worthy all our admiration, nor ought we ever to contemplate it, but with hearts replete
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:036274_0009_10086915214C2B80"/>
with gratitude to the Almighty for the bleſſings we daily receive. Let us never behold it, without thinking on Him who is the fountain of light, and ſource of ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery good!" Emmiline, who for ſome time had ſilently admired the glorious object, exclaimed, "But for what uſe did God make the ſun?"</p>

                        <p>You have told me, mamma, that from the ſun we derive light and heat, that without its influence we could neither have bread or fruits, for it is the ſun that ripens all the productions of the earth.</p>

                     </sp>
                     <p>The ſervant was by this time returned. "A poor place, my lady!" ſaid the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Peter, half out of breath, "it is ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſecure from wind and weather; I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally almoſt fear it will fall about your
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:036274_0010_100869176D2C0A88"/>
ears; and if a poor ſervant's advice be worth taking, I think we had better ſeek a few hours hoſpitality elſewhere." "Well, Peter!" interrupted his worthy miſtreſs, "but what ſort of inhabitants did you meet with? Did they ſay we could remain there while the carriage is repaired?" "Alack, Madam, they have but ſorry accommodations for themſelves. I ſaw ſomething like a ſopha in one cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, which, I ſuppoſe, ſerves occaſionally for the poor old man to lie on when he is weary; but it is not fit for you, my good lady: Be this as it may, he ſaid, you ſhould be welcome to paſs the night as well as the day there, if you would put up with what his hut afforded; that a few years back, he could have given you a better reception. While he ſaid this, I obſerved him bruſh off a tear that had fallen on his aged cheek. He has a good heart, I warrant him, and once knew bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter days." "Poor man!" replied Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ame de St. Claire, "let us accept his humble ſhelter." "Oh, dear mamma!"
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:036274_0011_10086918F4A5D050"/>
interrupted Clara, "do not go to that naſty hovel!—From what Peter ſays, there is not a bed fit for us to lie on, ſhould we be obliged to paſs the night there; the roof may fall in upon us; and I dare to ſay, it is as dirty as a pigſtye; I would not go near it for the world; I ſhould die with fright, I am ſure. We had better remain here, indeed we had."</p>

                        <p>Have you no thought but for your <hi>own</hi> ſafety and convenience, Clara? (and for a moment the ſerenity of her countenance was changed to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure) ſorry am I to find you have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived ſo little advantage from my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer advice. You ſeem, at this inſtant, to forget you have a mother, a brother, or a ſiſter, and are only apprehenſive of the danger which threatens yourſelf. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, this is no proof of the tenderneſs of your affection for us.

anxious days of ſickneſs or of ſorrow! It is but too probable, he is in need of the ſupport it may be in our power to beſtow: Humanity, at leaſt, ſhould induce us to make the inquiry; and ſurely there is ſome ſatisfaction in diſpenſing comfort to the miſerable. Could I any way re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this aged ſufferer, (for ſuch we are led to think him from Peter's account) I ſhould feel more pleaſure, my child, as a gueſt beneath his humble roof, than mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one in the moſt ſumptuous palace. If his little manſion be not ſo clean as we could wiſh it, our clothes can be waſhed; and if they could not, you, who are ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſed on the ſubject, have another frock to put on. For ſhame, Clara, I thought you had poſſeſſed leſs ſelfiſhneſs and pride.</p>

                     <p>The unfeeling girl looked confuſed, muttered ſomething to herſelf, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctantly followed the other children, who held each of them a hand of their dear mother.</p>
                     <p>"But if it ſhould <hi>really</hi> be falling?" ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed Henry, trembling with appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:036274_0013_1008691E55199898"/>
"if it ſhould fall on us!" "I think I may venture to aſſert," replied Madame de St. Claire, "things are not quite ſo bad as Peter has repreſented them. Its preſent inhabitant has probably reſided many years there; and were the cottage in ſo ſhattered a ſtate as we have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, he would not have failed to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion his danger to the ſervant. Thoſe whoſe fears will not permit them to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the aſylum he offers us, may ſtay here with Agnes, if ſhe alſo is afraid of approaching the deſolate dwelling; or remain alone." Agnes was a faithful at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant, who had lived from her infancy in this worthy family, and whoſe mind was ſuperior to thoſe emotions which now agitated thoſe of the young people. Henry's apprehenſions were ſoon over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, <hi>fear</hi> was to him a ſenſation border<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on cowardice; and he conſidered it as a weakneſs by which a well informed mind would feel itſelf degraded.</p>
                     <p>Agnes taking Emmiline's hand as ſhe was capering from ſide to ſide, exclaimed,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:036274_0014_1008691FD7A74088"/>
"This my dear little girl feels no terror, I am ſure, at the thought of accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us!" "No, that I <hi>do not,</hi>" replied the charming prattler, "I long to ſee the old man: Peter, whom I have heard you ſay is a very good carpenter, can perhaps repair the houſe, and I will help you and mamma to do any thing for him the mean while. Agnes! have you not one or two of thoſe little rolls you bought for us at the village, where we ſlept laſt night? Give them to me, that I may ſop them in ſome milk for him when we get there; he would reliſh them I dare to ſay, if, like the old woman, whom we ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſee on the <hi>pont neuf</hi> at Paris, he ſhould have loſt his teeth."</p>
                     <p>Fortunately, Agnes had remembered to remove from the carriage all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions which had been purchaſed for the children; and Emmiline begged to have the pleaſure of carrying the rolls herſelf to the cottage. "Amiable child!" ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed her delighted mother, "would that my Clara's heart reſembled thine!"</p>

Peter uttered a thouſand bleſſings on his dear young <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

"This is ſo like Miſs Emmiline," he cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, "ſhe is for doing good to every one; do you remember, Agnes, the preſent ſhe made me, laſt winter, in the ſevere froſt we had. I was juſt recovered of a fit of the rheumatiſm, and was going out with the carriage for the firſt time, when ſhe called me into the hall, and gave me a pair of the niceſt worſted gloves, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, as ſhe kindly ſaid, my having a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of the complaint in my hands.

                     <p>In this manner the whole party pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to the cottage; Clara lingered ſtill behind; and preſently, as ſhe was looking another way, her foot ſlipped. and ſhe fell into a narrow ditch, into which ran a ſmall rivulet; in endeavoring to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate herſelf, her hands and her face were torn in a terrible manner by the bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, before any aſſiſtance could be given.</p>

Madame de St. Clair<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as ſhe helped the ſervant to waſh off the dirt which her perſon and clothes had received, ſaid to her, "You are now, my daughter, to all appearance, in a worſe ſituation than the poor cottager, whoſe ſolitary home we are preparing to viſit; and would you like, becauſe your frock is dirty, and you are this diſagreeable figure, that we ſhould forſake and leave you in the road?

"Oh! pardon me, my dear mamma, do not think ſo, do not ſuppoſe me proud or inſenſible. I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed very ſorry to have given you cauſe to imagine I could—" Here her voice faultered, the tear of contrition gliſtened in her eye, ſhe attempted to take her mother's hand. Madame de St. Claire made no effort to withdraw it. "I hope," ſaid this affectionate mother,

"you will no more give me cauſe for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof on this ſubject. May time, and a few years' experience, convince you, my dear girl, that an amiable diſpoſition is the baſis of all domeſtic felicity.</p>

                     <p>THEY ſoon after arrived at the cottage, of which they found that Peter had given no very exaggerated deſcription. It was almoſt ſurrounded by trees, which ſpread a nightly gloom over the lonely habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; one end of which had already fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en into decay, and indeed there was but one part which appeared any way habit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. The moſs which grew upon the thatch, and the vine that encircled the lowly roof, almoſt concealed the ſhatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed lattices. Amidſt this ruinous ſcene, they were ſurpriſed to obſerve, a little way off to the left, a ſmall garden, which appeared to be cultivated with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:036274_0018_100869290F3EE4A0"/>
care and order. Here they ſaw a little boy about nine years old, very buſy in clearing the cuttings of ſome trees that had been newly lopped, who, on perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, left his occupation; and, after reſpectfully bowing to the ſtrangers, paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on to open the little wicket which led to the ſhadowed entrance. Madame de St. Claire and her family followed their young conductor, and were preſently welcomed by its aged maſter, who thus accoſted them, "Thanks, kind lady, for having deigned to accept the ſhelter this poor hovel affords. It is a pitiful place, and unworthy ſo noble a gueſt; yet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me, you are ſincerely welcome to all it contains. Fear not to enter; theſe old walls have ſtood many a ſtormy night. Though ſo ruinous, the part which I now inhabit, I have reaſon to think, is perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſafe. Come, my little friends," add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he, taking the children by the hand, "I have ſome new milk, a ſtray cow which ſeemed the only living animal in this ſolitude when I firſt came to it, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:036274_0019_1008692B6C26C3D0"/>
us with that, and I believe the vine, ancient as it is, will yield a few grapes." "Oh! Father", exclaimed the little boy, "I will go and gather ſome of my larg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt apples, and beſt pears, for the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny!" "Do ſo, my love," he replied. Then conducting them into a ſmall but neat room, he led Madame de St. Claire to the only chair it preſented, beſides which, two ſtools, a table, and a narrow wooden bench, were all the furniture it could boaſt of. If Madame was pleaſed with the apparent ſimplicity of every thing around her, ſhe was not leſs ſo with her venerable hoſt, whoſe countenance beſpoke a generous and feeling heart, though the traces of affliction were ſtill viſible on this manly cheek. The little boy ſoon returned with the fruit, and the rural ſtores were produced on a table, the whiteneſs of which was ſcarcely ſurpaſſed by the ſnow on the ſummit of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains. Peter, Agnes, and the poſtillion, remained at the door, and ſhared their peaceful meal under the ſhade of an aged

oak, round the rugged trunk of which a ſeat had formerly been erected; the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of it now afforded comfortable reſt to theſe weary travellers; for not all the eloquence of Madame, or the venerable man, could perſuade the honeſt people to eat a morſel in the ſame room with their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs; and except one deſtined for repoſe by its owner, there was no other habitable.</p>
                     <p>"I am rejoiced we came here," whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered Henry to his mother, "what nice fruit! and then the old man is ſo civil!" He had great reaſon for this remark, as the cottager was particularly attentive to the young folks. Clara was the only one to whom his politeneſs gave any confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. It brought to her mind all ſhe had ſaid reſpecting the cottage and the owner of it. The recollection was painful, and it prevented her feeling that pleaſure which the others enjoyed.</p>
                     <p>The evening paſſed away in the moſt cheerful manner, and it was concluded that Peter ſhould ſet off early in the morning for further aſſiſtance, to repair the carriage.</p>

In the inner room, the good old Albert (for that was the name of their hoſt) had contrived to make up two beds for Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ame, Agnes, and the children; whilſt the poſtillion remained in an outhouſe with his horſes, himſelf, Peter, and the little boy, ſlept ſoundly till daybreak on ſome clean ſtraw and dried ruſhes; perhaps they had never enjoyed more comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble repoſe, for when the mind accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates itſelf to circumſtances, it is not the little inconveniences of life that can affect us.</p>

Madame de St. Claire and the little fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily enjoyed a comfortable repoſe, until the bright beams of the riſing ſun ſhone through the lattice, and the little birds began their uſual harmony.</p>

                     <p>The landſcape at this ſpot was extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pictureſque. It was not a public road; they were paſſing a precipice; above this were others extending to an amaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing height; the ſcattered hamlets on whoſe ſummit appeared but as a few al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt imperceptible ſpecks; nearer were ſeen cottages above the clouds, paſtures which ſeemed ſuſpended in the air, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting the moſt delightful ſcenery that can be conceived. Below, on the left, were cattle grazing; ſome of which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared no larger than the ſmalleſt birds; to the right, a foreſt, whoſe thick inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven trees ſeemed to form an artificial night; beyond this the proſpect opened, and the diſtant village became viſible by degrees, as its lowly ſpire caught the ſun's uninterrupted ray.</p>
                     <p>Here it was, that, feeling themſelves fatigued, they ſat down to reſt, under the

ſhade of the neareſt trees, and the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren repeated their leſſons.

"You prefer ignorance, then to a few hours application?" ſaid their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate mother. "Believe me, Clara, before the lapſe of many years, you will ſeverely repent this negligence, and wiſh you could recal even the moments you have ſpent in idleneſs and folly.

                     <p>"Oh! no, mamma! that I ſhall not; I know enough already." And the thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs girl ſkipped away as cheerfully as the others, with whom their indulgent moth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er had ſo much reaſon to be ſatisfied.</p>

watch, to find it was ſo late. They made all poſſible haſte, fearing the good Albert might be uneaſy at their ſtay. He was ſo, had ſet out in ſearch of them, and met the little party almoſt within ſight of the cottage.</p>
                     <p>"You are willing, I ſee, good Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am," ſaid he, "to enjoy all the delight of the country. Is there any pleaſure that can exceed that of a morning walk at this charming ſeaſon? My little friends, I ſee, are alſo charmed with the beauties nature here preſents to us." "Yes, ſir," replied Henry, "all but my ſiſter Clara; I am ſorry to ſay, ſhe has no taſte for what is ſublime and beautiful. To me, no ſight is ſo glorious as the riſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or ſetting ſun, I could gaze on it for ever; I would not be ſuch an inſenſible mortal as ſhe is for the world." "You would wiſh us then to underſtand," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed Albert, "that you are a young man of infinite ſenſe and taſte, perhaps of abilities; I own I am always inclined to ſuſpect thoſe who think ſo highly of their

own; but to try the extent of yours, let me hear if you can anſwer the queſtion I am going to propoſe. Why do we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive more heat from the ſun in ſummer than in winter, when, in fact, it is nearer to us in the latter?</p>
                     <p>The children were confounded, no one ſo much as Henry. They were unable to reply. "I ſee," ſaid he, "my queſtion is a little two difficult for my young phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophic friend, who another time will not be ſo ready to call his ſiſter an inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible mortal; ſince his youthful capacity is found to be not yet equal to every ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. But that the ſame queſtion may not occaſion you any further embarraſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I will tell you why we receive great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er heat from the ſun in ſummer than in win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Though then <hi>nearer</hi> to us, his rays fall more obliquely, in ſummer more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect: conſequently, we then receive the greater heat. Have you never put your hand ſideways to a candle? and, have you not remarked that you could, in that poſition, almoſt touch the flame
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:036274_0028_1008694153D8DF20"/>
without being burnt? but when you have held your hand directly over it, have you not at ſix times the diſtance found it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable?" The children acknowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edged the truth of what he had ſaid, and thanked him for having ſo well explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſubject to them, and all, except Emmiline, ſeemed willing to change the converſation, who thus continued, "You ſaid, ſir, we were nearer the ſun in win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than in ſummer. How <hi>can</hi> this be? I am ſure our houſe at Paris always ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſtand in the ſame place; if it had moved nearer the ſun at any time, we muſt have felt it." "And yet, my little darling, it is certain that the earth moves ſixty eight thouſand two hundred and forty three miles every hour, and that we are carried along with it in open ſpace. The ſun, the moon, the ſtars, ſeem to make a revolution in the heavens; but it is in reality the earth that moves. Lend me, young lady, the cup and ball you were playing with juſt now." When, taking it by the ſtring, he whirled it
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:036274_0029_100869439C365210"/>
round his head, ſaying, "We will ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe this little ball the earth, and my head the ſun, do you obſerve that as it goes round, it deſcribes alſo a ſmall circle round the ſtring? This may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the diurnal motion of the earth, which turns as you ſee this ball, upon an imaginary line within, called its axis. It is this motion which produces day and night." "But how," interrupted the children, "can we move ſo faſt, and not be ſenſible of any motion?" "Have you not been in a ſhip?" ſaid Madame de St. Claire, "and did not the trees, the land, and every object on the ſide of you appear to move?"</p>
                     <p>"Oh! yes, mamma," replied Emmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line, "and I recollect it was with diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty you made me comprehend that it was not the trees, but the veſſel, which moved."</p>
                     <p>"Well, then, cannot you imagine that the motion of the earth a contrary way produces the apparent motion of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens from eaſt to weſt? We are not ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:036274_0030_100869451EFA82F0"/>
of the motion of the earth, being no more on this globe, in compariſon, than a fly would be on a ball of wax as large as our chariot."</p>
                     <p>The children were delighted with the knowledge they had acquired, and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged their mother would continue to talk to them on ſimilar ſubjects, to which their capacities might be equal, whenever ſhe had leiſure or opportunity.</p>

Therefore, their induſtry in ſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up proviſions is, in all probability, not ſo much intended to guard againſt

the winter, as to provide during the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt a neceſſary ſubſiſtence for their young, to the nouriſhment of which they are particularly attentive.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <p>The attention of the young people was attracted from this ſcene of induſtry, by a noiſe, which ſeemed to be the exclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſome perſon in diſtreſs a few pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from them; when, turning out of the direct path to ſee what was the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, they beheld a ſpaniel extended on the ground, apparently dead, and on one ſide, a goatherd lamenting over it, in all the agony of ſevereſt grief. "What thus diſtreſſes you, my lad?" exclaimed Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert. The boy did not even turn his head to ſee from whence the voice pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded; his eyes were fixed on the lifeleſs animal before him. They obſerved him take up its paw, bathe it with his tears, preſs it to his lips, and then put it down again. "Poor Carlo!" ſaid he, "thou haſt followed me many a dreary mile, but the flinty roads ſhall no more cut thy tender feet—Carlo!—" and again
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:036274_0035_10086950B18D7490"/>
convulſive ſobs for a few minutes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted his ſpeech; at length he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed: "Thou art cold—dead!—I muſt purſue alone each day's hard journey.—Thou wilt no more climb the craggy mountain, or gambol through the valley. But at noon, when I ſet me down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the ſheltering willow by the clear brook, and take from my ſcrip the ſcanty morſel—it is then, Carlo! I ſhall miſs thee—for thou waſt accuſtomed to partake its ſtore. At night too—for theſe fifteen years haſt thou ſlept beſide me! Dear companion of my labors!—Friend of my ſaddeſt hours!—Yes! thou waſt faithful—thou waſt a friend when others only aſſumed the name, and in poverty for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook me.—And muſt I bid the farewell for ever?—Yes, Carlo!—Carlo, thou haſt paid the debt of nature!—"</p>
                     <p>The voice of Albert, who by this time had come up to the lad, interrupted his ſoliloquy.</p>
                     <p>"You lament the loſs of this poor ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal?" ſaid he. "Ah! ſir," replied the
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:036274_0036_10086953C8B6D9A8"/>
boy, advancing a few ſteps, then-retrcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as if unwilling to leave the remains of what had been ſo dear to him; "you know not how much he deſerves to be lamented. Yet, if he had died a natural death, I think I could have borne it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but to be deprived of him by a mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious hand!—He is killed—the blood is now running from the wound where the ball entered his head. My Carlo!" and he threw himſelf on the ground beſide him.</p>
                     <p>"But tell us," ſaid Albert, "by what means you loſt your favorite?"</p>
                     <p>The goatherd, raiſing himſelf upon his elbow, thus continued, "Returning from the mountains this morning, I was ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled with the report of a gun, a few yards from me, but could perceive no perſon near, the thickneſs of theſe trees perhaps concealed them. Carlo was at a little diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, I called him—he ſtaggered towards me—the gunner had taken two ſure an aim—for in a few minutes he expired at my feet. Had you beheld his looks, and heard his laſt moan—you never would

                     <p>"But have you no idea who could be guilty of this cruel action?" aſked Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ame de St. Claire.</p>
                     <p>"My ſuſpicions, I fear; are but too well founded," replied the peaſant; "there is a gentleman in this neighbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood who has long wiſhed me to part with my dog, and even offered me mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ey for him; but the largeſt ſums he could have given, would not have purchaſed my Carlo.

He was my father's dog, had followed me from my infancy, and when oppreſſed by misfortune, his fidelity af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded me ſome comfort; when I have fancied that I read in his looks, that pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which the unfeeling world denied me. Twice when a child he was the preſerver of my life, by dragging me out of a river, into which, playing on its bank, I had heedleſsly fallen. Judge if I have not reaſon to lament him—"</p>

"But why," interrupted Albert, ſhould you accuſe the gentleman of his death? I ſhould rather have ſuppoſed he would have been ſorry, that any acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent had happened to deſtroy the hopes he might ſtill entertain of the animal's being one day his own."</p>

                        <p>Alas! ſir, his ſteward in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed me a few days ſince, that if I would not let his maſter have the dog, he threatened to have it deſtroyed by ſome means or other, as a puniſhment for my daring to refuſe ſuch a trifle to a man of his conſequence. Ah! little did I think his heart would ſuffer him to put the threat in execution. Why do I ſay his <hi>heart;</hi> he could not have any. Yet, I did not imagine he would kill my Carlo!—"</p>
                        <p>Saying this, he threw himſelf again up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the dog, and ſobbed aloud.</p>

                        <p>I have thought of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. He grieves for the loſs of his dog, becauſe it ſupplied to him the place of a friend. It is dead—he has none now. But if I might, (looking tenderly at Albert) I think I could recommend one who could comfort him in all his troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les. (Taking Albert's hand) May I aſk you, ſir! to be a friend to this unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate lad? Mamma, I am ſure, will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute ſomething with us to render his ſituation in life more comfortable; but to his mind, who could give the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of your ſalutary counſels? Your friendſhip, therefore, would be more to him than all that <hi>we</hi> could do—Yes, I know you will be his friend.</p>

                     <p>Albert took the charming girl in his arms, and ſuffered her to wipe off a tear from his venerable cheek, which her ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility had excited. "I will comply with your generous wiſhes," ſaid he, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionately embracing her.</p>
                     <p>Then taking the hand of the poor boy, he exclaimed, "The child of ſorrow ſhall
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:036274_0040_1008695BAE133250"/>
never want a friend, while Albert has power to diſpenſe to the aching heart a moment's comfort."</p>
                     <p>The goatherd, overpowered by a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of emotions, was unable to ſpeak.—He knelt down—raiſed his eyes to heaven, as if thankful for a reſtoration of its bleſſings, and preſſed the hand of the old man to his lips.</p>
                     <p>At length they perſuaded him to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company them to the cottage; where, to paſs an hour or two, it was imagined might divert a melancholy, not all at once to be overcome; for though grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as he appeared for their favors, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo could not be forgotten. He turned back often to look for the ſpot where they had left him, and frequently paſſed his hand acroſs his eyes to bruſh away the ſtarting tear.</p>
                     <p>When he became more compoſed, Henry aſked him if he did not intend, by ſome means or other, to puniſh the inhuman man who had killed his dog? "Ah! no," he replied, "what would
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:036274_0041_1008695F86B8AC30"/>
that avail? it would not reſtore my Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo; and what pleaſure is there in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge? I have it every day in my pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to return his cruelty. His dogs make great havoc amongſt our flocks, but I have not hurt one of them, nor ever will; although my maſter has ſpoken to him ſeveral times, he will not keep them upon his own grounds. Poor and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant as I am, I have not forgotten the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of humanity my father taught me, "To do good to all, but no injury even to an enemy." By this time they had reached the cottage, where they found a rural breakfaſt prepared by the little boy and Agnes, to which the former had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed all the rarities his garden could produce.</p>

                     <p>One morning, after a cheerful break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt, Madame de St. Claire thus addreſſed the good Albert: "Pardon my curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, my worthy friend, but I cannot help expreſſing a, deſire to know to whom we are indebted for the kind and hoſpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able reception we have met with in this ſolitude.

meaſure, inſtrumental to your future happineſs and welfare. Deny not then a ſatisfaction, which a further account of yourſelf might ford me."</p>
                     <p>"And this is what I would refuſe to many," replied the old man, "but your kindneſs deſerves all my confidence; and although it may be painful to recal to remembrance the paſt events of my life, I will relate to you the misfortunes which have driven me to this ſtate of poverty. "My name is de Livré; my father was a reputable tradeſman at Paris, and I was brought up to the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. For ſeveral years we continued in buſineſs together; as an only child, at his deceaſe I became poſſeſſor of all his fortune, which was very conſiderable; a few months after which, I had the afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to loſe the beſt of mothers!</p>
                     <p>"The time of wearing mourning for my dear parents was ſcarcely elapſed, when an intimate friend of my father's returned from India with his wife and daughter, the latter a moſt amiable young

Mine were, alas<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> no more.

For ſeveral years the ſcene of happineſs continued, and our dear parents lived to partake our domeſtic comforts, and to ſhare our tranſports in the daily improvement of an only ſon. Little did we then think, this darling child would be the cauſe of of ſo much ſorrow to us. But why do I reflect on him? It was beyond a doubt

my boundleſs indulgence which laid the baſis for the impropriety of his future conduct. He was of a lively turn of mind; and youthful frolic which mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ited the cenſure of parental authority, were too often conſidered as the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowings of a volatile diſpoſition. We had no other little one to ſhare our affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; in him was centered all the joy, the delight of our exiſtence; his every whim was complied with, he poſſeſſed abilities and a good underſtanding; but theſe were overvalued by our blind par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality. He knew how to take advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of our weakneſs, and ſeldom failed to obtain our conſent to all his wiſhes, however imprudent or abſurd. His paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions were violent, he could not indure the leaſt reſtraint; Monſieur Mélone per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived this in the anſwers he made, when any check was put upon his inclinations, either by his mother or myſelf. He dreaded the uneaſineſs his future conduct might occaſion us, and endeavoured to reaſon with him on the ſubject; but, in

ſuch converſations, the advice of his grandfather was too often totally diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, or turned into ridicule. At length he became ſuperior to all control, and we reſolved to place him at an academy, the maſter of which had been ſtrongly rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ommended to us. He had been at this ſeminary rather more than two months, when it pleaſed Heaven to take from us our worthy parent. Madame Mélone ſurvived him only two years. Little elſe material happened to diſturb our domeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic tranquillity for ſome years. My ſon, after he left ſchool, became a partner with me in my buſineſs: But I was ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to perceive no change in his diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though his perſon and manners had received every embelliſhment; but he had formed ſome connections which did not tend to the improvement of his mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als or his heart. A few gay young men of faſhion, who were pleaſed with his ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, invited him often to their parties, and I fear but too frequently engaged him at the gaming table. Home and our

little happy circle, ſeemed no longer to have any pleaſures for him; our ſtyle of living became diſguſting, for in this we aimed at nothing which did not entirely correſpond with our ſituation. What has a tradeſman to do with elegance? My ſon's ideas were very different from mine; he thought a ſplendid appearance neceſſary for the ſupport of our houſe. When firſt in partnerſhip, he muſt have two of the fineſt horſes that could be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed, to carry himſelf and ſervant to wait on thoſe gentlemen who ſent for him on buſineſs. It was in vain I remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated againſt theſe expenſive proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. He would ſometimes liſten to me with patience; but what I ſaid was ſoon obliterated from his mind, by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of thoſe who only ſought his ruin.</p>
                     <p>"It is true, a ſeries of continued proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity had enabled me to lay by a few thouſands, but millions would have been too little for his ſupport. Our trade, heretofore ſo flouriſhing, daily declined as his extravagance increaſed. The gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral

opinion ſeemed to be, that a man who drives his phaeton about the ſtreets of Paris, could not be a perſon who was in care of employment.</p>
                     <p>"He married a beautiful woman of no fortune, whoſe diſpoſition bore too great a reſemblance to his own for her ever to attempt a reformation. Gay, good humored, and imprudent, but too much the fine lady to attend to the duties of her family; the care of which was left entirely to ſervants, who took advantage of her negligence to haſten the ruin of herſelf and her huſband, by an exorbitant waſte of every thing.</p>
                     <p>"My Amelia, who was the beſt of wives and mothers, endeavored often to inſpire her with a love of neatneſs and economy, but ſhe was too young and thoughtleſs to give ear to any argument o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The old man appeared ſo much affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with what he had related, that Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ame de St. Claire begged he would defer the remainder of his hiſtory till the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon,
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:036274_0051_1008697669FB19D0"/>
or another opportunity. The children appeared greatly intereſted in what they had heard. In the moſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetic parts, Emmiline had been obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to put her handkerchief to her eyes; and when De Livré left off ſpeaking, ſhe jumped upon his knee, and throwing her little arms around his neck, exclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, "Wicked boy! to behave ſo ill to ſo good a father! but do not grieve a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him now; mamma, I am ſure, will always be your friend, and if we are not too young, let <hi>us</hi> be your friends alſo? My brother, though a little vain, is a good boy; the more you know of him, the more you will like him; and you will love Clara too, who I am ſure would work for you with all her heart. Do not look ſo melancholy—we will all do our utmoſt to make you happy." "Charming children!" he replied, "your future conduct, I dare predict, will recompenſe the beſt of mothers for all her cares, and realize their parent's fondeſt hopes."</p>

                     <p>AFTER dinner, Monſieur de Livré thus continued his intereſting narrative: "Although my ſon had now a family of five children, he ſtill continued to ſquan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der away vaſt ſums to enable him to keep up an acquaintance with his youthful diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute companions, who ſeemed to aim at nothing but the completion of his ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. It was in vain I repreſented to him the injury my circumſtances had ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and exhorted him to be more prudent. He relied on the flattering promiſes of his friends, as he called them, and aſſured me all would yet be well; that we ſhould ſoon be able to bid adieu to the fatigues of a commercial life; that they would place us in a ſituation where we ſhould have nothing to do but enjoy ourſelves in eaſe and ſplendor. Miſtaken young man! I was not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with half his imprudence, till
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:036274_0053_1008697C182E52A8"/>
going one day into a ſilverſmith's to have a trinket repaired of my dear Amelia's, I left my addreſs, that it might be ſent home when finiſhed. The ſhopman had no ſooner looked upon the card, than he deſired me to do him the favor to ſtop a few minutes. Odd as this requeſt appeared, I complied with it, and I ſaw him go to his maſter then in the Compt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing houſe; who told me, with a ſtately air, he could not poſſibly do any thing more till the long account betwen us was ſettled. Aſtoniſhed, I demanded what that account could be! As he was perfectly a ſtranger to me, having never entered his ſhop before, "It is no ſmall affair!" he replied, "three hundred pounds!" "Three hundred pounds!" I exclaimed, "you muſt be miſtaken, I am not the perſon you ſuppoſe me." "I beg your pardon, ſir! I have notes of hand which you have ſent me from time to time, as ſecurities for payment." "Let me ſee them," cried I eagerly; they were preſently produced, and I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:036274_0054_1008697D9A0D4BD8"/>
recollected my ſon's hand. A terror ſeized me: I was near fainting; the ſhopman, perhaps more compaſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate than his maſter, obſerving my diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, offered me a chair, and I thus ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed the ſilverſmith, as ſoon as I could articulate a word, for my agitation had for a few minutes deprived me of ſpeech: "you are miſtaken, ſir, I again repeat, I am not the perſon you ſuppoſe me to be, though nearly related to him. It is my ſon, unfortunately, who is your debtor; I would defray the whole account this moment were it in my power; but at preſent it gives me the deepeſt concern to ſay it is not, for I have no doubt your demand is a juſt one. However, here are bills, taking out my pocket book, to the amount of fifty pounds, and I will endeavor in the courſe of a few days to ſettle the remainder.</p>
                     <p>"This I had ſoon the ſatisfaction of doing, by diſpoſing of ſome valuable prints. I had hoped that all his debts were then ſettled, or that this was the
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:036274_0055_100869800DFB6820"/>
moſt conſiderable. Alas! how much was I miſtaken.—I was greatly ſurpriſed to ſee him, a few mornings after this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair was ſettled, enter the warehouſe, having been abſent ſeveral weeks. I had never ſeen him in ſuch a diſhabille. His lips were livid, and his whole counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance was wild and ghaſtly. "I am ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined!" he exclaimed, "irretrievably ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined! Wretch that I am!" and he ſunk into a chair.—I feared there was but too much truth in this wild aſſertion, yet had ſcarce power to aſk by what means ſo ſuddenly? "And can you, ſir!" he cried, with an heſitating voice, "ſpeak to me with this compoſure? Wretch! deteſtable wretch!—Monſter that I am!—My father ruined too! By me! I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſupport it!—My mother! Oh! how ſeverely will ſhe feel my folly!—My own headſtrong paſſions have raiſed the ſtorm, and my vile friends in guilt have ſwelled the tempeſt to our undoing. I have <hi>gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>—Enticed by <hi>fiends</hi>—for ſure they were ſuch! In debt—I hoped by this

means to be ſoon able to ſettle all; nor ſtopped till at the deteſtable table I had ſtaked the laſt guinea. No!" ſtriking his forehead, "there is NO reſource—'Tis done—my <hi>wife,</hi> my <hi>children,</hi> 'tis there I feel the acuteſt pang—Oh! ſir!" falling on his knees before me, "If I dare to ſupplicate for THEM—continue to them the affection I have forfeited, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe them not—the harmleſs little ones partook not in a father's errors. How can I ever ſee them more? No!—Yes, I will ſee them! but it ſhall be to bid them an eternal farewell!—Diſtraction ſeizes me. 'Tis ſurely not my father that I behold—his rage would ſpurn me from him, and from his lips the bittereſt curſes would purſue me.—I have ruined him—he could not bear to look upon ſo vile a wretch! See!—ſee! they are coming to ſeize on all!—Fly—fly—my father! No! ſtay! and let <hi>me</hi> meet their fury!" "Saying this, he darted from me, and had left the houſe ere I had power to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him.—For ſeveral weeks we could

It is not in my power to deſcribe to you my ſufferings, or thoſe of my Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia. Unknown to me, my ſon had drawn upon my banker for conſiderable ſums; and though a month before I was poſſeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of thouſands, I found that I had now but a few pounds remaining; I was a bankrupt. And this was but too ſoon made public! We remained at a friend's houſe while our things were diſpoſed of; with a friend who ſincerely pitied our diſtreſs, but who had not the ability entirely to relieve it.</p>

                     <p>"ONE morning, taking a ſolitary walk through la Rue St. Germaine's, I was followed by two ragged boys, who aſked charity of me. "For God's ſake, ſir," ſaid the eldeſt, "give ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

to this poor child, who has not courage to beg, though ſtarving; his father is dying, there is a wretched mother, and four more of them." "I was inſenſibly affected by the intereſt the beggar boy took in the fate of his little indigent friend, in whom I recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected the features of my grandſon, and followed his ſteps to the abode of the wretched family. It was a miſerable garret; I arrived in time to receive my ſon's laſt ſigh; who expired in my arms. They had lived, I found, in this wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed manner ever ſince he left me ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly, upon the little produced by the pledging of their clothes. You will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the ſituation of my daughter and the helpleſs infants. I had no home to take them to, from this ſcene of miſery; but, with the few ſhillings I had about me, I prevailed on the landlady to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them to paſs two days in another apartment, and took the eldeſt boy with me to my friend's houſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="61" facs="unknown:036274_0059_1008698A8EF00150"/>
"My dear wife, overcome with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue and affliction, I found had not been able to leave her bed that day. My friend met me with his uſual cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. He ſaw ſomething had happened to diſtreſs me; and, at his requeſt, I relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him the miſery of which I had been a ſpectator. He deſired me to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted, ſaying he would himſelf viſit the unfortunate mother, and do ſomething for their relief. It was in vain I urged him not to think of it, nor injure his circumſtances by relieving ours. "Be under no apprehenſions of this ſort, my good friend," he replied, "the plan I mean to adopt ſhall not injure any one. Aſk no queſtions. Promiſe me not to viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it your daughter till the day after to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow; and then permit me to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany you. In the mean time, reſt aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every thing ſhall be done which her ſituation requires."</p>
                     <p>"I muſt not omit to tell you the means by which this generous man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came able to aſſiſt us. In one of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments,
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:036274_0060_1008698CE17B9820"/>
I was ſurpriſed to ſee the place vacant where an elegant organ had ſtood. I had entered this room one morning, the door being open, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire a very fine picture, which hung op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite. A ſervant coming in for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for his maſter, I enquired whither the inſtrument had been removed? He replied, his maſter had diſpoſed of it, he believed, for a great ſum of money. An idea of his generous plan immediately glanced through my mind. I ſaw him paſs the door of the apartment where I was, and in a moment threw myſelf into his arms. But all my expreſſions of gratitude but feebly expreſſed the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of my heart. "Forbear, my friend, to ſpeak on this ſubject," cried he, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly preſſing my hand, "what I have done is trifling. Fond as I am of muſic, the inſtrument never gave me half the pleaſure I have felt in the diſpoſal of it, for you and yours; but that pleaſure is not perfect till I have your approbation of my proceedings. We will viſit your
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:036274_0061_1008698F2FBDF068"/>
daughter." This good man informed me by the way, that he had given orders for my ſon's funeral. I was ſurpriſed when we came to a ſmall neat houſe in the outſkirts of the city, to be told my daughter and her children reſided there. We had the ſatisfaction of finding her better than could be expected. My friend had furniſhed a little ſhop for her, and there ſeemed a proſpect of happier days, when this unfortunate mother was ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a fever, and after a few days ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs expired, leaving four helpleſs little ones. In the midſt of this diſtreſs, my friend ſtill remained faithful to me. He aſſiſted in placing them at ſchool, where the two elder ſurvived their parents but a ſhort time, and the youngeſt not more than a twelvemonth; he ſettled us again in buſineſs; but, my Amelia's frame was not equal to the rude ſhock of misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</p>
                     <p>"She died! two months after my daughter in law. This was one of thoſe troubles to which human fortitude is
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:036274_0062_10086990B33010A0"/>
apt to imagine itſelf unequal. But that Providence, which had ſupported me in all my afflictions, did not forſake me at this trying period. In trade I was again for a few months ſucceſsful, and contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in it till the death of my only friend. There ſeemed then nothing left to attach me to the world; ſorrow had injured my health; I could not purſue my oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupations with my former vigor. My friend having left me the remains of his ſmall fortune, I purchaſed with it this dwelling, the deſolate appearance of which induced the proprietor to let me have it on moderate terms, where my grandchild has been my ſupporter, by cultivating the orchard and garden; the produce of which he ſells weekly at the next village. The laſt ſeaſon was not a favorable one; our fruits did not rip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, and we were obliged to diſpoſe even of our furniture to procure a ſubſiſtence, and ſupport me in a long and painful ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but, thank God! there is a delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful proſpect this year, and we ſhall be

                     <p>Here de Livré pauſed. The children, who had liſtened attentively to the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, now ſurrounded Madame de St. Claire, begging they might be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to do ſomething before they left the cottage for their good friend. "And what would you do, my children?" ſhe demanded. "Henry, let us hear in what manner you propoſe being uſeful to this worthy man."</p>

I beg of you, but thoſe will not be enough; take my bracelets, the buckles are pearl, they are uſeleſs ornaments, are they not? Yet, perhaps, they might be ſold for ſomething, and then they would be of real value.</p>

I will tell him his hiſtory, and I am ſure he will not; then here is my locket, it is ſet in gold, my ſciſſors ſheath, and this pocket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>book, the caſe is ſilver. If he could ſell them, he might be enabled to buy ſome new clothes; and when I ſee him newly and comfortably dreſſed, I am ſure I ſhall think no more of theſe baubles.</p>

                     <p>"My dear children," ſaid Madame, "you ſhall each follow your generous inclinations, and yet keep theſe things, which from being a parent's gifts are ſo

We will take a ride to the neareſt town; you ſhall purchaſe, Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, with this note, clothes for your good friend; you, Clara, a new dreſs for this dear little boy; Emmiline ſhall make him a preſent of ſome uſeful books, and I will take charge of the repairs of the cottage, and new furniſh it." Then ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing herſelf to Monſieur de Livré: "You muſt accept from my ſteward, every year, a ſum ſufficient to make your lives comfortable, and we will repeat our viſit annually." "Can there be ſuch an angel?" exclaimed the good old man, "ſhall the dear child, who has ſo long ſhared with me the miſeries of pov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty, rejoice in your benevolence?—Oh! accept a father's thanks, may he ever be deſerving of your bounty! For him how many hours of anxiety and care have I experienced! I am old, and the painful thought would frequently oppreſs me, that I muſt leave him, Heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en knows how ſoon, in this ſolitude, friendleſs and unprovided for—But now

Dear Madame, you are too generous; we have not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved all that you would do for us; it is too much—" "And what is that ALL?" interrupted Madame de St. Claire, "it is not adequate to your merits. If Providence has been bountiful to us, let us enjoy its bleſſings by diſpenſing them to others. The completeſt happineſs we can know in this world, is in relieving miſery, and making thoſe happy whom we eſteem."</p>
                     <p>The carriage was ordered, and the children accompanied their mother to the neighboring town. Henry, as they drove from the door, obſerved it was the happieſt day he had ever paſſed. "From thence learn, my ſon," ſaid this amiable woman, "how much our own felicity is connected with that of others; and let no opportunity eſcape you of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                     <p>IN a few hours the purchaſes were made, and the happy party returned to the cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. It was agreed that Monſieur de Livré ſhould that evening make his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance in his new attire; and Emmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line inſiſted on having the pleaſure of decking out her little friend, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived their preſents with a thouſand thanks. Tears were the only language of the venerable de Livré. "Why does he cry?" demanded Emmiline; "I fear, mamma, we have not done enough." Then running up to him, "Let me wipe away thoſe tears, my <hi>good</hi> friend. When I am a great girl, and papa allows me more money, I will lay it all by for <hi>you!</hi>" "I am overwhelmed with your goodneſs, my dear friends," at length
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:036274_0068_1008699FD8E1FEC0"/>
exclaimed the cottager; "but the tears I ſhed, my affectionate young lady, are tears of JOY, the <hi>ſincereſt</hi> JOY." "Of JOY!" repeated Emmiline, "I thought people only cried when they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy or diſtreſſed. I cry when mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma is diſpleaſed with me, becauſe I am grieved I have offended her; and I have ſeen mamma cry but it was when dear papa was ill, and then, I am ſure, ſhe cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed becauſe ſhe was in trouble. Pray let us ſee you ſmile, and we ſhall think you are really happy." It was ſome time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Madame de St. Claire could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince her daughter, that the extreme ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of joy or ſorrow might give riſe to the ſame emotions.</p>
                     <p>At length the appointed morning came, when they were to bid adieu to the ſolitude in which they had experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced ſuch a portion of uninterrupted pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure and ſatisfaction. It was with real regret they took leave of their worthy friend, who, after affectionately embrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the children, took them each ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:036274_0069_100869A159E70AE0"/>
in his arms to the carriage, while they exclaimed, in accents ſcarcely audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, "God bleſs you! Bleſs our good friend de Livré!" The carriage drove away.—Grief would not permit the good man to bid them a ſecond adieu. They gazed at him until a turn in the road prevented their enjoying longer this gratification, and ſoon even the lowly habitation ceaſed to be diſcernible. They had travelled ſome miles. The children were unable to overcome their dejection; when Madame de St. Claire endeavored to divert their thoughts from the melancholy ſeparation, to the beauties of the ſurrounding country; but it exhibited ſcenes which the ſorrow of the preſent hour would not ſuffer them to contemplate with any ſenſation of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. "That you are concerned to leave a perſon who has treated you with ſo much kindneſs, is not ſurpriſing. It would have ſhewn an inſenſibility of heart, not to have been affected; but, it is wrong to give yourſelves up to this
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:036274_0070_100869A4758650F8"/>
immoderate grief. We ſhall ſee Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur de Livré again in the courſe of a few months, and we are aſſured, it will not be long before we have the pleaſure of hearing from him, and ought we not to feel ſome conſolation in having left him in eaſier circumſtances? If you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue thus to give way to fruitleſs ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, you will not be able to bear the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigues of your journey. Be cheerful, I beg of you. Emmiline, I know, loves a ſtory. Henry and Clara, I believe, can ſometimes take pleaſure in one; and I think, I know a ſhort hiſtory which would amuſe you, at leaſt for a few min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utes." "Oh! do, do tell it us, dear mamma," they all exclaimed, while ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger expectation ſeemed to arreſt the ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tear. Madame, after tenderly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing them, began the following little narrative:—</p>

                        <head>THE DISAPPOINTMENT.</head>
                        <p>"WHAT joy!" exclaimed Sophia to her ſiſter, one morning as they left their apartment; "this day is come at laſt!—The birth day of our dear couſin. We are to go to the ball this evening. How I love a ball! how happy we ſhall be! I will wear my new frock that is ſo prettily trimmed, with my ſky blue ſaſh." "And I," interrupted Mary, "thoſe pretty ſlippers, which mamma bought for me the other day." At breakfaſt nothing was ſpoken of but the expected pleaſures of the evening; the ſame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject was continued till dinner time, and their little heads were ſo much taken up with the thoughts of a dance, that they could not apply themſelves to a ſingle leſſon. Their governeſs complained of their inattention. Throwing their arms
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:036274_0072_100869A9BA878540"/>
around her neck, they exclaimed, "Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe us, dear Madam, to day, we cannot apply ourſelves; it is the day of the ball, our dear couſin's birth day, whom we have ſeen but once ſince her return from the continent. Pray, pray excuſe us; indeed we will be very aſſiduous tomor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row." "It is enough," replied their amiable inſtructreſs, "I do not forget that I was once young as you are, and yield to your ſolicitations. We will ſet aſide all buſineſs for today." The morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paſſed away with all the ſenſations of delight which hearts young as their's only could experience. "Why, mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma," ſaid Sophia, as they were at table, "are you not as cheerful as we are? You are going to the ball with us, but you do not ſeem ſo joyful, and I often obſerve, my dear mamma, that you have tears in your eyes; yet, if we ſpeak to you, you <hi>ſmile,</hi> and in a moment all your ſorrow ſeems to be gone." "Do not, my love, queſtion me on this ſubject," ſaid the good mother, "you are as yet
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:036274_0073_100869AC0FFDF6B0"/>
a ſtranger to affliction or misfortune, and ſo once was <hi>I.</hi> Many years have elapſed ſince the event, which cauſes me ſo often thoſe emotions, which excite your ſurpriſe. Do not ſeek to know any further. In <hi>you,</hi> my dear children, I am <hi>happy!</hi>" She ſighed, and her eyes overflowed with tenderneſs as ſhe preſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to her boſom.</p>
                        <p>Soon after, a ſervant entered with a note. It was to ſay that the young lady (Sophia and Mary's couſin) was taken ſuddenly ill, and obliged to put off the ball till another day. The countenance of the children betrayed every emotion of vexation and diſappointment, as their mamma read aloud the unpleaſant intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence. "I would not give any thing to go another time," cried Sophia, "I had thought with ſo much pleaſure of this evening.—I ſhall not be able to wear my pretty frock for I know not how long, and then the charming dance we ſhould have had!" "I know," in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted Mary, "it will be put off from
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:036274_0074_100869AD99DCED08"/>
day to day, and we ſhall never go." Saying this, ſhe burſt into tears. Mrs. Lambert, who obſerved and pitied their uneaſineſs, when the firſt tranſports of their grief began to ſubſide, thus addreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them: "I am very ſorry, my dears, you are deprived of this long expected pleaſure, and more ſo that your coſin's ill health prevents her having the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of her friends' ſociety. But we muſt not ſuffer ourſelves to be too much affected by trifles. If her life was in danger, you would have reaſon for theſe tears; but by a letter I have juſt receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from her mother, I am informed that her indiſpoſition is by no means alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing—quietneſs is preſcribed, and I have no doubt but in a few days we ſhall hear of her perfect recovery. Since the ball is deferred, we muſt endeavor amongſt ourſelves to paſs this evening as agreeably as we can; but, then, I muſt inſiſt that you throw off this dejection, and appear with your accuſtomed cheerfulneſs. You would not wiſh, I am ſure, to make
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:036274_0075_100869B122D8B720"/>
thoſe you love uncomfortable, by ſullen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ill humor, for this trivial diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment." "No, my dear mamma," ſaid Sophia, drying her eyes, "we will not give you cauſe to be diſpleaſed with us. We will be cheerful. What ſhall we do to amuſe you?" "Shall we play or ſing to you, dear mamma?" demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Mary, kiſſing her hand. "Neither, my love," replied this indulgent parent, "I am ſo pleaſed with this your effort to oblige me, in drying up your tears, that I muſt think of ſomething for <hi>your</hi> amuſement. We will go and drink tea with the good woman of the farm, whom we have ſeen but once ſince we came into the country." "What! Nan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nette?" cried the children, "how glad we ſhall be to ſee her again! You re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member how we loved her, when ſhe was our nurſe. Thank you! thank you, for this indulgence, dear mamma!" And in a moment the diſappointment was forgotten.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="78" facs="unknown:036274_0076_100869B36D7498C0"/>
The evening was one of the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful for a walk: Mrs. Lambert and the young people were joyfully welcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the amiable cottager, who, in a few minutes liberally ſet before them the homely productions of her little tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                        <p>While partaking of theſe, a beggar at the gate excited the curioſity and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her ſprightly gueſts. For the pleaſures of the afternoon had raiſed even the depreſſed ſpirits of Mrs. Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert. The perſon who aſked their char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity was an elderly woman, accompanied by a beautiful child, who appeared to be not more than ten years of age. They were cleanly dreſſed, though their clothes were ragged. "Alas!" ſaid the poor wanderer, "it is not for myſelf I implore your benevolence; I am old—the days of my life will ſoon be at an end.—It is for this dear child—ſhe is well born, and deſerves a better fate. But what do I ſay! Perhaps ſhe is now an orphan, and her only remaining friend
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:036274_0077_100869B4F0458758"/>
the unfortunate wretch who now begs upon her knees a bit of bread for her. Oh! do—do not refuſe it, ſhe is ready to faint with fatigue; we have travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led many a weary mile through rugged roads to day; and laſt night—I thought I ſhould have loſt her—no one would give us ſhelter from the ſtorm, we brav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed its fury in the foreſt—ah! ſuch a night. This dear child, though thus forſaken, is amiable, and worthy of all that can be done for her." Mrs. Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert, affected almoſt to tears, deſired the aged ſupplicant to come in. "Give us," ſaid ſhe, "ſome account of yourſelf and of the dear child you have thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected, my good woman: But firſt drink a little milk, it will do you good. You have greatly intereſted us. Sit down, you ſeem very much fatigued." Mary and Sophia immediately offered their baſons to the little girl. "Heaven bleſs you, Madam!" ſaid the woman, as ſhe took the milk, "our ſtory is a long one; but you have humanity, and
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:036274_0078_100869B748490090"/>
will liſten to the recital of our misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes with patience.</p>
                        <p>"It is now almoſt ſix weeks ſince we were driven by a wicked landlord (lately come to his eſtate) from our habitation. He was a proud, auſtere, avaricious man. The ſight of our humble dwelling was a moſt diſguſting ſpectacle to him; he ordered his ſteward to have it pulled down, and to ſend the inhabitants away. This man, not leſs cruel than his maſter, would not liſten to our ſupplications, nor even permit us to ſtay and pack up our few clothes; as if he had not ſhewn in this ſufficient ſeverity, he demanded the immediate payment of all that was due to him; a great ſum to me at that time, for bad health had rendered me for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny months incapable of doing any thing towards earning any money for our ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence; and all that I had formerly laid up had been expended for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and education of this dear innocent. Ah! there was once a time, when we were in a better ſituation; but the death
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:036274_0079_100869BAD1910E18"/>
of my dear huſband reduced me to pov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty. I could no longer keep her at ſchool, and after having ſold the greateſt part of our furniture, I rented this hut, about three miles from St. Albans, where, by my daily labor I have ſupported this dear child, and when not able to work, ſhe has been ſo good, ſo kind to me in all my ſickneſs—It was then her induſtry maintained us both." "She is your niece, I imagine," ſaid Mrs. Lambert, "perhaps a brother's unprotected daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter!" "Ah! no, Madam, ſhe is born of nobler parents. In me you behold her nurſe, the attendant of her helpleſs years. Her father and mother, when they ſet off for America, conſigned her to my care, and proud was I of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious charge! My huſband being at that time in buſineſs, we were proſperous and happy. The charming girl became eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day dearer to us. Had ſhe been our own, we could not have loved her bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. What is there now that I would not do for her? For her dear parents—
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:036274_0080_100869BC56993B88"/>
alas! they are dead—perhaps buried in the profound abyſs of the ſea! I have received but one letter ſince their depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure." "What was their name?" aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Mrs. Lambert with emotion. "My maſter's name was Lambert, Colonel Lambert—" replied the woman. "Heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens!" exclaimed the affectionate moth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, "is it, can it be poſſible? But tell me your own?" "Elſon, Madam." With increaſing ſurpriſe, Mrs. Lambert caught the child in her arms, and preſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her to her boſom, thus continued, "Is it not an illuſion? Do I live to embrace again my daughter, after hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vainly ſought her for ſo many years! My dear, my firſt child? It is! it is herſelf! my heart tells me that it is—though long ſuppoſed to be no more! Thy mother's deareſt bleſſing lives! My Caroline! My nurſe too, the generous protectreſs of my helpleſs innocent! How ſhall we ever recompenſe your cares, or reward you for the hours of anxiety and miſery you have paſſed on our

account?" In a moment the good wom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an was upon her knees before Mrs. Lambert, and preſſing her hand with fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor: "My dear, my beloved miſtreſs! do I live to ſee you once again, to reſtore this darling to a mother's arms, to ſee you happy? Now I ſhall die content. Receive my prayer, oh! Father of the friendleſs. Preſerve and bleſs this dear, this worthy family! But," looking earneſtly around her, "one is wanting; my good maſter!" "He is well, my affectionate nurſe," replied the joyful parent, "and is now in England. Oh! let us haſten home to reſtore to him his long loſt child." "It was then for the loſs of our dear ſiſter, mamma," ſaid the children, "that we have ſeen you ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſorrowful. Dear, dear Caroline! how happy we are to you. Good nurſe, we will love you as well as you have loved our ſiſter." "It is now," in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted the enraptured mother, "more than ſix years ſince we returned to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. You were the firſt perſon we
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:036274_0082_100869C119D25230"/>
ſought on our arrival; but the houſe you formerly occupied, was let to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other perſon, and we were told that every one thought you dead. Unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected happineſs! You live—and have preſerved, regardleſs of your own, a life ſo dear. Oh! my Caroline!—my Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oline!—" She could articulate no more. Mary and Sophia were not leſs affected. They wept, they embraced their ſiſter by turns, who returned their careſſes with the tendereſt affection. The carriage, which Mrs. Lambert had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to fetch them, now drove up to the gate, and they took a haſty leave of Nannette, anxious to introduce the love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly object of their ſudden joy to the beſt of fathers.</p>
                        <p>"How fortunate!" exclaimed Sophia; "if the ball had not been deferred, we ſhould not have enjoyed this pleaſure." "Let this teach you then, my children," ſaid their good mother, "that the ſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt <hi>diſappointments</hi> may ſome times prove the ſource of our greateſt <hi>happineſs.</hi>"</p>

                           <p>Certainly, my love, they could not have given a better proof; they waited not to be informed what her neceſſity required, but conceiving in a moment the miſery of her ſituation, did all in their power to relieve it.</p>

                           <p>Mamma, I always thought beggars were a bad kind of people; and had I been in the place of Mrs. Lambert, I ſhould have told the poor woman to

have gone about her buſineſs. But I ſhall not think ſo of them in future, ſince this ſtory has convinced me, it is poſſible that many who have lived in affluent circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, may have been reduced by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable misfortunes to poverty and diſtreſs, and that we ſhould not always judge of perſons from their outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance.</p>

                        <p>In this manner did the little travellers drive away fatigue and dejection. They ſpoke of de Livré, but with more cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, and concerted many plans of amuſements, to be executed at their next viſit to him.</p>
                        <p>On the evening of the ſecond day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they left the cottage, the happy par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty arrived at the end of their journey.</p>

                     <p>THE chateau of Monſieur de St. Claire was ſituated on an extenſive plain, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:036274_0085_100869C8CD0FA890"/>
with beautiful gardens and plantations. As they approached it, the moon was juſt riſing, and illumined with its ſilver rays the diſtant ſummit of Mount Blanc. The evening was one of the moſt ſerene, when not even the whiſtle of the mountain peaſant inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted the plaintive notes of the night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingale, prolonged by the gentle breeze.</p>
                     <p>"Ah! here we are once more!" ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed Henry, with tranſport, "how glad I am to ſee the old manſion again! How pretty it looks by moonlight! Does it not, mamma? See how the trees in the avenue are grown ſince we were here. What pleaſure we ſhall have tomorrow, in going through all the walks!" By this time they were at the door, which was opened by an old port<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, who for thirty years had been intruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with that employment. "Oh!

                     <p>Clara, hurt and offended at her broth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's officiouſneſs, retired to the fartheſt part of the room. Her mamma enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſoon after, and enquired what was the matter. "Oh! do not aſk me," ſaid Emmiline, "Clara will tell you." Madame then turning towards Henry, ſeemed to demand an explanation from him; though ſevere as his conduct had been to his ſiſter, when they were alone, the reproof he had once received from de Livré came at this moment acroſs his mind, and he was determined to be ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, rather than appear ungenerous or ill natured; he was not naturally ſo, and when he erred in this reſpect, it was through thoughtleſſneſs, not from a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravity of diſpoſition.</p>
                     <p>Madame de St. Claire, going up to Clara, thus addreſſed her: "I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed concerned to ſee this ſorrowful countenance, my dear girl; you have left, it is true, a few friends behind you,
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:036274_0089_100869D30BC317D8"/>
but I ſhould hope thoſe who are moſt dear to you are now preſent, and that you would ſuffer yourſelf to be amuſed by thoſe diverſions they are deſirous of procuring you. Had you a taſte for books, my Clara, we certainly could promiſe you a larger ſource of entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I yet hope, a time will come, when I ſhall ſee you take pleaſure in them.</p>
                     <p>"Your preſent conduct is highly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing to me, for I imagined you would have endeavored to render your ſociety as agreeable as poſſible, in your dear fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's abſence. This is rather an ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful return, for all my attempts to make you happy." She then propoſed a walk to the young folk; but no one could prevail on Clara to accompany them. She ſaid ſhe did not want to ſee flowers and trees, they could afford her no amuſement. "I am ſorry to perceive, my dear," ſaid her mother, "that in your preſent diſpoſition there is not any thing which <hi>could</hi> give you pleaſure."
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:036274_0090_100869D499BBA968"/>
"Good bye, Miſs Sulky," cried Henry, as they were going out; "I hope you will be in better temper when we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn." "And by what authority do you call your ſiſter names, Henry!" ſaid Madame de St. Claire, "you know I do not ſuffe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> this impertinence; ſhe merits my diſpleaſure, but not your inſolence. Aſk her pardon, ſir, for this diſreſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful treatment." Henry returned to his ſiſter, and took her hand, ſaying, "Will you forgive me, Clara, I know it was not right to call you ſuch a name; I will not do ſo any more." "Think no more of it, my dear brother, I am moſt to blame, for having given you reaſon to ſuppoſe I merit it." Henry, to whom his mother's diſpleaſure gave the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt uneaſineſs, dared not again approach her, till Emmiline had ſaid ſomething in his favor. "Mamma," ſaid this charming girl, "you will permit Henry to walk with us! will you not? He is grieved he has offended you; I ſhall not have half the pleaſure if he does not go
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:036274_0091_100869D6480B76A8"/>
with us. Nor will you be ſo happy, my dear mamma, for I know you love my brother." Emmiline then led him to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Madame de St. Claire, who thus addreſſed him: "You are ſenſible, my ſon, you have committed a fault; but this contrition makes me hope you will never again incur my diſpleaſure by a repetition of it. You have my entire forgiveneſs." They then proceeded to the garden. It was kept in admirable order, and there were a variety of beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful plants and flowers; the nature and names of which Henry and Emmiline were deſirous of being acquainted with. They had ſcarce gone over all the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent walks, before the bell ſummoned them to dinner. Clara had ceaſed cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but had not reſumed her uſual cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs. The children ſpoke in raptures of their morning ramble, and were ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed to ſee, as ſoon as the cloth was removed, the carriage drive up to the door. "I propoſe," ſaid Madame de St. Claire, "to make a little excurſion
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:036274_0092_100869D969A2FB38"/>
this afternoon to the dairy houſe. You do not remember it, I believe, Henry, for you were very young when you uſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to accompany me thither; and took great delight in playing with and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning after the wild goats. As for Clara, who imagines there can be no kind of amuſements at a diſtance from Paris, we will leave her to divert herſelf as ſhe thinks proper at home." The miſtak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en girl now indeed began to repent of not having ſhared the pleaſures of the morning, and left ſome deſire to be of the party; but her mamma would not hear of it, and left her to the charge of the good Jaqueline, to whom ſhe gave ſtrict injunctions not to behave to her with the leaſt familiarity; as her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct had been ſuch as ſhe could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely approve.</p>

                     <p>THE dairy was about four miles from the chateau, a thatched dwelling, over which an old vine extended its luxuriant branches almoſt on all ſides, whoſe pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple cluſters overſhadowed the narrow lattices. By the door was a bench en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circled with woodbines and ivy, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorite ſeat of the aged cottagers, when the declining ſun put a period to the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors of the day. As they approached, they were ſurpriſed with the ſounds of muſic. The merry tabor echoed among the hills, and its cheerful notes ſeemed to announce an eve of feſtivity. Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral young peaſants were ſeen dancing on the lawn, at a little diſtance from the houſe. "Oh! look, mamma," ſaid Henry, "here is a ball! How prettily the young girls are dreſſed, and how pleaſed they look! I never ſaw any fine ladies at Paris look half ſo happy,
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:036274_0094_100869DE06014310"/>
even in your drawing room. But they have all wreaths of white roſes round their heads; what can this mean?" On a ſudden the muſic pauſed—the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a carriage had for a while ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended the ſportive ſcene. Madame, alighting with the children, begged they would continue their diverſion, while they ſpoke a few words to the good old couple, who had ſeated themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the extenſive branches of an aged oak; which for ſeveral years had been the ornament of their ſolitude.</p>
                     <p>The worthy people roſe at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of a ſtranger. "Good Heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens!" exclaimed the herdſman, "is it Madame de St. Claire I ſee?" "Yes, Marcilen, we are come once more to viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it you. How does my good dame? But do not let us interrupt your ſport. It is a feſtival I ſee, and ſome of thoſe young people, I ſuppoſe, are your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren." "Yes, and pleaſe you," replied the herdſman's wife; "that young woman in white is our eldeſt daughter,
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:036274_0095_100869E0923BC538"/>
ſhe was married this morning to the lad you ſee dancing with her; ſo we invit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a few neighbors to make a kind of holiday. The two girls to the left of her are her ſiſters, and that ſtripling who is ſitting down yonder is our ſon." "Thank God!" continued Marcilen, "we are very happy in our children; they are our greateſt comfort, and though Lucinda is married ſo well, we ſhall be ſorry to loſe her; but we ſhall enjoy her dear company a few days longer, as they will not go to their own habitation this fortnight. Dear Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am, do walk in, and partake of ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment; or, perhaps, you would like to have it here better." Madame de St. Claire expreſſing a wiſh to remain a ſpectator of the rural fête, he called to his ſon Louis to bring a little table, and ordered him to get ſome fruits and new milk for the viſitors. "It is long," ſaid the happy peaſant, "ſince we had this honor, and we muſt let our young neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors enjoy their ſport an hour the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:036274_0096_100869E2E03BD4C0"/>
to welcome our noble gueſts." On a ſignal given, the dance again began. Henry and Emmiline, after they had partaken of the homely, though deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious entertainment, joined the merry throng; and never had any amuſement afforded them ſuch delight. "How charming it is to dance in the open air!" cried Henry, ſkipping up to his mamma, "and then what a delightful evening! I wiſh Clara was here, I am ſure I ſhall not be tired theſe three hours." And he joined again his little partner. "You are very happy here?" ſaid Madame to the herdſman. "Yes, my good lady, our flocks are proſperous, and indeed we have not a ſingle care. We work hard, it is true, but cuſtom has worn away that difficulty; and the recreations of the evening are the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for the toils of the day. A thouſand trifles, that would perhaps affect others, do not give us a moment's uneaſineſs. We have never accuſtomed ourſelves to look for perfect felicity; yet are happy
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:036274_0097_100869E531D337F0"/>
as it is poſſible for mortals to be. We have health and dutiful children, in our labors we are ſucceſsful, and what elſe could we deſire? Ah, Madam! how often do I wiſh, when I meet a fine car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage on the high road, that its owners were as happy as we are!" "But you do not dance every evening, I preſume?" ſaid Madame. "No, good lady," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied Jacine, (for that was the name of the herdſman's wife) "but our children amuſe us, we have a few books, and they take it by turns to read to us; Louis plays on his pipe too, now and then, and the girls ſing to it; Lucinda, they ſay, has a very pretty voice. A mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic maſter, who came into this part of the country about two years ſince, would have given her ſome inſtructions for nothing, but it would only have made her vain, and taken her mind from things of more importance, ſo we declined his generous offer. Her wild note pleaſes us, nor do we wiſh her better informed. But you would think theſe merits were
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:036274_0098_10086ABB0F64F6B8"/>
trifling, did you know how good ſhe is. I had a fit of the rheumatiſm laſt winter, (a ſevere one it was) and had you ſeen, you never would have forgotten all ſhe did for me; ſo tender, ſo attentive, and my ſpinning went on as well as if I had been about; I believe the dear child worked as ſhe ſat up with me every night."</p>
                     <p>Madame de St. Claire chatted with theſe good people and their family, till the falling dew warned her it was time to return. The children wiſhed for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other dance, but ſhe was fearful of their taking cold. Accuſtomed to regard her will as the rule of their inclinations, without a murmur they cheerfully ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped into the carriage, nodding to the happy groupe as long as they remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſight. "I ſhould like," exclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Henry, "to viſit theſe honeſt people every day. Why is not every body ſo happy?" "Becauſe," replied Madame, "there are few who have rightly conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered what is the baſis of <hi>true happineſs.</hi>
                        <pb n="101" facs="unknown:036274_0099_100869E6B3ABB4F8"/>
They imagine it conſiſts in the gratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their deſires, and a purſuit of pleaſure. We have ſeen an example to the contrary, in theſe worthy peaſants; who, without forming one extravagant idea in the ſearch of true felicity, find it in contentment. Indeed, happineſs is much nearer to us, than we are often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to think, when our paſſions and our caprice prevent our enjoyment of it. I rejoice that the ſcene we have witneſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, has made ſome impreſſion on your minds. You have ſeen health and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs the reward of virtue and induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try."</p>
                     <p>For the firſt two miles of their return, the dairy furniſhed matter for converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. As it grew darker, the children's attention was attracted by the number of ſtars that then ſhone forth with their brighteſt luſtre; and they reminded their mother of the promiſe ſhe had made, to give them further information relating to aſtronomy. "Oh! mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma," cried Henry, "there is the conſtel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:036274_0100_100869E946263BE8"/>
of the Great Bear, that you point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out to us the other evening; and there are ſeven ſtars, a little farther on, in the form of a creſcent, which I think is the Northern Crown. But what a bright one is over that tree! What a ſteady light it has! What do you call it?"</p>

                        <p>Planets are dark bodies enlightened by the ſun. The earth we live on is a planet, and there are ſix be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, which make their revolutions round him, and turn each upon its axis, at ſtat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed periods: Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and the Georgium Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus. The other luminaries you have been obſerving, are called fixed ſtars, from their keeping nearly always the ſame places in the heavens, and not riſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or ſetting as the planets do.</p>

Can you tell me, Henry, why thoſe planets ſhine with a ſteadier light than the fixed ſtars?</p>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>HENRY.</speaker>

                        <speaker>MADAME.</speaker>
                        <p>The fixed ſtars are appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently ſo ſmall, that the interpoſition of the leaſt body, and there are many ſuch floating in the air, deprives us of the ſight of them. When the interpoſed body changes its place, we again ſee the ſtars, and this occaſions a twinkling.</p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>HENRY.</speaker>
                        <p>You ſay, mamma, the plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets are like our earth; how can this be? They appear only little bright things not larger than a ſpangle.</p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>MADAME.</speaker>
                        <p>And yet there are ſome as large, and others larger than the earth. The reaſon of their appearing ſo ſmall, is their immenſe diſtance from us. Do you not perceive a very ſmall light be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thoſe trees?</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>

                        <p>Yes, mamma, it reſembles a little ſtar in ſize, but the color is very different.</p>

                        <p>That light proceeds from the Chateau. It is a candle they have placed in one of the windows. As we approach nearer, you will be able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh it; and it will appear as large as it really is. Do you comprehend now why the ſtars appear ſo ſmall?</p>

What an auguſt, what an amazing conception does this give us of the works of the Creator!

                        <p>The children promiſed they would endeavor to retain the information they had acquired; and almoſt with regret ſaw themſelves once more at the gate of the Chateau.</p>
                        <p>They were welcomed home by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentant Clara, whoſe countenance bore the ſtrongeſt marks of ſincere contrition. Though not faultleſs, ſhe had an affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate heart, in which her mother's diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:036274_0104_100869F3A76C9338"/>
excited the greateſt grief. At their next viſit to the dairy, ſhe was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to accompany them; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged there were ſome pleaſures to be enjoyed even at a diſtance from the metropolis. Far from finding the time hang heavy on their hands, or expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riencing the dullneſs of ſolitude, after having paſſed a few months in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement, they owned they had never been ſo happy. Madame de St. Claire diverſified their employments in ſuch a manner, that they had always ſomething new to learn, or to be informed of. The mornings were devoted to ſtudy; when the buſineſs of the day was completed, they rode, walked, or cultivated their gardens, for Henry and his ſiſters had each a portion allotted them.</p>

                     <p>THEY had been more than a twelve-month at the Chateau, when one morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Henry and his ſiſters aſked leave of their mother to take a walk before break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt with Agnes, to a beautiful ſituation, about two miles off, where they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed endeavoring to ſketch ſome views.</p>
                     <p>Being arrived at the ſpot, they were ſome time ſeeking where to place them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; at length Henry exclaimed, "Oh! what a delightful proſpect is here! Thoſe trees to the left thrown in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſhade, and the cottages in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground, will make a charming land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape; and how it will pleaſe mamma, to ſee I can draw from nature." "And how delighted ſhe will be with a draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of mine," interrupted Clara; "I ſee a beautiful ſubject—that bridge and the mill at a diſtance. Agnes, give us the paper and pencils; Emmiline, do not
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:036274_0106_100869F845FA2E90"/>
come and interrupt us." Emmiline had no ſuch intention. She had begged a bit of paper, and began to amuſe herſelf by trying to draw one of the herdſman's huts, which ſhe ſaw at a little diſtance. Henry eagerly ſet about his view, but found it not quite ſo eaſy to accompliſh as he at firſt imagined. It was ſometime before he could produce any repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what he wiſhed. At length he exultingly called his ſiſter Clara to come and look at his outline. On her ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, he cried, "I have got it quite right at laſt; ſee, Clara, how exact I have been. Now I have only to color it, and then it will be finiſhed." His ſiſter ſaid, ſhe thought he had better do it in Indian ink, as he had not begun to draw in colors, and moſt likely, by attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it now, he might ſpoil his landſcape. "And ſo you would have me give mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma this charming view only in black and white? It would be very like it to be ſure! Look at the color of thoſe trees, which the ſun ſhines ſo bright on; a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:036274_0107_100869F9C7DA0280"/>
gamboge, mixed with lake, is the very tint, and the ſap green for thoſe which are in ſhade. Do your's in what you pleaſe. Recollect, you have not learnt ſo long as I have, and I am ſure you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not draw as well as <hi>I</hi> can." "You know, Henry, mamma is not pleaſed to hear you ſpeak ſo often of the perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of your own performances. I fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy you have forgotten the converſation at the cottage." "It is no buſineſs of your's," replied Henry, much offended, "I wiſh you would leave me, that I might finiſh my drawing. Say what you will, I am ſure it will be better than your's; for you know even your out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines mamma ſays are very incorrect." Henry found more difficulty in the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oring than he expected. His yellow was too bright, and endeavoring to ſoften it, he had given it the appearance of a dirty brown. Vexed at not being able to ſucceed to his expectation, he put the drawing in his pocket; not permitting even his ſiſters to look at it, but hurry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:036274_0108_100869FC0F4C6990"/>
them from the delightful ſpot. Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra had juſt finiſhed her's, and from not attempting more than ſhe could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, had ſucceeded better.</p>
                     <p>On their return, in a lane leading to the chateau, they were accoſted by a poor boy, who begged of them to buy ſome little birds which he held up for their obſervation in a broken cage. "Pray do, my good ladies; my poor father is very ill, and my moth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er not able to leave her bed." "If this be true," interrupted Agnes, why do you not work for them, inſtead of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying theſe birds about to ſell; by which, it is certain, you cannot obtain much towards their ſupport?" Alas! Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am," he replied, "Heaven knows how willingly I would work now for them, would any one employ me: But I have been a very undutiful boy to them; I did not like labor, and the farmers and herdſmen, knowing my former indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, will not now take me into their ſervice; but my dear father, my dear
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:036274_0109_100869FF210EF3A0"/>
mother, they will die, if I cannot earn ſomething for their ſupport." Emmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line exclaimed, Let us buy theſe pretty creatures, Agnes. There are ſix of them, juſt two a piece. What do you aſk for them, little boy?" "Oh! whatever you pleaſe to give me," he replied, ſob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing. Each immediately produced their purſe; but Clara, as ſhe opened her's recollected the promiſe of her mamma to take them that day to a neighboring fair; at which, the preceding evening, ſhe had given them a little ſum to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe what ſhould pleaſe them moſt. She heſitated, looked at her brother, then at Emmiline, then at the almoſt naked object before her. "Your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, your mother are ill," ſhe exclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in a tender accent; "and I have it in my power to do ſomething for them. Why ſhould I deliberate? Take this tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle. If it procures them eaſe, I ſhall not regret the want of the trifles it was deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tined to purchaſe." "But," ſaid Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, "if we ſpend all our money, perhaps
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:036274_0110_10086A016F4C3338"/>
mamma will not take us to the fair." "Should that be the caſe," replied Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miline, "I am ſure ſhe will not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with us; and the ſatisfaction of having done ſomething for theſe poor people, will afford us pleaſure, even ſhould we be diſappointed. Poor boy! take this, (putting into his hand five ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings) and get ſomething with it for your parents." Henry added his ſhare, but with unuſual reluctance; having reſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it for the purchaſe of a new ſet of ninepins. "I ſhall not have what I have ſo long wiſhed for," ſaid he to himſelf, as he gave the money, "but what of that? The reflection of having done a good action will be preferable." The lad, aſtoniſhed at the ſight of what to him was an immenſe ſum, returned thanks on his knees for their bounty. Emmiline took the cage, and they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued the road to the chateau. Agnes, unobſerved, ſtepped back to enquire in what part of the country the wretched family dwelt, in hopes ſhe might have it
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:036274_0111_10086A02F2B07890"/>
in her power to be of further ſervice to them, when Madame de St. Claire ſhould be informed of their ſituation.</p>
                     <p>Emmiline was the firſt to relate the events of the morning, eagerly running up to Madame, "Look, look, mamma, ſee what pretty birds we have bought!" And in a few minutes the whole adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was related.</p>

                        <p>Poor boy! Oh! mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, if you had but ſeen him, he looked ſo ſad. No ſhoes or ſtockings upon his feet, and his coat was all in tatters. Then his parents are ſo ill. If I had had a guinea in my pocket, I am ſure I ſhould have given it to him. I thought, mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, if you had been ill, what I ſhould have felt; and this thought made me pity him, though you would have had every thing that was comfortable; but theſe poor people have not even neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries.</p>

little creatures have already ſuffered enough, in being taken from the neſt. See how they flutter.

Should Agnes go to the fair, would you permit her to buy him ſome ſhoes and ſtockings? This is all I want, indeed, mamma.</p>

purchaſe them yourſelf. I have ordered the carriage. We will all go to the fair; and to reward your benevolent conduct, I will give you as much again to ſpend as I did at firſt. Agnes has informed me where the miſerable parents of this poor lad reſide. Jaqueline and Lémoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſhall take a walk with our apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to provide them with every thing that is neceſſary and comfortable, and if the boy is really diſpoſed to be induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, I have given orders that he may be employed in the garden.</p>
                        <p>While the carriage was getting ready, the children exhibited the ſketches they had made. Madame de St. Claire was much pleaſed with Clara's attempt. "And where is yours, Henry?" ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. "Oh! mamma," he repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, taking it from his pocket, "you will not be ſo well ſatisfied with this. I have ſpoiled it in the coloring. I thought I could have done it better; I was ſo vexed when I found it did not go on well, that I could have torn it in pieces.

                        <p>"Mamma," interrupted Emmiline, "will you look at my herdſman's hut? There was a fine tree on one ſide of it, but I could not do it well, though I tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſeveral times.

                        <p>The children ſpent a delightful day. Every thing was new, and conſequently had the charm of pleaſing.

                        <p>They were proceeding, when a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, almoſt out of breath, came run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning up to Madame de St. Claire.

"You are wanted within, Madam—a flight accident—my young maſter—his horſe has thrown him!—but he is not much hurt, I hope, your good ſurgeon is with him—do not be alarmed."</p>
                        <p>Madame de St. Claire was near faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at this melancholy intelligence, and was ſupported by Clara and the ſervant to the apartment where her ſon lay ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently almoſt lifeleſs on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

When her mother entered, ſhe fell ſenſeleſs on the floor, and was conveyed by Agnes to another room. The ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon was tying up Henry's arm, for he had bled him, when Madame, ſcarce able to ſupport herſelf, ſat down by him. "Do you think, ſir, my dear boy will recover?" "Certainly, Madam," he replied, "the bruiſes he has received may confine him a ſhort time, but I do not apprehend any danger; I would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe his being put immediately to bed, and kept very quiet, and I requeſt no perſon except yourſelf and his nurſe may go near him." Emmiline, who at this moment had reentered, exclaimed in the moſt pathetic accents, "Oh! ſir, may I not ſee my brother? I will be very quiet—I will not ſpeak to him, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I will not, if it will do him harm, but I muſt be with him.

three days that the dear little fellow was confined, this affectionate sister never left him; she had her own bed brought to the side of his, and gave him with her own hand whatever he wanted, scarcely suffering any other to approach him. Clara was also very attentive, and shewed the greatest concern at her broth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's indisposition. At the expiration of a week, he was able to set up the whole day, and Clara and Emmiline did all in their power to amuse him; the latter brought into his chamber one evening, her cabinet of shells. "I have thought of a charming entertainment," said the affectionate girl, addressing Madame de St. Claire, "we will look over these cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosities, and you will tell us the names of those we are not acquainted with. Here are some beautiful sea weeds too, which I want to know something about. We will sit all round this table, and look at them separately.</p>

The plants, which are entirely ſtony, are the coral and the madrepore; the latter has no bark, the former has.

There is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a white coral; but what is called black,<note n="*" place="bottom">Some ſpecimens of Black Coral are in Sir Aſhton Lever's Muſeum.</note> is a ſea plant of a very different nature.

with which, like two oars, its rows its lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle bark along. When he has a mind to dive, he strikes the sail, collects himself within his shell, and filling the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing room with water, without any fear of drowning sinks to the bottom.</p>

                     <p>ABOUT this time, Madame de St. Claire and her children paid the prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſed viſit to Monſieur de Livré, whom they found in perfect health; and rend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered by their benevolence the happieſt of mortals.</p>
                     <p>The cottage had been repaired, and preſented to the eye, in lieu of its form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er deſolate appearance, a neat and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious dwelling. It was furniſhed in the ſimpleſt ſtyle, and de Livré had hir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:036274_0144_10086A52AFE2CA00"/>
the daughter of a neighboring peaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant to keep it in order.</p>
                     <p>The garden had been enlarged, with many improvements, and the path clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from brambles, which led to a pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant eminence beyond it. This winding walk was now planted with roſe trees, jeſſamine, and the ſweeteſt ſhrubs. At the top Monſieur de Livré had erected a ruſtic edifice, to which, a few days after their arrival, he conducted his good friends. This ſpot commanded a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful view of the adjacent country. "It is here, my little friends," ſaid he, "that I hope now and then to be favored with your company. You have no doubt made ſome progreſs in aſtronomy ſince I had the pleaſure of ſeeing you; and will not this be a charming place to purſue your ſtudies in? See what an expanſe of horizon there is around us! I had (he added) your improvement and pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure in view, when I conſtructed this; I looked forward to your promiſe of viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iting me, and wiſhed to make my ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude

as agreeable as poſſible to my wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy benefactors. There are too many clouds this evening for us to trace out the different conſtellations, but the firſt evening that is more favorable I hope you will accompany me hither."</p>
                     <p>The children, delighted with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal, returned their artleſs thanks, and waited with impatience the following evening, which proved all they could wiſh for. The air was ſerene, and not a cloud perceivable, even to the utmoſt verge of the horizon.</p>
                     <p>Struck with the beauty of the ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the preceding day, the children beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to drink tea on the mount, that they might have the pleaſure of ſeeing the ſun ſet from thence.

                        <p>Then I will endeavor to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain it to you. You have been informed, that the earth turns upon its axis once every twenty four hours.

                        <p>Perfectly, mamma, I now recollect you explained it to us at the time you mentioned the change of the ſeaſons; which we could not enjoy but for the inclination of the earth's axis twenty three degrees and a half from its orbit. Yet this axis always keeps the ſame poſition, and is directed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards one and the ſame ſide of the heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens, moving from Weſt to Eaſt, in the time of its turning three hundred and ſixty five times and a quarter. I think I can alſo account, mamma, for our not ſeeing the ſun always ſet at the ſame point of the horizon. Does it not ariſe from the difference in the length of our days and nights, and the inclination of the earth's axis?</p>

                        <p>This faint light<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> viſible in our atmoſphere after ſunſet, particularly in the Weſt, and which we call twilight, is occaſioned partly by the refraction and reflection of the rays of the ſun in our atmoſphere. By atmoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere is meant the air we breathe, that which ſurrounds us on all ſides. In this atmoſphere the ſun's rays are ſo refract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, (that is, broken and diſperſed) as to afford us that equal light which we call twilight, till the ſun has ſunk eighteen degrees below the horizon.</p>
                        <p>The ſun has alſo an atmoſphere: His rays, reflected upon this, produce what is called <hi>zodiacal light,</hi> which ſometimes appears, but particularly towards even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſpring, and in autumn towards the morning. The duration of twilight is generally about two hours. About the firſt of March and eleventh of Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:036274_0149_10086A5E8E7460E0"/>
our twilights are the ſhorteſt; when the ſun does not deſcend eighteen de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees below the horizon, the twilight laſts all night. This is the reaſon that, at the time of the ſummer ſolſtice, we have ſcarcely any night; and that there is not any in the more northern parts of Europe, though the ſun is below the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon.</p>

                        <p>Should you like it to be dark night immediately as the ſun is ſet? If we had no twilight or atmoſphere to reflect the ſun's rays, this muſt be the caſe. Numerous are the advantages we derive from twilight. A ſudden change from light to darkneſs might be hurtful to our eyes. Surpriſed by ſudden night, many travellers would loſe their way, and moſt birds would be in danger of periſhing. The wiſe Author of nature has prevented all theſe inconveniences, as by means of twilight we paſs gently and gradually from day to night. But

                     <p>AT their return to the cottage, Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ame de St. Claire was ſurpriſed to ſee ſtanding before the gate ſeven or eight poor villagers, whoſe dreſs and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance beſpoke want and miſery. The young peaſant, ſervant to de Livré, was portioning to each an equal ſhare of milk and vegetables. "Theſe are ſome of my good neighbors," ſaid the old man, "whom I have ſought out as proper ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects on whom to beſtow the ſurplus of your bounty to me, dear Madam; I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve they are truly deſerving. I viſit them ſometimes, and have ſeen nothing
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:036274_0159_10086A756344C730"/>
as yet, in their conduct or families, to alter my opinion; and, ah! Madam, if the happineſs you have reſtored to me can be increaſed, it is in thoſe moments when I receive their bleſſing. They come up every evening, and we contrive always to have ſome little proviſion for them. The vegetables are all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce of my grandſon's garden, the labor of his leiſure hours; and I believe, were the queſtion put to him, he could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine which he has the moſt pleaſure in, rearing them for me or them. I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct their children as often as they will ſend them to me, in which taſk Joſeph alſo aſſiſts me; and I find him a gainer always by their leſſons. Thus I endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or to make myſelf uſeful in that ſtation in which it has pleaſed Providence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place me." "Worthy man!" exclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Madame, "how well do you deſerve the gifts of fortune! You muſt intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce me to ſome of your neighbors to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>morrow." The children begged they might be permitted to accompany them.
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:036274_0160_10086A77E9D79FC8"/>
They aroſe at five in the morning, to get their leſſons, and write their exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes; and when Madame came down to breakfaſt, they were all ready to repeat them, although their excurſions were not to commence till the evening; which proving a fine one, they prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red walking. Monſieur de Livré was delighted with their obſervations by the way, and not leſs ſo with their behavior in every cottage they entered. Each added ſomething to what their good mother gave to the poor inhabitants. They had proceeded part of their way to the habitation of de Livré, when they diſtinguiſhed the ſounds of voices, and finding they iſſued from a dwelling to the left, reſolved thither to direct their ſteps. They were here welcomed by an old woman, whom de Livré had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly viſited; "You ſeem very joyful this evening, dame," ſaid he. "Oh! ſir, we have reaſon; let me preſent to you my boy, my dear boy. Our ſon, whom we thought dead, this morning arrived
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:036274_0161_10086A7B0F50B338"/>
from the Weſt-Indies. It was joy enough to ſee him well! but he ſays, we ſhall have no need to work any long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; his ſervices and valor in a late en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement are rewarded with a penſion for life." "I rejoice, young man," ſaid de Livré, "at your happy fortune, and more that you have the goodneſs of heart to ſhare it with thoſe who merit all your attention, and over whoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining years your filial piety will throw the ſunſhine of renovated felicity." "Oh! ſir," exclaimed the enraptured father, "he was always a dutiful child, ſo attentive to us in all our troubles and our ſickneſſes, and now Heaven has rewarded him; but, good ſir, will you not take ſome refreſhment with us? You who have ſo often viſited and conſoled us, by your pious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, when we thought this our dear ſon was no more: Do not refuſe now to ſhare our joy at his return." "No, my friends, believe me I partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate in all your tranſports; and if agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:036274_0162_100839A2A86E28A0"/>
to Madame de St. Claire, we will paſs an hour or two with you." "<hi>Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ame de St. Claire!</hi>" exclaimed the young man, "may I aſk if this lady is related to the Monſieur de St. Claire, whom I left at St. Vincent's, and who is a native of Paris, and left England about two years ſince in the Neptune?" "The ſame," replied Madame, I am wife to that worthy man; theſe are his beloved children; but tell me, how was he when you left him?" "Perfectly well," an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the young ſeaman, "and he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioned me to forward this letter to you; but the veſſel in which he was, being ſuddenly put under ſail, he gave me the letter, but forgot to direct it. I deſigned, immediately on my return to France, to make enquiry for your place of reſidence; but the joy of meeting again my dear parents, pardon me, Madam, had almoſt made me forget the charge I was entruſted with." Saying this, he gave the packet to Madame. It contained the moſt ſatisfactory intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:036274_0163_10086A7D5DA1BD38"/>
that in a few months Monſieur de St. Claire hoped the buſineſs which had kept him ſo long from his dear family would be completed. What joyful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation for the beſt of mothers, and her darling children! "Papa, our dear papa, will ſoon again be with us; in a few months, we ſhall ſee him!" was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated almoſt every moment for ſome hours after. In the midſt of the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal joy which prevailed throughout the happy party, de Livré could not help obſerving a dejection which from time to time ſtole over the ſailor's counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and a ſigh which now and then burſt from his boſom, notwithſtanding all his efforts to ſuppreſs it; the good man, taking him by the hand, thus tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly addreſſed him, "The pleaſures of the preſent moment, I fear my friend, are not ſo perfect as we could wiſh them; can I any way contribute to your felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty—ſpeak, tell me what I can do?" "Oh, ſir," replied the young man, "this goodneſs is too much. You knew me
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:036274_0164_10086A7EE0671EC8"/>
before I went abroad, you were inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of my attachment to Louiſa, and my father's diſpleaſure at it, becauſe ſhe was poor. Six years abſence has not leſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my affection; I am now rich, and able to ſupport her as ſhe deſerves. Would you, ſir, take upon you to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede with my father. But perhaps, thinking me dead ſhe is married to another, and <hi>ſhould</hi> I obtain <hi>his</hi> conſent, ſhe never can be mine!" "Be not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy," replied de Livré, "ſhe is not mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, I ſaw her a few days ſince. I will ſpeak to your father. You will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe me any favor to day, good Dupont; I am going to fetch Louiſa, and you muſt give the young people your bleſſing." "With all my heart," replied the cotta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, "I had always an affection for the dear girl; but when we could ſcarcely ſupport ourſelves, it would have been cruel to have ſuffered her to become a ſharer in our poverty. Beſides, we knew that, ſince her poor father's death, ſhe has experienced but too much of it at home."
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:036274_0165_10086A824E572098"/>
De Livré then went out to fetch Louiſa, who lived within a few doors of the cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, but it was agreed that young Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pont ſhould conceal himſelf in an adjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing apartment, leſt the ſurpriſe ſhould be more than ſhe could ſupport. In a few minutes he returned with his fair charge. "You muſt partake the general joy of this humble dwelling," he exclaimed, addreſſing her; "our good friend Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pont has received ſome agreeable news to day. His ſon, whom he ſuppoſed no more has been heard of; he was well a few weeks ſince." "Oh! does he live then?" feebly exclaimed Louiſa, half fainting in the arms of Madame de St. Claire: "No—no, he does not live for me." Then, as if aſhamed of the emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhe had involuntarily betrayed, ſhe made an effort to diſengage herſelf. "Permit me, Madam, to retire; my mind has been a little deranged of late, I know not ſometimes what I ſay." "You muſt not leave us," ſaid this ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able woman, "I have heard your ſtory;
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:036274_0166_10086A84C81759A0"/>
in our walks the other day we ſaw you at a diſtance, I enquired of Monſieur de Livré who you were, and from him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the melancholy account of your ſorrows, which now are at an end. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pont is returned, he is <hi>yours,</hi> we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived for him a parent's approbation of his choice." Dupont, no longer able to contain his tranſports, ruſhed from the inner room, exclaiming, "He lives in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and lives for you, Louiſa!" "Ah! Dupont," cried the affectionate girl, burſting into tears, "I have mourned long for you. The miſerable days and nights that I have paſſed!—and when I heard you were dead, a fever ſeized my brain, my mind I fear is hurt—but all will now be well—I will forget it—'tis paſt—I will throw off this ſable dreſs, and we will once more welcome <hi>happineſs.</hi> I thought of late it was a phantom—but, no no—I was miſtaken, it is <hi>Dupont.</hi>" "Poor girl," whiſpered Madame de St. Claire, "this ſcene is almoſt too much for her reaſon, diſordered as it has been by a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries

                     <p>TO vary their pleaſures as they returned, de Livré propoſed conducting them to his habitation by a road they had never paſſed, and which commanded many beautiful views; now rendered more ſtriking by the varied tints of an autum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal

                        <p>Henry looked confuſed, and knew not what to anſwer.</p>
                        <p>I think the young gentleman is a little at a loſs, as well as the young lady, which in him is the leſs excuſable. Springs<note n="*" place="bottom">Sturm's Reflections.</note> are produced either by heavy ſnows, or the clouds which thoſe heights are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways covered with; and it is that which keeps up the courſe of great and ſmall rivers. I need not mention to you the utility of theſe. Beſides the advantages of ſprings and fountains, for which we are indebted to mountains, they have many others. Several kinds of animals, whoſe fleſh or ſkins are ſerviceable to us, find there a dwelling, and it is the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains that afford them ſuſtenance without our labor. On the ſides of mountains are found an infinite number of ſalutary
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:036274_0170_10086A8D2F0FF558"/>
herbs and roots, which cannot be culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated with equal ſucceſs in the plains, or have not the ſame virtues; minerals and metals are formed in the bowels of mountains, which would not propagate ſo well, in low and level countries, for want of neceſſary moiſture. By theſe we are alſo ſheltered from the bleak blaſts of the Northern and Eaſterly winds, and it is on them the moſt exquiſite vines are foſtered. Though ſome inconveniences may riſe from them, theſe ought not to make us overlook the various bleſſings they afford us.</p>
                        <p>Were there no mountains, there would be no rivers, no ſprings, no lakes, and the ſea itſelf would become a ſtagnated marſh. Would you rather be deprived of theſe, Emmiline, or bear with the few inconveniences produced by the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains?</p>

                        <p>The ſun had-been long ſunk below the horizon, before they reached the direct road to de Livré's abode; and from the adjacent meadows a thick dew began to ariſe. "Look, mamma," ſaid Clara, "what a thick fog is coming over thoſe fields, it was not ſo juſt now; whence does it proceed?"</p>
                        <p>"What you ſuppoſe to be fog," ſaid Monſieur de Livré, "is the riſing dew."</p>

                        <p>Dew is nothing more than the ſweat of the plants, and the moiſture they draw from the earth. It is eaſy to conceive how it is formed. The heat of the ſun's rays continually looſens a multitude of thin particles from off every thing; ſome of which riſe into the atmoſphere, and the reſt collect in the form of drops of water. Thus it
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:036274_0172_10086A9294379D08"/>
is, that the dew is ſometimes hurtful and ſometimes not; its nature depending on the quality of the vapors which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it. The lighter exhalations are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away by the wind as ſoon as form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which prevents them from falling in drops. This is the reaſon, that when the air is calm as it is this evening, there is moſt dew.</p>

                        <p>Right, my dear. The North wind comes armed with millions of frozen particles of air to precipitate, diſperſe, or condenſe, the malignant and unwholeſome vapors of autumn; laſtly, the ſharp edge of the North wind is tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en of by that genial warmth which the South wind diffuſes through the air, kindling freſh life and vigor in every part of nature. Theſe perpetual viciſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes ſerve to vary the diſpoſitions and productions of the earth; they correct or prevent thoſe ill conſequences which would reſult from any one fixed and permanent ſtate of things, and purify the air, by keeping it in conſtant motion. Without the aſſiſtance of winds we ſhould be poiſoned in our houſes, and
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:036274_0174_10086A976A9440D8"/>
Paris and London would be in a little time no better than two great ſinks of corruption.</p>

                        <p>Henry looked aſhamed, and walked ſilently on, till they arrived at the ſolita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry abode. The villagers had received their daily allowance, and the little peaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant had prepared the rural ſupper, which

conſiſted of all the fineſt produce of the garden, and a brace of partridges, which the grandſon of de Livré had ſhot in the morning. As a recompence for their good behavior, the children were that night permitted to ſit up an hour longer than uſual, and to partake of what the table afforded. Each ate of the partridges except Emmiline. "Why do you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe, my love?" ſaid her mother, as it was offered her.</p>
                        <p>"Becauſe, mamma, I ſaw ſome little birds in the orchard this morning, and I fear theſe are the ſame. Joſeph ſaid he would ſhoot them.

                        <p>Clara, I am concerned to obſerve, has a fretfulneſs of diſpoſition, which, if not corrected, will be a contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual ſource of uneaſineſs to herſelf, and will increaſe as ſhe grows older. When every thing meets her wiſhes, ſhe is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable and good humored; but her temper cannot bear diſappointment, or the leaſt oppoſition to her will. The leaſt trifle diſcompoſes her, as the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent moment may evince. You ſee her ſullen and in tears, becauſe ſhe cannot go out.

reſource to fill up her time, though the education ſhe has received might afford her many. It is not only herſelf that ſhe renders uncomfortable by theſe hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, but others who have the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to be in her company. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, when Monſieur de Livré returns from his walk, will he not conclude that ſhe is tired of the viſit, and diſſatisfied, although he has done ſo much to make it agreeable to us all. Indeed, this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>havior muſt have to him the appearance of diſreſpect and ingratitude.</p>

Clara, anxious to regain he mother's good opinion, was very aſſiduous in learning her leſſons; and, indeed, her brother and ſiſter were not leſs attentive.

                     <p>HENRY and Joſeph ſet out on their little excurſion. They had not proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more than a mile and a half, before, on the top of a hill, they met a young waggoner who ſtopped to reſt his horſes. "Are you not very tired?" ſaid Henry to him; "it has been a ſad wet day for you, and you ſeem to have walked a long way." "Only twenty miles, ſir, that is
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:036274_0187_10086AC90E633A40"/>
not ſo very far; but the roads are dir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which helps to tire one."</p>

                        <speaker>HENRY.</speaker>
                        <p>But why do you walk at all at the ſide of a waggon? If I were you I would chooſe ſome other employment.</p>

                        <p>And what could I fix on bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? My maſter pays me regularly, I am ſtrong and hearty, and he is always ſatisfied with my diligence. It is true, I am a little fatigued ſometimes in the hot days of ſummer; but in the evening, when I receive my wages, and purchaſe with them neceſſaries for my poor moth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, I no longer feel tired; I make her a fire, fetch her milk and boil it; and then I think not of the miles I have travelled on foot, but what I can do to make her comfortable.</p>

                        <p>Alas! no. She had a terrible fall in the hard froſt laſt winter, and has been ſo lame ever ſince as ſcarcely to be able to move from her chair. My little ſiſter is very good; ſhe does what ſhe
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:036274_0188_10086AB635AA0D68"/>
can for her; but ſhe is only ſeven years old, and mother will not truſt her to make a fire. But young gentlemen, my horſes have had reſt enough, and we muſt be getting homeward.</p>

                        <p>Ah! no, ſir, he died when I was very young; he was an honeſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious man; mother tells me every day how hard he uſed to work to ſupport us. I wiſh I had known more of him; I remember as I uſed to ſet on my little ſtool beſide him, when he returned in the evening from the fields, and we made a circle around the cheerful hearth, that he would take my hand between his, bidding me be a good boy, and then I ſhould never want a friend.</p>

                        <p>I fear ſhe would doubt my word. I have travelled the ſame road daily more than two years, and never till this evening met with any one who thought me worth notice. I remember one day, more than a twelvemonth ago it is, as I was leading my horſes down this hill in a very froſty ſeaſon, being ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:036274_0190_1008399FDF595848"/>
overtaken by two gentlemen in a curricle, I endeavored to turn out of the way a little for them, for they were driving at a furious rate, when my foot ſlipped, and I fell upon a large piece of ice. Unable to riſe for ſome minutes, being ſtunned with the fall, they ſwore dreadfully at me, whipt the horſes, and ſet them off full ſpeed, leaving me in that ſenſeleſs ſituation.</p>

                        <p>Indeed you are too good, to think of ſuch a poor boy. But if you are determined to ſeek out our lonely hut, you muſt give to her that bounty you intended for me; I have health and can bear fatigue; but I often think ſhe ſtands in need of more than I can earn by my hardeſt labor; and the charity for which I thank you would be well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed.</p>
                        <p>

Saying this, the lad wiſhed them a good night, and proceeded to the valley. Henry and Joſeph haſtened to complete the commiſſion they were intruſted with by Monſieur de Livré, reſolving to viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it the young waggoner and his mother that evening; and ſoon after ſunſet they found themſelves in the direct road to their dwelling. As they approached it, Henry exclaimed, "Mamma, I think—I hope, will not be diſpleaſed with us for lengthening our walk. If we make haſte, we ſhall get back before it is quite dark."</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>JOSEPH.</speaker>
                        <p>Since the motive of our viſit is to be of ſervice if we can, I am ſure neither Madame de St. Claire, nor Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur de Livré, will be diſpleaſed with us.</p>
                        <p>But do you ſee that hovel yonder? That muſt be their dwelling, from the boy's deſcription.</p>
                        <p>It was ſo. The door half open pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to them the moſt pleaſing ſcene of rural felicity. They ſaw the young waggoner in a corner of the chimney
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:036274_0192_10086ABFD3ECA988"/>
breaking ſome faggots; the girl his ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was adding one of them to the little pile, and as they entered they heard her exclaim, "Look, Billy, what a nice blaze I have made! Mamma's milk will ſoon boil now!" In an old wicker arm chair on the oppoſite ſide ſat the good matron; ſhe had been knitting, but her thoughts ſeemed then wholly engroſſed with theſe affectionate children, for it was thrown careleſsly on a bench beſide her. "Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, good woman, this intruſion," cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Joſeph, "we met your ſon in our walk this evening, who refuſed a trifle to procure him ſome refreſhment, which he ſtood ſo much in need of; and we thought, that if we viſited him in your preſence he could not heſitate to accept it." (Putting the money into his hand.)</p>

                        <p>Oh! my dear mother, ſince theſe generous young gentlemen <hi>will</hi> have it ſo, accept their preſent.</p>
                        <p>"No," interrupted Henry, "this is for yourſelf only." Then approaching the cottager, "Your ſon has informed
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:036274_0193_10086AC155D8D1B8"/>
us of your lameneſs; for his ſake receive this purſe, and get advice for it. You muſt, you muſt indeed oblige us."</p>
                        <p>The good woman, aſtoniſhed, looked firſt at the children, then at the purſe, and at length exclaimed, "Is it poſſible, there can be ſuch generoſity in youth? Amiable children! Receive our ſincereſt thanks, but take again your bounty; it is a ſum too conſiderable to be given unknown to your parents, if you have any; and I hope you have, for ſure you muſt be their <hi>greateſt bleſſing.</hi> Thank Heaven, my lameneſs is ſomething bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the induſtry of Billy and Peggy furniſhes me with all I want."—It was in vain Henry and Joſeph urged her to accept the purſe; ſhe would not hear of it.</p>
                        <p>Night came on, and they were oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to take leave of the honeſt family; but before their departure, Henry, as he kiſſed the little girl, ſlily ſlipped the purſe into her boſom: And was out of ſight in a moment. They arrived at
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:036274_0194_10086AC2DD5A5010"/>
the cottage juſt as de Livré and Madame were ſitting down to ſupper. The hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of the young waggoner furniſhed matter of converſation till bedtime; but Henry did not mention having left the purſe, for whatever he gave was not from motives of oſtentation, but real be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence.</p>

                        <p>Clara and Emmiline were ſo induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous that by the afternoon the frock was completed. They then ſet out for the valley, accompanied by Madame de St. Claire and de Livré.

Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ame converſed with the good woman reſpecting her lameneſs, and promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſend her a ſtrengthening plaiſter, of which ſhe knew the efficacy. No ſooner did the worthy cottager under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that the perſons with whom ſhe was converſing ſo familiarly, were the parents of thoſe generous children who had viſited her ſon the preceding even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, than ſhe attempted to return the purſe. Monſieur de Livré received it; but it was only that he might add ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to Henry's bounty. "It is yours," ſaid Madame, returning it after having (as ſhe imagined) unperceived ſlipped in a
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:036274_0198_10086ACCD89DF4C8"/>
ſmall piece of paper. "You have an hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and induſtrious ſon. Accept this for <hi>him</hi>—for your <hi>daughter,</hi> if you will not for yourſelf." Obſerving the paper to be a bank note, "Oh heavens!" cried the poor woman, "this for my chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren?" Then, while the tears of heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felt gratitude bedewed her venerable cheeks, ſhe thus continued: "May the hand of Providence ſhower on you its <hi>choiceſt bleſſings;</hi> may you experience ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery pleaſure, every comfort! Would you could form ſome idea of that you have this day given to a widow's heart! My children, honeſt, amiable, induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but ignorant, will now receive the advantages of education: Your gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity has enabled me to procure it for them, and made me the happieſt of mothers."</p>
                        <p>During this ſcene, Emmiline and her ſiſter had retired to a corner of the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and were buſily employed in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on the frock they had made. The little girl, who had never ſeen herſelf ſo
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:036274_0199_10086AD04E09EEE0"/>
nicely dreſſed before, had ſcarcely pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience till the laſt ſtring could be tied, when running up to her mother. "Look! look! mamma, what a fine frock! and theſe ladies ſay I am to keep it; they have made it for me. Oh!

                        <p>The ſun was ſetting as they returned, and the young people did not fail to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mind their friend of the pleaſures of the mount. "What a charming evening," they exclaimed, "will this be, for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of the ſtars!"</p>

"Alſo for the moon," replied de Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vré, "whoſe nature and revolutions you have promiſed us ſome account of. It is at the full this evening, and you will be greatly pleaſed with its appearance through the teleſcope."</p>

be ſeas, but now are found to be only darker places of the land, for we ſee they are full of pits and valleys; but if they were ſeas, they would have even and ſmooth ſurfaces. Dr. Herſchel has diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered volcanos or burning mountains in the moon. Three of theſe he obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in different places of the dark parts of the planet; two of them appeared nearly extinguiſhed, or probably going to break out; the third was an actual eruption of fire or luminous matter; this obſervation was made on the 20th of April, 1787.</p>

likewiſe obſerved to change their figure from round to oval, juſt before the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of an occultation behind the moon, which can be attributed to no other cauſe than that their light is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fracted by being ſeen through the moon's atmoſphere.</p>

                        <p>The moon is a round o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paque body, which borrows light as well as the other planets from the ſun. She is the ſatellite and inſeparable compan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion of the earth, and appears, from her nearneſs to us, to be the largeſt in the ſyſtem. Her diameter is two thouſand one hundred and eighty miles; her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from the earth two hundred and
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:036274_0203_10086AD9B49A81C8"/>
forty thouſand. She turns on her axis in twenty ſeven days ſeven hours and forty three minutes, and moves at the rate of two thouſand two hundred and ninety nine miles per hour.</p>
                        <p>Her periodical revolution of going round her orbit ſhe performs in twenty ſeven days ſeven hours and forty three minutes; her ſynodical, from the time of new moon to new moon, in twenty nine days twelve hours forty four min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utes and three ſeconds.</p>

                        <p>You ſpeak a little learnedly, my young friend. Pray, can you tell me what occaſions the difference between the ſynodical and periodical revolution?</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>HENRY.</speaker>
                        <p>I believe it is cauſed by the revolution of the earth round the ſun, and the apparent motion of the ſun in the ecliptic.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>DE LIVRE.</speaker>
                        <p>Yes, and thus it is that the moon takes up a longer time to paſs from one conjunction to the next,<note n="*" place="bottom">Adams on the Planets.</note> than to deſcribe the whole orbit; or the time
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:036274_0204_10086ADB368D4D30"/>
between one new moon and the next is longer than the moon's periodical revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution. If the ſun had no apparent mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the ecliptic, the moon would come up to it, or be in conjunction again after it had gone round in its orbit; but as the ſun moves forward in the ecliptic while the moon is going round, the moon muſt move a little more than once round before it can come even with the ſun, or be in conjunction. Do you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend this?</p>

                        <p>My brother has told us that the moon is round, but how hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens it then, that we ſometimes ſee her what we call three quarters old, and ſometimes no more than a thin bright creſcent?</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>HENRY.</speaker>
                        <p>I think I can account for this. As ſhe ſhines with light entirely borrowed from the ſun, and reflected by her ſurface, it follows that, according to the poſition of the beholder with reſpect to the illuminated part, he will ſee more
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:036274_0205_10086ADD840674E0"/>
or leſs of her reflected beams; for only one half of a globe can be enlightened at once; and the different appearances ſhe bears are called her phaſes; but Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur de Livré can no doubt explain it better to you.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>DE LIVRE.</speaker>
                        <p>When ſhe is in conjunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that is, between the ſun and us, her illuminated ſide is then all turned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, and her dark to the earth, conſequently ſhe is then inviſible. This is called new moon or conjunction. But when ſhe goes back towards the eaſt, and retires from under the ſun, a ſmall part of the illuminated ſide is viſible, and the horns of the creſcent are turned towards the eaſt. At the end of ſeven days, when ſhe has reached a quarter of her courſe round the earth, ſhe diſcovers more and more of the illuminated ſide, till ſhe ſhews us half of it. Her light part is then turned towards the ſun, and the dark part caſts no light on us. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly half the moon is then enlightened, and we call this the firſt quarter. At
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:036274_0206_10086AE0961DAAB8"/>
the end of ſeven days, reckoning from the firſt quarter, it is almoſt directly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to the ſun, and its whole enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened diſk preſents itſelf to us, riſing in the eaſt at the time the ſun ſets in the weſt, and we have then a full moon. The more ſhe goes forward, the more the dark ſide increaſes, till at laſt half the dark ſide is turned towards the earth, and conſequently half the light ſide. It has then the form of half circle, and is what we call the laſt quarter. Theſe different appearances are a demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that ſhe ſhines with reflected light; for did ſhe ſhine with her own, we ſhould always ſee her round like the ſun.</p>
                        <p>But it is late, the wind blows cool, and he had better return to the houſe.</p>

<pb n="69" facs="unknown:036274_0209_10086AE6FB09F7C8"/>
had then been conſidered as a fixed ſtar. Dr. Herſchel's attention was firſt engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſteadineſs of its light: This induced him to apply higher magnify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing powers to his teleſcope; with theſe he obſerved it change its place; he then concluded it was a comet; but in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time he determined that it was a plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, from its vicinity to the ecliptic; the direction of its motion being ſtationary in the time, and in ſuch circumſtances as correſpond with ſimilar appearances in the other planets. When the moon is abſent, it may be ſeen with the naked eye. It has two ſatellites, which were diſcovered by Dr. Herſchel on the 11th of January, 1787. Thus, my little friends, we can perceive no bounds to the univerſe<note n="*" place="bottom">Maclaurin.</note> The objects we common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly call great, vaniſh, when we contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate the vaſt body of the earth.

The old man welcomed them with tears of joy; Madame de St. Claire affectionately congratulated the happy couple, and when all were ſeated, under pretence of aſking his opinion on ſome improvements de Livré had made, ſhe took Dupont into an adjoining apartment, and putting into his hand a ſmall ſealed packet, thus addreſſed him: "You once, with a paper ſimilar to this in form, made me happy beyond deſcription.

                        <speaker>DE LIVRE.</speaker>
                        <p>No. It is perpendicular to the ecliptic or earth's orbit, and near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo to her own, being inclined only two degrees ten minutes to her orbit.

                        <p>When a comet arrives at a certain diſtance from the ſun, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halation ariſes from it, which is called the tail. The tail of the comet ſeen in the year one thouſand ſix hundred and eighty was of a prodigious ſize, extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the head to a diſtance ſcarcely inferior to that of the ſun from the earth. To give you an idea of the ſwiftneſs with which comets move, Mr. Brydone obſerved one at Palermo in July, 1770, which in 24 hours deſcribed an arch in the heavens upwards of fifty degrees in length, ſo that if it was far diſtant from the ſun, it muſt have moved at the rate of upwards of ſixty millions of miles in a day.</p>

It was with regret Madame de St. Claire and the children left the mount; which in all probability they would not have the pleaſure of reviſiting for a twelvemonth, the following morning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fixed on for their departure from the cottage.</p>

                     <p>BY ſix o'clock the carriage was at the gate, and de Livré once more took an affectionate leave of his good friends, who received his promiſe to undertake a journey to the Chateau the enſuing ſpring, if his health permitted; and the hope of ſeeing him in the courſe of a few months, in ſome meaſure ſoftened the pain of ſeparation. On the evening of the ſecond day after they had left the humble dwelling, they found themſelves again at the Chateau. In leſs than a fortnight after their return, Madame de
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:036274_0226_10086B0CEF9CC820"/>
St. Claire received a letter from a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant relation, who with his family was come to reſide in Switzerland; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſting her to favor them with her company for a few days: ſhe would willingly have excuſed herſelf, no place having in her eſtimation the pleaſures of home, nor any ſociety, in the abſence of Monſieur de St. Claire, the charms that her children's afforded; but hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no real apology to offer, ſhe accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the invitation, and the young people were delighted with the thoughts of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying her. They had never ſeen their couſins, and promiſed themſelves every gratification from the viſit. But the family of Monſieur Duvernie was very different from that of Madame de St. Claire. The children were ignorant and ungovernable, and the parents fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhly indulgent; unhappy if they were out of their ſight for a ſingle moment; although their preſence ſeemed to put every thing in diſorder wherever they were.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="87" facs="unknown:036274_0227_10086B10471F16F0"/>
The family conſiſted of two daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and a ſon. The eldeſt of the form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er was thirteen, and the ſecond eleven. The boy had juſt entered his twelfth year. They were handſome, but a pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exterior was all they had to boaſt of; for their minds were entirely unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and too often the regularity of their features was diſtorted by obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy or ill humor.</p>
                     <p>From the moment of Madame de St. Claire's arrival till bedtime, nothing was to be heard but the inſignificant prattle of theſe froward children. It was in vain their parents endeavored to rend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er them quiet; they paid not the leaſt attention to their commands. Madame Duvernie was ſurpriſed at the pleaſing manners and good behavior of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Madame de St. Claire. "What would I give to ſee mine as tractable!" ſaid ſhe, "they worry me to death. I have been endeavoring theſe two years to perſuade Monſieur Duvernie to have a governeſs and a tutor for them. He
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:036274_0228_10086B12C971D8C0"/>
ſays it is time enough. But I am ſure they are beyond my management. I am obliged to be quite angry, nay almoſt put myſelf in a paſſion, before I can get them to obey me in the leaſt trifle." "And I," replied Madame de St. Claire, "have never yet found cauſe to be real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpleaſed with mine, longer than half an hour in my life. I have taught them to conſider me as a friend, not as an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtere tyrannic parent. They conſult me on every occaſion, and I have the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of obſerving they do this with pleaſure, and of their own accord. To incur my anger, is regarded as the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt misfortune that can befall them. They are not faultleſs, but they are ſoon made ſenſible of their errors; and I hope their affection for me will in time enable them entirely to correct their fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings."</p>
                     <p>The converſation was here interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſudden entrance of the Miſs Duvernies, whom but a few minutes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their mother had ordered to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:036274_0229_10086B15179C5F60"/>
Clara and Emmiline to the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment allotted them. The eldeſt run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning up to her mamma, exclaimed, in a voice like thunder, "Mamma, will you ſpeak to Adelaide; ſhe has beat me ſo, becauſe I deſired her to make haſte and get to bed, for I did not like ſleeping in that great room at the top of the houſe. I cannot go up again, I am ſure I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not; I ſhall die with fright, I muſt ſtay here till you go to bed." "I will ſee whether you ſhall do that," ſaid the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, taking up a large horſewhip which ſtood in a corner of the room; "go up directly, or you ſhall feel the weight of this." It was by ſuch harſh methods alone that theſe children had been taught obedience. The young ladies, after giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing way to their paſſion in a flood of tears, left the parlor with as much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitation as they had entered it. Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ame de St. Claire, after their departure, could not forbear expreſſing her diſguſt at the ſcene ſhe had witneſſed, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavored to perſuade the miſtaken pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:036274_0230_10086B16984C1BA8"/>
to have recourſe to milder treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but they were not leſs obſtinate than the children, who had been ſpoiled by their improper indulgence. Over ſuch diſpoſitions, it was not likely that argument could avail much. After many fruitleſs attempts to convince them of the impropriety of their conduct, Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ame was obliged to leave them to their ignorance and the abſurdity of their opinions; reſolving to make her ſtay as ſhort as poſſible in a manſion, the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of whoſe inhabitants were ſo oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to every thing that was amiable. The following morning, after breakfaſt, Maſter Duvernie propoſed ſhewing his couſins all their curioſities, and for this purpoſe conducted them into a large play room, where, among other ſcenes of cruelty, was exhibited an owl tied by its leg to a table, and ſtruggling to get free; Henry no ſooner ſaw its diſtreſs, than he ran towards it, and was going to ſet it at liberty. Maſter Duvernie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, "Oh! do not untie it! If it
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:036274_0231_10086B18E480D558"/>
gets looſe, it will fly away." "Poor thing," cried Henry, "how can you take pleaſure in torturing it? You or I ſhould not like to be faſtened to a table all day long." "Pſhaw! what of that? We are not birds. Papa bought it for me to play with." "And do you not think it cruel to confine it, ſince even the meaneſt inſect is not leſs ſenſible of pain than we are?</p>

Papa is very good to us in this reſpect; we had once this room almoſt full of live crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but we forgot to feed them, and then they died. But come and look at our dormice. Are they not beautiful little creatures? Sometimes I put them into this little box, and keep them ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral days in my pocket, they will ſleep for weeks together, and this is very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable, for then one has not the plague of giving them any thing to eat.

Oh! we have ſuch fun with them, we make the puppies draw them about the court yard for an hour together, heavily loaded too with ſtones and whatever we can pick up, and if they dare to ſtand ſtill give them ſuch a cut with this whip—a pretty little whip! is it not?</p>

                        <p>Henry and Clara, diſguſted with their companions, propoſed a walk in the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, which was cheerfully agreed to; but here they were ſurpriſed at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order which ſeemed to reign around them. "Have you a good gardener?"
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:036274_0235_10086B23BB3DAE10"/>
ſaid Henry, "your garden is not kept ſo nice as mamma's." "Oh! a very good one, and three laborers beſides," replied Miſs Duvernie, "but papa is always making a racket about the garden; Robert will drive his puppies over the flower beds; it is a pity to be ſure, and coſts papa a great deal of money. Old Colin tells me very often, he is tired of endeavoring to keep it neat. And well he may, for my brother very often brings his rabbits and his pigs here to play with." Notwithſtanding the ſtate of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangement in which every thing appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the young people paſſed an hour or two very pleaſantly, and it was here Miſs Duvernie informed them that her brother expected ſome friends to paſs the afternoon with him. "I wiſh I could perſuade them to come into the garden, and play with us," ſhe cried, "but I know they will think themſelves above it. They hate to be conſidered as chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. They will do nothing but play at cards. Robert generally loſes, and he is

ſo often declared never ſhould be given away. How wretched this thought makes me; I, that uſed to fly with rapture to meet the moſt affectionate of mother's, now tremble at her approach.

You may have met with objects before this poor woman related her tale of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows. Their misfortunes might have been more pathetically told.

                           <p>My own imprudence. You left Benſon and me at cards, with a ſtrict injunction not to play for money; but ſcarcely had you left us, when he propoſed it, endeavoring to perſuade me, there could be no harm in it—at length I conſented—loſt all my little ſtock, and more, which Emily generouſly paid for me. Not content with this, we engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed again. My ſiſter was not preſent. Again I <hi>loſt,</hi> and to defray my debt, have parted with the purſe ſhe made for me.

How many have been render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed miſerable for life by this deteſtable character. Ought not a mother's heart to ach, when ſhe beholds the ſtrong pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſity of an only ſon to this horrid vice—of him—who has already played for money contrary to all her admonitions? (During this ſpeech, Charles falls upon his knees, and looks in the moſt ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating manner at Mrs. Valancour.) Can I, my ſon, have any further dependence on your word? Your diſobedience ſhocks me. Your imprudence has not only deprived you of my eſteem, but of the nobleſt pleaſure the human heart can enjoy—that of relieving from your own
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:036274_0257_10086B583119AFD8"/>
purſe the ſorrows of the diſtreſſed. You have alſo incurred the diſhonor of being in debt, both to your ſiſter and me. Thus, the love of play leads from one extremity to another, till poverty and ruin are the conſequence. At the age of ten years, you have, by not following my advice, made yourſelf a bankrupt. So early led into the paths of error, what may I in future expect from a conduct ſo reproachable? I ſhudder, left the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of years ſhould render it ſuch as even a mother cannot pardon. (Emily raiſing him.)</p>

                           <p>To teach your brother a leſſon, which I hope he will never forget.

<pb n="118" facs="unknown:036274_0258_10086B59B2F94548"/>
of this; but artleſs himſelf, I could not bring him to ſuſpect the little hypocrite. I obſerved, with inexpreſſible concern, the taſte which he had inſpired him with, for the moſt deteſtable of all vices. To cure him of this, I permitted him today to make choice of a playmate, almoſt aſſured Benſon would be the one he would like to invite. I gave them cards, and purpoſely left the room, that Charles might have an opportunity of diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the true character of his ſuppoſed friend, whoſe parents, I am ſorry to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, are people of the moſt diſſolute morals; who have taken no care to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct him, beyond the experteſt meth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od of cheating, or dividing a pack of cards. What is your opinion of Benſon now, Charles? Is that perſon our friend, whoſe counſels and opinions render us miſerable, and teach us to deviate from the paths of duty?</p>

                     <p>"WHAT a charming drama," ſaid Miſs Duvernie, "and how delightfully you have read it. I wiſh I could read as well as you do; but papa will not let us have a governeſs."</p>

                        <p>If there is any thing praiſe worthy in my conduct, I am indebted to my dear mamma for it. I fear I have given her a great deal of trouble, for till within theſe few months I was ſullen, haughty, and ill humored; and when we firſt came into Switzerland, I could find no pleaſure in any thing, I regretted the gaieties of Paris, and books were then my averſion.</p>

                        <speaker>CLARA.</speaker>
                        <p>It was my affection for the beſt of parents, that induced me to labor at improvement; I ſaw the uneaſineſs my conduct gave her, and her continual endeavors to make me happy; and ſince to be good was the only way I could contribute to her felicity, I reſolved to become ſo. She would frequently read aloud ſelect paſſages from the beſt authors, explain them to us, and make obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. This inſenſibly inſpired me with a taſte for that rational amuſement, which can render the deepeſt ſolitude agreeable.</p>

                        <p>Nor do we. We have a thouſand ways to procure amuſement. Muſic fills up no ſmall portion of our time, then work, riding on horſeback, our gardens, the greenhouſe, the hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes, theſe ever afford us a variety of entertainment.</p>

It is a ſenſation of delight; I cannot deſcribe it to you, but, were you to viſit with us the cottages of the poor, you would feel it; where to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the pains of the ſick and the wants of the indigent, unfolds at once the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret of happineſs, and ſhews that the moſt exalted pleaſures of humanity are centered in benevolence.</p>

                        <p>By this time, Henry and Maſter Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernie were returned from the ſtables. "So," cried the latter, "here you are, ladies, in the little arbor where we left you." "Yes," replied his ſiſter, "and I believe it would have been better for you, had you remained here too, we have been moſt delightfully entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed." "So it ſeems, or you would not have ſtaid here ſo long—I fancy you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get you have to dreſs for dinner." "In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I had not given it a thought," ſaid Miſs Duvernie; "but as it is ſo late, I ſuppoſe we muſt go in, and make our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as ſmart as we can for your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany this afternoon. Though, I confeſs, I had rather ſtay here and converſe with my couſins." The young people then proceeded to the houſe, which they had ſcarcely entered, before Miſs Duvernie
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:036274_0268_10086B72727F2790"/>
exclaimed, "You muſt come up with us, and ſee our wardrobe. We have ſuch beautiful things! Clara and Emmiline were ſurpriſed to obſerve the diſorder of their couſins' drawers, for here nothing ſeemed to be in its proper place, all was confuſion; and half an hour was ſpent in ſearching for the dreſſes they propoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to wear that day. Adelaide in miſtake had taken her ſiſter's necklace, and it was with difficulty Clara and Emmiline could prevent a ſerious quarrel on the ſubject. In conſequence of this diſpute, the din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner bell had rung before they were half ready to go down. And when the buſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ineſs of the toilet was entirely complet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed they dreaded to meet the angry eye of Monſieur Duvernie, aſſured that their negligence would excite his diſpleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure. It did ſo, and when the ſervants were withdrawn, their failings were enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merated with increaſing ſeverity, and little elſe was ſpoken of the remainder of the day. Clara and Emmiline, much as they were diſguſted with the conduct of
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:036274_0269_10086B74C1622040"/>
their couſins, pitied them on the preſent occaſion, and did all in their power to reſtore that domeſtic harmony, which their incautious behavior had interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. At a late hour, wearied with the numberleſs diſagreeables of the day, they retired to reſt, when Clara thus addreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her ſiſter: "How thankful ought we to be, my dear Emmiline, for the bleſſings we poſſeſs in the beſt of parents; had our mother reſembled Madame Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernie, we ſhould have been as miſerable as Julia and Adelaide!"</p>

                        <p>One clear wintry morning, the ſpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Juliana ran to her brother as ſoon as ſhe was dreſſed, rejoicing that the ſnow was all melted, and that ſhe ſhould ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain permiſſion of her mamma to take a long walk. The requeſt was no ſooner made, than granted by their indulgent parent, and they ſet out; but had not walked more than two or three miles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:036274_0271_10086B78905D6848"/>
Juliana, finding herſelf fatigued, was perſuaded by her brother to enter a ſmall habitation which they obſerved to the left at a little diſtance from the road. It was thatched, but in many places the tempeſt had torn away the ſtubble, and left the roof expoſed to all the inclemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the ſeaſon; not a window remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed entire. "What a dwelling!" ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed little George, as he rapped ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the door! "oh! you, whoever you are, who inhabit this cottage, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit two children, worn out with fatigue, to reſt here a little while," Saying this, he rapped again, but nobody anſwered. The door was o'jar, and ſeemed to invite the young travellers to enter; but what a ſcene of miſery there preſented itſelf to their eyes! A beautiful girl on her knees, at the ſide of a bed of ſtraw, on which lay a young child, apparently not more than ſix years of age, groaning with anguiſh; while the girl, raiſing her eyes filled with tears, and her hands to Heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, exclaimed, with all the fervency of
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:036274_0272_10086B7BA60A1920"/>
heartfelt prayer, "Oh! Almighty God, merciful Father of the orphan, preſerve, I beſeech Thee, this child—preſerve my brother!"</p>
                        <p>She ſtopped. The preſence of the ſtrangers prevented her continuing. The tender heart of Juliana was already affected, and taking the hand of the poor girl, ſhe ſaid, with a voice interrupted by ſighs, "Be comforted, your little brother will ſoon be well again." The girl ſhook her head, and looked on him as if every ray of hope had been long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed. "But what is the matter with him?" continued Juliana, approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the bed, "What is his diſorder? why does he lie upon ſtraw? and why are his clothes ſo ragged? Poor baby! He has not even a nightcap; and the high wind blows ſo keen through the crevices in the wall, that when it is bad weather, the rain, I am ſure, muſt fall upon his head."</p>
                        <p>"Oh! my dear Miſs!" replied the unfortunate girl, "you are yet young,
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:036274_0273_10086B7DEFCCBD78"/>
and unacquainted with ſuffering and ſorrows. You aſk, why we lie upon ſtraw? why we are covered with rags? Know then, that we are poor! We are orphans! It is now ſix months ſince we loſt our dear parents by a malignant fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. During their life we had ſufficient for our ſupport, for they were very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious. My father had a ſmall purſe almoſt filled with money, which he had earned by his labors; and he uſed often to ſay it was for his dear children, but when he was ill, the phyſician came al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every day, and I obſerved his viſits made alſo to my dear mother were paid from this; ſo that at the death of my dear parents, which happened ſhortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, there was only enough left to defray their funeral expences, and ſupport my brother for ſome weeks in an illneſs which has continued ſince the meaſles. But it is now all gone. Four days ſince, I bought with our laſt ſixpence a little loaf for him. Alas! my dear brother!—He will die—for I have not the means
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:036274_0274_10086B7F70FBF678"/>
to preſerve his life. I cannot labor in the fields at this ſeaſon of the year to earn any thing, to procure him the moſt tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling nouriſhment, and he muſt periſh with hunger." In pronouncing theſe words, ſhe threw herſelf upon the child, who embraced her with tranſport, and ſaid in a feeble voice, "Do not be unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, my dear ſiſter. When I ſee <hi>you</hi> cry—it makes me ſuffer more."</p>
                        <p>"Amiable boy!" exclaimed George, (advancing towards the bed) "you ſhall have my hat to defend your head from the wind, which blows in on this ſide. Though a fine morning, it is rather cold. I will leave you alſo my ſpencer. There—I will lay it over your feet to keep them warm." "And I," interrupted Juliana, "will make you a pillow of my muff." "Dear generous children," ſaid the poor Madelon, "is it poſſible you can commiſerate thus our misfortunes? On my knees I thank you for all this good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. It is too much. You muſt not leave with us your—" "My hat,"

I have others at home, and ſhould I be a little cold as we return, I ſhall only expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience for one hour, what you and your brother have felt for days, weeks, and months.

"How I pity you, good girl!" ſaid Juliana, "though I know not what it is to be poor; but it makes me cry to ſee you without fire, and almoſt naked, in this wretched hov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el. I had no idea there were ſuch miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able beings in the world." "There are but too many in ſimilar ſituations I fear," replied the dejected Madelon. "And does nobody ſeek them out," cried George; "I am ſure if I had known yeſterday you were ſtarving with cold and hunger, I could not have ſat peaceably at table, or enjoyed our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable fire ſide."

She will permit us, I am ſure, to return and bring you all you are in want of, and medicines for the dear boy, that I hope will entirely recover him."</p>
                        <p>Juliana at this moment forgot that their houſe was more than three miles off; for in taking leave of the cottagers, ſhe promiſed to return in a quarter of an hour. But more than three quarters had elapſed before they found themſelves at home, and in their mamma's preſence, who was ſurpriſed to ſee her ſon with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his hat and ſpencer; but this was ſoon explained by the intereſting hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Orphan Cottagers. "Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace me, my dear children," ſaid this affectionate mother, while the tears of compaſſion ſtole down her maternal cheek; "what pleaſure it gives me to ſee you can feel for thoſe misfortunes, which before this day you could not have formed to yourſelves the ſmalleſt idea of!" "And are you willing, mamma," they demanded, "that we ſhould return to the cottage?" "You can then,"

ſhe replied, "relinquiſh without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret the pleaſures of the ball, to which you are engaged this evening? You know that today is the birthday of your little friend Eliza, who, perhaps, would think you unpolite, were you to diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point her of your company."</p>
                        <p>The children looked ſeriouſly at each other. "Oh! we had forgot the ball!" "But," continued Juliana, "if I go, my dear mamma, to Eliza's, I ſhall think all the time I am there of the troubles and the ſufferings of theſe poor orphans. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, I cannot go—for I promiſed to ſee them again in a quarter of an hour. Oh! indeed I cannot go to the ball. Send ſome apology, dear mamma, to my friend. I ſhall feel more pleaſure in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving the miſery of theſe poor chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; you can have no idea of their ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, or what I would not do to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it." "Nor I either," cried George; "let us return to ſupply them with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing that is neceſſary." "My dear children," ſhe replied, "it is not my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention

to deprive you of the nobleſt pleaſure the human heart is capable of enjoying. You need not prepare for the ball theſe two hours. In that inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, we can return to the cottagers. I will order the carriage, and accompany you. We will bring them with us. Here they ſhall be taken care of, and every thing adminiſtered that their wants require. What do you ſay to this, my little ones? Are you willing that theſe orphans ſhould ſhare with you the affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that mother who loves you ſo tenderly?" "Oh! yes, dear mamma," replied immediately Juliana, "let us fetch them—let us fetch them: They are good, and worthy your protection. If you had ſeen the affection of poor Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delon for her parents, how ſhe wept when ſhe ſpoke of them, and her tender anxiety for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

plaint all the while we were there. But here is the carriage. Oh! mamma, our dear mamma; you will alſo be a moth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to the Orphan Cottagers!"</p>
                        <p>"Thank you, thank you, dear mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma," exclaimed Emmiline, "what a charming ſtory! I am in love with the little Juliana, and the dear boy who left his hat and ſpencer with the poor chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. I will repeat their hiſtory to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa. How much have we to ſay to him! Our good friend de Livré too—how hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py he will be to know ſo worthy a man!"</p>
                        <p>It was late in the evening before the travellers arrived at the Chateau. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry heart palpitated with joy as they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached the gates, about which the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagers were aſſembled in crowds, and "Monſieur de St. Claire, our good maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, is returned!" was reechoed with bleſſings from an hundred voices.</p>
                        <p>The reunion of theſe amiable partners in conjugal felicity was a ſcene to which no pencil can do juſtice, no pen deſcribe

with ſufficient energy. Thoſe only who have known the pleaſure of meeting with all that is moſt dear to them, after a long and painful ſeparation, can form an idea of the happineſs of Madame de St. Claire and the joy of the Little Family.</p>
