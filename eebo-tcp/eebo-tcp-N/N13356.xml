            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE following Oration was delivered immediately after the Law for incorporating the <hi>Philosophical Society</hi> was passed by the General Assembly of <hi>Pennsylvania.</hi> It was composed at a short Notice; the Gentleman appointed to the annual Duty of Delivering an Oration before the Society, having declined it, in Consequence of his being nominated to an important Office, which required his immediate and very close Attention.</p>
            <p>PERFORMANCES of this Kind are sometimes altered and amended after they have been delivered, and perhaps it is justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable to do so; but to me it always appeared uncandid and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable. This, therefore, is published Word for Word as it was delivered, except only what follows from the Mention of Captain <hi>Biddle's</hi> Fall, Page 10, to the End of that Paragraph, which I found myself unable to pronounce: I could neither pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce it, nor get clear of the Idea for some Time. The Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of that Part will apologize for some Hesitation in one or two Paragraphs following it.</p>
            <p>To deliver an Oration which took up an Hour and ten Minutes, before as respectable an Audience as ever was collected within the same Compass in any Country, would not have been an easy Task even to one accustomed to speak in Public; and the polite and highly obliging Attention which was paid during the whole Time, alone, enabled me to go through it, unpractised in the Art of speaking as I am. It would be great Injustice to my own Feelings, if I neglected to acknowledge that kind Indulgence in the most grateful Terms.</p>

            <head>AN ORATION, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>IT is now but seven Years since the reverend and learned Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman<note n="*" place="bottom">The Rev. Doctor W. SMITH.</note> who first began the annual Duty of this Day, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered that copious, though concise Oration, which, with a masterly Hand, at once points out our Object and animates to the Pursuit.</p>
            <p>THE Year following the ingenious Doctor <hi>Rush</hi> gave a learned Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course upon the Diseases of <hi>American</hi> Natives, compared with the Diseases of <hi>Europe:</hi> A Discourse which will convey to future Times many use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Remarks, which the present Day alone could afford.</p>
            <p>IN the Year 1775 my worthy Friend Mr.<hi>Rittenhouse,</hi> an amíable Member of this Society, delivered an Oration on the Science of Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy. A Subject so copious and brilliant must have warmed and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated even the coldest Genius—must have inspired Sentiments and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections worthy of Attention; but in his Hands it appears truly great, majestic and sublime. Opening and unfolding the wonderful Scene, he bears us with him through the stary Heavens, and marks out the Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps of them all, as they dance in solemn Round through the Immen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of Space;—and, while the delightful Scene is before us,—while the Mind is impressed with a pleasing Astonishment,—is wondering at the beauteous Order of the glittering and stupendous Frame, calling our Attention to still higher Things, he points to the "thick Darkness" where HE dwells, whose awful Fiat spoke them into Being:—And, looking back, he says, <q>And all yonder Stars innumerable, with their
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:016867_0005_0F9EC078B85B71C8"/>
Dependencies, may perhaps compose but the Leaf of a Flower in the Creator's Garden!</q> Who can hear this—hear his Creator thus mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, and not feel a living Soul leap for Joy within him!</p>
            <p>THESE are some of the early Fruits of this Society: And thus it is, that fair Science, while her right Hand guides and supports Man through the World, her left always points toward Heaven.</p>
            <p>HE who reads the last mentioned Oration will be the wiser and the better for it; but he will no longer wonder that five Years have elapsed and not one Oration since delivered. 'Tis a humbling Consideration, that our Blessings have each their attendant Inconveniencies:—This, by excelling too far, has damped and discouraged where it ought to have roused and emulated.</p>
            <p>THE learned and ingenious Gentlemen of this Society, best qualified for this annual Task, have for various Reasons, or Pretences, declined the Duty; while I, in all Respects unequal to it, have ventured on the Attempt, as the most pointed Proof, that could possibly be given, of my full and firm Reliance on your Candour.</p>
            <p>I have but one Apology to offer:—It is an Act of Duty, not of Choice.—All cannot excel—it is impossible;—and I am content to stand a Foil to such distinguished Brightness—such uncommon Lustre.</p>
            <p>WHEN, a few Days ago, you appointed me to the Duty of this Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, entirely unprepared for the Discharge of it, I had not even thought of a Subject on which to speak; but, sitting down to consider of it, the Seals of the State lay before me: On the Face a Plow, a Sheaf of Wheat, and a Ship: On the Reverse, Liberty, represented by a Female Form, with a modest, but animated and determined Countenance,—in her right Hand a drawn Dagger,—her left Foot vigorously and firmly pressing to the Ground the horrid Head of Tyranny, represented by a huge, grim, furious Lion, exerting a last convulsive Effort to rise and devour her: The Motto, <hi>"Both can't survive."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:016867_0006_0F9EC0798B8D0BE8"/>
How just a Picture of the Contest between these United States and prostrate <hi>Britain,</hi> still haughty, desperate and furious in her Fall! How tempting a Theme for Declamation!</p>
            <p>BUT, to what Purpose shall it be pursued? Has not the youthful, blooming Genius of <hi>America</hi> roused her Sons to Arms? A brave well disciplined Army is already in the Field:—Men, whose Intrepidity in Battle does them Honor; but whose Firmness, Magnanimity and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severance, in contending with the Rigors of the Seasons, and unusual Hardships of War, have not been equaled by Mankind: To such Men as these it were Insult to offer a Motive beyond the Feelings of their own Hearts, and the Honors they have already earned, to excite them to do all that human Hands can perform. And Thousands of Citizens, fired by the great Example, stand ready to join with them when the Occasion shall require it. Our gallant Officers who have led them on, are, by Experience, become Masters in the Art of War. Foreigners of the first Distinction, led by a Love of Liberty, have left their native Country and united with us in the glorious Contest. <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>Impartial History will represent the Conduct of the Marquis <hi>De La Fayette,</hi> in joining our Army at the Time he did, as one of those Events which do the highest Honor to human Nature. While every Friend to Liberty, of all Countries, admired the patriotic Sentiments which distinguished that young Nobleman, his Conduct, Courage and Intrepidity endeared him to our great General and the whole Army.</p>
                  <p>The Baron <hi>De Stuben,</hi> the Father of Discipline in <hi>America,</hi> has rendered Services to these United States which it is not easy to describe. And however sensible we may be of their Importance, and of his steady Perseverance through the greatest Difficulties, it will not be in the Power of the present Age to make him a just Recompence: Posterity must remain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to him, and will undoubtedly do Justice to his Memory.</p>
                  <p>Highly sensible of the great Merit of many other Foreigners who have early joined us in this Contest, I should rejoice exceedingly in the Opportunity of doing them that Justice to which their great and faithful Services, have entitled them; but in the mean time there will not, I am confident, be found among them a Man who will feel himself hurt by the Justice done to these two great Examples,—which, to speak my Sentiments freely, shew more real disinterested Love of Liberty than is recorded in the Annals of any Time or Country.</p>
               </note> A kind protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Providence has sent us a great General, whose Heart is animated with the purest Flame that ever warmed a Patriot Breast. A wise and powerful King, inspired with Benevolence to Mankind, has made our
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:016867_0007_0F9EC07A37DF19C0"/>
Cause his own. The hardy Sons of <hi>America</hi> have dared to meet her Enemies on that Element which <hi>Britain</hi> once, proudly boasting, stiled "her own."—Alas! too boldly dared the unequal Combat: There the brave neglected <hi>Biddle,</hi> impelled by too much Virtue, nobly fell.—And, oh! forgive the falling Tear, which a fond Father's swelling Heart rolls reluctant down his Cheek at the Remembrance. I mourn a darling Son, once the fond Hope and Comfort of my Heart—That dreadful fatal Blast, which rent the <hi>Randolph</hi> to Splinters, scattered his mangled Limbs in the Air—and they fell, blacked and disfigured, a Prey to the Fishes of the Sea.—I mourn his Loss, but would preserve his Name,—Beloved by all that knew him, esteemed and highly honored by his brave Captain, <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>He was a Midshipman on Board that Ship, and on her Return from her first Craize at <hi>Charlestown,</hi> Captain <hi>Biddle</hi> distinguished him by presenting him with a very handsome Sword, as a Mark of his great Esteem and Affection. He was then but 17 Years of Age.</p>
               </note> he fell in the most glorious Cause—and, 'tis just to say, he lived and died unconquered, and from Infancy to that awful Hour the Voice of Fear or of Complaint was never heard from his Lips!—But, wherefore do I weep?—'Tis my Glory that I had such a Son to fall in such a Cause.</p>
            <p>LEAVING then this brighter Theme, I had still before me <hi>Agriculture,</hi> and its Attendant, <hi>Commerce.</hi> Here my Education would have led me to prefer Commerce—that mighty Chain which girds the Globe and unites all Mankind in one common Interest:—Each bestowing and receiving equal Benefits—the peculiar Produce of every Quarter of the World is handed to all its Inhabitants.</p>
            <p>BUT, reflecting that the Support of the brave Army now fighting our Battles for us, and that Commerce which will one Day raise this State to high Importance, both depend on Agriculture, it claims a first Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration among the Arts. <hi>Cowley</hi> thought justly when he said, <q>The Plow, in a Field arable, is the most honorable Escutcheon.</q> And I beg your Pardon for the Boast, that my Ancestors, some of whom in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited this Country more than a Century ago, were all of them Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:016867_0008_0F9EC07DF453A140"/>
IT will, I suppose, be expected that something should be said of the Rise, Progress and Antiquity of Agriculture.</p>
            <p>To relate the Custom of the <hi>Chinese</hi> Emperors, from Time immemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial offering Sacrifices and Prayers to <hi>Chang-ti,</hi> their Idol, to obtain a plentiful Harvest; or to describe what are impiously called the divine Honors, paid, many Ages past, to <hi>Ceres</hi> Queen of <hi>Sicily</hi> for introducing Wheat into <hi>Europe,</hi> and parcelling out Fields to the Inhabitants of her Kingdom, would lead to melancholy Reflections on the Weakness and Folly of human Nature. And it would wear the Face of Ridicule seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously to enquire, whether <hi>Cicero</hi> derived his Name from the Honor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by his Ancestor, famous for raising of Peas, or from a Vetch said to be upon his Nose. But we have, on the present Occasion, the highest Authority and of the greatest Antiquity to refer to: I mean the sacred Writings. Agriculture was undoubtedly the first Employment in which Mankind were engaged. Indeed, so far as relates to this World, it was the main Design for which he was created: For it is a Remark, made by the inspired Penman, That, after the Creation of the Earth and of every Plant of the Field, "there was not a Man to till the Ground." And immediately after he was created and the Garden of <hi>Eden</hi> planted, <q>the LORD GOD took the Man, and put him into the Garden of <hi>Eden</hi> to dress it and to keep it.</q> From hence we may reasonably suppose, that his Knowledge of Agriculture was intuitive, perfect and complete; but what Portion of this Knowledge, immediately derived from the Deity, he retained after he was expelled from that happy Seat we are not informed. Certain it is, however, that <hi>Adam's</hi> two Sons took each a separate Part of this great Business—the Elder became <q>a Tiller of the Ground</q> and the Younger "a Keeper of Sheep." After the Flood <hi>Noah</hi> retained so much Knowledge, that <q>he began to be an Husbandman, and planted a Vineyard, and drank of the Wine, and was drunken.</q> There can be no Doubt, but that such Abuse of Knowledge, from whatever Source it might have been derived, must naturally tend to lessen, if not destroy it. The Event was such as ought to have been expected:—As Mankind degenerated their Knowledge in Agriculture declined; and, when they laid aside the Practice of it, they
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:016867_0009_0F9EC07F45102480"/>
became brutally savage. The whole History of Mankind is one conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued Proof of this Fact—and what is daily before our Eyes in the Conduct of the savage Tribes of <hi>America</hi> is a striking Example. On the others Hand, as Knowledge and Virtue have dawned upon various Nations, they have paid greater Attention to Agriculture: And it is a general Rule, which has a very few Exceptions in Favor of Trade and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, that in Proportion to the Attention which has been given to Agriculture and the Respect paid to Husbandmen, the Bands of Civil Society have been strengthened, the Arts have flourished and Nations have increased in solid Riches, Honor and real Happiness. When the Empire of <hi>Rome</hi> had risen to the Fulness of its Glory, and produced those great Men, whose Sentiments and Conduct remain to this Day as Lessons of Wisdom and Virtue, they held it infamous to neglect or despite Agriculture.—And it has been remarked, that <hi>Cato</hi> thought it real Praise to say that a Man was much addicted to Tillage. This Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was so generally adopted by the <hi>Romans</hi> of that Time, that the most honorable Patrician Families derived their Names from the Branches of Agriculture, which distinguished their Ancestors: Of which the best Historians give the clearest Testimony. And the present Age has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced still more honorable Testimonies in Favor of this Science.</p>
            <p>To shew that the wisest and best Men of our Day have given their Countenance to Agriculture, we need only say that <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>Sixteenth</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> the Friend of Mankind, the Father of his People, and the illustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Ally of these United States, cultivating the Fields which surround his imperial Palace, has held and guided the Plow with his own royal Hands. And so great has been the Improvement of this Science under that Prince and his immediate Predecessor, that I have the best Authority to say, it has within eighteen Years Past doubled the annual Produce of his Kingdom.</p>
            <p>GREAT Prince, it is not an empty Compliment, but solid Truth, that there is not a Gem in thy imperial Crown, but derives new Lustre from thy Wisdom—new Brilliancy from thy Benevolence! While those which once ornamented the Crown of thine Enemy, new-set by Folly have lost
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:016867_0010_0F9EC0805CF29178"/>
their Lustre—and the largest and most valued shaken from their Place by the convulsive Efforts of Pride and Madness, have fallen from his his foolish Head!</p>
            <p>THE Experiments made by <hi>Duhamel,</hi> while he held the important Post of Inspector General of the Marine of <hi>France,</hi> laid the Foundation for the Improvements in Husbandry lately made in <hi>England,</hi> and is a strong Proof what great Things may be done by persevering Genius; but those who expect to build a System of Agriculture upon those Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments, accurate as they are, have not well considered the Subject. We must build upon Experiments made in our own Climate, differing greatly from that of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>INDEED, our Circumstances differ so widely from those of the <hi>European</hi> World, that in some Cases it is clearly right to pursue a Conduct directly the Reverse of theirs: In old Countries, filled with People—overbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened with Inhabitants, it is their Interest to improve Lands to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most possible Perfection; on the contrary in new Countries, where there is Land in Abundance and but few People, we ought to make the most of our Labor.</p>
            <p>THE first Settlers of <hi>Pennsylvania,</hi> full of <hi>English</hi> Ideas of Farming, cleared little Patches of Land with infinite Labor, cutting up every Tree and Grub by the Root, until they broke their Hearts with the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor—and when they had done, new and fertile as the Lands then were, they hardly obtained themselves Bread. The Labor was <hi>Herculean:</hi> Many were discouraged, and Numbers actually returned to <hi>England.</hi> The poorer Settlers, urged by Necessity, ventured to sow and plant in Fields, from which the Timber was cut down and burned—and some hastily girdled the Trees and sowed their Grain, expecting but little Increase.</p>
            <p>BUT, the Lands being rich and the Surface light, produced better Crops than were expected, and much beyond the Proportion of Labor bestowed, when compared with those who thought themselves far better Farmers. The Practice soon became common and greatly facilitated the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:016867_0011_0F9EC080F41E9B08"/>
Settlement of the Country. And new Settlers on our Frontiers continue the Practice to this Day, as the best for them which can be devised.</p>
            <p>HAD the first Adventurers introduced the great Breed of <hi>Holland</hi> Cattle, it is probable they would all have perished. It was found difficult to preserve through Winter the better chosen hardy small Breed—Yet there is no Doubt the larger Breed is more profitable in well improved Grass Countries, where Beef is the Farmer's Object; and they are accordingly introduced into the Eastern States.</p>
            <p>THE Drill-Plow is the greatest Improvement lately made in Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry, and will beyond a Doubt be generally introduced among us in the plain Country to incredible Advantage.<note n="*" place="bottom">I am well aware that there will require some considerable Attention to this Plow, and the Manner of using it in these States, before it will, or ought to be introduced. To follow the Rules laid down by <hi>European</hi> Authors, will be destructive. Our Air is much drier than theirs, and therefore more Attention must be given to the Time when the Ground is plowed.</note> But the first Trials made in <hi>Pennsylvania,</hi> happening to be in a very dry Season, did not succeed—and the Drill-Plow was in great Danger of being condemned. For the same Year Wheat sowed in the old broad-cast Way produced good Crops every where.</p>
            <p>IT was soon discovered that Indian Corn, which had been neglected for some Time and then plowed in a dry Season, was injured; while that which had been duly attended, being plowed at the same Time, was greatly benefited. The latter had shot its Roots below the Reach of the Plow, while the former was turned out by it and perished for Want of Moisture.—This accounted for the Want of Success with the Drill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Plow, and further and more encouraging Trials were made. These Things are mentioned, to shew that in forming a System of Agriculture for these States we must depend on Experiments made in this Country.</p>
            <p>I shall now offer a few Observations on several Branches of Agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but it will not be expected, in a Discourse of this Kind, that so extensive a Subject should be fully treated of.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:016867_0012_0F9EC08504A20900"/>
BEFORE I enter upon this Part of the Subject, let me remind you of what deserves your serious Attention, and may require the Aid of the Legislature. A mischievous destructive Infect has seized upon and made dreadful Havoc among the Wheat<note n="*" place="bottom">This Insect has also seized upon the Indian Corn in some Parts of <hi>New-Jersey.</hi>
               </note> in several of the neighbouring States, and has threatened to invade <hi>Pennsylvania.</hi> Such an Enemy is more to be dreaded than a <hi>British</hi> Army and ought to be opposed before they get a Footing among us. A <hi>British</hi> Army may be repelled by Force—may be restrained by Retaliation; but if this Infect should once get Possession of our Fields, the Consequence may be dreadfully fatal. It may not be in our Power either to repel or to restrain them. It has been said, that by threshing the Wheat immediately after Harvest, the Egg of this Infect will not hatch in the Grain. If this be so, effectual Means should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised to have it done by every Body, every where—left the Neglect or Indolence of a few bring Calamity or Destruction upon all. But should early threshing be found ineffectual, Kilns may be erected to dry the Grain. A few Experiments with a Thermometer will point out the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Heat necessary to destroy the Infect and her Eggs—and those Experiments ought not to be delayed. There is Reason to hope that our Labor will not be lost—as few Enquiries have ever been diligently pursued which have not been blessed with some useful Discovery—some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times even threatened Calamities have produced the happiest Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences.</p>
            <p>THE severe late Frost last Spring, by destroying the Farmer's Hope in his Crop of Winter-Grain, terrified us with the dreadful Idea of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. But the Consequence was, that uncommon Industry and the greatest Exertions were used in sowing and planting Oats, Buckwheat and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian Corn. The Event afforded an Example of what Industry could do, convinced Thousands of Farmers of the real Value of those Summer-Grains, and produced a happy Abundance throughout the State.</p>
            <p>THE best Preventive against the Smut in Wheat was discovered by an Experiment which seemed to have no Relation to it:—A Ship Load of Wheat being sunk, was taken up after it was soaked with Salt Water 
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:016867_0013_0F9EC085E6298800"/>
and rendered unfit for making of Bread; upon Trial it grew very well, and the Cargo was bought by the Farmers and sowed in different Parts of the Kingdom.—At the following Harvest all the Wheat in <hi>England</hi> was smutty, except only the Produce of this Seed, which was all clean from Smuttiness. An important and unlooked for Discovery, which greatly encouraged persevering Enquiry.</p>
            <p>THE Time is fast advancing in which Manures will be of great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance—indeed they already are so in the older settled Counties. Hitherto little Enquiry has been made after Marles, or other native Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nures. The Husbandman has contented himself with the Use of Lime where it could be obtained, and he has supposed it was a Manure on all Lands in all Conditions; but this has been doubted with great Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Reason. A late Author has insisted, that Lime is a Manure only where there is a full Supply of Oils in the Land, and that it ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates by uniting with the Oil, and thereby rendering it capable of mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Water, and becoming the Food of Plants. This appears to be a great leading Point and worthy of being enquired into,—I therefore beg Leave to suggest an Experiment.</p>
            <p>FLAX is known to impoverish Lands more than other Plants do—probably by extracting a greater Quantity of Oil.<note n="*" place="bottom">The same Field will produce several Crops of Flax, one after another, in <hi>Ireland,</hi> where they pull it before the Seed is formed.</note> Upon Lands then which have been exhausted by Flax, lay a full Proportion of Lime only on one Part of the Field, and on the other Part of the same Field lay the same Proportion of Lime and with it the Flaxseed raised upon it, first bruising the Seed, but not extracting the Oil. 'Tis easy to form Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures of the Event in both Cases, but Experiment only can give us the Information we want.</p>
            <p>PUTREFACTION <note n="†" place="bottom">A dead Colt, which had lain until it was so far putrid as that the Hair would readily rub off, being drawn across a Grass Lot in the Month of May, to be buried in one Corner of the Field, produced so great an Effect on the Grass it passed over, for at least twenty Rods, that its Growth was very remarkable, and its Effects were so lasting that the Direction the Colt was drawn in remained plainly visible both in the Color and Strength of the Grass for three Years afterward.</note> produces wonderful Effects on Vegetation—The
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:016867_0014_0F9EC0878A8C41A0"/>
Roots of common Green Grass will penetrate the Earth six Feet deep where Animals have been buried at that Depth. Enquiries on this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject promise important Discoveries—and he who dedicates a few Days to this Purpose will deserve Honor.</p>
            <p>BUT to proceed on my Subject: Two Plow-Horses, harnessed, proper, support the Arms of the State. The Figure is just, and shews the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of her Councils concerning the Plow, that great Instrument of Blessings to Mankind, which, simple as it is, deserves our first Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration and every possible Attention of Genius to improve it. The Plow was sent by Heaven to mitigate the Sentence passed upon <hi>Adam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NEXT to the invaluable Drill-Plow, which will save in Seed Corn only the whole Tax on the Field, the <hi>Bucks</hi> Country Plow, with a short Mold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board, is justly esteemed the best. By turning over the Furrow shorter and quicker than any other, it breaks and greatly loosens the Soil; and, if plated with Steel<note n="*" place="bottom">I say plated with Steel rather than with Iron, because Steel is not only much the best; but, whenever the Use of it becomes general, it will be found in the End much the cheapest: For, however paradoxical it may appear, the high Price of Steel is owing to the small Quantity of it now used; as the Smallness of the Quantity heretofore used was a Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of its high Price. The Expence of converting Iron into Steel is very small, and is nearly paid by its Increase of Weight in the Process, which is very simple. <hi>British</hi> Tyranny restrained us from making of Steel, to enrich her Merchants and Manufacturers, but we can now make it ourselves as good as theirs: And the Day will come when our Horse-shoes shall be of Steel; perhaps even the Whole of our Coulters and Plowshares. If ten times the Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Steel now used were consumed, the Steelmaker could well afford to abate seven-eighths of his present Profit; and the Husbandman will find his Interest in having as many of his Instruments made of Steel as are improved by it. Few People are aware how much stronger Steel is than Iron, when Steel is only hammered and not hardened.</note>, will work lighter and freer than any other Plow used in <hi>Pennsylvania.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT has long been controverted, whether Horses or Oxen are best suited to the Plow and most profitable to the Husbandman? In the Eastern
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:016867_0015_0F9EC087D1266950"/>
States the Ox is preferred; in this State Horses are chosen: perhaps in both Cases upon just Ground and from fair Trials. But it is plain that the Attention in Breeding of them, which is due to both these Animals, is not paid to either of them. Men are apt to say, that "any Thing will do for the Plow." The Sentiment is unjust, and greatly injurious to the general Welfare: For, as the Plow is infinitely the most important Service to which the Labour of Horses is applied, so also does it require the best Horses in the World—and no wise Farmer will ever own a mean one while he can obtain a better. The Plowman's Day is spent whether his Horses walk faster or slower, whether they are strong or weak, and do little or much. The Labour of the Plow-Horse is hard, long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued and in the extreme Heat of our Summers; he ought therefore to be strong, vigorous and healthful, and his Lungs clear and sound. This cannot be denied, but the Question is, What Kind of Horses possess those Qualities in the highest Degree?</p>
            <p>UPON this Subject I know Men of the best Understanding are not agreed, but I beg Leave to speak my Sentiments freely, and leave them to be justified or condemned by Experience.</p>
            <p>THOSE who introduced Horses of the Blood, as they are called, among us, probably had in View to promote the Breed of Race-Horses,—and our young Men chose out the lightest boned and gayest Mares to breed from, with the still lighter boned Stallions of the Blood, consequently the Colts were small and of little Worth. By this Means the Blood fell into Disgrace; but a few large heavy-boned strong Mares with those Horses produced most excellent Plow-Horses. Since that Time the half-bred Horses have been rising in Reputation: They are now most esteemed where they have had the fullest Trial—and, if proper Care be taken to chuse from among the true Barbs those Stallions which have the largest Bones, the fullest Chest, the strongest Loins and shortest Pastern-Joints, they will with our heaviest Mares bring the best Plow-Horses for this Country. Those Horses are stronger in proportion to their Weight, walk faster, have clearer Lungs, and are hardier than any others. The great Dray-Breed cannot be brought to stand hard Service in our Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:016867_0016_0F9EC0888E767038"/>
nor be taught to walk with any tolerable Speed. Among the half-bred Horses, there will be found those fit for the Saddle, for travelling Carriages, and for the Purposes of War. A Stallion to breed good Plow-Horses for this hot Climate, must have sound Lungs. And the best Mode of trying them, is by long Races with heavy Riders; but Racing is disgraced by its Connection with Gaming. If these can be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated, this Mode of trying the Wind and Strength of breeding Horses will certainly be advantageous; but if they cannot be entirely separated, it were better to plow with Asses than destroy the Morals of a People—as Gaming does.</p>
            <p>BUT, useful as Horses are, too great a Number will eat up a fruitful Country. Of this the Pride of <hi>Britain</hi> affords a striking Example: The Food given by that People to their useless Horses, is worth the Interest of one-fourth Part of their enormous national Debt. Infatuated and ripe for Destruction as that People are, we must not expect they should see this; or seeing, shun the Evil—But we ought to derive Instruction from their Errors, as well as from their Improvements.</p>
            <p>WHEN our Farms are more divided, and the Meadows become insuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to support the encreasing Number of Horses, Oxen will then be introduced—because one Acre of Land will produce more Cabbages and Carrots, which are good Food for Oxen, than five Acres of the same Land will produce of Hay. And as the Lands by long Use will require to be plowed deeper, the Husbandman must make himself Amends, for the Want of Speed in Oxen, by the Advantage gained in their superior Strength. And when the Comparison is made between Horses and Oxen, let it be remembered, that an Ox taken from the Plow in perfect Health and Strength and made fat in a short Time, affords the Best of Beef for present Use.—And let it also be remembered, that the savory Surloin, served up at the Harvest-Board, deserves a distinguished Place at the well-earned Feast—A Feast such as <hi>Heliogabalus,</hi> with a thousand Dishes before him never tasted—such as the Epicure may look on and envy, but is too lazy, too indolent to enjoy: Industry and the cheerful Labors of the Field give a Relish to it, which Art, poisoning her Votaries, can
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:016867_0017_0F9EC08937A3E580"/>
never imitate. The Husbandman at the Head of his Table, surrounded by his assisting Neighbours and their industrious healthful Sons—his Heart elated with Joy, and his Countenance filled with Benevolence, affords the strongest Picture of perfect human Happiness: The sparkling Nectar of his Orchard passes from Lip to Lip, and Wit, brightened by the Joys of Harvest and chastened by his Presence, inspires every Heart with Cheerfulness, good Humor and Mirth,—while the careful Wife and the attentive dutiful Daughter, with Pleasure sparkling in their Eye, watch every Look and prevent every Wish.—'Tis their Care, their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition that nothing shall be wanting. When were Princes waited upon with such watchful Attention? When were they served by those so much and so deservedly beloved? Wealth cannot purchase such a Feast, not Royalty command it: 'Tis reserved for the Husbandman, whose own Hands have earned it: 'Tis reserved for him by whose Labors all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind are fed.</p>
            <p>As to Cloathing, both for Winter and for Summer, it is within our Power:—Our Sheep afford a warm Covering to keep off the chilling Blasts of Winter.—Our Flax and our Silk-worms offer us a light, cool, decent Dress for Summer.—The Importance of these need not be insisted on—they are evident.</p>
            <p>OUR <hi>British</hi> Enemies raised up an Empire once the Admiration of the World, and they boasted that its Foundation and Support was a Wool-Pack:—Their Woollens exported to every Quarter of the Globe, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased and centered in that Island the Produce of every Country, civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized and savage;—but becoming insolent and unjust, she raised up the Rod of Oppression against her Children and her Neighbours, and the righteous Hand of Heaven has humbled her in the Dust—she has fallen detested and despised—an Object of Hatred and of Contempt—Upon that wicked and foolish Nation we have been too long dependent—Let us forget them for-ever; or remember them only to profit by their Example.</p>
            <p>THE Sheep of this Country are not subject to Disease as they are in
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:016867_0018_0F9EC08A0B5FB288"/>
               <hi>England.</hi> The Rot is unknown among us.<note n="*" place="bottom">There is a Disease among Sheep occasioned by Moisture in low Grounds, which has some of the Characters of that fatal Disease the Rot; but it has never yet appeared to be infectious.</note> They are easily kept, and with less Care than is taken of them in any other Country. The Wool which they produce, both in <hi>Pennsylvania</hi> and <hi>New-Jersey,</hi> is finer, stronger and fulls more than any Wool of which <hi>Britain</hi> can boast. Of this our Wool Hats, the best in the World, is a full Proof.</p>
            <p>OUR Cloths last longer than any imported from <hi>Europe.</hi> and by assort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Wool, as is done in other Countries, they will full as even and wear as smooth.</p>
            <p>HUSBANDMEN who have not pen-folded their Sheep, have no Idea of the great Value of their Manure. It is within my Knowledge, that a Farmer in <hi>New-Jersey,</hi> who possessed a Tract of poor Land, by keeping an hundred Sheep greatly enriched the Whole. It became highly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable, and will now yield more than double the Crop of Grain it would have done thirty Years ago with equal Tillage. And in the mean time he has made an Estate by his Sheep. But if we clothe ourselves with Wool, we must part with our large Breed of Dogs.<note n="†" place="bottom">The small Breed of Dogs answer all the Purposes of the Farmer as well as the larger ones, even on the Frontiers.</note> They destroy the Sheep, and the Husbandman is discouraged.</p>
            <p>WERE there no Considerations arising from Interest or Necessity to influence our Determination respecting the Keeping of Sheep, one should think that the Pleasure which is seen in the Countenance of an affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate industrious Wife, looking on her Husband and Children clothed with Garments spun by her own Hands, greatly deserves our Regard and Attention. Feelings such as these, are the strong Motives and great Rewards of Industry—They act silently indeed; but irresistibly: Nor are those happy Feelings confined to the Mother only, the Daughter has her Triumphs too. Look at a modest, blooming, ruddy Lass dressed in a well finished Homespun—her Eye sparkles with Pleasure, and she strives
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:016867_0019_0F9EC08AC7A33EF8"/>
in vain to mask a decent virtuous Pride in her Dress. Our young Men, to while away an idle Hour, may toy and frolick with some tawdry flut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering Thing, flounced off with foreign Frippery; but whenever their sober Thoughts lead them to settle in the World, they turn their Eye upon the prudent homespun Lass—with her they hope for Happiness—Her Industry has already shewn that she is worthy of their Love—while the other falls to the Lot of some idle Fopling, vain and thoughtless as her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
            <p>IN a Country like this, there is no Bounds to Industry. When Things useful and convenient are obtained, Ornament and Elegance are within its Reach:—When we have clothed ourselves in Wool, a single Effort will clothe us in Silk. The Experiments already made under the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage of this Society, leave no Doubt of our Success: Plant the <hi>Italian</hi> Mulberry, and in a few Years the Famer's Wife and Daughters will clothe themselves in Silks, more lasting and obtained with less Labor than any other Manufacture. And, in Spite of what Pride and Envy may suggest, Silks will fit the neatest and shine brightest on the Backs of those by whose Hands the Silk-worm has been fed: Nor can the proudest Empress of <hi>India</hi> shew an equal Title to wear them. Female Industry deserves the highest Reward, and has in all Ages obtained Praise.</p>
            <p>WHEN <hi>Solomon,</hi> whose Wisdom has never been excelled, speaks of a good Wife, with what Force and Elegance he describes her Industry. You will indulge me in repeating a Sentiment of his on this Subject: <q>She is not afraid of the Snow for her Houshold: for all her Houshold are clothed in Scarlet, She maketh herself Coverings of Tapestry, her Clothing is Silk and Purple.—And her Husband is known in the Gates, when he sitteth among the Elders of the Land.</q> How must the Female Heart rejoice in the well earned Praise, when, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses it, <q>her Children rise up and call her blessed, her Husband also, and praiseth her.</q> The Praise of <hi>Solomon</hi> is not confined to the good Wives of his People; it extends equally to all Nations. Let us then look round among those of <hi>Pennsylvania</hi>—let us seek out the Thousands to whom it justly belongs—let them be honored and be loved, <q>for their Price is far above Rubies.</q> Their Hands will make us truly rich.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:016867_0020_0F9EC08B82DBA0E0"/>
SPEAKING of the Mulberry Tree, it would be unpardonable to omit the Remark, that this Tree, like the Walnut, enriches the Ground it grows upon and is a most valuable Ship Timber.</p>
            <p>EXPERIMENTS made on the Vine in this Country, afford no very flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering Expectations of present Success;—perhaps the native Grape has been too much neglected. Whether Wines are necessary or not, all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind from the Days of <hi>Noah</hi> to this Day, have had a strong Desire to drink of them.—Commerce at least will introduce enough of them; but should they be imported for common Use, the Produce of the Country would not pay for them. The Husbandman would drink up his whole Crop, and remain in Debt. He would have nothing to give towards the Defence of his Country. It would stand an inviting easy Prey to the first bold insolent Invader.</p>
            <p>BUT, Thanks to that kind Providence which governs all with equal Wisdom and Benevolence, we have no real Need of foreign Wines. Our Orchards yield us a Juice, which, well improved, may justly vie with the best the World can afford. The Art of Fermentation will bring this delicious Drink to Perfection. And our Fields produce Hops and Barley in Abundance: These afford a Liquor, which, when the Sons of <hi>Britain</hi> were brave and virtuous, was their Boast. It is a Fact, that those who drink Beer well tinctured with the Hop, are not afflicted with Agues; while those who drink Spirits of any Kind, are doubly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with them.</p>
            <p>PENNSYLVANIA has generally taken the Lead in Agriculture;—but it must be acknowledged her Husbandmen are greatly behind-hand in Fruit-Trees, both of the Orchard and of the Garden. It is a Remark made by Foreigners from all Countries, that more Flesh is eaten by the People of this State and <hi>New-Jersey</hi> than by any other Nation. Hence many fatal Diseases take their Rise, especially Dysenteries and putrid Fevers. Against which, it is well known, full ripe Fruits are the most effectual Preventives and the most sovereign Remedies. The Effects produced by the best Kind of free-stone Peaches in Dysenteries, renders
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:016867_0021_0F9EC08C4603F678"/>
it probable that a general Cultivation of that Fruit alone would within twenty Years save more Lives than we have lost in the present cruel and bloody War—a War rendered glorious by the great Prize we have gained in the Contest. Surely then this Society, whose Object is to apply useful Knowledge to Practice for the Benefit of Mankind, will think the Propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating of Fruit-Trees an Object of their immediate Attention.</p>
            <p>THE many great Advantages derived from our happy Connection with <hi>France,</hi> may draw our Attention from the lesser; but it is far from being an inconsiderable one, that we now have an Opportunity of culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating the most excellent Fruits of that fine Country—her Cherries—the great Variety of her rich melting Pears—her luscious Plumbs—her blush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Nectarins—and, above all, her delicious Peaches.<note n="*" place="bottom">Little Difficulties ought not to discourage us—the great one is overcome:—That de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive Worm which so long triumphed over us, is at last conquered. A Bank of Earth raised round a Fruit-Tree, at once secures it from the Worm and renders it doubly fruitful, and it is scarcely the Labor of a Minute annually.</note>
            </p>
            <p>FRUITS were the first Food of Man, and it is wonderful that in this Country, in which they will grow even to Admiration, the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man should toil through the Heats of Harvest and not provide for his Table a Desert of wholesome cooling Fruits; which alone are want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make his Table the most plentiful and the most happy. This strange Deficiency must be owing to Want of Knowledge in Grassing and Inoculation. The unwholesome sour Trash found almost every where is full Proof—it can be accounted for no other way. The Practice of this Art is so easy, so expeditious, that it is impossible it should be generally known and so entirely neglected: Let us then devise some Means to teach it to every Boy within the State. Their Parents will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice in it. Some kind-hearted worthy Man in every Township of the State will dedicate a Day or two in a Year to this useful and benevolent Purpose, and teach every Boy upwards of ten Years of Age. Notice being given of the Time appointed, all would attend, and all may be instructed even in a few Hours.<note n="†" place="bottom">A few plain Instructions on the Subject of Grassing and Inoculation may be printed and given to each Boy to keep the Instructions upon his Mind.—These shall not be wanting wheneveer this Plan is attempted.</note> If some Public Honors are found ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:016867_0022_0F9EC08CFA832FE0"/>
to incite the Attention of Youth, let him who excels wear a graceful rural Crown and be treated with more than common Respect. A Plan of this Kind, well digested and faithfully executed, cannot fail of Success. It would fill our Country with Fruit-Trees and make of it a new, a delightful and more lasting <hi>Eden</hi> than that from which our first Parents were driven. A Garden in which Knowledge and the Practice of Virtue would restore to Man every earthly Happiness he was created to enjoy.</p>
            <p>MANKIND have talked of a <hi>Milennium</hi>—a Thousand Years of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Peace and Happiness—and some have looked for it to happen about this Time. Whenever the Prophecies of this great Event shall be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, and the whole Earth become one fruitful <hi>Eden,</hi> the benign Sun of that happy Day will rise upon a perfect Knowledge of Agriculture, a sober persevering Industry, and a virtuous, chaste Enjoyment of the Fruits of the Field.</p>
            <p>IN our Endeavors to promote the Interest and Happiness of our Country, let us follow the wise Example of <hi>France</hi>—Let us apply to the intelligent Husbandman in every Part of the State, and collect the real Knowledge among us—let us examine, digest and arrange it into Science: Suggest Experiments, which may determine doubtful Cases, or lead to new and still further Improvements. Time cannot be better employed—A Portion of it dedicated to so useful a Purpose, will obtain the ready and cheerful Assistance of every Man in the State. To do good is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful:—And that Country whose Citizens make its Welfare not only the Object of their Business, but of their Pleasure, cannot fail to become wise and happy, and must rise to a Height of Riches, Strength and Glory, which the fondest Imagination cannot readily conceive.</p>
            <p>THE Star-bespangled Genius of <hi>America,</hi> leaning upon and embracing her fond Sister Genius of <hi>France,</hi> points to Agriculture as the stable Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of this rising mighty Empire. 'Tis our Business, our Duty, to build it up with all our Strength. The great plain written Volume of Nature is open before us:—Let us read with Diligence, and a Knowledge in

her Ways will rapidly encrease—her whole System of Vegetation may perfectly be understood.—And I feel a solid present Joy in the Certainty that Agriculture, as a Science, will ere long be taught within these Walls.<note n="*" place="bottom">This Oration was delivered in the University.</note> That, under the Auspices of a Patriot Legislature, that Science will give the last Polish and brightest Glow to a learned and useful Education—There cannot be a Doubt:—So obvious are the Advantages, that even Parsimony would prompt us to adopt the Plan. And what is there taught among Mankind of higher Importance and more real Use? I dare boldly affirm, that he who can add one Bushel of Wheat to the Encrease of a Field, is greater than he who has ravaged a Province, or conquered a Kingdom. Husbandmen compose the great Majority of our Citizens. Their Voice will long be the Law of the Land: Their Knowledge and Virtue must fix among the Nations the Reputation of the State: Their Industry and Skill in Agriculture will determine the Value and Extent of our Commerce—the Importance and Worth of our Alliance. When Husbandmen are liberally educated, Agriculture and the State will flourish together—will rise to their utmost Perfection.—And this will soon come to pass.</p>
            <p>WE have seen the Representatives of the People liberally endowing that University in which the future Husbandman, Patriot and Statesman in one must receive his Instructions in Wisdom and Virtue. May their Descendants enjoy the Benefits for Ages to come—Their Fathers have deserved it.</p>
            <p>IN the Midst of a careful and anxious Solicitude to support the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent unavoidable and just though distressing War, and the Hurry, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion and great Difficulties which attend it, we have seen the same Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triotic Legislature, with a truly <hi>Christian</hi> Benevolence, attending to the Cries of our Fellow-Men, though differing in Color from us, though dishonored and disgraced by Slavery—we have seen them loosing the Bands of Oppression,<note n="†" place="bottom">Alluding to the Act for the gradual Abolition of Slavery in <hi>Pennsylvania.</hi>
               </note> and thereby drawing down the Blessing of Heaven upon us.—With a Readiness which engages our highest Respect and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent

Acknowledgment—with a Liberality of Sentiment which adds to the Honors they had justly acquired they have by a solemn Act incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated and enlarged the Towers of this Society. Men who thus dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate their Time and Abilities to promote the Interests of Learning, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and their Country, are far above vulgar Praise—are entitled to far different Returns than Thanks and Compliments. We owe to them, and to the great Cause which they have espoused, a strenuous and unremit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Exertion of every Power we possess, for the true and real Interest of the State, by promoting and extending useful Knowledge through every Part of it, and, if possible, throughout the whole World.</p>
            <p>WHILE the Balance of Justice<note n="*" place="bottom">The "Seal of the Laws of <hi>Pennsylvania"</hi> is,—The Hand of Justice, holding an even Balance and the Eye of Providence over it.</note> is held in such Hands, and the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing Eye of Providence is acknowledged to be upon us—while Agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culture is honored, and the great Republican Virtues of Industry and OEconomy are duly respected—while the Owners of our widely extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fields cultivate them with their own Hands—while our Citizens of all Ranks remain armed and trained for Defence—and while Learning is cherished and encouraged among us—Force can never conquer, nor Fraud enslave us. But, standing upon those mighty Pillars whose great Foundations GOD himself has laid, a whole happy People with one Voice shall triumph for ever in "VIRTUE, LIBERTY, INDEPENDENCE."<note n="†" place="bottom">The Motto of the Great Seal of the State.</note>
