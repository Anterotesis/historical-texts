         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THE perſon, whoſe daily converſation is here deſcrib'd, was not long ſince a poor ſimple country maid, and ſervant to a great family in <hi>France.</hi> The whole courſe of her life was very inſtructive, and a moſt ſhining pattern of a true ſpiritual conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. The particulars here related are taken out of the 18th chapter of the ſecond part of her <hi>Life,</hi> giving great encouragement to a daily and uninterrupted converſation with GOD, and to walk before him as the omnipreſent LORD and Father.</p>
            <p>If we knew nothing elſe of Chriſtianity, or any other exerciſe, but this, to ſpend one day after another in this manner, it would be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient. 'Tis very remarkable, that this perſon, who ſerved GOD wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h unwearied prayer and watchfulneſs, was ſo ignorant, that ſhe could neither read nor write, and withal a ſervant, conſtantly employed in buſineſs and hard la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. By this we ſee that the true ſervice of GOD is ſpiritual, univerſal, plain and eaſy, ſo
<pb n="iii" facs="unknown:007218_0002_102B3F26950FE820"/>
that no perſon can be excuſed from it by any pretence whatſoever.</p>
            <p>Some, who diſcovered her ſpiritual diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, would needs have her go into a nunnery, where ſhe might be more at leiſure to ſerve GOD; which ſhe did accordingly. But per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving her former zeal and love to GOD be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to abate, ſhe went to ſervice again; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ſhe enjoyed the ſame favour of GOD, as ſhe had done before.</p>
            <p>By this circumſtance the LORD taught her and her friends effectually, that piety and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion was not confined to nunneries; and that the outward cloiſtering up of the body, without withdrawing the heart from the world, would never mortify, tho' perhaps it might colour and hide the inward corruptions of the ſoul. And whereas in that party ſhe belong'd to, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is reduced to the too narrow compaſs of cloiſters and nunneries, this may really con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them, that the life of grace is of a far lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger extent, than to be ſhut up within the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row pales of certain places; and that neither time nor place can reſtrain within itſelf the free and boundleſs operations of the ſpirit of GOD, which are above time and place. An heart humbly reſigned to the will of GOD, and walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his fear, is the temple, wherein the LORD manifeſts his ſecrets.</p>
            <p>'Tis not ſo much the changing of places, or names, or modes and forms, or of any thing without us, as the changing of our will and
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:007218_0003_102B3F28D7D91A40"/>
heart, that will render our ſervice at all accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to GOD. Hence the ſcripture declaring, what ſort of change is to be wrought in a ſoul, requires a tranſlation from darkneſs to light; (<hi>Acts xxvi.</hi> 18.) from death to life, (<hi>Eph. ii.</hi> 5.) &amp; from being loſt to be found again, (<hi>Luk. xv.</hi> 32.)</p>
            <p>And hence it was, that the perſon theſe pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers treat of, loſt in a manner the ſweet enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of a ſpiritual life, whilſt ſhe ſought more of them in cloiſters and nunneries; but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd them by going back into her former ſtate of life; which, though it was mean and toilſome in the eye of reaſon, (too apt to judge of things by a ſet form, and a devotion model<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the art and contrivance of men) yet was it that wherein ſhe enjoyed richer incomes of GOD'S favour, than perhaps others in the moſt retir'd ſolitude. And this falſe rule of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining religion to certain places, is too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly obſerv'd in that church this perſon hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to be a member of.</p>
            <p>What is here related of this <hi>good Armelle,</hi> is a paſſage of her daily intercourſe with GOD by faith and love. How ſhe ſpent her time from morning to night, in her dreſſing and outward devotion, in the midſt of her buſineſs, in eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and drinking, in daily ſufferings and temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, in the evening, and when ſhe went to bed. In ſhort: it ſhews the manner of her child-like, hearty and confident converſing with GOD as her only love, her father, and intimate friend; and this at all times, in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="V" facs="unknown:007218_0003_102B3F28D7D91A40"/>
and upon all occaſions, without uſing any other art or myſtery, but that of faith and love.</p>
            <p>The deſign of this ſhort eſſay, is to excite ſome able pen or other, to undertake the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the whole account of this ſpiritual maid into <hi>Engliſh;</hi> it appearing already in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral languages, for promoting the more ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial points of inward and unſophiſticated piety and religion.

            <head>A Chriſtian's daily Converſation with GOD.</head>
            <p>AS ſoon as I wake in the Morning, <hi>ſaith ſhe,</hi> I throw my ſelf into the arms of my heavenly love, as a child into the arms of his father. I riſe with a deſign to ſerve and pleaſe him. And if I have time to pray, I fall upon my knees in his holy preſence, and ſpeak to him, as if I really ſaw him with my bodily eyes. I give my ſelf up wholly to him, and deſire him, to fulfil all his holy will in me, and that he would not ſuffer me that day to do the leaſt thing which might be offenſive to him. Then I recommend to him all the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers which ſhall be made that day. In ſhort: I love, and praiſe him as much and as long as my affairs permit; tho' very often I have hardly ſo much time as to ſay the Lord's Prayer. But I do not trouble my ſelf about that; for I have God always in my heart, as well when I am about my buſineſs, which I do in obedience to his will, as when I retire on purpoſe to pray to him. This he himſelf has taught me, that whatever I do out of love to him, is a real prayer.</p>
            <p>I dreſs myſelf in his preſence, and he ſhews me that his love ſupplies me with raiment. And when I go a bout my buſineſs, even then doth he not forſake me, nor I him; but he converſes with me, and I with him; yea, I am then as much united to him, as when I am at my prayers, ſet apart on purpoſe for my ſpiritual recollec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. O! how ſweet and eaſy is all labour and toil in ſuch good company! Sometimes I perceive ſuch ſtrength and ſupport in my mind, that nothing is too hard for me, and I think myſelf alone able to manage the affairs of the whole family. Nothing but the body is at work, the heart and myſelf burn with love in the ſweet familiarity I entertain with God.</p>
            <p>I eat and drink in his preſence, as I do every thing
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:007218_0004_102B3F2BB328F450"/>
elſe, and it is as if I dipp'd every bit into the precious blood of my Saviour, and as if he himſelf gave me food, on purpoſe to inflame my love, and to engage it the more to himſelf. I leave you to judge, what effect this muſt have upon my ſoul. Indeed it is impoſſible for any body to expreſs it but God himſelf. As for me, my whole life would never be ſufficient to give an account of it.</p>
            <p>Whan I am about my buſineſs in the day time, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning up and down, till the body begins to be weary, or to repine, or to deſire unſeaſonable reſt, being oppreſſed with anger and uneaſineſs; my divine love enlightens me forthwith, and ſhews me, how I ought to ſuppreſs thoſe rebellious motions of corrupt nature, and not to nouriſh them at all, either by word or deed. This love keeps the door of my lips, and watches over my heart, that it may not in the leaſt contribute to ſuch irregular paſſions, which thus are cruſhed and ſubdu'd as ſoon as they riſe.</p>
            <p>But if at any time, for want of care, I am ſurpriſed with theſe or the like faults, I cannot be at reſt, till I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained pardon, and God be reconciled to me. I lie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate before his footſtool, confeſſing all my faults to him, as if he did not know them already; and there I continue, till he has forgiven me, renewed his friendſhip with me, and confirm'd it more than before. For ſo it always hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens through his infinite mercy, whenever I have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted a fault, which ſerves but to inflame my heart more and more with his divine love. If people perſecute me, and by foul and uncharitable cenſures raiſe ſcandals upon me, or any other way aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ict me; or if evil ſpririts attack me with their crafty cunning temptations, I then preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly run to my heavenly LOVE, who readily ſtretches forth his ſacred arms to receive me, ſhewing me his heart and wounds open for my ſecurity; in which I hide my ſelf as in a ſtrong caſtle and fortreſs. And then I am ſo mightily ſtrengthned, that if the whole army of hell itſelf, together with all the creatures, ſhould riſe up againſt me, I fear them no more than a fly, becauſe I am under the protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the moſt high God, his love being the hiding-place and ſafe-guard of my ſoul.</p>
            <p>If God at any time hides his face, making as if he would
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:007218_0005_102B3F2D439BB4C0"/>
go away from me, I tell him: <q>O! 'tis no matter, my love, conceal thyſelf as much as thou pleaſeſt, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs I'll ſerve thee; for I know that thou art my God.</q> And then I ſtand upon my guard more than ever, to be faithful to him, for fear of diſpleaſing my love. And at the ſame time perceiving the greatneſs of my miſery and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, I inſiſt the more upon the merits of our Saviour, and reſolve to reſt contented, tho' it ſhould pleaſe him to leave me all the days of my life in ſuch a condition. But he never lets me continue long under theſe circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and if I may venture ſo to ſpeak, he cannot forbear loving me, any more than I can live without him.</p>
            <p>At his return he recompenſes the little moment of his abſence with ſo many careſſes and endearments, that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes I am not able to bear them, but am forced to cry out: <q>I can receive no more! wherefore I deſire him to moderate my ſenſation, or elſe to let me die under the powerful ſenſe of his gracious preſence.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Many times, to bear this the better, I leave all, retiring into a corner to eaſe myſelf, by giving vent to the tears and praiſes due to his Majeſty, wherewith my heart is overcharged. And this I may do very well, ſince it is not the mere ſenſe of his kindneſs I long for, but rather HIM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SELF ALONE, that I deſire to enjoy. Altho' in the mean time one ought thankfully to receive theſe extraordinary tokens of God's mercy and love, if it be his holy will ſo to deal with us.</p>
            <p>If I am perſuaded on holidays, to be merry in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, I excuſe myſelf. For nothing can be compared to the pleaſures of my love, which are ſo much the ſweeter and greater, for my withdrawing from all company what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. If they wonder, how I can ſtay always at home alone, I think within myſelf: <q>O! if you knew the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous company I have, you would not ſay that I was alone: for I am never leſs alone, than when I have no body with me.</q>
            </p>
            <p>After this manner I ſpend not only working days, but holy days too, being often as much employed in the latter as in the former. But that is no hindrance to me, to whom labour and reſt, hard work and eaſy, all things are indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:007218_0005_102B3F2D439BB4C0"/>
ſince I do not look upon what I have to do, but upon him, for whoſe ſake I do it. I am ſo taken up with his love, that I have no time to mind my ſelf, nor any thing elſe but him alone.</p>
            <p>But if I do any thing amiſs, or out of ſeaſon, the ſame moment I feel a violent pain and ſorrow for what I have done, ſpringing from my love, which alſo makes me pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently hope for pardon; ſo that thinking of it no more, I go ſtrait forward on my way, turning aſide neither to the right hand, nor to the left. Neither do I remember what is paſt, or to come, but only, that I may love God to the utmoſt of my power.</p>
            <p>The night coming on, and every one going to reſt, I find reſt only in the arms of divine love: I ſleep leaning on his holy breaſt, like a child in his mother's boſom. I ſay, I go to ſleep, but being ſtill buſied about the love and praiſes of my God, till I fall quite aſleep. Many times this love rouzes up all my ſenſes, ſo that I cannot ſleep the greateſt part of the night, but I ſpend it in the embraces of the lovely grace of God, which never forſakes ſuch a poor miſerable creature as I am, but preſerves me, and takes ſpecial care of me.</p>
            <p>If in the night the evil ſpirits hover about, to torment or to ſurpriſe me (which often happens) this divine love guards me, and fights for me. Yea, it gives me grace, too, to reſiſt them couragiouſly, as if I were awake. For they ſeldom continue long to aſſault me, unleſs it be in my ſleep.</p>
            <p>And this is the life I have led for theſe twenty years paſt, without perceiving the leaſt change of that love which was poured out into my heart, after my ſincere conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion unto him. Nay, I have obſerved its daily increaſe, tho' every day it ſeemed impoſſible to endure any addition to what I already enjoyed. But truly, it is an infinite love, which ſatisfies and nouriſhes me, ſo that every day I have a new hunger, tho' methinks I can receive no more, than what I poſſeſs already every moment.</p>
            <p>THE author of her life ſays, concerning the manner of her expreſſions, that they were always very modeſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any noiſe or vehemence: her common diſcourſes were always holy and edifying; whereas others too commonly
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:007218_0006_102B3F2F88495680"/>
miſſpend their time in uſeleſs converſation and unprofitable talk. If ſhe was in company, where they talk'd of indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent or evil things, ſhe had the faculty of giving them ſuch a handſome turn, as to bring them quite off from that to ſome good and uſeful ſubject.</p>
            <p>For a long while ſhe could bear no other diſcourſe but of God, and his holy love. <hi>I cannot imagine,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>how a ſoul created for heaven can be concerned about the droſs of this world.</hi> From that time, if ſhe happened to be in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, where the ſubject of the diſcourſe was but indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, either ſhe did not mind it at all, entertaining herſelf in the mean while with God; or, as ſoon as ſhe thought it proper, ſhe diverted and changed the diſcourſe; thinking it but loſt time, which was ſpent in the trifles of this world.</p>
            <p>To every body, that had a mind to be acquainted with God Almighty, ſhe gave this advice: <q>To be ſilent, and to learn to keep their thoughts together in the center of the heart: for this, <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> is the beginning of our union with God, and by theſe means the ſoul forgets earthly things, and raiſes herſelf up to the contemplation of heavenly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. We ought to loſe our familiarity with the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, if we deſire to anjoy the converſation of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; a moment of which doth afford more delight and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, than all the fineſt diſcourſes in the world.</q>
            </p>
            <p>SHE declared once, that ſhe did by no means encourage any deſire of knowing what did not concern herſelf. When a certain perſon aſk'd her, whether ſhe did not know ſuch a ſtory, that the town rang of at that time? <q>ſhe anſwered, no; and gave God thanks, that ſhe never knew any thing of the news of this world, neither did ſhe deſire to know it. But ſhe knew a great deal of news concerning the love and mercies of Almighty God. For this ſhe ſaid was the only thing ſhe deſired to know, and wherewith her heart was entirely taken up.</q>

               </gap> ſhe had of the inward and ſpiritual life of grace, and of the manifold operations it is attended with, doth abundantly apear from the larger account of her life and converſion. To give the reader a taſte there of may ſuffice for the preſent:</p>
            <p>One time when her miſtreſs was afraid that <hi>Armelle</hi> was
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:007218_0006_102B3F2F88495680"/>
like to run quite mad by an exceſs of devotion, ſhe forbad her all ſpiritual exerciſes, and would not let her go even to church, except on the Lord's day only: <hi>Armelle</hi> being ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the falſe ſtep her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>treſs took, ſmiled with herſelf, ſaying, <q>Truly, I am not mad, after I have found my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, whom I now love with all my heart. I remember a time when I was ſeeking only God without me, and than I was mad indeed.</q> This miſtreſs of hers being of a ſour and moroſe humour, ſhew'd a deal of ill-nature to <hi>Armelle,</hi> of which, however ſhe never complain'd, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thanked God, that he was pleaſed to make this a means of her fuller purification. When her friends ſeeing what ſhe ſuffered in that houſe, adviſed her one time, entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to quit that place, ſhe replied according to her uſual earneſtneſs: <q>Why would you have me flee from the croſs which the Lord himſelf has entailed upon me? No, by no means: I ſhall never do it, except you abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely command it. If I ſhould undergo a thouſand times as much, I ſhall never forſake the place for all that, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtay till they turn me away by force.</q> In which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected anſwer they acquieſced, never prompting her again to quit a place, where ſhe had daily opportunity to practiſe <hi>Patience</hi> and <hi>Self-denial;</hi> virtues ſo much contrary to the whole bent of corrupt nature, and yet ſo neceſſary for rightly framing a Chriſtian life and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation. At another time ſhe ſaid: <q>If the ſoul be but well grounded in the favour of God, and lively affected with the operations of his grace, all the inſults of the devil, and of the creature, are born with joy and comfort. But that is miſery indeed, when the Lord himſelf withdraws from the ſoul, and lets her ſhift for herſelf. Then ſhe thinks, that every ſtep is a ſtep into ſin and corruption, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing utterly unable to protect herſelf againſt it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In what company ſoever ſhe was, ſhe talked of nothing more than of <hi>being faithful to God.</hi> Nothing dropped more from her mouth, than <hi>Let us be faithful, let us be faithful to the Lord.</hi> This word ſhe thought fit for any time, and ſuitable to every company. Now and then ſhe would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat it an hundred times over; and being aſked by her friends, whether ſhe had nothing elſe to ſay: She anſwer'd:
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:007218_0007_102B3F315CD3C6A8"/>
               <q>Don't wonder at my ſaying this over and over again. If I ſhould live a thouſand years, I ſhould ſtill tell ye the ſame thing. For 'tis faithfulneſs, wherein the perfection of a Chriſtian life conſiſts.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Of the conſtraining power of the divine love ſhe has the following expreſſion: <q>Whenever I happened to adhere a little too much to my natural inclinations (apt to ſteal in upon the mind under the ſpecious pretence of neceſſity) I was immediately reproved by the love of God. This di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine love is like a careful tutor, who takes all the pains imaginable, for advancing his pupil in the way of learning he is engaged in; and for this reaſon keeps his eye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly fixed on him, both to correct his failings, though never ſo ſmall, and to prevent his being led away by any thing that might divert him from his chief employment. Thus, <hi>ſays ſhe,</hi> dealt the Lord with me. He kept me cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confined to an holy awe and warineſs; and when I hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened by one overſight or other to withdraw, as it were, from his eye, he in that very moment purſued after me, and recall'd me to my duty. But all this was done with ſo much love and tenderneſs, that it muſt be a heart of braſs, if not mollified by ſuch endearing marks of love and kindneſs.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Of the diſorderly love to friends and relations, which now and then even well-diſpoſed ſouls are too much guilty of, ſhe gives the following account: <q>One time, <hi>ſays ſhe,</hi> my parents came to ſee me; when I entertain'd them, I found my ſelf tranſported with ſome vain joy and pleaſure, and ſomewhat coldiſh in minding the impreſſions of the love of God; nay, it ſeem'd as if the Lord himſelf did in a manner withdraw from me, to let me have as it were, the more liberty for the preſent. But no ſooner my parents were gone, and I come to myſelf, the burden and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I then felt upon my ſpirit, was heavy enough, ſince I did not find him whom I lov'd more than my own ſoul. However, as ſoon as I came home, I felt again a noble re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of the divine love, and it was, as if the Lord had wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for me on purpoſe, to communicate himſelf unto me.</q> After this ſhe freely confeſs'd, that from that very time ſhe found herſelf entirely freed from all manner of irregular ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herency
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:007218_0007_102B3F315CD3C6A8"/>
to her parents, whom ſhe was too fond of hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, being now only taken up with the grand concern of promoting the more ſpiritual part of her friends and fellow-creatures: <q>Thus, <hi>ſays ſhe,</hi> the love of God made every thing, nay even my very faults and imperfections, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to my greater ſpiritual good and welfare.</q>
            </p>
            <p>'Twas mention'd before, how earneſt ſhe was in exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting every one to be faithful unto the Lord with what he had received. This faithfulneſs recommended by her unto others, ſhe was a moſt ſhining pattern of herſelf in her whole Life and converſation. But it moſt viſibly appeared in that unwearied readineſs and quickneſs ſhe diſpatch'd any thing tending to promote the glory of God in her ſtation. No ſooner was ſhe convinc'd of the will of God, but was very earneſt and diligent, to anſwer it preſently. She often won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd at ſome peoples dilatory doings in the ſervice of God, and ſaid, it was a cunning fetch and ſtratagem of the devil, to make people put off from one day to another ſuch deſigns as might ſerve to advance the glory of God, and the good of our fellow creatures. <q>
                  <hi>For,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>it often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, that that grace which at one hour offers itſelf to a man, in order to ſupport him under ſome difficult enterpriſes, is not ſo eaſily met with at another time.</hi> And beſides this, how uncertain is our life! nay, if we were ſure to live lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, yet ought we not to linger upon that account at all, nor to defer from one day to another what might be done this day. A man that is full of delays in the ſervice of God, muſt needs have but little love at the bottom. <hi>Wherever love is raiſed to any conſiderable degree, there the ſoul can't reſt, whilſt there remains any thing to be done requir'd by the Beloved.</hi> And this dilatory temper, <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> was a great impediment in the way to perfection. Many ſouls were convinc'd of the will of God, but being too back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward conſtantly to ſtruggle againſt the corrupt propenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their dull and lazy t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mper, they made but a ſlow progreſs in the work of religion. They ſay, to-morrow, to-morrow it ſhall be done in good earneſt; but that to-morrow never comes. The conſequence whereof is, that the longer they flatter themſelves in their diſorderly and wonted cuſtoms, the leſs able they are to reſiſt them
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:007218_0008_102B3F3397266C10"/>
at laſt at all: the Lord leaves them now to their own will, ſince they did not improve faithfully what once they had receiv'd.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THE virtue of humility was as remarkable in this holy maid as any of the reſt; and it was grounded on a true and ſolid foundation too. She confeſſes herſelf, that the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite love of God kept her undefiled as to the vanity of pride; inſomuch that ſhe did not know what pride and haughtineſs was. <q>I was aſtoniſhed, <hi>ſays ſhe,</hi> when I was told to <hi>watch againſt pride;</hi> for I thought whilſt I was well in my wits, I could not poſſibly be proud. I was ſo fully convinced that any thing really good was from God, that if all angels and men had offer'd to perſuade me to the contrary, I ſhould never have believ'd them. And this ſenſe fortified me againſt all manner of pride and preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, my own conſcience never charging me with the leaſt guilt of that vice, and I could not imagine how it was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that men ſhould attempt ſo heinous a thing as this.</q> And this was the reaſon, that ſhe never would quit that manner of life ſhe was bred to, though mean and contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible in the eye of the world.</p>
            <p>Even her ſpiritual friends would now and then moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunately intreat her, to reſign up to any body elſe her place (which was that of a ſervant) and this under a fair pretence too, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> That ſhe might have the more leiſure to give herſelf up to a contemplative life, and thus to enjoy the favours and gracious infuſions of the Lord more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly. And indeed there wanted no opportunity of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining ſuch a quiet retirement, as ſome had cut out for her. But ſhe could never be prevailed with to comply. She had too high and eſteem for her low condition. <q>She ſaid, ſhe ſhould never do ſuch a thing, except ſhe was vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly convinced of the will of God. For tho' her ſtation was but mean, yet was ſhe more pleas'd with it, than with all the prayers and contemplations ſhe perhaps might enjoy in the moſt concealed ſolitude of the world. She ſaid, her outward employment and all the drugery ſhe was put to, did not at all cool or weaken the ſenſe of the love, and of the gracious preſence of the Lord, ſhe uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enjoyed. Nay, the more fervent ſhe was to ſpend her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:007218_0008_102B3F3397266C10"/>
entirely in works of charity, chearfully complying with every thing incident to her life, the more plentiful incomes ſhe had of the love and favour of God. Hence, it would be but the effect of a falſe heart, if one ſhould make bold to quit his outward employment, in order to gain more reſt and quiet in another place, <hi>God,</hi> ſays ſhe, <hi>knows ways to find ſouls wherever they be, if they do not wilfully ſhut their hearts againſt him.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Becauſe her love to God was great and fervent, the love ſhe bore to her fellow creatures, was alſo wonderfully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenc'd and inflam'd thereby. When ſhe conſider'd the woful ſtate of the wicked, and the dreadful judgment that is like to befal them at laſt, ſhe then felt a moſt tender and commiſerating love, and her very bowels began to yearn for compaſſion. When ſhe look'd upon the happy ſtate ſhe was arriv'd to, and the ſevere doom attending ſuch profli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate wretches, ſhe uſed to ſay, <q>She ſeemed unto herſelf like one that had been in a great ſtorm at ſea, and by ſtreſs of weather like to be caſt away every minute; but get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off at laſt ſafe and ſound, remember'd now aſhore the dangers his bretheren and near relations were ſtill expoſed to, being toſs'd up and down in the huge ocean, and left to the mercy of the roaring billows. Alas! <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> thus it is with me, when I lay to heart the danger ſinners run themſelves into. For the more endearing marks of divine grace the Lord has been pleaſed to beſtow upon me, the more fervent is my deſire, that alſo others might partake of the ſame with me.</q>
            </p>
            <p>AND now, ye learned men, and refin'd wits of the age, come hither and admire the ignorance and ſimplicity of this poor country maid! Conſider how far ſhe exceeds your high flown ſuperficial wiſdom, and the dark flaſhes of human wit <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nd learning? And was it poſſible for her to attain to this <hi>heavenly wiſdom and divine knowledge,</hi> to ſuch a noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and elevation of mind, without the ſcraps and aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of artificial learning and philoſophy? then truly, there muſt be another ſchool wherein thoſe that <hi>look unto the Lord</hi> (Pſ. xxxiv. 5.) <hi>are lightned.</hi> Indeed, <hi>to know the love of Chriſt, paſſeth all knowledge,</hi> Eph. iii. 19.
