            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>The Governor hereupon ſent back the ſame</hi> Indian <hi>with ſome Preſents, to inform the Chiefs of the</hi> Sinnekaes, <hi>and others of the Five Nations,</hi> That Col. <hi>Spotſwood,</hi> Governor of <hi>Virginia,</hi> deſigning with Col. <hi>Burnet,</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of <hi>New-York,</hi> to meet their Chiefs this Summer at <hi>Albany,</hi> He would take that Opportunity to ſee them in the ſame Company.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Time approaching that the Governors had appointed to meet the</hi> Indians, <hi>the Aſſembly of this Province, by whoſe Advice the Governor had engaged to the</hi> Indians <hi>to viſit them, were called together to provide for the Charge. The Subject of the intended Treaty, The Value of the Preſents to be made, and Members of Council to accompany the Governor,</hi> viz. Richard Hill, Iſaac Norris <hi>and</hi> Andrew Hamilton, <hi>Eſqrs. were agreed on by the Governor, Council and Aſſembly, and Sums of Money to defray the Charge were voted.</hi>

               <hi>On the 7th of</hi> September <hi>our Governor ſpoke to them, and the ſame Day the Two</hi> Sinneka <hi>Chiefs arrived.

                        </opener>
                        <p>I Have travel'd a great Way to ſee you, and to hold ſome Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with you. The People of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> have always been Friends to the <hi>Five Nations:</hi> They have punctually kept all their former Treaties with you. They expect, that you do not forget them, and therefore I am come to brighten the Chain between us. You ſent me Word, that you deſired to ſee me, and I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained Leave of my Brother, the Governor of <hi>New-York,</hi> to renew at this Place our former Treaties with you; and I am glad he is preſent with us, to hear and obſerve all that is ſpoken.</p>
                        <p>Some of your ancient Men can yet remember the firſt Settlement of the Province of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> by <hi>William Penn:</hi> He was a good Man, and had a great Affection for all the <hi>Indians:</hi> He entred into Leagues of Friendſhip with them, and treated them as his Brethren; and he gave it in Charge to his Governors, whom he left in his Place, and to all his People, that they ſhould continue to do the ſame.</p>
                        <p>Divers Great Men from the <hi>Five Nations</hi> have, on ſeveral Occaſions, viſited us at <hi>Philadelphia</hi> and <hi>Coneſtogoe.</hi> We were always glad to ſee them, and treated them kindly like Brethren. They made firm Leagues of Friendſhip with us, and frequently renew'd and ſtrengthned them. We became as one People, and hope always to continue ſo; and as often as the <hi>Five Nations</hi> renew'd their Leagues with our great and good Friends the Governors of <hi>New-York,</hi> it ſtill united them more nearly to us, as being Subjects of one and the ſame Great KING.</p>
                        <p>Laſt Summer the wiſe and good Man <hi>Geſaont,</hi> with ſome others of your People, came, in the Name of all the <hi>Five Nations,</hi> to viſit us at <hi>Coneſtogoe</hi>
                           <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> We received them with Joy, and opened our Hearts to each other. He rejoyced to ſee us and our <hi>Indians</hi> live in ſo much Love together. We then brightned the Chain, that it might be clear, ſtrong and laſting as the Sun and Stars. But when we heard that <hi>Geſaont</hi> died in <hi>Virginia,</hi> we were very ſorry; yet I hope the <hi>Five Nations</hi> received my Words of Love and Friendſhip to their <hi>Sachims,</hi> and to all their People, with the Golden Medal and the Preſents then delivered.</p>
                        <p>It was then ſtipulated and agreed between us, That we ſhould all be as one People; That the <hi>Five Nations</hi> ſhould not do an Injury to any
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:002343_0005_0FDBCC9AAF44EFD8"/>
of us more than to themſelves; and that we ſhould not do an Injury to any of the <hi>Five Nations</hi> more than to our own People: Or, if any Perſon did ſuch Injury, they ſhould be puniſhed for it in the ſame Manner as if done to an <hi>Engliſhman.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Since that Time a very unhappy Accident has fallen out, which gave us great Grief: Laſt Winter we heard, that one of the <hi>Five Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> had loſt his Life by Means of ſome of our People.</p>
                        <p>The very next Day after the News came to me at <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> I ſent two of my Council to <hi>Coneſtogoe,</hi> to enquire into the Matter and bring me the Truth. They ſound that the Quarrel aroſe about <hi>Rum,</hi> between a Brother of the <hi>Five Nations,</hi> who hunted near <hi>Potomack,</hi> and two of our Traders.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Indian</hi> was angry, and went haſtily and took his Gun to kill the <hi>Engliſhmen</hi>; they, in Defence of themſelves, ſeized the <hi>Indian,</hi> and in ſtruggling gave him ſome Blows, and left him. We heard, that our <hi>Indian</hi> Friend and Brother died the next Day.</p>
                        <p>The Men who did this were brought to <hi>Philadelphia</hi> and put in Priſon; and they will be tried according to our Laws, in the ſame Manner as if they had kill'd an <hi>Engliſhman.</hi> And to prevent ſuch Miſchief for the Future, we have made a ſevere Law againſt ſelling <hi>Rum</hi> to the <hi>Indians.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Though this Misfortune gave us great Grief, yet we are perſwaded that the Chief <hi>Sachims</hi> of the <hi>Five Nations</hi> are ſo wiſe as to know, that ſuch Accidents may happen without any ill Deſign amongſt the neareſt Brethren. And by this they will ſee, how ſtrictly we keep our Leagues and Treaties, in puniſhing thoſe who ſhall dare to offend and injure them, or any of their People.</p>
                        <p>I made haſte to ſend a Meſſage to the <hi>Five Nations</hi> by <hi>Satcheecho</hi> to expreſs our Sorrow, and I received their kind Anſwer by the Return of the ſame Meſſenger. You received our Meſſage like true Brethren, deſiring us, to wipe away our Tears, and invited me to come and ſee you. Immediately I ſent <hi>Satcheecho</hi> back with this Anſwer, <hi>That I would meet you at</hi> Albany, <hi>with my good Friends the Governors of</hi> New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>York <hi>and</hi> Virginia; and I ſent ſome Tokens to your <hi>Sachims,</hi> which I hope they received, with a Mourning Gold Ring off my own Finger to <hi>Sakaunkauta.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Satcheecho</hi> returned ſpeedily, and ſaid, <hi>You would be glad to ſee me at</hi> Albany; He alſo told me, You deſired <hi>John Cartlidge</hi> might be releaſed out of Priſon, and the Injury done to your Kinſman might be forgot. But <hi>Satcheecho</hi> brought no Belt, nor any other Token to confirm his Words; and therefore I have brought him along with me, that you may know and tell me if he ſpoke Truth.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Brethren,</hi>

And I deſire you may receive them as a Pledge of our firm Reſolutions to live in Perpetual Peace, and under the ſtrongeſt Ties of Friendſhip with the <hi>Five Nations</hi>; that you will ever remember us as your Brethren, and not ſuffer your young Men, when they travel, to hurt any of our Inhabitants, no more than they would their own, or to kill their Cattle and Stock: And that this Viſit, and the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-Chain which is hereby brightned, may be recorded in everlaſting Remembrance, to be ſent down to your and our Children, and to our Children's Children, to laſt as long as the Mountains and Rivers, and the Sun and Moon ſhall endure.</p>
                        <p>I alſo give you theſe two Pieces of <hi>Blankets,</hi> to wipe away and to dry up the Blood that has been ſpilt, and to cover it ſo as that it may never be ſeen or heard of any more.</p>
                        <p>I live at a great Diſtance from the Brethren, and perhaps may never ſee ſo many of your grave ancient Men together again; I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, like a true Brother, leave with you my beſt Advice, for the Happineſs and Welfare of all your People: And as oft as you look upon thoſe two Belts remember,<note place="margin">Two Belts ſaid down</note> that <hi>This One ſignifies the Strength which a wiſe Nation acquires and ſecures to its People by peaceable Councils; and encreaſing the Number of its Friends:</hi> And this other Belt repreſents to you <hi>A bold, firm, true Heart, that abhors Falſhhood, but is ever faithful to its Friends, and punctually obſerves whatſoever it promiſes.</hi>

                           <p>Brother <hi>ONAS</hi>;</p>
                           <p>[<hi>which ſigniſies a</hi> Pen <hi>in the Language of the</hi> Five Nations, <hi>by which Name they call the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors of</hi> Pennſylvania, <hi>ſince it was firſt ſetled by</hi> William Penn.]</p>
                           <p>I. YOU told us in your Propoſition ſome Days ago, That you was come a great Way to ſee us of the <hi>Five Nations</hi>; We thank you for your Good Will to us, and are very glad to ſee you here in good Health: And we hope a good Underſtanding and Agreement will be made and concluded between us.</p>
                           <p>You told us alſo, That you are come to renew the Covenant-Chain that has been made between us ſo long ago, even at the firſt Setling the Province of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> and to brighten the Chain, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move and do away any Spot of Ruſt that may be grown upon it ſince our laſt Meeting and Conference at <hi>Coneſtogoe.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Brother Onas,</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>II. You have told us, That at that Time you brighten'd the Covenant Chain between us, that it might be clear and laſting as the Sun and Stars in Heaven: For which we thank you. And we being now all preſent, do, in the moſt ſolemn and publick Manner, renew the Covenant and brighten the Chain made between us. that the Luſtre thereof may never be obſcured by any Clouds or Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but may ſhine as clear and laſt as long as the Sun in the Firmament.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Brother Onas,</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>III. You have likewiſe told us, How <hi>William Penn,</hi> who was a good Man, did, at his firſt Settlement of the Province of <hi>Pennſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania,</hi> make Leagues of Friendſhip with the <hi>Indians,</hi> and treated them like Brethren; and that, like the ſame good Man, he left it in Charge to all his Governors who ſhould ſucceed him, and to all the People of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> that they ſhould always keep the Covenant and Treaties he had made with the <hi>Five Nations,</hi> and treat them with Love and Kindneſs. We acknowledge that his Governors and People have always kept the ſame honeſtly and truly to this Day: So we on our Part always have kept, and for ever ſhall keep, firm Peace and Friendſhip, with a good Heart, to all the People of <hi>Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania.</hi> We thankfully receive and approve of all the Articles in your Propoſition to us, and acknowledge them to be good and full of Love: We receive and approve of the ſame with our whole
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:002343_0008_0FDBCC8EE20DD988"/>
Hearts, becauſe we are not only made one People by the Covenant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Chain, but we alſo are People united in One Head, One Body and One Heart, by the ſtrongeſt Ties of Love and Friendſhip.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Brother Onas,</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>IV. You deſire there may be a perpetual Peace and Friendſhip between you and the <hi>Five Nations,</hi> and between your Children and our Children, and that the ſame may be kept as long as the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and Rivers endure. All which we like well, and on our Part deſire, that the Covenant and Union made with a clean and true Heart, between you and us, may laſt as long as the Sun and Moon ſhall continue to give Light. And we will deliver this in Charge to our Children, that it may be kept in Remembrance with their Children, and Children's Children to the lateſt Ages. And we deſire, That the Peace and Tranquility that is now eſtabliſhed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us, may be as clear as the Sun ſhining in its Luſtre, without any Cloud or Darkneſs, and that the ſame may continue for ever.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Brother Onas,</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>V. We have well conſider'd all that you have ſpoken, and like it well, becauſe it is only the Renewing of former Leagues and Treaties, made between the Government of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> and Us of the <hi>Five Nations</hi>; which we always believed we were obliged to keep. And as to the Accident of one of our Friends being kill'd by ſome of your People, which has happen'd by Misfortune and againſt your Will, we ſay, That as we are all in Peace, we think it hard the Perſons who kill'd our Friend and Brother ſhould ſuffer: And we do, in the Name of all the <hi>Five Nations,</hi> forgive the Offence, and deſire you will likewiſe forgive it; and that the Men who did it may be releaſed from Priſon, and ſet at Liberty to go whither they pleaſe. And we ſhall eſteem that as a Mark of Regard and Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip for the <hi>Five Nations,</hi> and as a farther Confirmation of this Treaty.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Brother Onas,</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>VI. We ſay farther, We are glad to hear the former Treaties we have made with <hi>William Penn</hi> repeated to us again, and renewed by you; and we eſteem and love you, as if you were <hi>William Penn</hi> Himſelf. We are glad you have wip'd away and cover'd the Blood of our dead Friend and Brother; and we deſire the ſame may be forgot, ſo as it may never be more mentioned or remembred.</p>
                           <p>It is needleſs for us to anſwer every Particular of your Propoſition, becauſe we acknowledge the Whole to be good and acceptable to us; eſpecially your good Advice, which we will always remember: And in Teſtimony thereof, and as a full Confirmation of our Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Conſent and Approbation of all that you have propoſed, and we have here ſaid and promiſed, we lay down a few Beaver, Bear and dreſs'd Deer Skins: <hi>And ſo concluded.</hi>
                           </p>
                        </q>
                        <p>Then the Governor expreſs'd his Satisfaction with their Anſwer; and gave them Thanks for their Good Will and Love to Him, and the People of <hi>Pennſylvania.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>Indians</hi> then deſired to know of the Governor, <hi>If the Men who were in Priſon for Killing their Friend and Brother were diſcharged?</hi> To which the Governor anſwered, That "they were let out upon Bail."
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:002343_0009_0FDBCCAC5312A8F0"/>
They then deſired, That <hi>the Men might be diſcharged:</hi> To which the Governor anſwered, That as ſoon as he returned to <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> he would give ſuch Orders in that Affair, as ſhould fully Anſwer the Requeſt of the <hi>Five Nations,</hi> in Order to confirm the Friendſhip that is ſo happily renewed and eſtabliſhed by this Treaty.</p>

            <p>The Chiefs of the <hi>Indians</hi> expreſs'd a great Affection for the Governor and the People of <hi>Pennſylvania.</hi> And it appeared that <hi>Satcheechoe</hi> had faithfully diſcharged his Truſt in both the Meſſages ſent by him.</p>
            <p>When our Interpreters were coming away the Chiefs informed them, That they had ſomething further to ſay to the Governor; upon which they were detained. The next Day, the 14th of <hi>September,</hi> the Governor received at his Chamber the Ten Chiefs of the Five Nations, being Two from each; together with Two others, ſaid to be of the <hi>Tuſcororoes</hi>: And by the Interpretation of <hi>Lawrence Claeſe,</hi> Publick Interpreter for the <hi>Indians,</hi> in the Preſence of <hi>Philip Livingſton,</hi> Secretary for <hi>Indian</hi> Affairs at <hi>Albany,</hi> both whom our Governor deſired to be preſent, they ſpoke as follows:</p>
            <q>
               <p>Brother Onas,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>WE here now freely ſurrender to you all thoſe Lands about</hi> Coneſtogoe, <hi>which the</hi> Five Nations <hi>have claimed: And it is our Deſire that the ſame may be ſetled with <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> in Token whereof we give this String of Wampum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Brother Onas, <hi>According to the beſt of our Underſtanding, we have renew'd at this Time with you all former Treaties between your People and us; we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore expect, that if any of our People come to trade at</hi> Philadelphia, <hi>you will order that they be received like Brethren, and have the Goods as cheap as poſſible. So we wiſh you all Proſperity and a good Journey Home.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now we are going to depart from one another, we your Brethren, the <hi>Sachims of the</hi> Five Nations, <hi>deſire that you would give us ſome Proviſions, to help us on our Journey.</hi> On which they gave 2 ſmall Bundles of Beaver and dreſs'd Skins.</p>
