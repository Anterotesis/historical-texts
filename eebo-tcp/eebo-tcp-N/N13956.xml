            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE imperfection of human nature, and the mutability of worldly things, have given birth to frequent changes, and revolutions, in kingdoms and empires. Theſe revolutions, are neceſſarily attended with ſtriking ſcenes and events, that command the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and frequently excite the wonder of the world. They alſo neceſſarily exhibit to public view, a variety of characters, eſpecially of ſuch perſons as were formed by nature for heroic atchievements; the final iſſue beſt determines, to whom the good or evil principally belongs.</p>
            <p>No doubt the providence of GOD has wiſe and good purpoſes to anſwer, by theſe things; and his hand that guides and directs them, in their moſt ſecret cauſes and operations, will be
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:017655_0004_0FA212DE8B3E1128"/>
devoutly acknowledged, by the thoughtful and the wiſe.</p>
            <p>SENTIMENTS of this kind are naturally ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, from the glorious American Revolution, which in the courſe of nature, and by the will of Heaven, has opened in our day.</p>
            <p>WE have ſeen great events produced from cauſes but ſmall in human view: we have pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in various parts of the continent famed as theatres of bloody battles: we have a large num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of names recorded for patriots and heroes; and the important ſcene, yet open on the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican ſtage, commands the attention and wonder of the world.</p>
            <p>THIS day, and the public appearances of it, impreſs our minds with an affecting remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of a ſignal event, a moſt tragical ſcene that opened in this place, from which the alarm of war was founded thro' the land.</p>
            <p>THE battle of Lexington, will not only mark a diſtinguiſhed page in the hiſtory of this war, but be remembered, and mentioned, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation to Britiſh cruelty, and with reproach to the man that ordered, and the officers that executed the bloody orders, ſo long as proper feelings of humanity, ſhall poſſeſs the human heart. We well remember our feelings on that
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:017655_0005_0FA212DF45284C18"/>
day; nor ſhall we ever forget them: the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of this town muſt have undergone more than can be well expreſſed; and the friends of thoſe who fell victims to Britiſh cruelty and murder, muſt ſtill have aching hearts.</p>
            <p>THE religious obſervance of this anniverſary, with martial appearances on the day, do honor to the town, and the cauſe of our country,—"For this day ſhall be unto you for a memorial."</p>
            <p>THOUGH it is our duty to impreſs our minds with a proper recollection of the day, and its tranſactions, which gave birth to this anniverſary, and devoutly acknowledge the hand of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, in reſtraining the wrath and rage of our enemies, and diſappointing their baſe deſigns: yet it may not be neceſſary for me, at this time, to go over the particular tranſactions of that day, or attempt a deſcription of its horrors and diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which fell ſo heavily on the people of this place. In judgment, GOD remembered mercy: and among other favours in Providence, you had your faithful paſtor to adviſe and comfort you, and lead in your devotions to GOD; and on eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry return of the anniverſary, have devoutly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged the hand of GOD. A religious ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of GOD and his Providence, is certainly the duty of a chriſtian people, under all changes and events: and to poſſeſs a frame of mind that correſponds with the meaſures of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, is a noble attainment in religion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:017655_0006_0FA212E00043DB18"/>
THE day and its events we are commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, lead to, and are interwoven with a ſeries of wonders, involving our higheſt intereſts and concerns; and alſo thoſe of poſterity.</p>
            <p>THE finger of GOD has indeed been ſo conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in every ſtage of our glorious ſtruggle, that it ſeems as if the wonders and miracles performed for Iſrael of old, were repeated over anew for the American Iſrael, in our day. The hardneſs that poſſeſſed the heart of Pharaoh of old, ſeems to have callouſſed the heart of the Britiſh King; and the madneſs that drove that antient tyrant and his hoſts into the ſea, appears to have poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed the Britiſh court and councils, and to have driven them and their forces to meaſures, that, in human view, muſt terminate in their own confuſion and ruin: and this in ſpite of the council and advice of the prudent and wiſe; and the repeated prayers and intreaties of the poor and oppreſſed Americans.</p>
            <p>AS the powers of nature, under the command of GOD, operated in favour of Iſrael of old; the ſtars in their courſes fought againſt their enemies; the ſun ſtopped in its courſe, that Iſrael might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat their victory, kings and armies were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered and ſubdued before them: So a moſt aſtoniſhing concurrence of cauſes, under the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the ſame unerring wiſdom, have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired to bring about the American revolution,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:017655_0007_0FA212E0DCE4E190"/>
Canaan was for a long time, a land of reſt and liberty for GOD'S people of old: ſo we have our raiſed hopes and expectations this day, that our land will ſoon become a quiet habitation, an aſſylum to the oppreſſed throughout the world, and the joy of the whole earth.</p>
            <p>IN miraculous productions, we ſee and own the hand of GOD, but are apt to diſregard it, in common events; forgetting that the providence of GOD ought as much to be owned and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by us in events which we can trace from their natural cauſes, as in prodigies, or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous productions, that appear to be the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate effect of the almighty power of GOD. And as this, we generally ſay, is not the age of miracles, there is ſomehow, a ſtrange and ſinful inſenſibility to the interpoſition and agency of GOD, which too generally poſſeſſes our minds. We ſtop at ſecond cauſes, but forget GOD, the great and firſt cauſe of all: we admire the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roiſm of the general; we praiſe the valour and bravery of the ſoldier;—but forget that ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is of the LORD.</p>
            <p>THE whole of our arduous ſtruggle, is indeed but a ſcene of wonder and amazement; exhibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the moſt ſtriking marks of the interpoſition and agency of GOD. However politicians have been employed, the ambition and anger of men been raiſed, and the greateſt exertions of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:017655_0008_0FA212E18B998738"/>
power put forth; yet as ſober men and chriſtians, it becomes us to look above all theſe things, and acknowledge and adore the hand of Providence.</p>
            <p>THE time, it ſeems, was come, the full pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod commenced, appointed by the councils of Heaven, in the courſe of nature, when a new Empire ſhould ariſe in the world, and a nation be born in a day; that wiſdom which governs the world, determines events, and driveth aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the nations, prepared the cauſes in the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, the moral, and political world to unite their forces and accompliſh the great event. Hence a ſpirit of liberty muſt ſtimulate this large peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and like a ſpreading torrent flow over the land: the paſſions of men muſt be arouſed: the ſword, which is never wantonly uſed but by ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, robbers and madmen, muſt be drawn; and to the reproach of humanity, ſcenes of blood and carnage muſt enſue:—Alliances muſt be formed, and battles fought, that the foundation of the new Empire, like moſt others in the world, might be laid in blood;—a foundation ſadly ominous of its future overthrow and ruin, which, in their turn and order, will be the fate of all the kingdoms and empires of the world.</p>
            <p>IT is certainly a memorable Providence, that in the beginning of the controverſy, ſuch a ſpirit of liberty ſhould ſo generally fill the land. The
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:017655_0009_0FA212E24007A508"/>
nations of Europe, it ſeems, for a long time, have been much loſt to a ſenſe of liberty. As to many of them, the body of the people are but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle better than ſlaves to their princes and kings: long inured to oppreſſion, they have become in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible to their yoke, as the ſtupid aſs to the burthen it carries. But the ſons of America had not yet loſt the noble ſpirit of their anceſtors, and therefore diſdained to be the ſlaves of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. Not diſmayed by threatenings, or dangers, they engaged in the arduous work, determined to be free; and have exhibited examples of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, virtue, perſeverance and heroiſm, that are mentioned with admiration throughout the world. In following the ſteps of Providence, our duty has been pointed out from time to time; and favourable events ſucceeding one another, we are at length conducted, by the hand of a kind Providence, within fight of the great object of our toils.</p>
            <p>As the original ſource of the American revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, under Providence, was that ſenſe of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, which was ſo univerſally impreſſed on the minds of this people, it ought in reaſon to be viewed as a ſpecial interpoſition of Providence, from whoſe dominions the hearts of men are not exempted.</p>
            <p>THIS great principle of liberty formed a u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, which neither the power nor policy of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:017655_0010_0FA212E31A5CA070"/>
have been able to break: a union, which has been conſtantly ſtrengthening and increaſing, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from thoſe very meaſures that were deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by our enemies to confound and deſtroy it. Not only our own dangers and diſtreſſes, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the ſucceſſes and cruelties of our enemies, have conſpired, under Providence, to cement this people in a band of union, which at this day may defy the rage and power of tyrants; "for it is now conſolidated by a confederation happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly compleated." Thus united and bound, theſe American States, in a collective view, form a large empire, which bids fair, in the courſe of nature, to exceed all the empires of the world; they ſpread over an amazing extent of country, that by rapid population is daily filling with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants. It is not improbable but the exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive countries of Canada and Nova Scotia will ere long be joined in the union: nor is it impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible but the Weſt-India iſlands, from their local ſituation, may, in ſome future period, become the property of theſe American States. Alas! what ſurpriſing productions, what extenſive proſpects, has this great ſpirit of liberty, under Providence produced?</p>
            <p>VERY obſervable have been the interpoſitions of Providence, in raiſing up, for us, numerous and powerful friends. Even in Britain, and in the Britiſh court, perſons of the higheſt reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for virtue and knowledge, have owned the

juſtice of our cauſe, and done much to aſſiſt and ſupport it: by their friendly aid, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from time to time, notice of the deſigns and plans of our enemy, a circumſtance of high importance and utility.</p>
            <p>BUT our greateſt human friend and ſupporter is, His Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty the King of France, whom that GOD who has the hearts of kings in his hands, diſpoſed to enter into a moſt generous alliance with theſe States; and he has given us the ſtrongeſt evidences of his ſincerity and friendſhip. From ſuch a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ally we have indulged raiſed hopes and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations, and have experienced eminent and important ſervices, that have even exceeded our expectations. We well know our abſolute need of this foreign aid, and the many ways in which we have felt the benefit of it; but I fear we are not in general ſo mindful of the hand of Divine Providence, in this particular, as we ought in juſtice to be.</p>
            <p>THAT a nation of different manners, different language and religion, and with minds barred againſt us, by national prejudices, which, like national habits, are ſtubborn and incurable by human art and addreſs, ſhould at once form ſo open, friendly, and generous an alliance, with theſe poor and oppreſſed States; that their armies and forces ſhould harmonize with ours, like bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:017655_0012_0FA212E482FC9A48"/>
in a common cauſe; and all ranks of men among them, ſo highly intereſt themſelves in our concerns, and ſo freely ſhed their blood in our cauſe, diſcovers the hand of Providence, the kind influence of heaven; and it is much too great a compliment to human wiſdom and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, to conſider them as the ſole cauſes of ſuch great events.</p>
            <p>FROM education and prejudice, we have ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally been trained up from our cradles, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive unfavourably of the French nation. We viewed them as a kind of natural enemy, and ſuch were our feelings towards them: and hence it is not ſo much to be wondered at, that ſome among us appeared to be ſo inſenſible to the vaſt importance of our alliance with France. However, a number of real facts abundantly convince us of our error and miſtake, and prove our prejudices to be ill founded. And from the beſt authority and information, as well as from our own experience, we are now induced to view and eſteem the French by far the moſt poliſhed, humane, and generous people in the world. Their naval force, which from time to time has been ſent to America, has undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly prevented our enemies from burning our ſeat-port towns: and their troops, united with the American arms, under the command of our illuſtrious General the laſt year, effected the greateſt and moſt happy event of the war; a
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:017655_0013_0FA212E541FFDF10"/>
victory that will make as brilliant a figure in hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory as any to be met with, either in ancient or modern wars.</p>
            <p>A FRIEND in need, is a friend in deed. At this day we both ſee our need of this friendly aid, and feel the happy effects of it; greater foreign aſſiſtance we could not expect; that to be inſenſible of their kindneſs, muſt expoſe us to be reproached with baſe ingratitude; and not to acknowledge the hand of Providence in this alliance, muſt bring upon us the guilt of great impiety.</p>
            <p>MEMORABLE have been the interpoſitions of Providence, in blaſting and counteracting the deſigns of our enemy, and in diſcovering and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting their mean and wicked plots and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treagues. We have often ſeen their councils turned into fooliſhneſs, and their ſecret machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations detected. When their open violence has proved abortive, they have frequently at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to effect their purpoſe by fraud and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit. As if deſpairing of ſucceſs from their troops, they have had recourſe to traitors among ourſelves. Nay, ſo great is their malice and rancour, they would undoubtedly, with wicked Saul of old, in the hour of deſpair, readily go to the witch of Endor, if they might but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their point; but there is no enchantment againſt Jacob, neither is there any divination
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:017655_0014_0FA212E7B5CDED00"/>
againſt Iſrael, according to this time it ſhall be ſaid of Jacob and of Iſrael, what hath GOD wrought? The ſame overruling Providence that blaſted their open force, has detected their ſecret fraud.</p>
            <p>THERE have been, alſo, ſignal appearances of Providence in our favour, in times of our greateſt diſtreſs and danger. When our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies have had their greateſt triumphs, and we of conſequence our darkeſt hours, ſome of our greateſt deliverances and victories have been ſent. So ſignal have been the meaſures of divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, that the greateſt proſperity and ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of our enemy, ſeem to have been ordered, to prepare them for a greater overthrow; this is the doing of the Lord, and it is marvellous in our eyes.</p>
            <p>EVERY prop our enemy ſeem to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended upon, has failed them in its turn. They have ſent their ſecret emiſaries among us, to bribe and deceive, but it did not avail. They ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times hoped for factions among ourſelves, and did all in their power to foment them, but have been happily diſappointed. They much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected our money would fail us, but have the mortification to ſee their own money ſupporting our cauſe. They once thought we could do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at fighting, for the want of arms, but now find from woful experience, that we fight them, and beat them, with their own arms.</p>
            <p>

IT not their laſt, yet their greateſt hopes and dependence appear to have been placed upon a General, differently diſtinguiſhed in Britain and America; there by his high birth and fame; here by his ſhocking inhumanity and cruelty, who was permitted for a time, greatly to annoy and diſtreſs our brethren in the ſouthern ſtates: but bleſſed be God, that General, with his whole army, are now priſoners in our hands. Verily the Lord has done great things for us, the Lord has triumphed gloriouſly.</p>
            <p>FROM a ſeries of favourable events, and the preſent aſpects of providence; from the ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of our arms; the completion of our union; the favourable change of our currency; the fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſtate of our enemy; and the deſpair of thoſe miſtaken and wretched men, that are denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated tories, we cannot but entertain raiſed hopes that our deliverance is juſt at hand, and the bleſſings of peace will ſoon be reſtored, and our independence ſecured; when this land of liberty will become a quiet habitation; the wilderneſs bloſſom like a roſe; commerce and agriculture flouriſh; the arts and ſciences be cultivated; and generations yet unborn ſhall rejoice in the happy purchaſes of our treaſure and blood.</p>
            <p>BUT notwithſtanding the great things which God has done, and is doing for us, and the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing proſpect before us, we hear from ſome few
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:017655_0016_0FA212E9020DF0A0"/>
the voice of complaint and the growls of avarice; and the general ſubject is, the burden of taxes. Alas! my chriſtian friends, what is money, to the great bleſſings of liberty? to be freed from the jaws of tyranny, to live in freedom ourſelves, and leave our poſterity after us free, are bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of infinitely more value than all the wealth of the world. The kindneſs of heaven, and the bounties of providence beſtowed upon us, are enough to huſh and ſuppreſs every uneaſy ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this kind, where there is the leaſt ſpark of ingenuity or public ſpirit. Had we loſt all our wealth, but preſerved our liberty, we ſhould have been great gainers; but by the kindneſs of heaven, we may preſerve them both.</p>
            <p>IT is true, our taxes are heavy, and demands for our exertions are preſſing, and what elſe in reaſon could we poſſibly expect? But let me tell you, that great ſpirit which firſt led us to diſdain Britiſh tyranny, that has enabled us to brave every danger, and ſurmount the greateſt obſtacles; that ſpirit which has conquered whole armies of our enemies, one after another, and humbled the pride of Britain, will eaſily prevail with us, to part with a little of our money to compleat the glorious work.</p>
            <p>INDEED, I by no means think, that we ſhall find our public charges to be ſuch mighty diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties as ſome avaricious and unfriendly minds
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:017655_0017_0FA212EB31E8FE28"/>
would feign ſuggeſt. Should the infatuation of Britain continue, and it ſeems likely at preſent it will, it will help us to money to pay our debts, as it has furniſhed us with arms to fight our battles. The immenſe ſums Great Britain is conſtantly ſending over to America, to defray the expences of her wicked war, will in the iſſue, chiefly centre in the Americans pockets. By impoveriſhing themſelves, to gratify their luſt of power and revenge, they will in fine greatly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich theſe States.</p>
            <p>A LITTLE exertion, and public ſpirit, I doubt not, will eaſily carry us through all our expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Leſſons of prudence, oeconomy and induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, are naturally inculcated upon us, when mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney is ſcarce, and taxes are high: and theſe are profitable leſſons for a people at all times.</p>
            <p>WE chearfully part with our money when we think we have a good bargain; and certainly there cannot in nature be a better bargain ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with money, than liberty for our land, and freedom for ourſelves and our poſterity.</p>
            <p>BUT, ſhould Great Britain gain their point, we may abſolutely depend upon loſing our poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions and our necks together. For there is not the leaſt ſcruple in the matter, but the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugation of theſe States would be followed with the moſt ſhocking ſcenes of hanging and gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betting,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:017655_0018_0FA212EB8DF7E998"/>
from one end of the continent to the other, that was ever known, in any country or age of the world; all promiſes, covenants, hoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and acts of parliament to the contrary not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding.</p>
            <p>LET us therefore ſteadily follow the guidance of providence, and chearfully do our duty, and I doubt not we ſhall yet ſee the ſalvation of God, and our poſterity will long rejoice in the happy fruits of our toils and wars.</p>
            <p>THE militia of this town merit a particular addreſs at this time.—</p>
            <p>TO you, gentlemen, as long as life ſhall laſt, this day will be for a memorial. You firſt felt the ſhock of the tyrant's arms, and endured the bloody ſcene. You ſaw your brethren and friends fall victims to the lawleſs power and ſword of Britain, exerted in a moſt fooliſh, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton and wicked manner. From that hour to the preſent moment, you have heard the cry of their innocent blood ſounding in your ears, and calling aloud for vengeance. Your ſpirit and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertion on that day, evidence a martial zeal and ardor in your country's cauſe: and we truſt you will always be ready to defend your country, at the hazard of your lives.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:017655_0019_0FA212EE05B4C8F0"/>
YOU never can want for motives for exerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as you never can forget the murder of your friends. You and your country will always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member with marks of diſtinguiſhed reſpect and honour, thoſe perſons that firſt fell ſacrifices to our glorious cauſe: their ſurviving friends have the pity of their country, and we heartily wiſh them the conſolation of God.</p>
            <p>As your names are recorded, and your fame extenſive, you will diſtinguiſh yourſelves, by every exertion and virtue, of patriotiſm and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic ſpirit. It is needleſs to ſay any thing to quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en your feelings of indignation and abhorrence of Britiſh tyranny, or to perpetuate an indignant remembrance of Britiſh troops; but muſt urge you to remember with gratitude to God, his kind appearance for us, in that hour of danger and rage.</p>
            <p>As that memorable day, which opened the great ſcene of the American war, and forever diſſolved our union with Britain, has been fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed with ſurpriſing appearances of providence in our favour, ſo in celebrating this anniverſary, it becomes us to bleſs and praiſe God for his manifold mercies to our land.</p>

holy religion, and take to yourſelves the whole armour of God. To a zeal for your country you will add a zeal for God. To a deſire to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer your temporal enemies, you will add a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to conquer ſatan and ſin, and obtain a victory over every ſinful luſt and paſſion. And to your ſtruggles for liberty, you will add your unceaſing endeavours and prayers, to be made free from ſin, and become the ſervants of God, that your fruit may be unto holineſs, and your end ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life.</p>
            <p>GOD, who has done, and is doing ſuch great things for us, juſtly expects, that we improve to the glory of his name.

               </gap> become us to boaſt; but we have conſtantly new and nobler motives, to ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate and encourage us. Our foreign aid and friendſhip, we perceive, is daily increaſing; and our proſpects are enlarging, and brightening in our view. More than this, we have what we no ways deſerve, the bleſſing of Heaven, and the ſmiles of Providence, in the agreeable and promiſing opening of the ſpring. I am ſure ſuch things as theſe, muſt be animating to the feelings of every ingenuous mind. The path of duty, is our path to ſafety; and in ſerving GOD, we in the beſt manner ſerve ourſelves, our country and poſterity. Let us hearken to the united voice of theſe motives and calls, and preſent ourſelves living ſacrifices unto GOD. We have the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed goſpel in our hands, which contains the calls and invitations of our glorious redeemer, and the great promiſe of eternal life.</p>
            <p>IN late years, we have paſt ſurpriſing changes; but we have all, an infinitely greater change to paſs, our change by death. We have had ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſcenes, one after another, open to our view; but they are not to be compared to thoſe inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſcenes that will open upon us in the eternal world.</p>
            <p>WE have felt much from the terrors and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larms of war; but what are theſe to the terrors
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:017655_0022_0FA212F1B18A6750"/>
of a judgment to come, and to the trump of GOD, that ſhall one day pierce our ears, and raiſe the dead. Seeing we look for ſuch things as theſe, what manner of perſons ought we to be, in all holy converſation and godlineſs.</p>
            <p>We have alſo experienced the joys of victory and triumph over our enemies; pleaſing ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to mankind in general: but they are mere trifles, to that victory and triumph over ſin, death and hell, that ſhall crown the ſolemnity of the laſt day.</p>
            <p>To be ſuperior to the fear of our enemies, is indeed a pleaſing ſenſation; but by far a nobler one, to be ſuperior to the fears of death, from a lively faith in him, who has conquered death, and ſcattered ſo much light into the gloomy man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the grave.</p>
            <p>WE are all wiſhing and praying for the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of peace, that we may enjoy quiet and reſt; but the peace of Heaven, the reſt which remains for GOD's people above, is infinitely more deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our labor, wiſhes and prayers.</p>
            <p>LET us then, never forget, that we are candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates for immortal felicity, and ſhall ſoon have done with all worldly things, and enter upon the inviſible world; and therefore be ſoberly concerned, to approve ourſelves, to our conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to our country, and to our GOD, and then unſpeakably great ſhall be our reward in Heaven.</p>
