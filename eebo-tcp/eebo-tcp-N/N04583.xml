            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>For all this I conſidered in my Heart even to declare all this, that the Righteous and the Wiſe, and their Works are in the Hand of God: No Man knoweth either Love or Hatred, by all that is before them. All things come alike to all, there is one Event to the Righteous and to the Wicked; to the Good and to the Clean, and to the Unclean; to him that ſacrific<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and to him that ſacrificeth not: As is the Good ſo is the Sinner; and he that ſweareth, as he that feareth an Oath. There is an Evil among all Things that are done under the Sun, that there is one Event unto all: Yea alſo the Heart of the Sons of Men is full of Evil, and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is in their Heart while they live.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>THERE are two Things in the Courſe of Divine Providence, which have been Perplexing to good Men, and ſtumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to the bad, and they are theſe, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Calamities of the former, and Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:005695_0003_1026C0DFA72D05B0"/>
of the latter. Of theſe <hi>Solomon</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes in the Words that I have read: The wiſe Man pondered upon this difficult Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject thoroughly, he weighed the Matter with due Deliberation, and revolv'd it in his penſive Mind, and then came to the following Declaration and Concluſion; namely, that <hi>all Things come alike to all, and that there is one Event to the Righteous and to the Wicked: i. e.</hi> All outward Things whither proſperous or adverſe, comfortable or calamitous, are promiſcuouſly diſpenſed without Diſtinction upon the Good and Bad, and therefore that God's Love or Hatred towards us, cannot be judged of or known by our outward Condition; <hi>No Man knoweth either Love or Hatred by all that is before him;</hi> he cannot reaſonably conclude that he is the Object of God's peculiar Love, becauſe his outward State is honourable, eaſy and proſperous, or that he is expos'd to the Divine Indignation, becauſe his Name is cover'd with Reproach, his Eſtate blaſted by Adverſity, and his Body rack'd by accute Pain.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Solomon</hi> indeed acknowledges, that this
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:005695_0004_1026C0E56772B1A0"/>
mix'd Diſpenſation of Things was perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Good and enſnaring to the Bad; <hi>this is an Evil</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>among all Things that are done under the Sun, that there is one Event unto all: i. e.</hi> This ſeeming Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of Events is a great Perplexity to thoſe that are pious. The Pſalmiſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us in the lxxiii. <hi>Pſalm,</hi> how much he was ſtumbled at this in the following Words; <hi>But as for me my Feet were almoſt gone, my Steps had well nigh ſlipt, for I was envious at the Fooliſh, when I ſaw the Proſperity of the Wicked, for there are no Bands in their Death but their Strength is firm, they are not in Trouble as other Men, neither are they plagued like other Men; therefore Pride compaſſeth them about as a Chain, Violence covereth them as a Garment, their Eyes ſtand out with Fatneſs, they have more than Heart could wiſh, they are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and ſpeak wickedly, they ſet their Mouth againſt the Heavens, and their Tongue walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth through the Earth, behold theſe are the Ungodly who proſper in the World, they increaſe in Riches, verily I have cleanſed my Heart in vain, and waſhed my Hands
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:005695_0005_1026C0E6EE40D200"/>
in Innocency, for all Day long have I been plagued, and chaſtened every Morning. If I ſay I will ſpeak thus, behold I ſhould of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend againſt the Generation of thy Children, when I ſought to know this it was too pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for me, until I went into the Sanctuary of God, then underſtood I their END: Surely thou didſt ſet them in ſlippery Places, thou caſtedſt them down into Deſtruction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays in the viiith of <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtes</hi> and 11. ſerves to explain the latter Part of our Text, <hi>viz. Becauſe Sentence againſt an evil Work is not ſpeedily execut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, therefore the Heart of the Sons of Men is fully ſet in them to do Evil; madneſs is in their Heart while they live:</hi> They harden themſelves in their Wickedneſs and Impenitence, by the Abuſe of God's Providence, for thus they fooliſhly argue: Well if the Caſe be ſo, that the Wicked paſs unpuniſh'd (oftentimes) and the pious are afflicted, then I'll be wicked too, its vain to be religious, for God ſhews no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to ſuch, and makes no viſible Diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between them and others in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence. But how rediculous is this Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:005695_0006_1026C0E89D7F50B8"/>
or rather Cavilling? For if God makes a due Diſtinction after Time, it is enough to excite the conſiderate Mind to Virtue, and deter from Vice.</p>
            <p>In the mean time let us obſerve the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Characters that <hi>Solomon</hi> in our Text aſcribes to the <hi>Righteous</hi> and to the <hi>Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> and the ſpecial regard that the Almighty ſhews to the former, even in this World.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. The <hi>Righteous</hi> are <hi>clean, they have clean Hands and pure Hearts,</hi> they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the habitual Dominion of no Evil, but <hi>Hunger and Thirſt after Righteouſneſs,</hi> and having an Intereſt in the great and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Promiſes of the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> it is the chief Deſire of their Hearts, and the principal labour of their Lives, to <hi>cleanſe themſelves from all filthineſs of the Fleſh and Spirit, and perfect Holineſs in the fear of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly.</hi> The <hi>Righteous</hi> are <hi>Good,</hi> not only in reſpect of their State, but courſe of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. They are juſtify'd in the ſight of God, thro' the Imputation of CHRIST'S Righteouſneſs received by Faith. The Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty juſtifies them, however Men may
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:005695_0007_1026C0EC8D0C0AC8"/>
condemn them. And they are <hi>Good</hi> in their Series of Action, not only avoiding all appearance of cruelty and injuſtice, but abounding in Acts of Kindneſs and Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence towards the Names, Bodies, Eſtates, and Souls of their Fellow-Creatures; and herein they reſemble their heavenly Father, who not only <hi>is Good,</hi> but <hi>does Good unto all, and whoſe Mercy is over all his other Works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The <hi>righteous Sacrifice;</hi> that is, they worſhip God both inwardly and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly according to his Preſcription, they make Conſcience of the ſtated Performance of it, and will not ſtick at any coſt that is requiſite for that Purpoſe. The <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices were very coſtly, and yet they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered them up ſtatedly twice a Day, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides their extraordinary Devotions at par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Seaſons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The <hi>Righteous fear an Oath.</hi> They have a Reverence for God's Name, and ſo fear to take an Oath, becauſe it is a Solemn appeal to God as a Witneſs and Judge, and when they have taken an Oath they fear to break it, leaſt hereby they ſhould incur the Divine Vengeance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:005695_0008_1026C0F00C51C730"/>But on the Contrary the <hi>Wicked</hi> are <hi>unclean,</hi> except in their own Imagination, their Hearts are unrenew'd, and Sin habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually governs over them.</p>
            <p>They are likewiſe chiefly and generally influenced by ſelfiſh Principles and Views, ſelf is the Idol they Worſhip, to this all their Actions vail: They are careleſs of the ſtated Performance of God's Worſhip, they <hi>Sacrifice not,</hi> but under ſome Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence or other habitually neglect the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or outward Part of Worſhip or both, they will not be at any pains or Coſt about Religion at all.</p>
            <p>Again ſome of them <hi>Swear</hi> raſhly and prophanely, and have no Veneration for the holy Name of God.</p>
            <p>Now altho' Things come alike to thoſe Perſons, of ſo very contrary Characters, yet their outward Condition comes from a very different Spring, and will have a a different Iſſue. This <hi>Solomon</hi> gives us a Hint of in the Beginning of this Chapter, in theſe Words, <hi>For all this I conſidered in my Heart, even to declare all this, that the Righteous, and the Wiſe, and their Works
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:005695_0009_1026C0F191C531C0"/>
are in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of God. i. e.</hi> They are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his ſpecial Conduct and Direction, their Troubles do not come by Accident, but according to the Council of God's Will, and ſhall ſurely Work together for their Good, even thoſe Things ſhall be for them, which ſeemed to be moſt againſt them.</p>
            <p>That which I am to ſpeak upon from the Verſes I have read is this, <hi>Viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the outward Diſpenſations of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence are, for the general, the ſame to the Good and Bad.</hi> There is one good Event to both. Is <hi>David</hi> rich? So is <hi>Nabal:</hi> Is <hi>Joſeph</hi> favour'd by his Prince? So is <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi> And there is one bad Event to both, is <hi>Ahab</hi> kill'd in the Battle? So is <hi>Joſiah:</hi> Are the good Figgs carry'd to <hi>Babylon?</hi> So are the bad, (<hi>Jer.</hi> xxiv. 1) Was <hi>Saul</hi> kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the Battle? So was pious <hi>Jonathan.</hi> Are not the Righteous generally afflicted in Life? And hence we are told, <hi>thro' ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Tribulations, we muſt enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God:—That ſtrait is the Gate and narrow is the Way that leads to Life, and few there be that find it:—That</hi> in this World we ſhall have Tribulation:—<hi>That
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:005695_0010_1026C0F532274F48"/>
the Righteous are ſcarcely <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>:—That they ſhall mourn and the World rejoice:— That many are the Afflictions of the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous:—That while we are in this World, we groan within ourſelves waiting for the Redemption of our Bodies:—That we are judged and chaſtened of the Lord, leaſt we ſhould be condemned with the World,</hi> (1 Cor. xi. 31.) The Church is repreſented by the prophet Iſaiah, as <hi>toſs'd with Tempeſts, and afflicted.</hi> (Iſa. liv. 11.)</p>
            <p>And have not ſome righteous Perſons been remov'd by Death in a Manner that look'd Judgment like? Thus <hi>Eli,</hi> who was devoutly concern'd for the Ark of GOD, the Glory of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and Symbol of the Divine Preſence, when he heard that this was taken by the <hi>Philiſtine</hi> Hoſts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing overcome with a Preſſure of Grief upon this Occaſion, he fell back, and by the Fall broke his Neck, and died. This look'd very Judgment like, and yet it was no doubt in Mercy to him.</p>
            <p>The Caſe of <hi>Uzza</hi> is likewiſe very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, who when he touched the ſhaking Ark, with a View doubtleſs to
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:005695_0011_1026C0F7C2416868"/>
keep it from falling, was immediately ſtruck dead.</p>
            <p>And did not <hi>Samſon</hi> alſo dye a violent Death by the Fall of a Houſe upon him, tho' he was favoured juſt before with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common divine Aſſiſtance in Anſwer to his Prayer?</p>
            <p>In the mean Time the Pſalmiſt informs us of ſome of the Wicked, That <hi>like Sheep they are laid in their Graves,</hi> they are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd off the Stage of Time with Calmneſs and Confidence.</p>
            <p>Now the Reaſons of this mix'd Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of Things to Good and Bad, are theſe following, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. This World is a State of <hi>Tryal</hi> and <hi>Probation,</hi> and not of <hi>Recompence,</hi> wherein Perſons are to be exercis'd and treated as Candidates, in Order to a future Tryal and Reward; and therefore a proper and viſible Diſtinction of Perſons in this Life, according to their different Characters is not to be expected; for that would blend two very different States together, and render a future Judgment unneceſſary in that Day when God <hi>makes up his Jewels,</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:005695_0012_1026C0F9471F4DA0"/>
as the Prophet <hi>Malachi</hi> obſerves, We may <hi>diſcern between the Righteous and the Wicked, between him that ſerveth God, and him that ſerveth him</hi> not, <hi>but not before.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2dly. GOD hereby glorifies his <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty, he does in Heaven and Earth, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Council of his Will, and who can ſay unto GOD, why doſt thou ſo?</hi> The Almighty gives no Account of his Matters to his Creatures, nor can be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign'd before a human Tribunal: <hi>His Judgments are unſearchable, and his Ways paſt finding out.</hi> It is reaſonable that God in the Diſpenſations of his Providence, ſhould magnify his <hi>Sovereignty,</hi> as well as his other Perfections. Now this appears in his doing thoſe Things which he might either do or not do conſiſtent with his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and Juſtice. An Example of which we have in the Man that was born Blind.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. The Almighty by this mix'd Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of Events to Good and Bad, promotes the <hi>Benefit</hi> of the former, and renders the latter <hi>inexcuſable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As there are dark Texts in the Holy
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:005695_0013_1026C0FBC0195C30"/>
Scriptures, which it is difficult for us to explain, <hi>which the unlearned and unſtable wreſt to their own Deſtruction,</hi> ſo there be obſcure Diſpenſations of Providence which we cannot fully unfold, and which the Wicked ignorantly and inconſiderately miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interpret, and abuſe to their own Prejudice. <hi>GOD's Paths are in the great Deep, and his Footſteps are not known.</hi> The Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty ſometimes <hi>hides the Face of his Throne, and makes Darkneſs his Pavilion.</hi> We ſee but ſome broken Shreds of the Scene of Providence in this World, and therefore are but Poor Judges of the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Harmony, and Subſerviency thereof to anſwer the great Deſign propos'd by God: But at the End of Time, when the whole Piece ſhall be opened at once to our View, then the Beauty, the Wiſdom and Deſign thereof ſhall be admir'd, then we ſhall clearly perceive the cloſe Connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that ſubſiſts between the ſeveral Parts of Providence, and their direct Tendency to anſwer the great End which Almighty GOD had in View from the Beginning, <hi>viz.</hi> His own Glory and his Peoples Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage:
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:005695_0014_1026C0FD90F070E8"/>
That gracious comprehenſive Promiſe of God to his People ſhall ſurely be verify'd in all the Occurrences of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence they meet with, which is expreſs'd in the Epiſtle of <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Romans,</hi> namely, That <hi>all Things ſhall work toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the Good of thoſe that are the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led according to his purpoſe.</hi> One Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſhall aſſiſt the Uſefulneſs of another, notwithſtanding its contrary appearance; as the ſeveral Wheels of a Watch, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding of their contrary Motions, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly promote one Deſign.</p>
            <p>Now the Afflictions that are ſent upon the People of God are of three Kinds, namely either <hi>Chaſtnings</hi> for Sin, or <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventives</hi> of Sin, or <hi>Trials</hi> of their Graces.</p>
            <p>Sometimes the Almighty <hi>corrects</hi> his People for Sins againſt Light, as a Father his Children, with a View to their Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; and this is indeed agreeable to a gracious Promiſe of the New-Covenant, that if God's People ſin againſt him, <hi>he will puniſh their Iniquities with Stripes, and their Tranſgreſſions with Rods, yet his Loving-kindneſs he will not take away, or
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:005695_0015_1026C10196CDF788"/>
ſuffer his Faithfulneſs to fail.</hi> While the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty expreſſes a holy Diſpleaſure againſt their Sins, in the Sufferings he inflicts for them, he ſhews the Love of a Father to their Perſons, in making the Affliction a Medicine to cure the Diſorder that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd it; by this ſaith the Prophet, <hi>ſhall the Iniquity of</hi> Jacob <hi>be purg'd, and this is all the Fruit to take away his Sin.</hi> More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over the bleſſed God ſhews likewiſe the Love of a Father to the Afflicted, not only in mitigating the Severity of Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, by <hi>ſtaying his rough Wind in the Day of his Eaſt Wind,</hi> but alſo in comforting thoſe that are under them by his divine Influence; when <hi>Afflictions</hi> abound often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>Conſolations do ſuperabound:</hi> And truly Brethren Afflictions are ſo far from being Evidences of God's Hatred, that they are rather Signs of his Love and Care; for as the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> informs us, <hi>whom the Lord loveth he chaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, and ſcourgeth every Son whom he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth; but if ye be without Chaſtiſement, then are ye Baſtards and not Sons; and tho' no chaſtning for the preſent ſeem to be joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:005695_0016_1026C1050AA3E468"/>
but grievous, nevertheleſs afterwards it yieldeth the peaceable Fruits of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, unto them that are exerciſed thereby.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, I may obſerve, that Afflictions are ſent ſometimes to prevent Sin in time coming, in the People of God, and not as a Chaſtning for Sin paſt; this ſeemed to be the Caſe of <hi>Paul,</hi> whom a <hi>Meſſenger of Satan was ſent to buffet, leaſt he ſhould be lifted up above Meaſure:</hi> What the particular Affliction was that Satan inflicted we cannot certainly determine, neither is it material for us to know: But thus far is certain, that it was ſomething painful, and of a humbling Tendency; and that ſent with this Deſign (by the Almighty) <hi>viz.</hi> to prevent the Apoſtle's being proud of the Abundance of Revelations which he had.</p>
            <p>Once more, another Kind of Afflictions ſent upon the People of God are <hi>Trials;</hi> this was the Caſe of <hi>Job,</hi> a Complication of Diſtreſſes aſſailed him in a little Time; the <hi>Sabeans robb'd him of his Oxen and Aſſes, and ſlew his Servants. The Fire of God</hi> (by which I believe we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:005695_0017_1026C106C4C74FF8"/>
the fiery Meteor of Lightning) <hi>fell upon his Sheep, and Servants that attended them, and conſum'd them, and one only was left to tell the doleful Tidings.</hi> His Sons and Daughters in the midſt of their Merriment were ſuddenly <hi>ſtruck dead,</hi> by the Fall of the Houſe where they were, occaſion'd by a violent Wind. All theſe Afflictions came in a thick Succeſſion, and trod as it were upon the Heels of each other. Soon after theſe his whole Body was cover'd with painful Boyls, and his Mind diſtreſſed with a Senſe of God's Anger, of which <hi>Job</hi> eſpecially complains in the following Language of Agony and bitter Paſſion; <hi>O that my Grief were thoroughly weighed, and my Calamities laid in the Ballances together; for now it would be heavier than the Sand of the Sea, therefore my Words are ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up, for the Arrows of the Almighty are within me, the Poyſon whereof drinketh up my Spirits, the Terrors of God do ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in array againſt me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that which aggravated <hi>Job's</hi> Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, was the Conduct of his Friends; who inſtead of aſſwaging his Sorrow by
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:005695_0018_1026C108617C1138"/>
proper Lenitives, poured Vinegar and Nitre into his Wounds; they try'd by all the Arts of Perſwaſion, to prove him to be a Hypocrite by his uncommon Sufferings; this <hi>Job</hi> with Juſtice oppos'd, and aſſur'd them that <hi>he would not let his Integrity go, neither ſhould his Heart reproach him as long as he liv'd.</hi> And farther informs them, that the wicked are ſometimes eaſy and proſperous, in the following ſtrong Lines; <hi>Wherefore do the Wicked live, become old, yea are mighty in Power? Their Seed is eſtabliſh'd in their Sight with them, and their Offspring before their Eyes, their Houſes are ſafe from Fear, neither is the Rod of God upon them; their Bull gendreth and failleth not, their Cow calveth and caſteth not her Calf, they ſend forth their little Ones like a Flock, and their Children dance, they take up the Timbrel and Harp, and rejoice at the Sound of the Organ, they ſpend their Days in Wealth, and in a Moment go down to the Grave.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Surely if any Afflictions on account of their Number, Weight, or ſudden Manner of Infliction, deſerve the Name of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:005695_0019_1026C10CED8ED398"/>
theſe might be ſo called that were inflicted upon <hi>Job,</hi> and yet if the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God himſelf may be allowed ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to determine the Point, they were ſo far from proving <hi>Job</hi> to be a Hypocrite, as his Friends uncharitably and vainly imagin'd, that they were not ſent for any Sin that he had done, but for the Trial of his Graces; <hi>Ye have heard of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience of</hi> Job, ſays the Apoſtle <hi>James, and ſeen the End of the Lord;</hi> that is, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of God in ſending Afflictions upon him, was to try his Patience. Tho' <hi>Job</hi> ſhew'd human Weakneſs in his Troubles, yet he wou'd not reject his God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce his Religion: And his vindicating himſelf againſt the falſe Accuſations of his Friends, and ſhewing that it was for no extraordinary Evil he had committed, that thoſe Calamities were inflicted: I ſay this Vindication was approv'd of by the Almighty.</p>
            <p>I proceed to ſay, that the Afflictions of the Wicked, are Judgments properly ſo call'd, becauſe they proceed from Wrath, and being unſanctify'd are often a prelude
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:005695_0020_1026C10F804DA6E8"/>
to their Ruin; <hi>they are ſet in ſlippery Places, from whence they fall headlong into Deſtruction.</hi> Yea all that they meet with is in Judgment, eſpecially after they reject God's Calls, and quench his gracious Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. When God afflicts them it is in the Quality of a Judge, as a proper Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment for Sin; and indeed their Want of Affliction, is one of the ſoreſt Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and hence the Almighty threaten'd the People of <hi>Iſrael, that he wou'dn't pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh their Sons and Daughters any more, for they would revolt more and more.</hi> And elſewhere Jehovah ſpeaks to the ſame purpoſe; <hi>Becauſe I have purg'd them and they were not purged, therefore will I not purge them any more until I cauſe my Fury to reſt upon them.</hi> Ephraim <hi>is joined to Idols, let him alone. Let him that is unjuſt be unjuſt ſtill, let him that is filthy, be filthy ſtill.</hi> This is juſt like a Phyſicians aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning all Care of a diſtemper'd Patient, preſcribing no more bitter Potions to him, but letting him live according to his Fancy, which is an awful Preſage of Death. The Honours Profits and Pleaſures of ungodly
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:005695_0021_1026C11232D9F990"/>
Men, tho' in themſelves they be Bleſſings, yet to them, being abus'd, they become Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; <hi>the Proſperity of Fools,</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> obſerves, <hi>deſtroys them. And becauſe they have no Changes,</hi> as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks, <hi>therefore they fear not God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But on the contrary, the Afflictions of the Righteous, however ſudden and great they be, tho' as to the Matter of them, becauſe afflictive to Senſe, they be call'd Judgments; and hence <hi>Judgment</hi> is ſaid to <hi>begin at the Houſe of God;</hi> and <hi>David</hi> reſolv'd to <hi>ſing of Mercy and of Judgment:</hi> Yet in reſpect of their Principle and Iſſue, their Spring and Scope, they are Covenant-Mercies; they proceed from the fatherly Love of God and terminate in their real Benefit.</p>
            <p>I proceed now to the Improvement of this Subject. And.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt:</hi> If the Caſe be ſo <hi>that all Things come alike to all,</hi> then ſurely the Liberty that ſome take in cenſuring Profeſſors of Religion, (under uncommon Calamities) in reſpect of their State and Actions is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unjuſtifiable and ſinful, eſpecially if their Lives be blameleſs; and yet it is almoſt
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:005695_0022_1026C113C2EE9470"/>
as common as it is uncharitable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable. When <hi>Paul</hi> after a dangerous Voyage, had reach'd the Iſland of <hi>Melita,</hi> and a Viper had faſtened on his Hand, the <hi>Pagan</hi> Inhabitants ſoon paſs'd a ſevere Cenſure upon him; they judged him to be a very wicked Man, and that tho' he eſcap'd the Dangers of the Seas, yet divine Vengeance wou'dn't ſuffer him to live: But when they ſaw that he ſurviv'd, they ſoon chang'd their Opinion, with as little Judgment, to the contrary Extreme!</p>
            <p>It ſeems by what our Lord obſerves in the 13th of <hi>Luke,</hi> that ſome of the <hi>Jews</hi> imagined that thoſe Galileans whom <hi>Pilate</hi> ſlew, as they were ſacrificing, were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly wicked Men; but our Lord op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes their unjuſt Cenſure in the following Manner, <hi>And JESUS anſwering ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, ſuppoſe ye that theſe</hi> Galileans <hi>were Sinners above all the</hi> Galileans, <hi>becauſe they ſuffered ſuch Things, I tell you nay, but except ye repent ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh.</hi> Poſſibly the <hi>Jews</hi> were enduc'd to paſs ſo hard a Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure upon the violent Death of the <hi>Galileans,</hi> becauſe they were not of their Sect or
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:005695_0023_1026C1178DBC4FC8"/>
Party, or had ſome debate with them. To ſilence this, our Lord propos'd an Inſtance of 18 of their own Party, upon whom the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>Siloam fell; think ye,</hi> ſays Chriſt, <hi>that they were Sinners above all that dwelt at</hi> Jeruſalem? <hi>I tell you nay, but except ye repent ye ſhall all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Periſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Doctor <hi>Lightfoot</hi> thinks, that this Tower, adjoyn'd to the Pool of <hi>Siloam,</hi> which is the ſame with the Pool of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſda,</hi> where the impotent Folk waited for the moving of the Waters, ſo that thoſe who were kill'd by the Fall of the Tower, were probably ſome of them, or ſome who in this Pool purified them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for the Temple Service, it being near the Temple.</q> Now while they were thus in the Way of their Duty, this ſad Accident happened, <hi>As the Birds are caught in a ſnare, ſo are the Sons of Men ſnared in an evil Time, when it comes ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon them,</hi> ſays <hi>Solomon.</hi> Theſe Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſufficiently prove, that we cannot judge of Mens Sins by their Sufferings in this World; for many are thrown into the
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:005695_0024_1026C11A0E23E750"/>
Furnace as Gold, to be purify'd, and not as Droſs and Chaff to be conſumed. This ſhould therefore give check to unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Cenſures, for hereby we are in Danger of condemning thoſe whom God Juſtifies, and bringing Guilt upon our own Minds.</p>
            <p>Seeing Almighty God ſends Afflictions for various Ends, that Charity, which hopes all Things, ſhould incline us to chooſe the moſt favourable Side, except we have very evident Reaſons to the Contrary.</p>
            <p>And yet, in nothing more do many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge a wild and ungovernable Looſe, than in raſh judging and ſeverely cenſuring Perſons under Calamities. Hereby they do, as far as in them lies, the unfriendly Office of Perſecuting, or adding Affliction to the Afflicted: Hereby they <hi>wound thoſe that God hath ſmitten.</hi> Such Treatment they would not like in their own Caſe, which they know not how ſoon it may be, ſeeing they have no greater Protection from Accidents than others.</p>
            <p>While the Prophane Herd, from an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate Prejudice againſt Religion, expreſs ſuch Sarcaſms and Cenſures on the aforeſaid
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:005695_0025_1026C11BB0001DD0"/>
Occaſion, as are inconſiſtent with the Laws of Humanity and common Decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, the ignorant Bigots of particular Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties boldly invade the divine Prerogative, and aſſert that ſuch Calamities are Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments inflicted upon Perſons for their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing their Sect, Opinions, or Humours, as if they were forſooth of God's Council, and knew all the ſecret Springs of his Providence.</p>
            <p>I think it is a juſt and unexceptionable Maxim, that the leſs Reaſon and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment any Men or Party have to offer for their Principles and Conduct, the more they are enclin'd to raſh judging and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Cenſure upon others that differ from them, having nothing that is ſolid to offer in their own Vindication, they make rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſupply the Room of Argument. And truly, in general, the leſs Knowledge, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, and true Goodneſs men have, the more they are diſpos'd to raſh judging and ſevere cenſure: But increaſe of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Grace makes Men merciful, as their heavenly Father is Merciful. In ſhort, raſh judging and cenſuring of others is a Satyr upon our ſelves, it loudly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:005695_0026_1026C11E6F801090"/>
our Ignorance, Weakneſs in Grace, or total want of it: <hi>The Heart of the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous ſtudieth to anſwer,</hi> (ſays <hi>Solomon) but the Mouth of the Wicked poureth out evil Things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Folly, the Sinfulneſs, and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of raſh judging and cenſuring the afflicted, is repreſented in ſtrong and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Colours in the Book of <hi>Job.</hi> There all that can be ſaid in ſupport of it is offer'd at large, with much Fire and Fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Diction, and it is fully and fairly confuted according to the Judgment of God himſelf, whoſe wrath was kindled againſt <hi>Eliphaz</hi> the <hi>Temanite, Bildad</hi> the <hi>Sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>hite,</hi> and <hi>Zophar</hi> the <hi>Namathite</hi> for not ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him the Thing that was right, as his Servant <hi>Job</hi> did: They were, therefore, enjoin'd to offer Sacrifices, and get <hi>Job</hi> to Pray for them, leaſt God ſhould deal with them after their Folly. (<hi>See</hi> Job <hi>Chap.</hi> 42.)</p>
            <p>It is ſtrange indeed that the Diſciples of Chriſt, who had the Advantage of the Book of <hi>Job</hi> to inſtruct them, ſhould be at a Loſs about the blind Man, as we find they were, (<hi>John</hi> ix.) <hi>And as JESUS paſſed by, he ſaw a Man which was blind
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:005695_0027_1026C122D6612BF8"/>
from his Birth, and his Diſciples ask'd him ſaying, Who did Sin, this Man or his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents that he is born blind? JESUS an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, neither this Man ſinned, nor his Parents, but that the Works of God ſhould be manifeſt in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Diſciples it ſeems took it for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that that extraordinary Calamity was the Puniſhment of ſome extraordinary Crime, which was very Cenſorious. This Divinity they had probably learn'd of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> who told the blind Man, when he ſpoke ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably of CHRIST, <hi>Thou waſt altogether born in Sin, and doſt thou teach us?</hi> But our Lord on the Contrary inform'd them, <hi>that neither this Man had ſin'd, nor his Parents,</hi> (that is, in an extraordinary Degree, ſo as to Occaſion the Calamity inflicted,) <hi>but</hi> it was <hi>that the Works of God might be made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt in him.</hi> That is, that our Lord might have the Opportunity of curing him in a Miraculous Way, and ſo of confirming the Verity of his divine Miſſion and Doctrine.</p>
            <p>The unſearchable Depths and Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Divine Providence, may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd into this: That God hereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:005695_0028_1026C1245CA271C0"/>
to manifeſt his Sovereignty and Glory, while ordinary Events are paſs'd over with Silence and Neglect, extraordinary Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents are ſent to ſummons the Notice of a ſecure World. Almighty God has ſuch abſolute Propriety in, and uncontroul'd Sovereignty over all his Creatures, that he may make them ſerve his Honour, either by doing or ſuffering, in ſuch a Way as he thinks fit: And ſurely if God be glorify'd by us either actively or paſſively, we are not made in vain.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly: Do all Things come alike to all?</hi> Then let it be obſerv'd for the Support and Conſolation of ſuch as fear God, and Terror of the Impenitent, that Things will not be always thus. It is reaſonable it ſhould be ſo, in this World at leaſt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, becauſe it is but a State of Trial; and becauſe Afflictions are many Ways uſeful to pious Souls; hereby their Pride is humbled and other Corruptions morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd; hereby their Faith and Patience and other Graces are exercis'd; hereby they are excited to a more affectionate Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of religious Duty; hereby they
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:005695_0029_1026C1261CF09990"/>
are more weaned from this World, and the Thoughts of Heaven endear'd to them.</p>
            <p>Tho' Events are mix'd here, when the next State commences there ſhall be a wide and viſible Difference; very different Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſhall then be diſpens'd, according to Mens different States and Actions; the Righteous ſhall be cloath'd with Honour and Dignity, and admitted into everlaſting Reſt and Pleaſure, while the Wicked ſhall be rais'd to Shame and Contempt, and rack'd with the accuteſt Pain!</p>
            <p>The believing Expectation of future Bleſſedneſs, may make us rejoice with Joy unſpeakable and glorious, under all the Calamities of Life; for the Sufferings of it, which are light and but for a Moment, are not worthy to be compar'd, with that exceeding great and eternal Weight of Glory which is reſerv'd for us; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> nobly obſerves, as on the one hand we ſhould not <hi>deſpiſe the Chaſtning of the Lord,</hi> ſo on the other, <hi>we ſhould not faint under it;</hi> for the ſame Afflictions we endure, either in kind or Meaſure, have been fulfill'd in

our Brethren that have gone before us to Glory: <hi>We ſhould not therefore think it ſtrange concerning the fiery Trial which is to try us, as tho' ſome ſtrange Thing hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened unto us, but rejoice in as much as we are partakers of Chriſt's Sufferings;</hi> that when his Glory ſhall be reveal'd, we may be glad alſo with exceeding Joy: <hi>What tho' now for a Seaſon, if need be, we are in heavineſs thro' manifold Temptations, that the Tryal of our Faith, being much more precious than of Gold that periſheth, tho' it be try'd with Fire, might be found unto praiſe, and honour, and Glory, at the Appearing of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> O it is a calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing comfortable Conſideration in every Diſtreſs, that every Event is under the Direction and Controul of our heavenly Father, who rules all Things with uner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Wiſdom, irreſiſtable Power, unſpotted Holineſs, inviolable Fidelity, and ineffable Goodneſs, to the nobleſt Purpoſes! O it is ſweet to think, that we are in his Hands, who numbers the very Hairs of our Head, and preſides not only over the greateſt Events, but even the moſt minute, and
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:005695_0031_1026C12CA16E9030"/>
to our Apprehenſion fortuitous Incidents!</p>
            <p>But on the contrary, the fearful Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of future Miſery, after this ſhort and tranſitory Scene expires, may juſtly allay all the preſent agreeable Senſations of the Impenitent: What avail ſuch ſhort liv'd Enjoyments, as ſo ſoon terminate in Woe and Ruin! Woe to the Wicked it ſhall be ill with them, for the Reward of their Hands ſhall be given them! But I proceed,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly: Do all Things come alike to all</hi> in the preſent State? Then let both Saints and Sinners be excited to prepare for every Event, yea even for the moſt ſudden and ſhocking Calamities.</p>
            <p>Let pious Souls ſeek and ſtrive for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of Grace and Holineſs, by a right Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of all the Means of Grace, as well as of the Dealings of God in his Providence; <hi>For ye know not what a Day may bring forth.</hi> Let us therefore <hi>go with our Loyns girt, and with our Lamps burning, for we know not when the Bridegroom comes, at Midnight, Cock-crowing, or in the Morning.</hi> While we behold the great Fathers Rod in his Hand, ſmiting any of the Family, it ſhould poſſeſs
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:005695_0032_1026C12F42D8D608"/>
every one of the Houſhold with a Fear and Reverence of his Majeſty, ſeeing that all are Sinners, and therefore deſerve his Stroaks.</p>
            <p>And ſurely Brethren, thoſe that are in a State of Sin are loudly call'd upon, by the Calamities of others to repent of their Sins, and ſeek an Intereſt in the pardoning Mercy of God: And this is indeed the Uſe that Chriſt himſelf made of the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God recorded in the xiiith. of <hi>Luke,</hi> when he had mentioned the Caſe of thoſe that were ſlain by <hi>Pilate,</hi> and by the Fall of the Tower of <hi>Siloam,</hi> he took occaſion therefrom to excite all, both Saints and Sinners to Repentance, by aſſuring them, <hi>that except they repented, they ſhould all likewiſe periſh. If Judgment begins at the Houſe of God, what ſhall the End be of thoſe that obey not the Goſpel of God? If the Righteous are ſcarcely ſaved, where ſhall the Ungodly and Sinner appear?</hi> If a pious Perſon dies ſuddenly, he will immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly paſs into a State of Glory and Bleſs; but if ye unregenerate Sinners die in your preſent Condition, ye will be unalterably fix'd in a State of unexpreſſible Miſery, beyond all Hopes of Recovery: O dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:005695_0033_1026C130D2F950A8"/>
Thought! Sirs, not only Saints but Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are expos'd to the awful Artillery of Heaven, the Thunder. Now if ye ſhould be ſtruck dead by it in your Impenitence, which you know not but you may in a little Time, except you improve the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent gliding Moments to better purpoſe; conſider your ſelves the rueful Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which I at preſent forbear to expreſs. <hi>Behold now is the acceptable Time, behold now is the Day of Salvation!</hi> Therefore Sirs, it will be your Wiſdom and Intereſt, to forbear uncharitable Reflections upon others Sentiments and Conduct, and inſtead thereof let every one try to know the Plague-Sore of his own Heart, and reform his own Practice.</p>
            <p>You are all aware, my Friends and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, that the late Stroak of the Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning which I have ſuſtain'd, has given riſe to theſe Meditations. I may aſſure you Sirs, that what I have ſpoken againſt Cenſuring in this Diſcourſe, has not ariſen from any Fear of it, or Uneaſineſs oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by it, ſo far as it reſpects myſelf; <hi>for to me it is a little Thing, to be judged by you, or by Man's Judgment;</hi> but Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:005695_0034_1026C13412E39628"/>
of Duty to God and Man, has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd me to ſpeak thus.—</p>
            <p>Concerning this Diſpenſation of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, give me leave to ſay, that I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge to the Glory of God the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of it: I am a Sinner, and as ſuch, deſerve all Manner of Miſeries in this Life, and eternal Ruin in that to come. But in the mean time I muſt declare, that I am not conſcious of any extraordinary Evil in my Conduct, for which this was ſent. I have a Witneſs in Heaven, and one upon Earth, that I have been enabled to be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right before God in the Courſe of my Life, aiming at JEHOVAH's Glory, and his Kingdom's Good; and at the very Time when this was inflicted, I enjoy'd Peace of Mind, and Nearneſs to God; and preſently after it, I had a Senſe of the Love of God as a Father, and Willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to reſign my Life, and my all into his Hands: My Soul experienc'd a humble Reverence of God's Majeſty, and a ſweet Complacence in his Dealings with me in general, and particularly in this Providence, and was therefore enclin'd a few Hours after, to bleſs his Name for it with my
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:005695_0035_1026C1378A2050D0"/>
whole Heart; and therefore the various, unreaſonable and inconſiſtent Cenſures of People upon this Occaſion, give me not the leaſt Uneaſineſs, ſo far as they concern me, but I am griev'd for their ſinful Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and Uncharitableneſs, as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect themſelves, and pray that a gracious God may forgive them, for they know not what they do.</p>
            <p>I hope, my Brethren, you will excuſe my ſaying thus much concerning my ſelf, which if I had not judg'd to be my Duty at this Time, when ſo many falſe and fooliſh Cenſures are heap'd upon me, on Account of this late awful Diſpenſation of Providence, I ſhould have wholly wav'd.</p>
            <p>And as I do not yet know, what is the particular Voice of this Providence to me, I beg the Help of your Prayers, that I may be enabled to know it, ſo far as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns my Duty, and to comply therewith.</p>
            <p>So far as I know my Heart, I deſire to bow with the moſt awful Reverence before the Sovereign Majeſty of Heaven, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign myſelf to his Government and Diſpoſal.</p>
            <p>I deſire likewiſe to take thankful Notice of that Mixture of Mercy which appear'd
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:005695_0036_1026C13A09A14948"/>
in this Providence in ſparing my Life, and preſerving my Bones from being bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, while the Flaſh of the Lighting was ſo violent as to tear my ſhoes to Pieces, twiſt one of my Buckles, and melt a little of two Corners of the other. Surely the bleſſed God has according to his gracious Word <hi>ſtayed his rough Wind in the Day of his Eaſt Wind.</hi> That which makes the Mitigation of the Stroak the more agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to me, is the Opportunity that is here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by offered of farther Service to the Church of Chriſt, and the Prevention of a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Degree of Reproach, which would in all probability have been, tho' without Ground, caſt upon my Character, and thro' that upon the Truths and People of God, had I been ſtruck dead by the Lightning at a Stroak, tho' I truſt it would have been the beſt Day to me that ever I ſaw, yet the wicked would have taken thence Occaſion to triumph and reproach without Cauſe; the Hearts of many pious People would have been griev'd, and the Weaker amongſt them poſſibly put to a Plunge to anſwer the Cavils of the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent: It has therefore pleas'd a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:005695_0037_1026C13C8A4764B8"/>
GOD to lengthen out the Thread of my Life a little longer. O may it be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd to better Purpoſe in the Service of his Honour, Truths and Kingdom!</p>
            <p>I pray God that all who hear of this uncommon Event, and eſpecially the dear People of my Charge, may be enabled to improve it to God's Honour, and their own Benefit. It ſeems, my Brethren, as if the Time in which it was inflicted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Hour of your Publick Convention, when I was wont to ſpeak to you in my Maſters Name, pointed to you to take ſuitable Notice of this Providence.</p>
            <p>Seeing my dear Brethren it has pleaſed Almighty God to threaten to remove from you at a Stroak, the Diſpenſer of the means of Grace among you, I hope it will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite you to improve with greater Attention and Care, ſuch Opportunities in time com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; forasmuch as they are ſo exceeding uncertain, and yet of ſuch great Moment.</p>
            <p>And Brethren, I think I am bound by the Laws of Gratitude to take this publick Opportunity of expreſſing my Thankfulneſs for your uncommon Sympathy with me, and Kindneſs to me under the gentle touch
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:005695_0038_1026C13F5A7715E0"/>
of a Father's Hand. Ye have not treated me with the uncharitable Severity of <hi>Job</hi>'s Friends, but with Lenity and Indulgence, the Law of Kindneſs has mov'd your Lips; neither have ye been aſham'd of my Chain. May it pleaſe a good GOD to reward you for all the Expreſſions of your Reſpect to me, and keep you from an undue Eſteem of me, who am leſs than the leaſt of all Saints.</p>
            <p>In fine Sirs, let us all be excited to liſten to and improve the awful Voice of God by Thunder in general. <hi>Give unto the Lord O ye mighty, give unto the Lord Glory and Strength, give unto the Lord the Glory due unto his Name, worſhip the Lord in the Beauty of Holineſs, the Voice of the Lord is upon the Waters, the GOD of Glory thun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dereth, the Voice of the Lord is powerful, the Voice of the Lord is full of Majeſty, the Voice of the Lord breaketh the Cedars, yea the Lord breaketh the Cedars of</hi> Lebanon, <hi>he maketh them alſo to ſkip like a Calf,</hi> Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banon <hi>and</hi> Syrion <hi>like a young Unicorn; the Voice of the Lord divides the Flames of Fire, ſhakes the Wilderneſs of</hi> Kadeſh, <hi>makes the Hinds to calve, and diſcovers the
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:005695_0039_1026C141DD181EC0"/>
Foreſt.</hi> It is but reaſonable my Brethren, that we ſhould offer Homage to that great God, who is All-ſufficient in himſelf, and whoſe Majeſtick Voice in the Thunder, produces ſuch ſudden and amazing Effects and Alterations in the Kingdoms of Nature and Providence, as have been repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Who can ſtand before this Holy Lord God, when once his Anger begins to burn? He is wiſe in Heart and mighty in Strength: Who has hardned himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God and proſpered? But tho' our Hearts ſhould be fill'd with a ſolemn Awe of God's Majeſty while we hear his Voice thundering in the Heavens, yet let the Friends of God beware of a ſlaviſh Dread of God's Judgments, and Diffidence in his Word; and let them ſweetly reſign themſelves by Faith into their Father's Hands, humbly adoring and ſilently ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to his unerring Diſpoſals, which are always Wiſe, and Juſt, and Good. <hi>Our God is a Rock, his Ways are Perfect, a God of Truth, and without Iniquity, juſt and right is he.</hi> I add no more, but Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Praiſe to God the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, for ever and ever, to which let Men and Angels ſay, AMEN.</p>
