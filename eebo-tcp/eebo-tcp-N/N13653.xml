            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <bibl>II CHRONICLES IX.8:</bibl>
               <q>Bleſſed be the Lord thy God which delighted in thee to ſet the on his throne, to be king for the Lord thy God; becauſe thy God loved Iſrael, to eſtabliſh them forever, therefore made be that king over them, to do judgment and juſtice.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HESE words were ſpoken by the Queen of Sheba, of whom honourable mention is made by our Saviour, in that ſhe came from a far country to hear the wiſdom of Solomon; who, when ſhe had come and proved him with hard queſtions, declares, that although the report ſhe had heard of his wiſdom and grandeur did far exceed her belief; yet having heard his wiſdom, and ſeen the grandeur and magnificence of his kingdom and attendance, ſhe finds reaſon to acknowledge that the half was not told her. And upon a view and reflection on theſe things, ſhe, with wonder and admiration, breaks forth in the language recorded in my text: <q>Bleſſed be the Lord thy God which delighted in thee to ſet thee on his throne, to be king for the Lord thy God; becauſe thy God loved Iſrael, to eſtabliſh them forever, therefore made he thee king over them, to do judgment and juſtice</q>.</p>
            <p>THESE expreſſions diſcover an excellent ſpirit of diſcernment, wiſdom and underſtanding in this royal female. Although a heathen, yet ſhe acknowledgeth the true God, and expreſſeth her belief of his governing providence in the affairs of this world, and in diſpoſing of men to places of public truſt, power and authority; and with devout acknowledgments aſcribes glory to him, ſaying "Bleſſed be the Lord thy God," &amp;c.—</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="unknown:017236_0005_0FA0B924228ED128"/>THE dignified character of the civil ruler is here alſo exhibited in its proper light. They ſit upon God's throne, and are veſted with their authority for the Lord their God. All power is of God: the powers that be are ordained of God. Their authority is deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from him, and is to be uſed for him: they are his vicegerents, acting by delegated authority from him; for which cauſe they are ſome times ſtiled Gods. Thus ſhe obſerves to Solomon, that he was ſeated upon God's throne,<note n="*" place="bottom">Although there was a ſpecial propriety in repreſenting the kings of Iſrael as ſeated upon God's throne in that Iſrael was a Theocracy, yet I can ſee to impropriety in applying this to civil rulers in general; which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive is warranted by the apoſtle who has ſaid, "the powers that be, are obtained of God."</note> and was made king for the Lord his God.</p>
            <p>WE may here alſo obſerve the accurate penetration and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this dignified female, in that ſhe not only traceth civil government from its true ſource, as it is derived from God; but alſo wiſely obſerves the great ends and purpoſes to be ſerved by the exerciſe of that power which particular perſons, by the allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of divine providence, are veſted with; which is to do good by the exerciſe of their authority to thoſe over whom they govern. Men are veſted with civil power, not for their own ſake; but for the benefit of thoſe among whom they are to exerciſe their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. For thus ſhe obſerves to Solomon, "that it was becauſe God loved Iſrael, to eſtabliſh them forever, that he had made him king over Iſrael, to do judgment and juſtice." Thoſe two expreſſions, "judgment and juſtice," are expreſſive of the whole exerciſe of civil government. Civil rulers are to do judgment, that they may diſcountenance and reſtrain all manner of ſin and wickedneſs, by inflicting a proper puniſhment upon offenders; and they are to do juſtice by an equitable deciſion of all contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies which ariſe between a man and his neighbour.</p>
            <p>THUS we have the remarks of a female upon the nature, ends and purpoſes of civil government: and what pity is it that any who value themſelves upon being called <hi>men,</hi> ſhould come behind her in the knowledge of theſe things; or if veſted with any branch of authority, ſhould ſo fail in the exerciſe of it, as to fall under the reproof of an old woman!</p>
            <p>IT is not neceſſary to ſuppoſe this Gentile queen was directed
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:017236_0006_0FA0B9248A2949B0"/>
by inſpiration when ſhe uttered theſe words: it is ſufficient to give a divine ſanction to my text, that it here ſtands recorded by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired pen-man for our inſtruction and admonition; wherein we not only find the dignity and duty of civil rulers pointed out; but alſo many motives briefly touched, to excite them to the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it. Their duty is to do judgment and juſtice. They muſt do judgment by puniſhing the vicious, therein rendering them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves a terror to evil-doers. As a man can have no right to hurt his neighbour; ſo neither to hurt himſelf: whence it appears to belong to the civil magiſtrate to puniſh perſonal as well as relative offences. And they muſt alſo do juſtice, by making equitable deciſions between contending parties.</p>
            <p>IT muſt be confeſſed that the power of legiſlation is not here ſo directly ſpoken of; but yet, as doing judgment and juſtice is the great and important ſervice which civil rulers are to perform for the community, therefore when they are acting in a legislative capacity, it muſt be their ſpecial care to enact ſuch laws, that the executive authority may be rendered bleſſings to a people by the due exerciſes of judgment and juſtice upon all occaſions. Indeed, the kings of Iſrael ſeem to have been veſted with little or nothing of that power which is of the legislative kind. God himſelf had framed their laws by the miniſtry of Moſes, not only for their edification as a religious ſociety, or viſible church; but alſo for their good government as a civil ſtate. We have there given us an excellent and truly divine model of civil government, worthy to be imitated by all nations. There laws are but few; expreſſed in few, but plain terms, eaſy to be underſtood. They are for the moſt part, general rules of equity; and but few ſpecial ſtatutes for particular caſes. Some few particular ſtatutes in certain caſes are given, which might ſerve as a pattern for the inſtruction of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutive authority, to direct them to the righteous application of the more general rules of government in all particular caſes that might ariſe; which men of interity might eaſily apply, ſo as to execute good judgment, and true equity among a people. When legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive powers eſſay to frame particular ſtatutes that may be a rule for the executive authority in every caſe that ſhall ariſe, it is neceſſary that their ſtatutes ſhould be very numerous; which not only makes it more difficult to find men ſufficiently acquainted with the law to put it in execution; but alſo, many times wicked,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:017236_0007_0FA0B926251627E8"/>
deſigning and crafty men invent ways to ſhelter evil actions under the letter of the law; or to ſcreen themſelves from juſtice, becauſe the judges are obliged to proceed according to the expreſs terms of particular ſtatutes. Indeed, where civil juſtice is to be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred not by particular ſtatutes, but by the application of general rules of equity, much will depend upon the wiſdom and integrity of the judges; which would make it peculiarly neceſſary in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of executive authority to practiſe upon the advice of Jethro to Moſes, "To provide out of all the people able men ſuch as fear God, men of truth hating covetouſneſs". Might we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon having men of this character for the administration of juſtice, we might be ſafe in our perſons and properties without ſuch a multiplicity of particular ſtatutes. For a man of an honeſt heart will, for the moſt part, readily ſee how to apply general rules of righteouſneſs to particular caſes, ſo as to do judgment and juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, without being confined to the expreſs terms of particular ſtatutes.</p>
            <p>But whether the affairs of a people are to be adminiſtered by the application of general rules of righteouſneſs or particular ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes adapted to each ſeveral caſe; yet it is of ſingular moment that civil rulers, in every capacity, ſhould conſider themſelves as being made rulers over a people for the Lord their God. The apoſtle Paul agrees with our text and ſpeaks of civil rulers as mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of God for good. Rom. XIII 4. They are God's miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, in that they are to ſerve him, acting as it were in God's ſtead, in doing both judgment and juſtice. It is a manifeſt inference from the divine perfections that ſin ſhall not go unpuniſhed: and theſe perfections of the Deity ought to be patterned after by all ſuch as are ſtiled God's on earth, all ſuch as bear rule among men; that it may be truly ſaid, that they act as his ſervants, vicegerents, or repreſentatives, in doing judgment upon tranſgreſſors. Every well regulated ſtate will make laws to diſcountenance and reſtrain vice and immorality of every kind. To be ſure this is the caſe with this ſtate. We have reaſon to rejoice that our wiſe and good rulers have from time to time, made good and wholeſome laws to reſtrain the vicious, to put wickedneſs to ſhame, and prevent the contagion of evil example from leading others aſtray. And it is the peculiar province of thoſe who are authorized to put the laws in execution, to render themſelves bleſſings, great and extenſive bleſſings to the people in doing judgment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:017236_0008_0FA0B926CFAFBF40"/>INDEED, ſuch civil officers will meet with many trying caſes, in their putting the good and wholeſome laws of the land into execution. If they are not men of virtue and integrity, the fear of offending on the one hand, or the hope of making friends on the other, to ſerve their own private intereſt, or ambitious views, may prove powerful temptations to connive at breaches of law, or to warp the law aſide from its true intention, and fruſtrate the ſalutary purpoſe for which it was made, either by executing ſo ſmall a puniſhment as not to render themſelves terrors to evil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doers; or allowing ſome room for criminals to make their eſcape from puniſhment. Or if we allow the judges to be men of real integrity and uprightneſs, yet the tender feelings of humanity, eſpecially in very criminal caſes, may be great temptations to bear the ſword in vain, not approving themſelves the miniſters of God, the avengers to execute wrath upon him that doth evil. But if they are miniſters of God, act by authority derived from him, are to pattern after his perfections, and be finally accountable to him for the manner in which they conduct in their office; they ought and muſt execute the good and wholſome laws of the land in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing judgment and juſtice. It is true, that although ſeveral per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons may be found guilty of tranſgreſſing the ſame ſtatute, yet there may be great difference in the aggravating circumſtances of the tranſgreſſions of different perſons; which has given riſe to that common proverb, "the ſeverity of the law is cruelty," which may ſometimes have too great an influence upon the tender feelings of the judge, inclining him to relax the puniſhment, to the detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the public, whoſe peace and proſperity often requires the faithful execution of judgment upon the tranſgreſſors. But ſuch is our happy civil conſtitution, that our legiſlative authority always have a power to relax the penalty to particular perſons, where the circumſtances of the caſe, and the public good requires it; ſo that the executive authority may, with ſafety and righteouſneſs, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in the execution of the law, leaving all ſuch relaxations of the puniſhment as any particular caſe may require, to the proper board.</p>
            <p>THE civil peace and proſperity of a community require in the firſt place, that good and wholeſome laws ſhould be enacted, for the distribution of judgment and juſtice; but if the laws, when made, exiſt only on paper and ink, what benefit can a people de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:017236_0009_0FA0B927987EFF00"/>
from them! The divine law is quick and powerful, and ſharper than any two edged ſword; and ſurely, his miniſters ought to make the laws which they execute, bear ſome reſemblance to his, in theſe reſpects; which if done, the benefits to ſociety cannot eaſily be reckoned up: But if thoſe whoſe office it is to put the laws in execution, inſtead of giving vigor and efficacy to them, do ſuffer them to languiſh and die in their hands; it is not eaſy to count the evils which muſt neceſſarily follow from it.</p>
            <p>SUCH officers cloud and darken their own reputation. It is truly an honour put upon a man, to be veſted with any branch of civil authority; thereby an opportunity is put into his hands to do the more good in the world, to render himſelf a more extenſive bleſſing, and merit the honorable eſteem and regard of mankind. But yet, if a man doth not honor his office, his office will never honor him. The higher a man is raiſed in civil rank, the more contemptible will he be in the eye of mankind, if his conduct is not ſuitable to his ſtation, ſo as to anſwer in ſome good meaſure, the juſt expectation of mankind from him, the ſolemn ties of the oath of God under which he is laid, and the important purpoſes for which he was dignified. Men may pity, but muſt deſpiſe thoſe who thus betray the truſt which the public have repoſed in them.</p>
            <p>NOR does the miſchief flop here; but the law itſelf becomes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed and contemned, when men find they may tranſgreſs without fear of puniſhment. And while ſome few laws are thus ſuffered to be trodden under fear, it emboldens wicked and deſigning men to diſregard all law, to deſpiſe government, and trample upon the authority; it opens a wide door to anarchy, confuſion and every evil work. And in this caſe, tho'e become the greateſt ſufferers, who are moſt worthy, and most deſerving of protection. Men of honeſtly and uprightneſs, who make conſcience of their ways, are hereby laid open to inſult and oppreſſion; while the wicked are ſuffered to proſper in their wickedneſs. For if the foundations be deſtroyed, what can the righteous do.</p>
            <p>AT ſome periods there is a much greater tendency to anarchy and licentiouſneſs among a people, than at others; and never was there greater danger of theſe evils, in this land, ſince the firſt ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement of it, than now. While theſe American ſtates were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent on the Britiſh crown, ſuch were the meaſures of admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, adopted by the Britiſh miniſtry, and by the King himſelf,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:017236_0010_0FA0B92873B584B0"/>
that it became neceſſary for us, in the defence of our juſt rights and privileges, to riſe up in oppoſition to their proceedings. And although many of thoſe meaſures taken in the land, were very juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifiable, in that caſe; yet ſome of them were not without their bad tendency and effects upon ſome people's minds. The leſs judicious part of mankind, who are not ſo diſcerning in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and neceſſary meaſures of civil government, have perhaps, been emboldened to find fault with, and oppoſe all government. And it is very obvious that one courſe to be taken, to prevent or remedy evils of this kind, is not to relax the laws; but to carry the reins of government with a ſteady hand; and that all the good and wholeſome laws of the land ſhould be diligently and carefully executed in doing judgment and juſtice among the people. Greater ſtrictneſs and ſeverity in the execution of the laws, ſeems neceſſary in the preſent times, to prevent the dangerous and growing evils with which we are threatned.</p>
            <p>IT is the anxious apprehenſion of many, that at preſent, we have more reaſon to fear miſery and diſtreſs ariſing from that ſpirit of licentiouſneſs, and that tendency to anarchy and confuſion, which ſeems to be working in the land, than we have from our open enemies. Therefore it concerns every one to guard against, and do what in us lies, to prevent ſuch evils. But it eſpecially concerns civil rulers, whoſe more immediate care it is to maintain peace and good order, to exert their authority in ſupport of the law, which can be done only by their diligence and <hi>faithfulneſs</hi> in doing judgment and juſtice among the people; protecting, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting and encouraging the virtuous; and frowning upon and puniſhing the vicious. The virtue of patriotiſm, at ſuch a day as this eſpecially, ought to meet with all countenance and reſpect; and on the other hand, the oppoſite vice of treachery calls aloud for the purſuit of vengeance. Our noble patriotic army, which under God, is our chief bulwark, and the support of every thing dear and valuable to us, ought by no means to be neglected; but ſhould receive all poſſible ſupport and encouragement. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe all ſuch friends to the ſtate, which act in leſſer circles, ought to meet with ſupport and encouragement; while ſuch as are ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical to our freedom and protection expoſe themſelves to our juſt indignation. Such as are inimical and treacherous, have acted very different parts in the preſent day. Some have acted an open
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:017236_0011_0FA0B9290C061C18"/>
part, and have gone and joined the enemy; while others have choſen ſtill to continue at home among us; who have been much more hurtful to us, and helpful to the enemy, than thoſe who have gone off, and openly joined them. They, many of them, maintain a ſecret correspondence with the enemy, give them intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, carry on a clandeſtine trade with them; they lie as a dead weight, throwing every clog and hindrance in the way of all our movements and efforts for our own defence; to them it is princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally owing, that our paper currency has ſuffered ſuch a great and rapid depreciation; and our land ſo exhauſted of proviſions to feed the enemy, as greatly to diſtreſs and diſcourage our own army. Every argument therefore, which will juſtify us in our oppoſition to Great Britain, ſtrongly plead for our moſt vigorous efforts to detect, and make examples of ſuch ſecret enemies as endeavour to conceal themſelves among us. It cannot therefore ſurely, be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that a civil officer, of whatever rank, whoſe duty it is to execute the law, should shew more lenity towards a tory, than to a friend of his country; or be, by any means, backward, or inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midated from doing judgment and juſtice in that caſe, yea, or in any other, wherein the peace and good order of the ſtate are inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted. Nor are there any weighty and powerful motives wanting, to quicken every one to diligence in the duties of his ſtation. Our text ſuggeſts ſeveral conſiderations of great weight, to influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence thoſe who are cloathed with authority, to exert themſelves in their own ſtations, to preſerve and promote the peace, good order, and proſperity of the people. As</p>
            <p n="1">I. THE hand of God is acknowledged, in putting men into their ſeveral ranks and offices, in a civil ſtate. Thus faith the Queen to Solomon, "Bleſſed be the Lord thy God, which delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in thee, to ſet thee on his throne." It is the Lord's doing, and his hand is to be acknowledged in it. "For promotion cometh not from the eaſt, nor from the weſt; but God is the judge; he putteth down one, and ſetteth up another." Whatever methods are uſed in chooſing men, and inveſting them with authority, yet all is under the controul of the wiſe and all-governing providence of God. For "the lot is caſt into the lap, but the whole diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing thereof is of the Lord." When therefore men are called into places of public truſt and improvement, they are to remember,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:017236_0012_0FA0B929D4E015F0"/>
that the finger of God is in it. Which conſideration, if duly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to, plainly ſhows a ſpecial obligation hence ariſing, to quit themſelves with diligence and faithfulneſs, in their public truſt. Nor are they to look upon the call of God in his providence, which has ſeated them in places of public improvement, as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing a burthen, but as conferring a bleſſing, for which, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the example of the queen in our text, God's name is to be bleſſed. For there is not only an honour thereby put upon a perſon, but alſo an advantage for more extenſive good and uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in our day and generation.</p>
            <p n="2">II. CIVIL rulers are likewiſe to conſider that their power is the power of God. Our text repreſents them as ſeated on God's throne; and put into office for the Lord their God. And the apoſtle Paul tells us, "There is no power but of God; the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that be, are ordained of God." Rom. xiii. 1. God himſelf is the ſupreme Governor of the world. But it is his pleaſure not to perform the whole of government immediately himſelf, but to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove his ſervants, as his inſtruments, in the exerciſe of ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of it. Thus the apoſtle ſpeaks of the angels of light, as miniſtring ſpirits, ſent forth to miniſter unto them which ſhall be heirs or ſalvation. Heb. 1.14. That noble order of beings eſteem it an honour to be employed in public ſervices, even for the good of mankind who are ſo far below them. And they are faithful, zealous and very active in it. For we are told that "he maketh his angels ſpirits, and his miniſters a flame of fire." And ſhall not men, when thus honored and authoriſed of God, feel them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves animated to diligence and faithfulneſs? They are rulers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der God, and are to act in God's ſtead in doing judgment and juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice in their ſeveral ranks and ſtations. Hence it is that they are ſtiled Gods. Pſalm LXXXII 6. "I have ſaid, ye are Gods, and all of you are children of the moſt high." If then, civil rulers are put into office that they might exerciſe this branch of divine au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and make use of God's power in doing judgment and juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice among their fellow creatures; it ſurely ought to animate and influence them to diligence and faithfulneſs in it. And is it not a kind of ſacrilege to pervert this divine prerogative to bad pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes? Or even not to improve it to the good ends for which it was conferred upon them?</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:017236_0013_0FA0B92A9C9AA1C0"/>III. ARE civil rulers God's miniſters? Are they not then, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable to him for their conduct in that ſtation? Although they are Gods, they ſhall die like men. Death is the great leveller of mankind, which ſwallows up all diſtinctions which have taken place in this life, puts both rulers and ruled upon an equal foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the grave, that they may ſtand in an equal rank in the day of judgment. The great men of the earth will be treated with no more ceremony and reſpect in that day, by their judge, than the meaneſt beggar on the dunghill; but every one muſt give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of himſelf to God, for his improvement of the talents he has received. God's ſervants here in this life, receive their talents ſome more, ſome leſs; ſome receive ten, others one; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their receipts, muſt their account be. All the ſolemn ſcenes therefore, of the day of judgment, and all the rewards and puniſhments of an incomprehenſible eternity, ſtand before every one, before rulers as well as ruled, as ſo many motives to diligence and faithfulneſs in the duties of their ſtation.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. GOOD and faithful rulers are repreſented as expreſſions of the love of God to a people. It was becauſe God loved Iſrael to eſtabliſh them forever, that he ſat ſuch a wiſe king over them to do judgment and juſtice. Good rulers are a great bleſſing, and the adminiſtration of judgment and juſtice will be of unſpeakable advantage to a people. And when a people are favoured with ſuch, they are to look upon it a token for good, an expreſſion of divine love, and a reaſon to excite them to bleſs the Lord. The Queen of Sheba, in our text, though not intereſted in the proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Iſrael, bleſſed God under a view of it. To be a bleſſing in the world, a bleſſing in our place, day and generation is a very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable thing. Therefore when Abraham was ſent abroad in the world, that he might be ſupported and encouraged to duty under all trials and difficulties, God promiſed to make him a bleſſing. Gen. XII.2. Thoſe who are veſted with civil authority are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by put into a capacity to render themſelves bleſſings, great and extenſive bleſſings in the world: but then they are ſo, only in caſe of their due and faithful diſcharge of their public truſt. And ſhall not this be attended to as an effectual argument, and prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing motive to ſtir up such to diligence and faithfulneſs? Can any one bear the thought of being held up to view, and placed in a
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:017236_0014_0FA0B92B80E92398"/>
conſpicuous ſtation in civil life, that he may appear as an inſtance of God's anger againſt a people, rather than as an expreſſion of his love? And be indeed a curſe rather than a bleſſing? No, I would hope better things, though I thus ſpeak.</p>
            <p n="5">V. IT is farther implied in our text, that ſuch civil rulers as will do judgment and juſtice, are peculiarly neceſſary to the eſtabliſhment of a ſtate. It was becauſe God loved Iſrael, to eſtabliſh them forever, that he gave them ſuch a wiſe ruler as Solomon was.</p>
            <p>THE ſtability, ſtrength and firmneſs of a ſtate very much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the ſkilfulneſs and faithfulneſs of its rulers. While good government is maintained, the State will flouriſh, and make a reſpectable figure in the world; but when civil rulers neglect their duty, ſlacken the reigns of government, and are not careful to maintain righteouſneſs and equity; the State becomes fickly and will ſoon fall into decay. Hiſtory will furniſh us with many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of ſtates that have flouriſhed in the world, while regularity, order and good government were maintained in them; but have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards fallen into diſgrace, and crumbled into nothing, through the corruption and perverſion of government.</p>
            <p>THESE American ſtates are now in their infancy, and but juſt riſing up, and making their appearance in the world; much ſtill remains to be done for their eſtabliſhment. To this end the war muſt be vigorouſly proſecuted; the army be kept up, be ſuitably provided for, encouraged and rewarded; and our enemies counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted in all their plots and ſchemes. We have a very powerful enemy to oppoſe, aided and aſſiſted by treacherous and ſecret ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies among ourſelves; for whoſe detection and ſuppreſſion the vigour of law and utmoſt vigilence and activity of our rulers, ſeem peculiarly neceſſary and important. Good government alſo muſt be kept up among ourſelves; which is the moſt effectual method to obtain reſpect, credit and influence abroad. A well eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtate will be a terror to a foreign enemy, and be always ready to make a defence againſt every attack. There can be no better ſecurity againſt the approach of an enemy, than to be in a well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prepared ſtate for a defence. And one principal thing in which preparedneſs for making a defence conſiſts, is to be in a ſtate of peace, regularity and good order among ourſelves; which never
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:017236_0015_0FA0B92C0C2C5D10"/>
can be the caſe, without the due exerciſe of civil government, in the faithful adminiſtration of judgment and juſtice among a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Whether we regard the internal ſtrength, peace and proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the ſtate, or its external honour, reſpect and influence; civil government muſt be maintained, good and wholeſome laws muſt be enacted, and life and vigor given them by ſuch as are authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and betruſted with the care of putting the laws in execution. The ſafety of the whole ſtate, and the good, the ſafety and intereſt of each individual of which the ſtate is compoſed, loudly call for theſe things at the hand of civil rulers.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. ARE civil rulers God's miniſters? Then ſurely, they may hope for his bleſſing on them, and preſence with them, in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of the duties of their ſtation. Difficulties are to be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and trying diſcouragements muſt be encountered and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come; wherein we need to attend to every animating conſideration; among which, this ſurely muſt be of great weight, that "God is with us." Civil rulers are cloathed with authority by God, they are ſeated on his throne, and employed in his ſervice; and may therefore hope for his bleſſing to crown their faithful endeavours in the duties of their ſtation. The encouraging hopes of civil ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers in this caſe are not only warranted from their being God's ſervants, but they are alſo much ſupported by experience, and the manifeſt tokens of the divine preſence, in ſupporting the cauſe of truth and righteouſneſs; and especially in the things which tend to the eſtabliſhment of this, as well as of the other independent ſtates of America. Time will not allow me to enumerate parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular inſtances; but the over-ruling hand of divine providence has been often ſo conſpicuous in the events of the preſent war, as to extort a confeſſion, even from infidelity itſelf, that it is God that fighteth for us; which tokens of the divine preſence ought to have a very animating and quickening influence upon every rank and order in the civil ſtate to exert themſelves for the eſtabliſhment, peace and proſperity of the ſtate.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. CIVIL rulers have powerful motives to diligence and faithfulneſs in the duties of their ſtation, from the proſpect of a divine reward. Are civil rulers God's ſervants? Then to him they muſt look for their reward. No wonder, if in this life, they
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:017236_0016_0FA0B92CD7A28980"/>
meet with unkind returns from an ungrateful world; but their labour is with the Lord, and their reward with their God. If they are truly faithful, yet a little while, and they ſhall receive that bleſſed <hi>euge,</hi> Well done, good and faithful ſervant; enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>APPLICATION</head>
               <p n="1">I. THE way for a people to be bleſſed with good rulers, is to ſecure an intereſt in the love of God. It was becauſe God loved Iſrael, that he ſet a wiſe king over them. All our bleſſings come from God, the father of lights, from whom deſcends every good and perfect gift. When a people corrupt themſelves, abuſe their privileges, and yield themſelves to their own luſts, to be led away by an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God; they forfeit his favours, provoke his anger, and pull down his judgments upon themſelves. God will then curſe their bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, take away his abuſed favours, remove from them the hedge of his providence, and open the door for a variety of calamities to make inroads upon them. Nothing therefore can be of greater concern to us, both with reſpect to our temporal and eternal intereſts, than to ſecure the favour and love of God. For we have the teſtimony of the apoſtle, that "Godlineſs is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable unto all things, having the promiſe of the life which now is, and of that which is to come." And the wiſe king of Iſrael, ſpoken to in our text, alſo tells us, "That righteouſneſs exalts a nation: but ſin is a reproach to any people." God once gave Iſrael a king in his anger, and took him away in his wrath. If therefore civil rulers do not prove bleſſings to a people; although ſuch rulers may be highly criminal in not anſwering the good purpoſes of their appointment, yet the people ought firſt to look at home, and remember that it is ſome God provoking wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs among themſelves, that is the reaſon why divine providence has not ſmiled upon them, and given them the bleſſing of good rulers.</p>
               <p n="2">II. WHEN a people are bleſſed with good rulers, the hand of God is to be acknowledged in it, with praiſe and gratitude. Even this gentile queen in our text, bleſſed God on account of his love
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:017236_0017_0FA0B92E58380708"/>
to Iſrael, in ſetting a wiſe king over them to do judgment and juſtice. Good rulers are a great bleſſing to a people, while they, with diligence and faithfulneſs, attend to the duties of their ſtation, adminiſtering judgment and juſtice, in the execution of the good and wholeſome laws of the land. The benefits thence ariſing are very great and deſirable; which ought to be acknowledged as coming from the ſame divine Benefactor, who is the bountiful given of all our enjoyments. To him therefore, a tribute of praiſe and thankſgiving is due from a people thus ſmiled upon of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. This is a favour which carries its bonds of duty along with it; and the people are to expreſs their gratitude for it, not in words only, but in actions; by leading peaceable and quiet lives in all godliness and honeſtly, under this good and faithful adminiſtration of civil government. It belongs to the people to give countenance to, and to ſupport and encourage civil rulers in their adminiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of government. This will render the ruler's duty the more eaſy to him, and the more efficacious and beneficial to others. Yea, this is what people are obliged to do, for conſcience toward God; and is one way in which they are to expreſs their praiſe and thankſgiving to their divine Benefactor for the bleſſings of good government.</p>
               <p>THE public occaſion of this day, calls upon me, in a particular manner, to addreſs the important thoughts contained in my text, to the General Aſſembly of this State now convened. And firſt to his Excellency our Governor:</p>
               <p>MAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY:</p>
               <p>OBEDIENCE to your Excellency's commands having called me into this deſk, upon this public occaſion; give me leave, ſir, to congratulate you for the ſingular honour God has put upon you, in your early introduction into the chief ſeat of authority in Connecticut, when it was a colony to the British crown; conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing you in that ſeat through the revolution, to this day; and improving you as a very important inſtrument in his hand, for the eſtabliſhment of this free State. Although your vigorous efforts, and ſpirited endeavours in the defence of our liberties and privileges, and for the effectual eſtabliſhment of this State, are ſuch as merit the eſteem and thanks of the public; yet all ſuch
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:017236_0018_0FA0B92F086C5B58"/>
among us as wiſh ſucceſs to the Britiſh arms, look on them with an evil eye; and will therefore, by all means in their power, ſeek your removal. But promotion cometh not from the eaſt, nor from the weſt, nor from the ſouth: God is the judge, he putteth down one, and ſetteth up another. So long as God has any further ſervices for you to perform, in this public ſtation, your excellency ſhall ſit ſecure, in this chief ſeat of government, and as we truſt, will uſe your authority for the Lord your God, and for the good of the State over which you preſide.</p>
               <p>LET me also addreſs myſelf to his honour, the DEPUTY GOVERN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OR, to the honourable members of COUNCIL, and the reſpectable REPRESENTATIVES of the people, in General Court aſſembled.</p>
               <p>MAY IT PLEASE YOUR HONOURS, AND WORTHY GENTLEMEN,</p>
               <p>IT is my duty to remind you, as directed in my text, that you are by the providence of God, ſeated upon his throne, and put into office for the Lord your God. And we encourage ourſelves to hope that it is becauſe he hath loved this State, to eſtabliſh it forever, that he has called you to your ſeveral public ſtations, to do judgment and juſtice. That you may be the happy inſtruments of ſo great a bleſſing, and an expreſſion of the love of God to this people, it is not only neceſſary that good and wholeſome laws ſhould be enacted, but alſo enforced by the executive authority of the State: life and ſpirit, vigor and efficacy muſt be given them among the people, by proper officers, who will exert themſelves, in carrying the law into execution. Such officers are not only to ſerve the people at large, but they are more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately the ſervants of this General Aſſembly. You have the appointment of them; and therefore reaſon dictates, that to you they ſhould be accountable for their conduct in their ſtations.—If there are any who betray their truſt, neglect the duties of their ſtation, or act an unworthy part, ſurely the people may juſtly expect ſome remedy, from the Aſſembly. The firſt and moſt effectual method to eſtabliſh this State, is to eſtabliſh the influence of law and rule in the minds of the people; which can only be done by giving life and ſpirit to the law, by diligence and faithfulneſs in the execution of it. To hold the reins of
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:017236_0019_0FA0B92FC70DE880"/>
government with a ſlack hand, eſpecially in ſuch a day as this, when people are ſo apt to break over all rule and order, will open a door to many evils which afterwards cannot eaſily be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved. When men are called up to public view, and ranked in the ſeveral ſtations of civil government, for maintaining order and regularity among a people, an opportunity is given them to become extenſively uſeful; but whether they ſhall be eſteemed as an expreſſion of God's love to a people, or of his anger; whether they ſhall be a bleſſing, or a curſe, muſt be made appear by their conduct in their ſtation.</p>
               <p>THE people of Connecticut, when they were a government, and now ſince they have been an independent State, have had reaſon to bleſs God that he has placed ſuch upon his throne of civil power, and made them rulers for the Lord their God, as have been happy inſtruments of our civil eſtabliſhment, by their wiſdom, diligence and faithfulneſs in doing judgment and juſtice. And we hope and pray ſtill to continue under the divine ſmiles in this reſpect; and that it will appear that God loves this people ſtill, and has it in view to eſtabliſh us more and more, by giving us ſuch to fill the ſeveral ſtations in the government, as will approve themſelves rich bleſſings by diligence and faithfulneſs in their ſeveral departments.</p>
               <p>As a conſiderable number of Miniſters of the Goſpel are preſent in this Aſſembly, I ſhall now take the liberty to addreſs may diſcourſe to my brethren, in the ſacred character.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reverend Sirs,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>MANIFEST it is, that it comes within our province, to uſe our endeavours to promote the adminiſtration of judgment and juſtice among the people of our charge. Indeed, to win ſouls to a ſaving union with Jeſus Chriſt, muſt be the chief and great ſcope of our labour: but then, it concerns us ſo to acquit ourſelves in the miniſtry which we have received of the Lord, that we may be able to ſay, "We have not ſhunned to declare the whole council of God." All the doctrines of the goſpel are to be laid open, that the people may be found in the faith; and the ſcope and tendency of theſe truths, for the purpoſe of holy living, muſt be urged upon their conſciences. To preach morality, is as really preaching Chriſt, is when we preach articles of faith.—
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:017236_0020_0FA0B93088422E78"/>
And as it becomes a good ſteward of the manifold grace of God, to deal out to every one, a portion in due ſeaſon; ſo there are certain times when we have ſpecial calls in divine providence, to warn againſt particular ſins; and more eſpecially to urge the practice of ſome particular duties; which calls of divine provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence may be eaſily known by all ſuch as duly obſerve the ſigns of the times, and the common practice of the people. The great prevalence of iniquity in the preſent day, is obvious to all men, which is a loud call to us, to cry aloud, and ſpare not, to lift up our voice like a trumpet, to ſhew our people their tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, and the houſe of Iſrael, their ſins. And although it belongs to civil officers to execute judgment on tranſgreſſors; yet, it alſo belongs to us to warn the wicked, that they may turn from their wicked ways. It belongs to us, not only to bear teſtimony againſt vicious practices; but alſo, to encourage our rulers in their vigorous endeavours to ſuppreſs all vice and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morality; and to inforce upon the people due ſubjection to order and good government; which plainly appears from that ſpecial charge of the apoſtle Paul to Titus, in Tit. iii.8. "This is a faithful ſaying, and theſe things I will that thou affirm conſtantly, that they which have believed in God, might be careful to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain good works: theſe things are good and profitable unto men."</p>
               <p>LET me finally direct my diſcourſe to the people at large.</p>
               <p>You ſee in the text, that civil rulers are ſeated on God's throne; they are veſted with authority for the Lord their God; and the deſign of God therein, is to ſhew his love to a people by their exerciſe of this authority, in doing judgment and juſtice.—It belongs therefore to every one, not only to be in ſubjection to government themſelves, but alſo to ſupport and encourage civil rulers in the diſcharge of their office. For ſhall we acknowledge that the adminiſtration of judgment and juſtice is the great bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing which God means to confer upon a people by the miniſtry of civil rulers, and yet not be careful ourſelves to abſtain from thoſe vices, and to practiſe thoſe virtues in which the great and good purpoſes of civil government are anſwered? Nor is it enough that we confine our own conduct within the rule of duty; but it belongs to every one to diſcourage and diſcountenance all
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:017236_0021_0FA0B9316B601C58"/>
