            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A SERIOUS ADDRESS.</head>
            <p>THE religious obſervation of the Sabbath, in an holy abſtinence from the common buſineſs and amuſements of life and a devout attendance upon Publick Worſhip, is ſtrongly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by the command of God, and the practice of his people; by many expreſs aſſurances of his gracious approbation of thoſe who have ſo kept the day holy,—and by ſolemn threatenings againſt ſuch as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piouſly profane it. <q>Thus ſaith the Lord, take heed to yourſelves, and bear no burden on the ſabbath day, neither do ye any work, but hallow ye the ſabbath day as I commanded your fathers. Jer. xvii. 21, 22. If thou turn away thy foot, on account of the ſabbath, from doing thy pleaſure on my holy day, and call the ſabbath a delight, holy of the Lord and honourable, and ſhalt honour him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleaſure, nor ſpeaking thine own words, then thou ſhalt delight thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the Lord, &amp;c. Iſaiah lviii. 13.
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:018896_0003_0FA82B06DF31A050"/>Whoſoever doeth any work therein, that ſoul ſhall be cut off from amongſt his people. Exod. xxxi, 14.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The notorious profanation of the chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ſabbath by perſons that call themſelves chriſtians, either in unneceſſary buſineſs or journeys, carnal pleaſures or idle viſits is a ſad evidence of that infidelity and impiety which neither fear God nor regard man: eſpecially among a people upon whom the ſanctification of the ſabbath, by refraining from theſe practices and attending upon publick worſhip, is ſtrictly enjoined both by the laws of God and their country. But I would hope better things of many into whoſe hands this addreſs may fall; that they neither openly profane the Sabbath, nor entirely forſake the aſſembling of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves together; nay that ſome of my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, ſincerely concerned for the honour and ſucceſs of divine ordinances, lament every irregularity obſervable in thoſe who attend upon them. And an irregularity they muſt certainly acknowledge it is, to come late to the houſe of God. The prevalence of this evil cuſtom in ſome congregations has been long complained of both by miniſters and private chriſtians: they are convinced of the impropriety of the practice: they ſee and feel many inconveniences ariſing from
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:018896_0004_0FA82B078C90A8D8"/>it: and are apprehenſive it cannot but be diſpleaſing in the ſight of God. For their ſakes, and from a real regard to the beſt intereſts of all who may have been affected by it, I beg leave, in the following pages, to recommend a more exact and regular attendance.</p>
            <p>I ſhall take it for granted that my reader acknowledges it his duty to attend upon divine ordinances—that hours of atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance are fixed, as convenient as may be to the majority of thoſe who uſually meet at the ſame place;—and that methods are, or may be made uſe of by every one for aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaining them. I cannot likewiſe but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that moſt ſerious chriſtians as well as miniſters acknowledge the evil of coming late into the houſe of God, and lament and blame the practice in others; nor ſhould I ſuppoſe that any ſuch would attempt to juſtify it in themſelves. To confirm ſuch in ſo good a cuſtom who have hitherto maintained it, and to ſecure a more conſtant and ſerious attention to it in others who have been remiſs, I would remind them,</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>That an early attendance is decent and orderly.</hi> The apoſtle Paul has enjoined it upon chriſtians that "all things be done decently and in order," 1 Cor. xiv. 40. The precept ought to be attended to through
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:018896_0005_0FA82B08CB08AD30"/>life: even in the common and leſs intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing concerns of it in the ſhop, in the field, and in our own houſes; but much more in the houſe of God, and in matters that reſpect and decorum of divine inſtitutions. And does it not appear to every one high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proper and becoming that the ſame ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, meeting together in the ſame place, to engage in the ſame devotional ſervices, ſhould all enter upon the ſolemn ſervice together, and be able to continue in it without interruption? Is not every one ſtruck with the impropriety of a miniſter's being obliged to begin with little more than half his congregation? Are not the laws of decency and good order notoriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly violated by thoſe who are breaking in upon the worſhip and aſſembly of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God five, ten, or fifteen minutes after the time appointed? This is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly indecent and diſorderly, and ought therefore to be avoided, eſpecially as,</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>The whole ſervice is of ſuch importance that no part of it ſhould be loſt.</hi> It is inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted for the good of ſouls: to fit them for an honourable and uſeful diſcharge of all the duties of this life, and for joining the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect in the devout, exerciſes of the temple of God above. He that appointed the means
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:018896_0006_0FA82B09569737E8"/>knew our need of them; and, unleſs utter ſtrangers to our own hearts, we muſt know it ourſelves. A wiſe concern, therefore, for our beſt intereſt, will teach us to value thoſe ſeaſons and privileges which are adapted to promote it, and make us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to ſuffer delays by which it would be in any meaſure injured.</p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>By coming late, perſons not only loſe an important part of the ſervice, but are like to ſuffer diſadvantage through the whole.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether the introductory part of divine ſervice be ſinging, reading the ſcriptures, or praying for a bleſſing on the whole, no one of theſe ſacred exerciſes can be neglected without ſuffering loſs; and yet ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, I am ſorry to ſay, are often too late for them all. Beſides depriving themſelves of theſe, ſuch forfeit that bleſſing, upon which the ſucceſs of all ordinances depend, when they neglect to unite with his people in aſking it: and ſome are hereby thrown into that hurry and diſcompoſure of mind which muſt unfit them for engaging with advantage on the ſubſequent part of the ſervice. Thus are they ſinning againſt their own ſouls, and almoſt as effectually loſing the benefit of their ſacred and moſt valuable privileges as if they entirely neglected them. It may alſo be obſerved, that,</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:018896_0007_0FA82B09D7386988"/>
IV. <hi>The time uſually employed in publick worſhip, is ſhort.</hi> I cannot expect this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration will be felt or even acknowledged by thoſe who have no reliſh for divine or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances. They ſay, of every hour ſpent in the worſhip of God, <q>What a weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is it! when will the Sabbath, when will the ſervice be over!</q> But the devout mind muſt account all the hours of it ſhort, not only in compariſon of the worſhip of heaven, where the ſervants of God are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented as ſerving God day and night in his temple, but ſhort likewiſe when compar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the hours employed in worldly bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, animal gratifications, and the purſuit of temporary gain. The whole Sabbath is but one day in ſeven, and only three or four hours of that are ſpent in publick worſhip. And when we have not more than one for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth part of our time for ſo reaſonable and important a ſervice, it would be equally fooliſh and ungrateful to ſuffer the leaſt loſs of ſo ſmall a proportion of our lives; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially conſidering the precarious tenure up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which we hold theſe privileges. We may ſoon be confined from ordinances; very ſoon be deprived of them, and that forever. Say not "you loſe little"—out of a little, that little is too much to be loſt; and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that evil habits grow. If you can ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:018896_0008_0FA82B0A8DD2D950"/>yourſelf in loſing five minutes now, by and by you may be eaſy with the loſs of ten; and it will be nothing ſtrange if, by growing indulgences of this ſort, you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come quite careleſs about the time of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ere long entirely abſent yourſelf one part of the day, nay at length quite forſake the aſſembly of God's people—Many have run great lengths in impiety from very ſmall beginnings.—It therefore concerns us, in this caſe as in all others, to attend to the counſel of the apoſtle Paul, <q>Abſtain from the appearances of evil.</q> It is further obſervable, that,</p>
            <p n="5">V. <hi>The things which uſually occaſion delays can neither juſtify the inregularity, nor make us amends for the loſs ſuſtained by it.</hi> The moſt conſcientious, regular, and zealous chriſtians, may ſometimes be unavoidably late through the great diſtances of their habitations. Though it has been long and generally obſerved that moſt of thoſe who come from villages, two, three, four, and five miles off, are more regular and early in their attendance, than many who live within a few doors of the ſanctuary. And I will beg leave to carry the obſervation farther, as I have ſeen, and heard of, poor chriſtians, and even pious women who have been in their places in the houſe of God,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:018896_0009_0FA82B0B492B1F48"/>after toiling through foul weather and bad roads on foot, ſometime before many of their wealthy neighbours who have horſes, and even carriages to conduct them thither. Yet through diſtance, unfavourable ſeaſons, and a difference of clocks, perſons may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times be not only innocently, but pitiably late. Bodily infirmities or neceſſary engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments may detain ſome, and works of mercy others. But little need be ſaid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this ſubject if theſe were the only occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the irregularity long complained of in many of our religious aſſemblies. Is it not often the conſequence of lying unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily and unreaſonably late in bed on the Lord's-day morning? Does not an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due attention to dreſs, or too much concern about proviſions for the body, often occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this ſymptom of indifference to the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual entertainments of the houſe of God? Is not the true reaſon why ſome are no earlier there, that they have been buſying themſelves needleſsly and criminally in their own houſes, nay in their ſhops or in their fields? Are not others indolently ſauntering away the hours of public wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in idle amuſements, or ſuffering them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be betrayed into an indecency af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronting to their Lord and his church, in complaiſance to the ill-timed intruſions of
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:018896_0010_0FA82B0C1044A858"/>Company; who at ſuch ſeaſons ſhould be diſmiſſed with the juſt apology and reproof of a previous and more important engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Perſons who ſuffer themſelves to be thereby detained from the houſe of God, ſeem afraid of being wearied with the length of the ſervice, or want ſpirit and management to contrive for it. No one will dare to offer ſuch excuſes as theſe to the Maſter of aſſemblies; there are few but would be aſhamed to urge them in vindication of their conduct to their fellow worſhippers. Whatever advantages any may expect from trifling with ordinances on ſuch conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they will find them a poor recompence for the loſs of one ſingle ſabbath, or even the leaſt part of its ſacred ſervices. Need I remind my reader,</p>
            <p n="6">VI. <hi>That the ſpirit and practice of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God in all ages of the Church</hi> is a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther recommendation of a diligent and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular attendance upon divine ordinances. The devout Iſraelite, when confined from them, poured out his ſoul in the moſt bitter lamentations, and made it his fervent pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to be reſtored to them. Pſalm 42. "As the hart panteth after the water-brooks ſo panteth my ſoul after thee O God, my ſoul thirſteth for God, for the living God, when ſhall I come and appear before God? Pſ, 63.
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:018896_0011_0FA82B0CEE12FF88"/>O God, thou art my God, early will I ſeek thee, my fleſh longeth for thee, in a dry and thirſty land where no water is, to ſee thy power and thy glory ſo as I have ſeen thee in the ſanctuary." And again Pſ. 84. My ſoul longeth, yea even fainteth for the courts of the Lord."—That good man moſt thankfully embraced the privilege whenever admitted to it, Pſalm cxxii. "I was glad when they ſaid unto me, let us go into the houſe of the Lord."</p>
            <p>And He who was at once the ſon of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid and his Lord, even Jeſus whom we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo profeſs to honour as <hi>our</hi> pattern, has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended a decent regard to the ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God's houſe and a diligent attendance upon them by making it his cuſtom, as in Luke iv. 6. we are told he did) <q>to go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſynagogue on the Sabbath day.</q> Nor let his followers in the preſent age forget the practice of thoſe their brethren in Chriſt Jeſus, who, after their Lord's departure, on the firſt day of the week, aſſembied together for divine worſhip.—Among other records preſerved of them, that in Acts x. 33. ought by no means to be overlooked or forgotten, where we find that, when Peter came into the aſſembly, they had to ſay, <q>Now are we all here preſent before God to hear all things that are commanded thee of God.</q>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:018896_0012_0FA82B0D8B4E9F70"/>Our forefathers could frequently ſay the ſame when they followed their teachers dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven into corners, and had travelled many miles in the night to ſecure opportunities of attending on their miniſtrations. <q>The word of the Lord was precious in thoſe days;</q> and they were unwilling to loſe a moment of thoſe ſeaſons of grace which they ſought for their ſouls good at the peril of their lives. Then were chriſtians alive to God, and ſelt the power while they kept up the form of Godlineſs. They went with pious zeal and eager haſt to the houſe of God in company, in the ſpirit and language of the recovered captives, aſking the way to Zion with their faces thitherward, and ſaying, "Come, let us join ourſelves to the Lord in a perpetual covenant that ſhall not be forgotten." Jer. l. 4.</p>
            <p>I cannot forbear reciting in this connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a pleaſing anecdote related of the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the pariſh of <hi>Durſley</hi> in <hi>Glouceſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire;</hi> when under the miniſterial care of the Rev. Mr. <hi>Joſeph Woodward;</hi> a faithful and very zealous preacher of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel at the time of Charles the ſecond's reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and who, with two thouſand of his brethren, was ejected by the act of unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, Auguſt 24, 1662. <q>
                  <hi>Durſley,</hi> when he came to it, was ſo very diſſolute that it
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:018896_0013_0FA82B0E69E4FDA8"/>was commonly called <hi>Drunken Durſly</hi> But it was much altered both in character and circumſtances by his labours.</q> And (which is the fact I had chiefly in view) <q>inſtead of a contempt for the miniſtry and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of Chriſt, and ſpending their Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths in ale-houſes as they had done before, after he had preached awhile among them, ſuch was their affection for him, for one another, and the houſe of God, that he ſeldom went thither alone. For his houſe being diſtant from the church the length of a long ſtreet, all got their families ready ſtanding at their doors as he came by, and ſo attended him and fell in with the others that were following; ſo that he literally went with the multitude to the houſe of God. Every one's zeal ſeemed inflamed by the flame he beheld in his neighbour, and his was the moſt compoſed and affected congregation that could any where be ſeen.</q>

            <p>I muſt beg leave to urge, as a farther conſideration,</p>
            <p n="7">VII. <hi>That coming late occaſions great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbances both to miniſters and fellow worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers.</hi> The comfort of a miniſter's ſervices to himſelf, and the acceptance with which they are like to be attended to others, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:018896_0014_0FA82B10D5D76670"/>greatly, under God, on the compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of mind with which he engages in them. We may therefore urge this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with our people both on their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count and our own.—You reſpect your miniſters, you would not do any thing that ſhould hurt them, or leſſen their uſefulneſs. You know they are thinking, and praying, and labouring for you, in their retiremen's, between one ſabbath and another. But you have not perhaps conſidered a remiſs and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular attendance upon their public mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations as an ungenerous return for the thought and time they employ, and the pains they take, both in the houſe of God and in their own, for your ſalvation.—You do not ſurely know, cannot conceive the confuſion, the hurry of ſpirits which coming late occaſions them: how often they loſe that recollection and poſſeſſion of themſelves by it, which is ever of great importance. You would feel the inconvenience yourſelves if your domeſtics were coming in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually while you were engaged in your family devotions; but perhaps not half ſo much in your private dwellings and ſmall houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds as miniſters do before many hundreds in publick aſſemblies. Indeed all around are immediately affected by this irregulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Their hearing is interrupted, their
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:018896_0015_0FA82B11DC66F730"/>eyes attracted, their hearts grieved by and for their fellow-worſhippers, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently their attention drawn off, before they are aware, from ſubjects upon which they ought and wiſhed to have their minds ſteadily fixed: and thus their ſouls are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of much of the pleaſure of their moſt important ſeaſons. In this caſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as in all others, ſhould we take care that we <q>give no offence to the church of God,</q> 1 Cor. x. 32. I ſhall only urge one conſideration more, viz.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. <hi>Coming late is an affront to the God we worſhip, and the Great Head of the chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian church upon whoſe ordinances we attend.</hi> The God who has inſtituted publick worſhip has aſſured his people of his preſence in all places where he records his name. Jeſus, our exalted Lord, revealed himſelf to John af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his aſcenſion, in theſe words, <q>I am He that walketh in the midſt of the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den candleſticks.</q> Rev. ii. 1. meaning his churches: and when upon earth he ſaid to his diſciples, <q>Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midſt of them,</q> Mat. xviii. 20. In the midſt of them, among other purpoſes, to inſpect their behaviour. But how muſt the conduct of thoſe appear to him who betray ſo much indolence, and
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:018896_0016_0FA82B1363962F08"/>indifference to the honours and privileges of his preſence as to ſuffer almoſt every trifle to keep them away from his houſe at the hour appointed? Do they not ſeem afraid of being too long in his preſence and engaged in his ſervice? May he not from hence charge them as he did an ancient people with ſaying, <q>It is vain to ſerve God, and what profit is it if we keep his ordinances?</q> Mal. iii. 14. Indeed by ſhortening the hours of divine worſhip they are robbing God, and that in ſuch a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legious manner as muſt certainly be moſt diſpleaſing to him, whoſe we are, and whom we are bound to ſerve; beſides, it betrays a degree of irreverence and diſreſpect to the Majeſty of Heaven that we ſhould be aſhamed of in our conduct towards an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſovereign. Were we invited, with our brethren, at ſuch an hour, into the royal preſence, and encouraged to preſent our petitions before the throne, with aſſurances of a gracious audience and a merciful an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, we ſhould not, we could not ſuffer ourſelves to be later than the time appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Nay we ſee men of buſineſs eſteem it a point of honour to be punctual to their appointments one with another. And I am told that perſons who frequent faſhionable entertainments uſually take care to be in
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:018896_0017_0FA82B138E6D7B40"/>time there, nay that many go half an hour, and ſometimes more than an hour, before it begins, rather than loſe any the leaſt part of a favourite amuſement. I am ſorry to have occaſion to call the thoughts of chriſtians to the Exchange and the Play-houſe to learn from thence punctuality in their attendance on the houſe of God. I would much ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther charge it upon them by the love and eſteem they bear for their Creator and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, and the pious gratitude they owe for all the bleſſings of Providence and Grace beſtowed upon them; by the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence they profeſs for divine inſtitutions, and by every wiſh and deſire they entertain of the preſence and bleſſing of the Moſt High: that preſence and bleſſing of his, to which ordinances owe their efficacy, upon which we depend for the true enjoyment of life in every connection and condition, and which is the joy and glory of heaven. I would hope nothing more need be ſaid to induce ſerious chriſtians to attend early up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on publick ordinances. But when any are unavoidably late I moſt earneſtly entreat and exhort them to uſe every poſſible pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution in their manner of entering the place and going to their ſeats, that they may diſturb their miniſter and fellow-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers as little as poſſible. Some perſons,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:018896_0018_0FA82B1452489678"/>by the incautious manner in which they open and ſhut the doors of the place, hurry to their ſeats, and run up the ſtairs into the galleries, add greatly to the nuiſance of their irregularity. As this is often obſervable of young people I mention it that thoſe who have the care of them may take proper methods with them to prevent it. Nay I hope that my reader will alſo obſerve here, that what has been ſaid to enforce an early attendance at the houſe of God, may, and ought to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as recommending a <hi>reverent and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectful behaviour</hi> in it—as reproving <hi>drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs,</hi> and every mark of <hi>inattention</hi> there—as evincing the folly and ſin of <hi>entirely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking the aſſembling of ourſelves together,</hi> or <hi>going to publick worſhip only one part of a ſabbath</hi>—and as capable of being urged with equal force and propriety againſt the practice of <hi>running out before the concluſion of the ſervice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Every one may and ought to attend upon publick ordinances where they are adminiſtered in a manner that appears to him moſt agreeable to the word of God, and for his ſpiritual edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It is a chriſtian's duty to Chriſt and his own ſoul to ſeek ſuch a privilege; and, when ſecured, whether near or at a diſtance,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:018896_0019_0FA82B151F242B00"/>carefully and thankfully to embrace and improve it. To attend ſtatedly and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly there. Roving about from place to place, one ſabbath, or one part of the day, here, and another there, without fixing in any ſociety, indiſpoſes men to ſerve the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of Chriſt any where with ſpirit and ſteadineſs, unſettles the mind, and, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging a taſte for novelty, diverts it from the moſt important and uſeful ends of hearing. Miniſters cannot well know their hearers, and therefore can neither pray properly for them, nor ſpeak ſuitable to them, when their congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations are thus fluctuating; and though hearers may be ſometimes ſtruck with a new voice, language, and manner, they can neither underſtand nor retain what they hear from various miniſters ſo much to their ſolid and laſting improvement, as from one with whoſe ſtyle and method, by long uſe, they become familiarly acquainted. A tree often removed bears no fruit.</p>
            <p>But I proceed to offer ſome directions to render an early and regular attendance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on publick worſhip eaſy and profitable.—</p>
            <p>Theſe I ſhall only juſt mention, and that in as few words as poſſible.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Endeavour to get the time for begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning publick worſhip fixed and properly obſerved in the place where you attend.
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:018896_0020_0FA82B15CD5F37C0"/>When it is ſeen that the miniſter, and a reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectable part of the congregation are punc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual in their attendance, it may be hoped that the good effects of ſuch a regulation will ſoon be apparent on the whole.</p>
            <p n="2">II. In order to aſcertain the time exactly, keep your clocks or watches regular; and ſee that they be rather too faſt than too ſlow on the Lord's day Morning. Thoſe who have neither, may obſerve a ſun-dial, or ſome well regulated clock, in their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Riſe early on the Lord's day Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; eſpecially if you are at any conſiderable diſtance from the houſe of God, as you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be in time there, to have opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of imploring the divine bleſſing, in your retirements and families, upon the ſeaſons and means of grace with which you are favoured.</p>
            <q>
               <l>"Up, ſleeper, from thy bed. At earlier hour,</l>
               <l>"From ſadder bed, for thee thy Saviour roſe."</l>
            </q>
            <p n="4">IV. Theſe who wiſh to be both able and diſpoſed to riſe at a proper time on the Lord's day, and indeed to be ſir, when they are up, for the ſacred duties of the ſabbath, ſhould retire early to bed the evening be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and endeavour to diſengage them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as ſoon as poſſible on the ſaturday evening from the cares and hurries of buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:018896_0021_0FA82B169A06FAA8"/>and houſhold affairs, that they may have time for thoſe devout exerciſes which will be preparatory to a more comfortable and profitable attendance upon publick or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances on the Lord's day.</p>
            <p n="5">V. Let not the precious hours of the Lord's day be ſpent, either in exceſſive or delicate eating, or drinking, or in thoſe need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ornaments of dreſs, by attending to which the cultivation of the mind would be neglected for the ſake of that outward adorning of the body, which calls off the attention both of the wearers and ſpectators from objects infinitely more worthy the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice and regard of immortal, yet dying crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and the diſciples of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. It may be a hint worth attending to by all, eſpecially thoſe who live at a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that they would do well to ſet out in good time from their own houſes, ſo as to be in their places four or five minutes before publick worſhip begins; that by a ſhort reſt, recollection, and ejaculatory ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to God, they may be the better pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the ſolemn ſervice: allowing like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe for unexpected hindrances, and varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in clocks. If people only aim at being preſent juſt at the time of beginning, they will often be too late.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. Above all let me intreat my reader
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:018896_0022_0FA82B1762A049D0"/>to cultivate a reverence for ordinances, and for him who has appointed them, together with a governing regard to the important ends of theſe ſacred inſtitutions. The love of Chriſt ſhed abroad in the heart; that zeal of the houſe of God which ate him up; a lowly fenſe of our need of improvement, and a diſpoſition like the apoſtle Paul's, to preſs towards the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Chriſt Jeſus, would not need many arguments to recommend the means of grace, or a regular and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent attendance upon them.</p>
            <p>It has been often obſerved, and it is matter of very ſerious and intereſting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration to us, that ſocieties, in this and many other reſpects, are as their miniſters. The general turn of a people becomes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, devout, and zealous by attending on the miniſtrations, and obſerving the ſpirit and walk of a faithful and active ſervant of Chriſt, who lives the doctrine he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and appears, by the fervour of his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for them, and the aſſiduity of his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours among them, to long after the people of his charge in the bowels of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, a formal, trifling, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolent miniſter, who diſcovers little or no heart for his work, or concern for the ſouls committed to his care, ſpreads a ſpirit of
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:018896_0023_0FA82B1808E63E78"/>formality and lukewarmneſs all around him. They ſee him indifferent to the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Godlineſs in his own heart and life, it appears in the ſtrain of his public ſervices, and the lifeleſs manner in which he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms them: obſerving him negligent of the rules of good order in the houſe of God, a ſpirit of indolence and inactivity ſpreads among them, and if they do not expreſsly plead his example, it has its ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret and powerful influence upon them. In the caſe before us, if a miniſter be irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and inaccurate in his time of begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning publick worſhip, his people not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when to come will be more ſo in their attendance: when they have obſerved him half a quarter of an hour too late one day, no wonder if they are a quarter the next.</p>
            <p>And, if I might take the liberty of ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſting the farther hint, I would remind my brethren with myſelf, that it becomes us to take heed that we do not weary our hearers either by the unreaſonable length of our ſervices, the unprofitableneſs of our matter, or the heavineſs of our manner in the performance of them, but endeavour to diſmiſs them continually under ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions as may tend to make the ſabbath a delight, and the return of it deſirable. <hi>Amen.</hi>
