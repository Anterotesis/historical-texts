            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WE are now on a peculiar and awful Subject, which requires your ſtrict Attention.</p>
            <p>For as the learned, <hi>Ainſworth</hi> well obſerves, This is the moſt doleful Pſalm in all the Bible: full of Lamentation, Mourning and Woe, from the Beginning to the End; without the leaſt Gleam of Hope or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, unleſs it be in the 1ſt. 2d, and 13th Verſes; where the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſeems to ſignify—He apprehended, that all his Salvation muſt come from God, and that it was at leaſt <hi>poſſible</hi> that God might hear and ſave him: but higher than a <hi>bare Poſſibility</hi> thereof, in his Diſtreſs and Darkneſs, he does not ſeem to riſe</p>
            <p>But to clear the Text and help us to improve it; I propoſe, with the divine Aſſiſtance, to conſider theſe four General Heads—</p>

            <p>This has been indeed conteſted among the Learned. But it being of Moment in the Caſe before us, we muſt endeavour to clear this Matter.</p>
            <p>For in the <hi>Title</hi> of <hi>this Pſalm,</hi> the Compoſure ſeems to be aſcribed to <hi>Heman</hi> the <hi>Ezrahite,</hi> as the <hi>following Pſalm</hi> to <hi>Ethan</hi> the <hi>Ezrahite:</hi> And as there were a <hi>Heman</hi> and <hi>Ethan</hi> two famous <hi>Brethren</hi> for <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> and another <hi>Heman</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> chief and contemporary Maſters of the ſacred <hi>Muſick,</hi> of the Tribe of <hi>Levi;</hi> ſome learned Men aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe theſe two Pſalms reſpectively to the <hi>two former,</hi> and others to the <hi>two latter.</hi> For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>two firſt</hi> were the Sons of <hi>Zerah,</hi> the Son of <hi>Judah,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> ii. 3,—6. And as <hi>Zerah</hi> when a Youth about <hi>ſeventeen Years</hi> of Age, <note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Chronological Tables,</hi> added to <hi>Saurin's</hi> Diſſerations.</note> went with his Father <hi>Judah,</hi> and Grand-father <hi>Jacob</hi> into <hi>Egypt;</hi> it ſeems his Sons <hi>Heman</hi> and <hi>Ethan</hi> were born and liv'd and died <hi>There</hi> within the Compaſs of the <hi>two Hundred</hi> and <hi>fifteen</hi> Years of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> Continuance in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt;</hi> and were there ſo famous for their <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> that even King <hi>Solomon</hi> was afterwards compared to them; 1 <hi>King.</hi> iv. 31. But</p>
            <p n="2">2. As <hi>Levi</hi> had three Sons, viz. <hi>Gerſhom, Kohath</hi> and <hi>Merari;</hi> there was another <hi>Heman</hi> who was the Son of <hi>Joel,</hi> the Son of <hi>Samuel</hi> the Prophet, of the Family of <hi>Kohath;</hi> which <hi>Heman</hi> liv'd in <hi>David</hi>'s Reign, and is called a <hi>Singer,</hi> or the chief of the Muſicians, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> vi. 33. i. e. choſen by the <hi>Levites</hi> and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of by <hi>David,</hi> Chap. xv, after his reigning at <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bron</hi> ſeven Years and an half from the Death of <hi>Saul,</hi> and upon the Death of <hi>Iſhboſheth</hi> aſcending to the Throne of all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> taking Mount <hi>Zion,</hi> and there building his Palace, placing the Ark and Tabernacle,
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:007769_0005_102E7930DD88DA20"/>
and ſetting the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Levites</hi> in their ſeveral Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders for the beauteous carrying on of the public Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: <hi>Aſaph</hi> of the Family of <hi>Gerſhom</hi> ſtanding at <hi>Heman</hi>'s Right Hand, and <hi>Ethan,</hi> ſometimes called <hi>Jeduthun</hi> of the Family of <hi>Merari,</hi> on his Left, when they led the ſacred Songs with Inſtruments of Muſick before the Ark and in the Tabernacle.</p>
            <p>And it ſeems ſurprizing, that ſo many learned Men ſhould ſuggeſt the <hi>former Heman,</hi> and <hi>Ethan</hi> of the Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> while in <hi>Egypt,</hi> were the Authors of theſe two Pſalms reſpectively. For, (1) It ſeems by no Means likely that <hi>Poetry</hi> and <hi>Pſalmody</hi> were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd to ſuch Perfection among the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in thoſe early Times before the Days of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and near a <hi>Hundred</hi> Years before their coming out of <hi>Egypt:</hi> and according to ſuch a Suppoſition, the 88th &amp; 89th <hi>Pſalms</hi> ſhould in the Order of Time have been placed ſo many Years before the <hi>Song</hi> in the 15th Chapter of <hi>Exodus;</hi> which being compoſed by that moſt learned and admirable Writer <hi>Moſes,</hi> is generally accounted to be the <hi>firſt divine Song</hi> extant in this lower World<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (2) The <hi>only Reaſon</hi> why any learned Men imagine the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers of <hi>theſe two Pſalms</hi> reſpectively were <hi>Heman</hi> and <hi>Ethan</hi> the Sons of <hi>Zerah,</hi> is becauſe the <hi>Titles</hi> call them <hi>Heman</hi> the <hi>Ezrahite</hi> and <hi>Ethan</hi> the <hi>Ezra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hite:</hi> But whoever reads the <hi>following Pſalm</hi> aſcrib'd to <hi>Ethan,</hi> will find ſuch preciſe Accounts of God's <hi>having raiſed up, anointed</hi> and <hi>eſtabliſhed David</hi> on the Throne of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> with the ſolemn <hi>Oath</hi> which God had made him of the Continuance of his Offspring on it, and as having caſt off and abhorred his anointed, ſeemingly made void his Covenant, and profan'd his Crown, by caſting it to the Ground  as is utterly inconſiſtent with the Time of <hi>Ethan</hi> and <hi>Heman,</hi> the Sons of <hi>Zerah,</hi> who lived above <hi>four Hundred</hi> Years before <hi>David</hi> had a Being. But (3) What intirely
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:007769_0006_102E7933DDD471B0"/>
decides the Matter is, that in the very <hi>Title</hi> of <hi>this</hi> 88th <hi>Pſalm,</hi> 'tis ſaid to be <hi>for the</hi> SONS <hi>of</hi> KORAH, <hi>to the chief Muſician Maſchil of</hi> HEMAN <hi>the Ezrahite.</hi> For <hi>Korah</hi> was the Grand-ſon of <hi>Kohath,</hi> as <hi>Moſes</hi> was, and went out of <hi>Egypt</hi> with him: and from <hi>Ko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah</hi> deſcended <hi>Heman,</hi> appointed the chief Maſter of the ſacred Muſick in the Reign of <hi>David;</hi> as in 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> vi, xv, &amp; xxv.</p>
            <p>But why both <hi>Heman</hi> in the <hi>Title</hi> of <hi>this Pſalm,</hi> and <hi>Ethan</hi> of the <hi>next,</hi> are diſtinguiſhed by the Name <hi>Ezrahite,</hi> ſeems at preſent utterly uncertain.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Heman</hi> is alſo called <hi>the King's</hi> [i.e. King <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid's</hi>] SEER <hi>in the Words of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> xxv. 5. which ſeems a Character yet higher and more diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing: For it ſeems to ſignify, that he was an inſpired Prophet, as his Grand-father <hi>Samuel</hi> had been, and as <hi>Gad</hi> then was: who were both called <hi>Seers;</hi> and in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> ix. 9. we read — <hi>Before time in</hi> Iſrael, <hi>when a Man went to enquire of God, thus he ſpake, "Come and let us go to the Seer:" for he that is now called a</hi> PROPHET, <hi>was before time called a</hi> SEER; — as well as that this <hi>Heman</hi> was choſen and appointed to <hi>preſide</hi> over that prophetical and ſacred Work of ſetting forth the Praiſes of God, by Pſalms, Trumpets and high ſounding Cymbals &amp;c.</p>
            <p>By all theſe Things it appears, that <hi>Heman</hi> was a Man of eminent Deſcent and Piety, high in the Eſteem of the <hi>Levites,</hi> and high in the Eſteem of King <hi>David,</hi> and by them exalted to a high Place of Dignity and Influence.</p>
            <p>And yet all his inward Qualifications join'd with all theſe outward Reſpects and Honours did not ſecure him from a conſtant Series of Affliction, even from his Youth all along to his advanced Age. For at the <hi>Time</hi> of his being raiſed to his ſacred Dignity, which ſeems to be at the Tranſlation of the Ark and Tabernacle to
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:007769_0007_102E7935639FE368"/>
Mount <hi>Zion,</hi> and before the penning of this Pſalm, we read in the ſame Verſe, viz. 1 Chron. xxv. 5; <hi>God gave to</hi> Heman <hi>fourteen Sons and three Daughters:</hi> And if they were all born at the Time of his Exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, He was now come to hoary Hairs of Piety, and 'tis likely even to <hi>Threeſcore</hi> Years of Age, when he compos'd this Pſalm, even to be ſung in Publick at the Tabernacle in ſuch ſorrowful Strains as theſe— <hi>I am afflicted and ready to die from my Youth up;</hi> while <hi>I ſuffer thy Terrors I am diſtracted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it ſeems highly probable, that he knew ſome, if not many others in the Aſſembly, his Companion <hi>Aſaph</hi> it ſeems was one as we may ſhow hereafter, in the ſame diſtreſs'd Condition, &amp; could readily join with him in ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this moſt mournful Ditty. Yea others alſo, and even thoſe who were then rejoycing in the Light of the Face of God ſhining on them, might yet affectionately join in ſinging this Song with <hi>Heman</hi> &amp; <hi>others.</hi> For <hi>Love</hi> to good People is a wondrouſly uniting Principle: it makes us one with them: it makes us feel as they, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyc'd as they, diſtreſs'd as they, and with them to Pray and Praiſe as they.</p>
            <p>Yea, <hi>Heman</hi> in <hi>this very Pſalm</hi> before us, in the very Darkneſs of his Diſpondency;— yet cannot help giving ſeveral plain <hi>Intimations</hi> of his <hi>excelling Piety.</hi>— As for Inſtance—</p>
            <p>In ver. 1, <hi>O Lord God of my Salvation, I have cried Day and Night before Thee!</hi> He believ'd in the only true, living and ſupream God Jehovah—the ſame God who had reveal'd himſelf to all the ancient Prophets inſpir'd before him, and in all his Inſpirations by them. He apprehended and in Faith look'd up to Him, as the God of his Salvation: and in Faith and Prayer he had continually cried before Him, as in his Eye and Preſence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:007769_0008_102E79381994A908"/>In ver. 2, <hi>Let my Prayer come before Thee: incline thine Ear unto my Cry!</hi> Tho' the Lord had ſo long, ſo many Years deny'd him; yet he gives not over; but retains ſuch an high Eſteem of God, as after all to apprehend there might yet be Room for Mercy, and therefore prays and cries unto Him ſtill.</p>
            <p>In ver. 5, He repreſents it as an <hi>Aggravation</hi> of his Affliction, that he was as one lying in the Grave, <hi>whom God remembers no more.</hi> The tho't of <hi>being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred by God no more,</hi> was very grievous to him— a plain Hint of his inward Piety, as apprehending <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>remembring him</hi> to be the only Scource of Happineſs and Comfort to him.</p>
            <p>In ver. 6, <hi>Thou haſt laid me in the loweſt Pit, in Darkneſs, in the Deeps.</hi> Wherein he piouſly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes his Faith in the <hi>ſpecial Providence of God,</hi> and aſcribes his Miſery and Darkneſs to his Hand &amp; Will.</p>
            <p>In ver. 7, <hi>Thy Wrath lyeth hard upon me; and thou haſt afflicted me with all thy Waves.</hi> It was not meerly his <hi>Affliction,</hi> but his Apprehenſion of the <hi>Wrath of God</hi> as the moſt preſſing <hi>Weight</hi> or <hi>Sting</hi> of his Affliction, which chiefly grieved him, as it does the truly pious: He feels his Troubles as the overwhelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Waves of God's Diſpleaſure, as the Pious in ſuch Caſes do: And his Apprehenſion of the <hi>Wrath of God,</hi> implies a <hi>deep Senſe</hi> of the <hi>greatneſs of his Sins,</hi> for which alone the Wrath of God could be excited.</p>
            <p>In ver. 8, <hi>Thou haſt put away mine Acquaintance from me: Thou haſt made me an Abomination to them.</hi> Where his Faith in the <hi>ſpecial Hand and Providence of God,</hi> is again expreſſed.</p>
            <p>In ver. 9, <hi>Lord I have called upon Thee: I have ſtretched out my Hand unto Thee!</hi> His paſt Faith in God, with his importunate Applications to him, and his preſent eying Him are again repeated.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:007769_0009_102E793C7232A988"/>In ver. 10. 11. 12. He repreſents his Caſe to be ſo deplorable, that his Salvation ſeem'd exceeding difficult and unlikely.—<hi>Wilt thou ſhew Wonders to the Dead? Shall the Dead ariſe and praiſe Thee? Shall thy Loving-kindneſs be declared in the Grave; or thy Faithfulneſs in Deſtruction? Shall thy Wonders be known in the Dark; and thy Righteouſneſs in the Land of Forgetfulneſs?</hi> And yet in ver. 13, <hi>But unto Thee have I cried, O Lord; and in the Morning ſhall my Prayer prevent</hi> [or come before] <hi>Thee!</hi> Tho' he had a long while, even from his Youth, 'tis likely for <hi>fifty Years,</hi> and Times innumerable, cried to God, and had not to his Apprehenſion at leaſt, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded; yet he would not give up intirely; but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves he will proceed, and early, every Day, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly implore Him ſtill for Mercy.</p>
            <p>Yea, in ver. 14, <hi>Lord, why caſteſt thou off my Soul? Why hideſt thou thy Face from me?</hi> It is <hi>God's caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth off his precious Soul,</hi> that he is chiefly concerned for; and 'tis <hi>the Hiding of God's Face from him,</hi> that greatly grieves him. Theſe are vaſtly more diſtreſſing to him, as they are to gracious Souls, than any bodily or earthly Troubles. His great Concern, excites his ſolicitous Enquiries to know of God <hi>the ſpecial Reaſons</hi> why a God of ſuch unbounded Grace and Mercy, ſhould caſt him off, and hide his Face, notwithſtanding all his long, earneſt and innumerable Cries: and he plainly intimates, that he apprehended, if God would not caſt him off nor hide his Face, but accept him and ſhine upon him; O, this is That, and nothing ſhort of This would give him Joy and Satisfaction.</p>
            <p>All theſe, even in the Midſt and Depth of his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Darkneſs, are the plain Outbreakings of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Faith and Piety, which lay at the Bottom of his Heart, and were the very Scource of his moſt bitter Complaints and Cries.</p>

            <p>I ſhall only at preſent mention the ſimilar Caſe of JOB, that <hi>upright and perfect Man, who feared God and eſchewed Evil, above all others on the Earth</hi> in his Day, as God himſelf bears Witneſs, <hi>Chap.</hi> i. 8—So eminent for Faith and Patience, that when he met with a moſt ſurprizing Succeſſion of increaſing Calamities, he was enabled to expreſs himſelf with ſuch wonderful Submiſſion, as in ver. 20, 21; <hi>Then</hi> JOB <hi>fell down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Ground and worſhipped, and ſaid,</hi>

Why died I not from the Womb? Why did I not give up the Ghoſt when I came out of the Belly? Why did the Knees prevent me? Or why the Breaſts that I ſhould ſuck?— Wherefore is Light given to him that is in Miſery, and Life unto the bitter in Soul?— Why is Light given to a Man whoſe Way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in?</q>
And <hi>Chap.</hi> vi.— <q>O that my Grief were thoroughly weighed, and my Calamity laid in the Balances toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther! For now it would be heavier than the Sand of the Sea; therefore my Words are ſwallowed up:

For THE ARROWS of THE ALMIGHTY are WITHIN ME, the Poiſon whereof drinketh up my Spirit: THE TERRORS of GOD do ſet themſelves in array againſt me!—O that I might have my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, and that God would grant me the Thing that I long for! even that it would pleaſe God to deſtroy me; that he would let looſe his Hand and cut me off!—Let him not ſpare! &amp;c.</q>

            <p>Are not theſe the awful Words of an eminently pious Man, even <hi>diſtracted</hi> with the TERRORS of GOD? No wonder then he ſays in <hi>Chap.</hi> xxxi. 23; <hi>Deſtruction from GOD was a</hi> TERROR <hi>to me: and by Reaſon of</hi> HIS HIGHNESS, <hi>I could not endure.</hi> O! <hi>with</hi> the infinite GOD, <hi>is</hi> moſt <hi>terrible Majeſty</hi> indeed, as <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libu</hi> repreſents in <hi>Chap.</hi> xxxvii. 22.

            <p>Behold the <hi>awful Strictneſs</hi> and <hi>tender Mercies</hi> of God together!—His <hi>awful Strictneſs,</hi> in reſenting the wrong Aſſertions of <hi>Job</hi>'s three Friends—and his <hi>tender Mercies,</hi> in kindly paſſing over all <hi>Job</hi>'s diſtempered Speeches, ſaying nothing about them; and only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the Doctrines wherein <hi>his Servant</hi> JOB (whom he delights to call <hi>my Servant</hi> JOB, four Times over) had <hi>rightly ſpoke of GOD</hi> in his Times of Trouble.</p>
            <p>But to return to the diſtreſſed Condition of <hi>Heman</hi>— We are now in the</p>
            <p n="3">IIId Place, To conſider the <hi>Cauſes</hi> thereof in the Hands of GOD.</p>
            <p>I ſaid—the <hi>Cauſes</hi> thereof <hi>in the Hands</hi> of GOD. For as there muſt be Cauſes of this deplorable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; whatever they were, He created them for their terrible Effects, He gave them their Efficacy, ſupported and over-ruled them; He acted in and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered them, either by Influence or Permiſſion, for this awful Purpoſe. And tho' they are to us innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable, yet may be ranked under the following Heads; wherein I ſhall chiefly conſider the <hi>Cauſes</hi> of his <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Troubles</hi> and <hi>diſtreſſing Terrors.</hi>—</p>
            <p n="1">1. Some of them may be called <hi>moral</hi> Cauſes; and were ſuch as theſe—</p>
            <p>This pious Perſon had not only a rational Soul, and was an intellectual and moral Agent, and by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of the Light of Nature, might diſcover ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of GOD and his Perfections, Will, Providence and future Judgment; but he was alſo born, bro't up, and lived in the Light of <hi>Revelation.</hi> He was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd of all contained in the <hi>holy Scriptures</hi> from the <hi>Creation</hi> of the Earth to the Reign of <hi>David,</hi> which was near <hi>Three Thouſand</hi> Years. He had ſufficient
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:007769_0019_102E79582246CBA8"/>
and convictive Evidence of this Revelation, and both underſtood and believed it.</p>
            <p>He viewed God as the Creator, Upholder, abſolute Proprietor and Lord of Heaven and Earth, and every Thing therein: He view'd Him in his abſolute and perpetual Omnipreſence, Omniſcience, Wiſdom, Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Juſtice, Goodneſs, Truth, Power and Providence: He view'd Him in his wiſe, righteous, good &amp; holy Laws and Declarations; in his ſacred Covenants, Promiſes and Threatnings; in his perfect and perpetual Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of us now, in his future Judgment, and eternal Rewards &amp; Puniſhments: He view'd Him in all his ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Dealings—Dooming all Nations in all Ages to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable and dreadful Miſeries and <hi>Death</hi> for the firſt Tranſgreſſion, with the awful and continual Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions of this dreadful Sentence on them both Elder and Younger in all Ages ever ſince: He view'd Him in his drowning innumerable Millions of Men, Women and Children in the <hi>univerſal Deluge;</hi> deſtroying <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah, Admah</hi> and <hi>Zeboim,</hi> with all their Children by tempeſtuous Showers of Fire &amp; Brimſtone; and Multitudes of others by Wars, Famines, Plagues, Inundations, Earthquakes, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, He view'd the Extenſiveneſs, the Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality and the Strictneſs of the Law of God: He knew that dreadful Sentence in <hi>Deut.</hi> xxvii. 26, which he doubtleſs underſtood as the Apoſtle ſince explain'd it in <hi>Gal.</hi> iii: 10; <hi>Curſed is every one that continueth not in all Things which are written in the Book of the Law to do them:</hi> He view'd and compar'd himſelf with this perfect Law: and from all theſe Views was led to ſee the Glory of God and his own exceeding Vileneſs, Guiltineſs and awful Danger; — to ſee the Agency, the glorious Holineſs and Dreadfulneſs of God in all the Expreſſions of his Indignation, in all his Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and in all his Judgments; and thence to be greatly
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:007769_0020_102E795E23E295A0"/>
troubled. So <hi>Heman</hi>'s pious Companion <hi>Aſaph</hi> ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> lxxvii. 3; <hi>I remembred GOD, and was troubled, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, and my Spirit was overwhelmed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And theſe ſeem to be the chief <hi>moral</hi> Cauſes of thoſe <hi>Terrors</hi> he endured of a <hi>ſpiritual Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Some of the Cauſes of his Diſtreſs might in the Hands of God be even <hi>material.</hi> And they might be ſuch as theſe—</p>
            <p>Beſides the various and diſordered Elements without him, the various hurtful Subſtances received in him, and their various troubleſome Impreſſions on him; <hi>ſome unhappy Conſtitution</hi> of the nervous Syſtem or other Parts of his frail Body, either in its primary Formation, or by ſome after Incident, under the divine Direction, might occaſion a great Variety of Diſorders, firſt of the <hi>Body</hi> and then thereby of the <hi>Mind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>mutual Influence</hi> between <hi>theſe two</hi> very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Parts of the human Compoſition, is too myſterious for our preſent Underſtanding: But that they have ſuch a mutual Influence on each other, we moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly know by univerſal and perpetual Experience. Diſturb'd Ideas in the <hi>Mind</hi> ſurprizingly diſturb the <hi>Body;</hi> and Diſorders in the <hi>Body</hi> as ſtrangely affect and diſturb the <hi>Mind:</hi> tho' the immediate Cauſe of this I can reſolve into nothing elſe but the continual Agency of God within us, according to particular Rules his conſummate Wiſdom has preſcribed.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Syſtem</hi> of the <hi>Nerves,</hi> all deriving from the Brain, ſeem to be the immediate Seat of the <hi>Soul,</hi> and its immediate Inſtruments both of Motion and Senſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in us. And the Configuration, Habit, or Tenor of the nervous Strings or Veſſels might put all the <hi>Fluids</hi> into great Diſorders; render ſome <hi>too ſlow,</hi> and others <hi>too precipitate</hi> in their Motions; and thoſe nervous Strings or Veſſels, whoſe Office 'tis to quicken the <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> might in their Conſtitution or Habit be too weak
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:007769_0021_102E79605BCC8038"/>
to quicken them; and thoſe nervous Strings or Veſſels whoſe Office 'tis to reſtrain the <hi>Latter,</hi> might in their Conſtitution or Habit be too weak to reſtrain them: the Conſequence of which would be great Diſorders, firſt of the <hi>Body,</hi> and then thereby of the <hi>Mind;</hi> which all the Skill of Man might be utterly unable to remove or moderate, or even his Penetration to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand.</p>
            <p>There are alſo innumerable <hi>outward Things,</hi> which in the Hand of God, have a natural Tendency to ſtrike and trouble, to worry and perplex the <hi>Mind;</hi> and thereby produce great Diſorders in the <hi>Body;</hi> which reverberate on the <hi>Mind</hi> again with greater Force and Violence. The very Powers of Reaſoning, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or thinking regularly, may be much impaired and interrupted, the Imagination wild and in great Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: and none but GOD, or at leaſt his mighty <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi> by his Order, may be able to reduce or govern them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Some of the Cauſes of his Diſtreſs, in the Hand of God and by his holy Permiſſion, might be even <hi>Diabolical.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The inſpired Scriptures plainly repreſent Multitudes of <hi>fallen Angels,</hi> Enemies to the Glory of God, and to the Good of Men, as going about continually ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and endeavouring, by all Sorts of Temptations, alluring, flattering, miſrepreſenting, frightning, to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lead, worry, vex and utterly deſtroy us. They are full of perpetual Malice, exceeding knowing, ſubtil, powerful, active, unwearied, and never reſting. When they are by God permitted, they have Multitudes of ſubtil Suggeſtions, to lead us into wrong, hurtful and deſturbing Views both of God, our Selves and Others; to raiſe our Paſſions and Perplexities, prevent our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Ways of thinking, hinder us from exerciſing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Graces, and from attending preſent Duties; and
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:007769_0022_102E7961E1F0B498"/>
ſo lead us into Error, Folly, Sin, and ſo to dreadful Darkneſs and Confuſion, yea Diſtraction.</p>
            <p>And theſe wicked Spirits are ſo <hi>numerous,</hi> that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Time of Chriſt on Earth, when there were ſuch a Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Nations, they could ſpare a <hi>Legion,</hi> which was then among the <hi>Romans</hi> at leaſt <hi>Twelve Hundred,</hi> to worry one poor Man, <hi>Mark</hi>

            <p>But then all theſe ſubtil and mighty Agents are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually in the Hands of GOD, yea in the Hands of the SON of GOD. He ſuſtains their very Subſtances and Powers in Being: and in the very Nature of Things, they muſt therefore be ever abſolutely ſubject to his Controul and Government: He has them ever there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in his mighty Chain, and lets them go no further than he pleaſes. And yet 'tis terrible to ſee and think how far the ſovereign God permits them to tempt, miſlead and worry, even his deareſt Children.</p>
            <p>They tempted and deceived <hi>Eve</hi> in her State of Innocence, &amp; dreadfully ſucceeded. They grieviouſly afflicted the upright <hi>Job.</hi> They tempted and prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on <hi>David.</hi> They were lying Spirits in the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi> of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> They ſtood at the Right Hand of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> the high Prieſt, to reſiſt him. They earneſtly deſired to <hi>ſift,</hi> or toſs and ſhake by Temptations, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> as Wheat is toſs'd and ſhaken in a Sieve. <note n="†" place="bottom">Whitby<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note>
They like <hi>Thorns in the Fleſh</hi> moſt pungently <hi>buffeted</hi> the Apoſtle <hi>Paul.</hi> They encountred the <hi>Saints</hi> at <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſus</hi> with their <hi>Wiles</hi> and <hi>fiery Darts.</hi> Yea for <hi>forty Days and Nights together,</hi> they were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in a dreadful Manner to tempt and worry the <hi>Man</hi> CHRIST JESUS in a ſolitary Wilderneſs, on the Top of a Pinacle of the Temple, and of an exceeding high Mountain, without any humane Help or Company.</p>
            <p>And 'tis highly probable, that in the myſterious Depths of Wiſdom, they were permitted to worry <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:007769_0023_102E7964AC3F7808"/>
even from his Youthful Days to his advanced Age. They might worry him both by horrible Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and Suggeſtions, and then by ſetting the Terrors of God before his Mind, even to Diſtraction. They might pervert every Scripture which otherwiſe would miniſter Encouragement and Comfort; repreſent Sin as Duty, and Duty as Sin; and give ſuch horrible and ſhocking Ideas of God and of himſelf; and then ſuch terrible Ideas of the Holineſs and Majeſty of God again, as he could not tell how to bear, and yet hold him under them, till they in a great Degree diſtracted him.</p>
            <p n="4">4. &amp; laſtly. Even <hi>GOD himſelf</hi> might by his <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate</hi> as well as <hi>mediate</hi> Influence, be the Cauſe of his extraordinary Diſtreſs and Terrors.</p>
            <p>For <hi>GOD himſelf</hi> is repreſented as <hi>ſtriking, ſmiling</hi> and <hi>afflicting</hi> both the <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Soul</hi> of the <hi>Man</hi> CHRIST JESUS, yea <hi>putting him to Grief</hi> and <hi>bruiſing him to Death</hi> when he ſtood in the Room of Sinners, <hi>Iſai.</hi> liii. And all the Saints in Scripture rightly aſcribe their Afflictions, either in an <hi>immediate</hi> or <hi>mediate</hi> Manner, to Him.</p>
            <p>So <hi>Job</hi> ſeems to aſcribe his chief Affliction to his <hi>immediate</hi> Influence, <hi>Chap.</hi> vii. <q>Thou ſetteſt a Watch over me?—Thou ſcareſt me with Dreams, and terrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt me with Viſions; ſo that my Soul chuſeth Strang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and Death rather than Life.—How long wilt thou not depart from me, nor let me alone [even for ſo ſhort a Time] till I ſwallow down my Spittle.— Why haſt thou ſet me as a Mark againſt Thee? ſo that I am a Burthen to myſelf?</q>
               <hi>Chap.</hi> ix. <q>He break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth me with a Tempeſt, and multiplieth my Wounds without Cauſe: He will not ſuffer me to take my Breath, but filleth me with Bitterneſs.</q>
               <q>And <hi>Chap.</hi> x. I am full of Confuſion— My Affliction encreaſeth: Thou hunteſt me as a fierce Lion; and again, Thou ſheweſt thy ſelf marvellous upon me: Thou renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt

thy Witneſſes againſt me, and increaſeſt thine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation upon me.</q>
            </p>
            <p>So <hi>Moſes</hi>—Pſal. xc. 7, 8; <q>We are conſumed by thine Anger, &amp; by thy Wrath are we troubled: Thou haſt ſet our Iniquities before Thee, our ſecret Sins in the Light of thy Countenance.</q>
So <hi>David</hi> — Pſal. xxxviii. 2; <q>Thine Arrows ſtick faſt in me, and thy Hand preſſeth me ſore.</q>
So <hi>Aſaph,</hi> again — Pſal. lxxvii. 4; <q>Thou holdeſt mine Eyes waking: I am ſo troubled, that I cannot ſpeak.</q>
So <hi>Heman</hi> again— ver. 7, before our Text; <q>Thy Wrath lieth hard upon me, and Thou haſt afflicted me with all thy Waves.</q>
And ſo <hi>Jeremiah</hi>—Lam. iii. 1,— 18. <q>I am the Man that hath ſeen Affliction by the Rod of thy Wrath: He hath led me and brought me into Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs &amp;c.</q>

            <p n="4">IV. and laſt General Head, is briefly to ſuggeſt <hi>ſome</hi> of the <hi>Reaſons</hi> of this divine and myſterious Diſpenſation.</p>
            <p>The pious <hi>Aſaph,</hi> who ſtood at <hi>Heman</hi>'s Right Hand, as <hi>Ethan</hi> at his Left, when ſinging before the Ark, and in the Tabernacle, was not only well acquainted with the afflicted Caſe of his Companion <hi>Heman;</hi> but was alſo <hi>much</hi> in the <hi>ſame Condition,</hi> and for a while much perplexed with this myſterious Diſpenſation: 'till at length he went into the Sanctuary; and There he ſaw <hi>ſome</hi> of the <hi>Reaſons</hi> to his entire Satisfaction; as he plainly tells us in the <hi>ſeventy third</hi> PSALM.</p>
            <p>And I ſhall here briefly hint not only <hi>Thoſe,</hi> but by the Light of Revelation <hi>ſome others</hi> alſo.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Firſt</hi> might be to give to him, and by him to others, more reverential Apprehenſions of the <hi>Being</hi> and <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>GOD;</hi> of his glorious Perfections, Providence and Word; of his Authority and Laws; of his Promiſes and Threatnings, of his faithful Fulfilment of them; and of his

adorable Sovereignty and Majeſty; to make them more afraid of Hypocriſy, Formality and trifling with him; and to excite &amp; keep alive their more ſolemn &amp; conſtant Awe of his continual Preſence &amp; the future Judgment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Another Reaſon</hi> may be to ſhow the exceeding evil <hi>Nature</hi> and miſchievous <hi>Influence</hi> and <hi>Conſequence</hi> of <hi>Sin,</hi> the fruitful Scource of all Darkneſs, Horror, Affliction and Diſtreſs, with the terrible Reſentment of GOD againſt it: that he is infinitely diſpleaſed with it, even in his deareſt People; yea, when it lay on the <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Soul</hi> of the <hi>Man</hi> CHRIST JESUS by <hi>Imputation,</hi> or by <hi>Subſtitution</hi> only.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Another Reaſon</hi> may be to ſhow, that tho' he <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons</hi> and <hi>dearly loves,</hi> yet <hi>in the preſent State,</hi> he <hi>grievouſly chaſtiſes;</hi> that all deſerve the like Affliction, are alike expoſed to it, and are entirely obliged to the ſovereign Will of God, that they are not conſtantly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during the ſame Diſtreſſes; and ſo excite their greater Thankfulneſs to their divine Preſerver.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Another Reaſon</hi> might be, to excite in <hi>Heman</hi> and <hi>others,</hi> a greater <hi>Hatred</hi> of <hi>Sin,</hi> Alienation from it, Enmity to it; Solicitude for Purification, Pardon, the Favour of God in Chriſt, with the holy, ſenbſile and happy Manifeſtation and Influence thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Another Reaſon</hi> might be to make the <hi>Body of Sin</hi> more burthenſome to <hi>Heman</hi> and <hi>other Saints;</hi> and excite their earneſt Groanings, Longings, Prayers and Endeavours after progreſſive &amp; compleat Deliverance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Another Reaſon</hi> may be, to damp and weaken their <hi>carnal Appetites,</hi> and the alluring Influence of the <hi>World</hi> about them; which otherwiſe might have a vaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more powerful, dangerous, prevailing and unhappy Efficacy on them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Another Reaſon</hi> may be, to lead them into clearer, ſtronger and higher Views, both of the <hi>Amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs</hi> and <hi>Happineſs</hi> of <hi>Holineſs,</hi> of <hi>compleat Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:007769_0026_102E796CAB086B20"/>
to God, of his <hi>ſpecial Favour</hi> in Chriſt, and of the certain <hi>Manifeſtation</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Another Reaſon</hi> may be to make them more expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimentally ſenſible of <hi>their own Weakneſs</hi> &amp; <hi>Inability,</hi> both to keep off, to bear, or carry aright under and improve Affliction, reſiſt Temptation, and rule their Hearts and Thoughts; to convince them of <hi>their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Dependence</hi> on the Grace and Power of God in Chriſt; and lead them out to look and ſeek to Him, and truſt in Him for Protection, Light, Conduct, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, Strength, Victory and Safety.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Another Reaſon</hi> may be to break and mortify their <hi>Pride;</hi> to give them a deeper Senſe of <hi>their own Baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Unworthineſs,</hi> and <hi>Guiltineſs;</hi> to make &amp; keep them more low and humble; to give them more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged Views of their Neceſſity of the <hi>infinitely free Grace</hi> of God, and <hi>abſolutely perfect Righteouſneſs</hi> of Chriſt as their Mediator and Repreſentative; and lead their Souls to a higher Value for them, a more hearty Acceptance of them, a more earneſt laying hold on them, and a more entire truſting in them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Another Reaſon</hi> may be to make <hi>Others</hi> more afraid of <hi>Sin;</hi> to excite the <hi>Impenitent</hi> to ſpeedy and true Repentance; to excite the <hi>Penitent</hi> to a greater Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as well as clearer Evidence of their own Sincerity.</p>
            <p>Or where <hi>impenitent</hi> Sinners, being often reproved and warned, continue ſet on the Gratification of their ſenſual and worldly Appetites; <hi>one awful Reaſon</hi> may be, in the righteous Reſentment and Judgment of God, to let them ſee ſuch awful Inſtances as theſe, that they may ſtumble and fall, renounce all Thoughts of being ſeriouſly religious; the <hi>Devil</hi> telling them, and they believing him, that <hi>to be ſeriouſly religious is the Was to Trouble and Diſtraction</hi>—and ſo indulge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their pleaſing Dreams, and give a greater Swing to their licencious Appetites, to the greater
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:007769_0027_102E796E31B8E1C0"/>
Glory of the Juſtice, Holineſs and Power of God, in their aggravated Puniſhment.</p>
            <p>But to be ſure, <hi>the Final Reaſons</hi> are— that <hi>Earth</hi> may lower and leſſen, and <hi>Heaven</hi> riſe and greaten in the believing Eyes of theſe afflicted Souls;—that they may have higher Views of the Bleſſedneſs and Glory of the <hi>World above;</hi>—that their Affections may more frequently and ſtrongly riſe up towards them;— that they may be much more <hi>quickened</hi> in their Labours to ſecure them and prepare for them; — that their <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize</hi> and <hi>Joy</hi> may be <hi>ſo much the greater</hi> upon their ſudden Entrance; and that their own exulting Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Praiſes, with the joyful Praiſes of all the Saints and Angels <hi>There,</hi> to God the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, may be ſo much the higher and more tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: yea by their <hi>juſtifying</hi> the holy God in their Darkneſs and Diſtreſs, and the <hi>exerciſe</hi> of <hi>other Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> tho' in the preſent State they ſee nothing of it, they may yield ſo much the <hi>greater Glory</hi> to Him; and their moſt grievous Trials may work out after all a far more exceeding &amp; eternal Weight of Glory to themſelves hereafter, as well as a greater Glory to his own Perfections,</p>
            <p>And <hi>whatever other Reaſons</hi> there may be of this myſterious Diſpenſation, <hi>they</hi> and <hi>others</hi> ſhall <hi>clearly ſee in the Light of Heaven;</hi> where the SON of GOD who <hi>opens</hi> the <hi>Books</hi> of the divine Contrivances, will <hi>ſhow</hi> ſucceſſively to all the happy Multitudes about Him, the conſummate Wiſdom of all his Works, to their perfect Satisfaction, and their higheſt Wonder and Joy for ever.</p>
            <p>And thus have we taken a tranſient View of <hi>the diſtreſſed Caſe</hi> of <hi>Heman,</hi> and of many other pious Perſons in the like Condition.</p>

            <p>By <hi>Sovereignty</hi> I do not mean ſuch a Sovereignty as is againſt the Glory either of his Wiſdom, Juſtice, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Truth, Goodneſs, or any of the Divine Perfections in the winding up of all his Diſpenſations: For this is utterly inconſiſtent and impoſſible: but ſuch a <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty</hi> as does not make <hi>our proportionable Deſervings</hi> the Rule of his Diſpenſations towards us in the <hi>preſent State;</hi> (which was the grand Miſtake of JOB'S <hi>Three Friends</hi>) but may order <hi>more grievous Trials</hi> for <hi>holy Perſons</hi> than for <hi>Others;</hi> yea for Perſons of <hi>higher</hi> Degrees of Holineſs than <hi>lower;</hi> tho' not more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous than they all deſerve: for in the midſt of all, the whole World muſt own, He in the <hi>preſent State</hi> afflicts them inconceivably leſs than their Sins deſerve.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Here we ſee that <hi>Piety</hi> is <hi>no Security</hi> from a <hi>conſtant Series</hi> of <hi>Affliction</hi> in the <hi>preſent State,</hi> nor from the <hi>terrible Apprehenſions</hi> of <hi>GOD,</hi> even to <hi>Diſtraction:</hi> and they may in the Depths of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Wiſdom be made ſubſervient both to <hi>his greater Glory,</hi> and <hi>their greater Benefit hereafter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Then we may by no Means ſuppoſe that ſuch as have been <hi>thus afflicted and diſtreſſed,</hi> were not truly pious, or leſs pious than others, or were guilty of greater Sins than others, or deſerved thus to be treated more than others.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Then there is <hi>no juſt Reaſon</hi> for any to be <hi>ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled</hi> or <hi>diſcouraged</hi> from being <hi>ſeriouſly Religious,</hi> on the Account of ſuch myſterious Diſpenſations in the <hi>preſent State</hi> towards ſome particular Perſons who are accounted Pious. For we muſt always take both the <hi>preſent</hi> and <hi>the future State</hi> into our extenſive Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect:
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:007769_0029_102E7978A99FF9B0"/>
And the abſolutely good, wiſe and faithful God has <hi>their eternal Intereſt</hi> in his univerſal View; and in his moſt grievous Diſpenſations to them <hi>here,</hi> (as when he calls <hi>his Martyrs</hi> to the glowing Fire) he orders all in <hi>Faithfulneſs</hi> and <hi>Kindneſs</hi> for their greater Glory and Bleſſedneſs for ever. In Heaven He'll give an over-full Reward for all: and, as <hi>his moſt beloved</hi> SON, ſo with Him, <hi>they</hi> ſhall alſo <hi>ſee of the Travail of their Souls,</hi> to <hi>their eternal Joy and Satisfaction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Let <hi>thoſe</hi> who are <hi>concern'd</hi> for <hi>Others</hi> in <hi>the like Diſtreſs</hi> with <hi>Heman,</hi> yet, for their Conſolation, obſerve <hi>the like Sparklings out of Grace;</hi> eſpecially their high Value for the Favour of God in Chriſt, and Conformity to Him, their earneſt Wiſhes for the Light of his Countenance, their preferring it above all the World, their being burthened with the Body and Power of Sin within them, their groaning for Deliverance, their crying out of their monſtrous Vileneſs, their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning Senſe of their own utter Unworthineſs and Guiltineſs, their being greatly ſhock'd with the horrible Suggeſtions and Temptations riſing in them, imagining that none were ever in their deplorable Caſe &amp;c.— which are the Sparklings out of Grace in the midſt of all their Darkneſs and Diſtreſſes.</p>

            <p>When <hi>Young,</hi> he was uncommonly tho'tful &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned about the Affairs of his Soul and Eternity: His Concern has been deep and conſtant, and often ſo great, that he was ready to ſink into Diſcouragement; and thro' the afflicting Senſe of the Corruption of his Nature, could enjoy but little Comfort.</p>
            <p>He was <hi>greatly afraid of being deceived</hi> about the State of his immortal Soul; as he juſtly apprehended that agreable to our kind Saviour's Warning, <hi>the Gate is ſtrait, and the Way narrow that leadeth to</hi> eternal <hi>Life,</hi> that <hi>there are very few who find</hi> and <hi>enter</hi> them, that the moſt of thoſe who live in the Light of the Goſpel, are going on in <hi>an eaſy Way,</hi> and deceive

themſelves to their eternal Ruin. And he has chiefly followed the Lord in the Dark, but perſevered to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Him.</p>
            <p>His <hi>Conſcience</hi> ſeem'd <hi>exceeding tender:</hi> and from its great Tenderneſs, and Fear of offending God, was inclined to be more than ordinary <hi>ſcrupulous.</hi> Tho' a Diſpoſition to be afraid of judging and doing Wrong and ſo to heſitate about Matters of apprehended Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in his natural Temper, might much promote this Scrupuloſity: and when he juſtly came to apprehend that all Matters of <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Duty</hi> were Matters of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> his ſcrupulous Temper would naturally operate in his gracious Fear of ſinning, And this ſcrupulous Fear of his a long while hinder'd him from coming to the <hi>Lords Table;</hi> till at length he came to be ſo irreſiſtibly impreſſed with a Senſe of his indiſpenſable Duty, that he determined to come, and there caſt himſelf at the Feet of Chriſt, ſtriving to yield Obedience to him, tho' there he ſhould periſh. He tho't it was better periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a Way of <hi>ſtriving</hi> to obey him, than in neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it; and that in a way of <hi>ſtriving</hi> he was more like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be accepted, helped and ſaved.</p>
            <p>He dearly loved <hi>the ancient People, Principles</hi> and <hi>Ways</hi> of <hi>New-England:</hi> tho' he was grieved to find <hi>ſome</hi> of <hi>our Fore-fathers</hi> ſo ſevere on the <hi>Quakers</hi> in <hi>ancient Times,</hi> eſpecially in <hi>two</hi> of the <hi>five New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> Governments. Excepting theſe grievous Severi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, thro' miſtaken Zeal in that Particular; he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd <hi>the Fathers</hi> of this Country as ſome of the moſt Pious and excellent Set of Men that were ever form'd into a Body Politick: and he greatly lamented the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generacy of their Succeſſors, in the Power and Practice Godlineſs.</p>
            <p>He early join'd to a <hi>Society</hi> of <hi>Youths</hi> in a <hi>Private Meeting</hi> to promote vital Piety among them. The Eyes of good People were turned to him; and as he
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:007769_0032_102E79814B949980"/>
grew in Years, he increaſed in their Eſteem, and anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered their Expectations.</p>
            <p>In his <hi>Commercial Dealings,</hi> he was fair and upright: In his <hi>Converſation,</hi> free, pleaſant, open, innocent and friendly; forward to confeſs his own Faults; and when in a free Manner he mentioned the Miſconduct of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, it was clearly without Ill-will or Gaul, but with <hi>Fulneſs</hi> of <hi>Candor</hi> to their Perſons and Intentions.</p>
            <p>As he was of a <hi>Publick Spirit,</hi> and lov'd <hi>the Town,</hi> they greatly affected <hi>Him</hi> — Choſe him <hi>one</hi> of their <hi>Select-Men</hi> to take Care of their Intereſts, in 1731, and ſo for <hi>four Years</hi> running—then in 1735, <hi>an Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeer of their Poor,</hi> for <hi>four Years more</hi> — and then in 1739, <hi>their Repreſentative</hi> in the <hi>General Court</hi> of the <hi>Province</hi> for <hi>four Years more</hi>—and would fain have continued to chuſe him in that important Truſt: But he found the weighty Care of his Country in ſo Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick a Place too heavy for his tender Heart and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, entreated them not to chuſe him again, and could not be perſwaded to bear it longer; tho' in the happy Company of his moſt agreable Brother-in-Law the late Hon. <hi>Thomas Cuſhing,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> a Fellow-Member with him, for whom He as well as many others had a very high Eſteem and very dear Affection; and tho' in the faireſt Way of the higheſt Honours his Country could raiſe him to. But prefering the quieter Office of <hi>taking Care of the Poor,</hi> the Town continued him therein from his <hi>firſt Election,</hi> for <hi>twenty one Years</hi> ſucceſſively, to the Day of his Death. And in every Office approval himſelf with Uprightneſs and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs.</p>
            <p>He greatly loved the <hi>moſt zealous, ſearching</hi> and <hi>awakning Miniſters:</hi> and they were always heartily welcome to his Houſe and Table.</p>
            <p>He ſteadily kept up Religion and good Order in his <hi>Family,</hi> both on the <hi>ſacred Sabbaths</hi> and <hi>other Days:</hi>
               <pb n="31" facs="unknown:007769_0033_102E79842977E010"/>
In perfect Harmony with his virtuous <hi>Conſort,</hi> trained up his <hi>Children</hi> in the Nurture and Admonition of the Lord. Among the Reſt — <hi>That moſt hopeful Youth</hi> his eldeſt Son <hi>of his own Name,</hi> whom he had bro't up to Learning for Publick Service, and proved one of the moſt ingenious and pious Youths this Country ever bred: but on <hi>Aug.</hi> 18. 1746, was, to the exceeding Grief of his <hi>Parents,</hi> and the great Loſs and Sorrow of <hi>Others,</hi> ſnatched from us by a violent Fever, in the 23d Year of his Age. Whoſe Death fell ſo much the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier on his diſtreſſed <hi>Father</hi> by Reaſon of his tender Conſtitution, and the grievous Loſs of his dear Brother <hi>Cuſhing</hi> on <hi>April</hi> 11, preceeding: And both theſe Loſſes made his Wounds of Grief ſo deep, that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſeem'd to recover wholly from them.</p>
            <p>But all who intimately knew him, could not but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend he maintained a cloſe Walk with God continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally. And yet he ſaw ſo much Deficiency and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in himſelf, and was ſo dreadfully worried with <hi>horrible Suggeſtions</hi> and <hi>Temptations;</hi> that tho' he <hi>feared the Lord,</hi> yet he almoſt always <hi>walked in Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs &amp; could ſee no Light</hi>—was like <hi>Heman</hi> much afflicted with Soul-Perplexities, even from his Youth; and as he advanc'd in Age they ſeem'd, eſpecially of late, to grow, till <hi>the Terrors of GOD</hi> at Times in ſome De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree diſtracted him.</p>
            <p>O how often have I heard him cry out in a moſt do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorous Manner, thro' horrible Suggeſtions and Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations concerning <hi>The Holy God,</hi> as with Solemnity he would always call him. As <hi>David</hi> he might ſay to GOD, &amp; tis likely many Times hath ſaid as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> xxxii. 3, 4. <hi>My Bones wax old thro' my Roaring all the Day long: For Day and Night thy Hand is heavy upon me: My Moiſture is turned into the Drought of Summer.</hi> Or as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> xxxviii. 8. <hi>I am feeble and

ſore broken: I have reared by Reaſon of the Diſquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of my Heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet in all his diſtracting Darkneſs he ever <hi>juſtified</hi> the HOLY GOD: He continually expreſs'd his <hi>reverential Apprehenſions</hi> of him: and even while his intellectual Powers were ſo greatly clouded and diſordered, we could hear <hi>no Murmurings</hi> againſt him, but <hi>earneſt Cryings</hi> to him thro' Chriſt for Mercy, while he condemned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as utterly unworthy of it. His <hi>Complaints</hi> were <hi>only</hi> of the <hi>horrible Suggeſtions</hi> of <hi>Satan</hi> againſt the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed GOD, and the <hi>vile Corruptions of his own Heart,</hi> with <hi>diſtreſſing Fears</hi> of <hi>yielding</hi> to thoſe <hi>Suggeſtions,</hi> and of <hi>ſinning</hi> even in <hi>the ſmalleſt Matters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A <hi>few Days</hi> before he <hi>died,</hi> he ſeem'd in a great Meaſure to be relieved of them, and to grow <hi>more compos'd and quiet.</hi> But as Death approached, his Intellectuals failed, and hindered us from knowing his final Sentiments. Yet we cannot but be fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that his departing Spirit, with Amazement on a ſudden opened into glorious Light and Holineſs, and Liberty, and Joy and Bleſſedneſs.</p>
            <p>O let the bereaved <hi>Widow</hi> repair to her REDEEMER, as her All-ſufficient and ever-living Husband. Let the <hi>Children</hi> ever remember his Prayers, his Graces, his Inſtructions, and Advices; and chuſe <hi>his God</hi> for <hi>theirs,</hi> for the Guide of their Youth and their everlaſting Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as he earneſtly exhorted them, and always ſerve him, and never forſake him.

            <p>AFter ſeveral Weeks Languiſhment died on the 10th, and this Day was decently inter'd, Mr. EDWARD BROM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FIELD, an eminent Merchant in this Place.—His An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, were among the diſtinguiſh'd Worthies of NEW-ENGLAND, whoſe Names will appear in Characters of Honour, in the <hi>Annals</hi> of our <hi>Church</hi> &amp; <hi>State.</hi>—The Grace of God took early Poſſeſſion of his Heart, and under its happy Influence, he devoted thoſe Years to the Service of Heaven, which are too generally ſpent in the Vanities of Life. — The <hi>Town</hi> of BOSTON, his native Place, obſerv'd his Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments, and call'd him to fill ſome of their moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Places of Truſt: All which he diſcharg'd, with great Honour to himſelf, and Advantage to the Publick.— In the Houſe of Repreſentatives, he appear'd the firm, uncorrupted Patriot; careful to aſſert the juſt Prerogative of the Crown, and to defend the invaluable Liberties of the People. He has been conſtantly choſen, for many Years, one of the Select-Men of the Town, and an Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeer of the Poor: which honourable Offices he exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted with great Fidelity — to univerſal Approbation. Attentive to the Complaints of the indigent,—diligent to maintain the good Order and publick Vertue of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants.—Firmly attach'd to the RELIGION OF JESUS, he received its ſublimeſt Myſteries, with the humbleſt Reverence—obeyed its Precepts with uniform Exactneſs— cheriſh'd its Miniſters with affectionate tenderneſs— and ſought its Advancement with unremitting Aſſiduity. — Tho' zealous for the <hi>Doctrine</hi> &amp; <hi>Conſtitution</hi> of the <hi>Churches</hi>
               <pb facs="unknown:007769_0037_102E798ED6750DD0"/>
of NEW-ENGLAND; yet with a truly catholick Charity he embraced good Men of every Denomination; Tho' ſtrict to the higheſt Degree in his own Conduct; he made the moſt charitable Allowance for the Infirmities of others— In his Domeſtic Relations, he was a ſhining Example of every Chriſtian Vertue. An affectionate <hi>Huſband</hi>—a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Father</hi>—an indulgent <hi>Maſter.</hi> His Houſe was a little CHURCH, where every Thing that had the Appearance of Vice was reſolutely baniſh'd; the Exerciſes of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion were regularly perform'd; the Religion of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath ſtrictly obſerv'd: He took a conſcientious Care to promote the temporal, as well as ſpiritual Welfare, of all committed to his Charge.— His Conſtitution was naturally tender; the Infirmities of his Body, ſometimes clouded the Serenity of his Mind, and indiſpos'd him for thoſe ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Joys, which many Chriſtians of lower Attainments happily experience. But under his growing Diſorders, he always maintain'd a devout and reverential <hi>Subjection to the Father of Spirits</hi>—an entire Dependence on the Merits of our divine Redeemer—and was above all Things ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous, that he might glorify God in LIFE and DEATH.— His Removal is a great Loſs to his Friends—his Family— and the Publick. But to him, we have the higheſt Reaſon to believe—<hi>The Day of his Death was better than the Day of his Birth.</hi>
