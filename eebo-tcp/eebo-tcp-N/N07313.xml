            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE next and immediate Deſign, of writing on controverted Points, is, to aſſiſt the Reader, by holding forth clear Light, to come to a well grounded Judgment, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Point in Diſpute. And to this End, we ſhould diſtinguiſh between Things that differ, ſtate the Point in Diſpute, with great exactitude; and then preſent to the Reader, the Arguments on the one ſide and the other, of the Queſtion in Debate, and leave him to judge for himſelf.—And accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, in theſe Pages, I ſhall (1.) make ſome needful Diſtinctions; the not attending to which, has occaſioned no ſmall Confuſion in this Controverſy, about the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of juſtifying Faith. (2.) State the Queſtion now to be diſputed, with great exactneſs. (3.) Offer Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt, and (4.) Conſider their Arguments in Favour of, the Poſition, which contains the Queſtion in Diſpute. And then leave every Reader to judge for himſelf.—The Diſtinctions to be made, are theſe,</p>
            <p n="1">1. THERE is an eſſential Difference between Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in the Sight of God, and a perſuation in our own Minds, that we are juſtified. One is the Act of God
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:009339_0004_103179D2259F7458"/>
our Judge; the other is the Act of our own Minds; as is ſelf-evident.— And God's Act muſt of Neceſſity be, in order of Nature, at leaſt, before our Act. We muſt be juſtified, before we can know that we are juſtified. For a Thing muſt exiſt, before its Exiſtence can be perceived; to ſay otherwiſe, is an expreſs Contradiction.</p>
            <p n="2">2. WE are juſtified by Faith alone, and that whether we know our Faith to be of the right Kind, or not: But we are aſſured of our Juſtification, by a Conſciouſneſs of our Faith, and other Chriſtian Graces, and by know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they are of the right Kind. We are juſtified without Reſpect to any Thing in us, or about us, conſidered as a recommending Qualification; ſimply <hi>by free Grace thro' the Redemption that is in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Our Union with Chriſt, is the Foundation of our Intereſt in him, his Atonement and Merits; and ſo of our Title to Pardon, Juſtification and eternal Life, according to the Goſpel. Faith alone, is that on our Part, whereby we are united to Chriſt and become one with him, and ſo that alone, by which we are juſtified. A Conſciouſneſs in our own Minds, that we have true Faith, and thoſe other Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Graces which are connected with it, and always accompany it, is that alone, by which we can know that we are juſtified. So that while we are juſtified ſimply on the Account of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, we can know that we are in Fact juſtified meerly by a Conſciouſneſs of our own inherent Graces; even as a poor Woman is made rich ſimply by her Huſband's Eſtate, with whom ſhe becomes one in the Eye of the Law by Marriage: but ſhe knows her Title her Huſband's Eſtate, only as ſhe knows that ſhe was married to him, and actually continues to be his Wife.</p>
            <p n="3">3. THERE is an eſſential Difference between a full Aſſurance, that thoſe, who receive Chriſt, and come to God in his Name, ſhall be pardoned, juſtified and have eternal Life: and a Conſciouſneſs that I do receive Chriſt, and come to God in his Name, and am conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently pardoned, juſtified and entitled to eternal Life.— That thoſe who receive Chriſt and come to God in his
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:009339_0005_103179D5C2B321B0"/>
Name, ſhall be pardoned, juſtified, and have eternal Life, is plainly and expreſly revealed in the Goſpel, and was true before I was born. And it appears to be true to every one, who underſtands the Goſpel aright, and believes it with all his Heart. But I muſt actually un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Goſpel, believe it with all my Heart, and in the belief of it actually receive Chriſt, and come to God in his Name, before I am juſtified; and ſo before I can be conſcious to my ſelf that I have ſo acted, and that conſequently I am pardoned, juſtified and entitled to eternal Life.</p>
            <p n="4">4. ALTHOUGH Juſtification in the Sight of God, muſt o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Neceſſity be in order of Nature before our Knowledge that we are juſtified; becauſe a Thing muſt exiſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it's Exiſtence can be perceived by the Mind: yet it is not impoſſible that a juſtified Believer may know his Juſtification ſoon, from an inward Conſciouſneſs of his receiving Chriſt, and coming to God in his Name, and from a Conſciouſneſs of all the Chriſtian Graces, which are connected with, and do always accompany true Faith. At Converſion, a Sinner is <hi>brought out of Darkneſs into ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

And from many Expreſſions in the new Teſtament, I am inclined to think it was common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo in the Apoſtolic Age. The three Thouſand on the Day of Pentecoſt, not only <hi>received the Word gladly,</hi> but immediately began to ſpend their Time in <hi>praiſing God,</hi> Act. ii. 41, 47. and Converts in that Age in gene<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ral <hi>being juſtified by Faith, had Peace with God,</hi> and <hi>re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>AND here, by the Way, this inclines me to entertain charitable Tho'ts of the <hi>firſt Reformers,</hi> that their Hearts might be right, even altho' it could be proved, that they made Aſſurance, of the Eſſence of Faith; as it is affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by ſome, that they did. For they were in the heat of Diſpute with the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> who denied that Aſſurance was at all attainable in this Life. But good Men among the <hi>firſt Reformers</hi> might be conſcious to themſelves, that they had had Aſſurance from the very Time of their Converſion; and might obſerve from the apoſtolic Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, that it uſed to be ſo with the apoſtolic Converts; and might obſerve it to be ſo with their Converts; and ſo, thro' want of proper Attention to the Nature of Things, might be led to affirm, that Aſſurance it ſelf is of the Eſſence of Juſtifying Faith. And by that one falſe Maxim, be in inſenſibly led into many other Miſtakes. But <hi>the Aſſembly of Divines at Weſtminſter,</hi> who ſat about an hundred Years after the Reformation, time having been had mean while to look more carefully into Things, and to diſtinguiſh between Things that differ, leſt Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance out of their Definition of Juſtifying Faith, in their <hi>Confeſſion of Faith; Larger,</hi> and <hi>Shorter Catechiſms.</hi> Nay, they even expreſly affirm, in their <hi>Larger Catechiſm,</hi> in Anſwer to <hi>Queſtion</hi> 81. "That Aſſurance of Grace and Salvation are not of the Eſſence of Faith." For while it was affirmed, that Aſſurance was of the Eſſence of Faith, by the Proteſtant Preachers, two Things would conſtantly happen, it may reaſonably be ſuppoſed, which would tend to convince them, that they were wrong, viz. 1. Many of their ſeeming Converts, who appeared to be full of the ſtrongeſt Aſſurance of the Pardon of their
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:009339_0007_103179DD39A23A08"/>
Sins, would apoſtatize and fall away to open Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, before their Eyes: as it has been with many in our Day.</p>

Which, when the heat of the Controverſy was a little over, and the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Party had had Time impartially to weigh Things, loth as Men naturally are to give up a Point they have once eſpouſed, they would feel themſelves obliged to do it, in this Caſe.—And accordingly it came to paſs, within about an hundred Years, that <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Divines in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral gave up that Notion, and defined Faith, in a very different Manner; as we may ſee in <hi>the Confeſſion of Faith</hi> and <hi>Catechiſms</hi> of the <hi>Aſſembly of Divines at Weſtminſter,</hi> and yet retained the Doctrine of Aſſurance, and aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it in the ſtrongeſt Language, but not as being of the Eſſence of Faith, but as reſulting "from the inward E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of thoſe Graces, unto which the Promiſes are made."

And Teſtimony has been publickly born againſt him in Years paſt, by ſome of the moſt noted Miniſters in the Country.

To do ſo, would be to juſtify the whole <hi>popiſh</hi> Party, in their appeal to the <hi>Pope,</hi> to decide all Points of Religion; and to give up the firſt Maxim on which the Reformation was built; viz. <hi>That the Word of God is the only Rule of Faith and Manners.</hi> It is not what the <hi>firſt Reformers</hi> ſaid, nor what <hi>the Aſſembly of Divines</hi> ſaid, nor what any other Men or Body or Men, ſince the Apoſtles were dead, have ſaid, or do ſay, that can determine any Doctrine of Religion, or ſettle any Point of Controverſy about Religion. If they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſettled by the holy Scriptures, they muſt remain for ever undetermin'd in this World. And to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to appeal to the Bible, and to that alone, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine what is Truth; is a full Proof a Man is a Heart an Infidel. He don't really believe the Bible is the Word of God, nor build his Scheme of Religion upon it; but upon his own Experiences, or the Sayings of others, whoſe Experiences he imagines were like his own. However what has been ſaid, may let the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic ſee, how I can conſiſtently entertain an Opinion, that ſome Men's Hearts may be more orthodox than their

Heads, in this Matter; which was the Point I was upon. <note n="†" place="bottom">It is very obſervable, that Mr. <hi>Wilſon,</hi> who is conſtantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating it, that all the <hi>proteſtant</hi> World are on his ſide, and glorying in it, is obliged, in the midſt of it all, to own, that while ſome hold, that <hi>Aſſurance is of the Eſſence of Faith,</hi> others only maintain, that <hi>Aſſurance accompanies it:</hi> (p. 97.) two Things in their Nature eſſentially different, nay contrary to each other.— For to ſay, that <hi>Aſſurance accompanies Faith,</hi> is to ſay, "it is not Faith, but ſomething elſe, which true Believers are wont to have in Company with Faith."</note>
            </p>
            <p>BUT while true Converts may, from their firſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, from a Conſciouſneſs of the ſaving Change they have paſſed thro', be perſwaded, that they are in a State of Favour with God, and <hi>Rejoyce in Hope of the Glory of God;</hi> Satan, that great Enemy to all Good, may <hi>trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form himſelf into an Angel of Light,</hi> and delude Hundreds and Thouſands &amp; ten Thouſands (and it is foretold that Satan is to <hi>deceive the Nations</hi> 'till the Thouſands Years of Chriſt's Reign do commence, <hi>Rev.</hi> xx. 3.) with a firm Belief that their Sins are forgiven, who never were converted; and ſo oblige them to believe their Sins are forgiven, when according to the plaineſt Declarations of Scripture, they are not forgiven; and ſo neceſſitate them in order to vindicate themſelves, to aſſert, that in juſtifying Faith "we believe that to be true which is not true before we believe it," and that without any Evidence from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Senſe or Reaſon."</p>
            <p>And theſe falſe Converts, emboldened by the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Number, may riſe, cut out a whole new Scheme of Religion ſubverſive of Chriſtianity, and ſeek to propagate it thro' the Chriſtian World, ſhewing the greateſt Rancor againſt the true Goſpel of Chriſt. Mean while, true Chriſtians may get puzled, ſtumbled and bewildered, and ſome perhaps brought unawares to eſpouſe the Language of the deluded, and to ſeem to plead their Cauſe. And the common Enemies to all experimental Religion, rejoyce in Hopes it will finally appear to all the World, that there is nothing in vital

Piety, and that all Religion conſiſts in an external re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Behaviour; and it is no matter what Men's Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples be, if their Lives are but good: which is nothing better than down-right Infidelity.</p>
            <p>THIS I take to be the Devil's Grand Scheme, in this preſent Age; and to counteract this his Deſign has been one chief End of all my former Publications: and ſo now of this.—But to return, and to proceed to ſtate the Queſtion to be diſputed.</p>
            <p>IN the beginning of my <hi>third Dialogue,</hi> which was on the Nature of <hi>Aſſurance of a Title to eternal Life,</hi> I had ſaid, that <q>Sanctification, taking the Word in a large and comprehenſive Senſe, is the Evidence, the only Scripture-evidence, of a good Eſtate.</q> And to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Miſunderſtanding, I added, <q>It is uſual for Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines to diſtinguiſh between Regeneration and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, between firſt Converſion &amp; progreſſive Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, between Divine Views and holy Affections, between Grace in the Heart and an holy Life and Converſation; but I mean to comprehend all under one general Name. You may call it the <hi>Image of God,</hi> or <hi>Holineſs of Heart and Life,</hi> or a real Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the Divine Law, and a genuine Compliance with the Goſpel of Chriſt. I have already let you ſee, what I apprehend to be the Nature of Law and Goſpel, of Love to God and Faith in Chriſt.—When I ſay, this is the <hi>only Evidence,</hi> I mean, that this is the only Thing wherein <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Sinners,</hi> in every Inſtance, <hi>differ.</hi> One has the Image of God, the other has not.—Or to expreſs my ſelf in the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of Inſpiration, Joh. xvii. 3. <hi>This is Life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, to know thee the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent.</hi> And 1 Joh. ii. 3, 4, 5. <hi>Hereby we do know that we do know him, if we keep his Commandments. He that ſaith I know him, and keepeth not his Commandments, is a Liar, and the Truth is not in him. But whoſe keepeth his Word, in him verily is the Love of God perfected: hereby we know that we are in him.</hi>

            <p>IN anſwer to which Words, Mr. <hi>Cudworth</hi> ſays, this
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:009339_0011_103179E8AAE27848"/>
"is no other than the Aſſurance of the <hi>Phariſee." Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Defence,</hi> p. 265.—but why? becauſe, ſays he, "it is only founded on the Difference there is between him and other Man"—To which I reply; and this may as well be objected againſt the Aſſurance of all the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolical Saints; as is evident from 1 <hi>Job.</hi> ii. 3, 4, 5. the very Text I quoted. For they knew they loved God, and kept his Commands, while the reſt of the World lay in Wickedneſs. And therefore they ſaid, 1 Joh. v. 19. <hi>We know that we are of God, and the whole World lieth in Wickedneſs.</hi> And will Mr. <hi>Cudworth</hi> affirm, that their Aſſurance was that of the <hi>Phariſees?</hi> Beſides there is a Fallacy in his Words: For the apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Aſſurance did not ariſe meerly from a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs, they differed from others; which might be true, and yet they have no Grace; as was the Caſe with the <hi>Phariſee;</hi> but from a Conſciouſneſs, that their Characters were agreable to the Goſpel Standard; that they had thoſe Graces which, according to Chriſt's holy Religion, are peculiar to the Saints, and certainly connected with eternal Life. Upon this, their Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance was built, juſt as I had repreſented. However, if Mr. <hi>Cudworth</hi>'s Words prove nothing elſe, yet at leaſt they ſeem to be a ſufficient Evidence of his hearty Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affection to the only ſcriptural Aſſurance of a good E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate. And he appears to think with his late Friend, that we may as well "place the dome of a Cathedral on the Stalk of a Tulip," as place our Aſſurance on this only ſcriptural Foundation.—But how then would he have us get Aſſurance? even by believing that our Sins are forgiven, while conſcious that we are upon a Level with the worſt of Sinners, no difference between us and them, as dead in Sin, as impenitent and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and as full of Enmity to God.—And this Belief is to beget our firſt Love.—But alas, what Grounds have we for this Belief? What Evidence for the Truth of what we believe? why none at all, ſays honeſt Mr. <hi>Marſhall,</hi> "from Scripture Senſe Reaſon." For the Fact believed to be true "is not true before we believe it."</p>
            <p>And as Mr. <hi>Cudworth</hi> affirms Aſſurance from a Conſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſs

Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hear his own Words, look into their plain and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Meaning, and ſtate diſtinctly the Point to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Marſhall</hi>'s Words are theſe, and the more we think of them, the more remarkable will they appear. <q>Let it be well obſerved, that the Reaſon why we are to aſſure our ſelves in our Faith, that God freely giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Chriſt and his Salvation to us in particular, is not becauſe it is a Truth before we believe it, but becauſe it becometh a certain Truth when we believe it; and becauſe it never will be true, except we do in ſome Meaſure perſuade and aſſure our ſelves that it is ſo. We have no abſolute Promiſe or Declaration in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that God certainly will or doth give Chriſt and his Salvation to any one of us in particular; neither do we know it to be true already by Scripture or Senſe or Reaſon, before we aſſure our ſelves abſolutely of it; yea, we are without Chriſt's Salvation at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, in a State of Sin and Miſery; under the Curſe and Wrath of God. Only—we are bound by the Command of God, thus to aſſure our ſelves: and the Scripture doth ſufficiently warrant us, that we ſhall not deceive our ſelves, in <hi>believing a Lie:</hi> but <hi>according to our Faith, ſo ſhall it be to us.</hi> Mat. ix. 29. This is a ſtrange Kind of Aſſurance, far different from other ordinary Kinds; and therefore no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if it be found weak and imperfect, and difficult to be obtained, and aſſaulted with many Doubtings. We are conſtrained to believe other Things on the clear Evidence we have that they are true, and would remain true, whether we believe them or no; ſo that we cannot deny our Aſſent, without rebelling againſt the Light of our Senſes, Reaſon or Conſcience. But here our Aſſurance, is not impreſſed on our Thoughts by any Evidence of the Thing; but we muſt work
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:009339_0016_103179F7A7778018"/>
it out in our ſelves by the Aſſiſtance of the Spirit of God.</q> 
               <hi>Myſtery.</hi> p. 173, 174—In this plain, honeſt Declaration, which opens to clear view the Heart and Soul of their whole Scheme, theſe <hi>eight Things</hi> may be obſerved.</p>
            <p n="1">1. IN general: That "this is a STRANGE Kind of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, FAR DIFFERENT from other ordinary Kinds." In all other Kinds of Aſſurance, he obſerves, there are theſe two Things. (1.) What we believe "is true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we believe it, and whether we believe it or no." (2.) "We are conſtrained to believe on the clear Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence we have that they are true." But "this is a ſtrange Kind of Aſſurance, far different from other or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Kinds," in theſe two Reſpects. (1) As we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve "that to be true, which is not true before we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it; and never would be true, if we did not believe it." (2.) As we believe "without any Evidence of the Thing."— "Any Evidence from Scripture, Senſe or Reaſon."—Herein the <hi>Strangeneſs</hi> conſiſts, and its Differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence from all other Kinds of Aſſurance in the Univerſe.</p>
            <p>A true Convert gets Aſſurance thus.—The Word of God teaches, <hi>Joh.</hi> i. 12. That he who receives Chriſt and believes in his Name, is a Child of God: But I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Chriſt and believe in his Name; therefore I am a Child of God.—Again, the Word of God teaches, <hi>Acts</hi> iii. 19. That he who repents and is converted ſhall have his Sins blotted out: But I repent and am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted; therefore my Sins are blotted out.—Once more, the Word of God teaches <hi>Acts</hi> xvi. 31. That he who believes in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſhall be ſaved: But I believe in the Lord Jeſus Chrſt; therefore I ſhall be ſaved —This is the "ordinary" Way of getting Aſſurance. And the Things believed are true before we believe them: and we believe only in exact Proportion to our Evidence.</p>
            <p>BUT in "this ſtrange Kind of Aſſurance," a Sinner who as yet is impenitent, unconverted, has not received Chriſt, nor believed in his Name, but is "under the Wrath and Curſe of God," believes his Sins are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given;
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:009339_0017_103179FB690C6470"/>
not becauſe they are, for they are not; not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he has Evidence they are, for he has none; but full Evidence to the contrary. But ſay they, becauſe God has commanded him to believe that they are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given, and promiſed that if he believes they are forgiven, they ſhall be forgiven. That is, God has commanded him to believe a Lie and promiſed that if he believes that he, it ſhall become a Truth. "According to our Faith ſo ſhall it be to us"—Not that that Text in <hi>Mat.</hi> ix. 29. ſpeaks a Word about "this ſtrange Kind of Aſſurance:" For it does not. The Thing the two blind Men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved was true before they believed it: and they were conſtrained to believe by clear Evidence, <hi>viz.</hi> That Chriſt was able to open their Eyes. See ver. 27, 28.— No. This Kind of Aſſurance is ſo <hi>ſtrange,</hi> that it is not ſo much as once required, commanded, exhorted to, or recommended in the Bible: nor any thing like it. Nor indeed is there any Thing like it in the Univerſe. For it is in truth "a ſtrange kind ot Aſſurance, <hi>far different</hi> from other ordinary Kinds."—But to be more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and that even thoſe who are of the weakeſt Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, may not only think, but be quite certain, that we do not miſunderſtand this Author, ſo very highly cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated by Gentlemen of the firſt Rank on that Side of the Queſtion, obſerve.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THE thing to be believed is a ſuppoſed Fact, which has no Exiſtence, viz. "that God freely giveth Chriſt and his Salvation to us in particular." Which he ſays, "is not true before we believe it." But pray, what does he mean by God's giving Chriſt and his Salvation to us in particular?" We often read in the Bible of the <hi>Gift of Chriſt,</hi> but every thing taught in the Bible rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to that grand and glorious Affair, is true before we believe, and whether we believe or no. For In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, is it not true, whether we believe it or not, that <hi>God ſo loved the World, as to give his only begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Life?</hi> Joh. iii. 16. And are not thoſe Words true whether we believe them or not, that <hi>God hath
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:009339_0018_103179FEB41A6100"/>
given to us eternal Life, and this Life is in his Son?</hi> 1 Joh. v. 11. And again, were not thoſe Words true, whether the Jews believed them or not, <hi>My Father giveth you the true Bread from Heaven?</hi> Joh. vi. 32. Yes, beyond all Doubt, all theſe Things are true, and every ſingle Sentiment implied in them is true, has been true above theſe Thouſand Years, and will remain true, whether we believe them or not. And indeed this is the Caſe with all the Truths contained in the Bible; yea, with every ſingle Truth in the Univerſe. They are true before we believe them, and whether we believe them or not.</p>
            <p>WHAT then does Mr <hi>Marſhall</hi> mean by God's giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt and his Salvation to us in particular?" which he ſays, "is not true before we believe it. Not <hi>that giving of Chriſt</hi> we read of in the Bible: but ſomething eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially different. He plainly means <hi>giving us in particular a ſaving intereſt in Chriſt and his Salvation:</hi> granting us Pardon, Juſtification and a Title to eternal Life, while impenitent and unconverted. This is plain from what he conſiders as oppoſite thereto. <q>Yea, we are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſt's Salvation at preſent, in a ſtate of Sin and Miſery, under the Wrath and Curſe of God</q> Which Words determine his meaning with the utmoſt Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty.

To be ſure Mr. <hi>Wilſon</hi> affirms this, over and over again, perhaps an Hundred Times, thro' both his Volumes. Particularly p. 145. he defines juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Faith in theſe Words. "Juſtifying Faith is a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving the Remiſſion of Sins with ſpecial Application to a Man's ſelf — Now obſerve,</p>
            <p n="3">3. Mr. <hi>Marſhall</hi> ſays, "this is not true before we believe it." But had it been declared, expreſly or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly,

in the Word of God, it had been true before we believe it, and whether we believe it or not: for this is the Caſe with every Declaration in the Bible. But Mr. <hi>Marſhall</hi> is ſo open, frank and honeſt, as to own that it is not taught in the Word of God <q>We have no abſolute Promiſe or Declaration in Scripture, that God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="4">4. The thing to be believed to be true, inſtead of being true before we believe it, is falſe. Yea, is known to be falſe, is owned to be falſe, is publickly declared before the World to be falſe. Inſtead of our having a ſaving Intereſt in Chriſt, we "are under the Wrath and Curſe of God."— And therefore this honeſt Man, in perfect Conſiſtence with himſelf, declares.</p>
            <p n="5">5. NEITHER do we know it to be true already by Scripture, or Senſe, or Reaſon.<q>— our Aſſurance is not impreſſed on our Thoughts by ANY Evidence of the Thing.</q>— And indeed, nothing could be more abſurd and Self-contradictory, than to pretend (as ſome of the Party ſeem to do) to have any Evidence of the truth of a Fact, which is known and acknowledged not to be true. For if we not only think, but know, that it is not true; we know that there is Evidence of its Untruth. Not ſimply, no Evidence of its truth; but full Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of it's Falſhood.<note n="†" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Marſhall</hi>'s meaning is so plain, that it ſeems impoſſible it ſhould be any plainer. And theſe Words did not drop from his Pen inadvertently; but the plain Truth of the Caſe drew them from him. For he has ſaid nothing but what is abſolutely eſſential to their Scheme. He knew it was ſo; and he had Honeſty enough to own it. True Mr <hi>Cudworth</hi> was ſenſible, he could not vindicate the Scheme, ſet in this open honeſt Light. Therefore he (abſolutely without any Grounds) pretends I miſrepreſent their Scheme; and then buries up himſelf in a heap of ambiguous Words; without attempting to anſwer my <hi>Queries</hi> upon the Point.

               </gap>. THAT herein lies the great difficulty of believing, not as it is with divine Truths becauſe the thing to be believed is contrary to our vicious Byaſſes; (<hi>Joh.</hi> iii. 19.) but meerly becauſe we have no Evidence of it's Truth, but full Demonſtration that it is falſe. <q>This is a ſtrange kind of Aſſurance, far different from other ordinary Kinds; and therefore no wonder if it be found weak and imperfect, and difficult to be obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and aſſaulted with many Doubtings.</q>—But pray, wherein does it differ from all other Kinds of Aſſurance? and why is it ſo difficult to be obtained? He goes on to ſay, <q>we are conſtrained to believe other things on the clear Evidence that we have that they are true, and would remain true, whether we believe them or no: ſo that we cannot deny our Aſſent, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out rebelling againſt the Light of our Senſes, Reaſon or Conſcience: but here our Aſſurance is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed on our Thoughts BY ANY EVIDENCE OF THE THING.</q>— And on this Account, and meerly on this Account, is it difficult to believe this Fact. For there is no Man but that would be glad to believe, that inſtead of going to Hell after Death, he ſhall be for ever happy in Heaven. <hi>Balaam</hi> ſaid, <hi>let me die the Death of the Rightoeus, and let my latter End be like his.</hi> So that wicked Men would be glad to get this Faith;

and if they cannot get it, it is not becauſe they are not <hi>willing</hi> to have it; as was the Caſe with the wicked Jews, whom Chriſt upbraided, Joh. v. 40 <hi>Ye WILL NOT come to me that ye might have Life;</hi> but meerly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have not "any Evidence of the thing." So then they are not to blame for their Unbelief; for it is no Crime. Rather they are to be pitied; for it can be conſidered only as a Calamity. And accordingly ſeveral Writers have of late appeared in <hi>Great-Britain</hi> zealous to prove, that Faith is no Duty, and Unbelief no Sin.</p>
            <p>THUS far then Mr. <hi>Marſhall</hi>'s Words are plain, and his Meaning eaſy to be come at: but the next Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular is not without ſome Difficulty. For,</p>
            <p n="7">7. HE ſays, that the Fact not being true, but rather known to be falſe, and ſo there being no Evidence of any Kind, or from any Quarter to build our Faith up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we muſt therefore <q>work it out in our ſelves by the Aſſiſtance of the Spirit of God.</q> But how can a Man, in his right Senſes, go about to work up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to believe, that to true, which he knows is not true, but abſolutely falſe? and which Way does a Man go to work in this Caſe? He does not look for Evidence; for he knows there is none from Scripture, Senſe or Reaſon. Nay, he does not try to believe it to be true, as ſuppoſing it true; for he knows it is not true. But he tries to believe it is true, that it may become true, by his believing it to be true. Surprizing, ſhocking Affair!</p>
            <p>AND all this by the Aſſiſtance of the Spirit of God." —But pray, how can the Spirit of God grant any Aſſiſtance in ſuch a Caſe? Were the Fact true, and were there Evidence of its Truth, we ſhould need no Aſſiſtance in the Caſe. A wicked Man is as able and as willing to believe ſuch a Fact as any Saint in the World. And ſince the Fact is known not to be true, and it is known there is no Evidence of its Truth, but full De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of its Falſhood, what Aſſiſtance can the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God grant in the Caſe?

            <p n="8">8. A fundamental Maxim in Mr. <hi>Marſhall</hi>'s Scheme, on which all the reſt depends; I ſay, A fundamental Maxim in Mr. <hi>Marſhall</hi>'s whole Scheme is, that in Juſtifying Faith "we believe that to be true, which is not true before we believe it." And this Maxim is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely eſſential to his Scheme. For,</p>
            <p>THE Fact believed is that "my Sins are forgiven." or in other Words, "that I have a ſaving Intereſt in Chriſt and all the Benefits purchaſed by him."—Now, if they ſay, that this is true before I believe it, they muſt, with the groſſeſt Sort of Antinomians, hold that <hi>we are juſtified before Faith,</hi> in expreſs Contradiction to the whole Goſpel.— This they do not, they dare not ſay.—They are therefore under an abſolute neceſſity to ſay, that we believe that to be true which is not true before we believe it."</p>
            <p>BUT if it is not true before we believe it, then every thing Mr. <hi>Marſhall</hi> has ſaid will inevitably follow. For if it is not true, it is falſe. If it is not true, there is, there can be, no "Evidence from Scripture, Senſe or Reaſon" that it is true. And therefore we muſt believe "without any Evidence of the Thing." And ſo it is "a ſtrange kind of Aſſurance," and "difficult to be obtained," and we muſt "work it out in our ſelves." And it being ſo contrary to common Senſe, even to the Reaſon of all Mankind, to believe that to be true which we know is not true, we evidently need the <hi>Aſſiſtance of</hi> ſome <hi>Spirit</hi> in the Affair. Not the Spirit of God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, for he never helps Men to believe any thing, but what is true before we believe it.</p>
            <p>IF therefore it can be proved, that this fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Maxim is falſe, down goes their whole Scheme, and all who are ſetted upon it, he buried in its Ruins.—</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:009339_0024_10317A0F826A4940"/>1. IT is ſelf evident, that in all Inſtances, a thing muſt exiſt, at leaſt, in order of Nature, before it's Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence can be diſcerned by the human Mind. To ſay otherwiſe, is an expreſs Contradiction. For, to diſcern that a Thing exiſts before it does exiſt, is to ſee that it is before it is: Which is the ſame as to ſay, that a Thing may be, and not be, at the ſame Time. Which is an expreſs Contradiction.—</p>
            <p>BUT to believe <hi>my Sins are forgiven,</hi> is to diſcern that this Fact is really ſo, that this Thing does exiſt. It's Exiſtence then is in order of Nature, before I diſcern it's Exiſtence. For to ſay, I can ſee a Thing to be, which is not, is an expreſs Contradiction. So then they muſt ſay, we are juſtified before Faith, or their Faith is an inconſiſtent, Self-contradictory Thing.</p>
            <p>I am well aware, that this Sort of Converts, in their inward Experiences, are wont to have the Love of God and pardon of Sin, to their Apprehenſion, manifeſted to their Souls before they believe. For this Manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the Ground of their belie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> and indeed it would be ſimply impoſſible, they ever ſhould believe, if they had not ſomething of this Nature For no human Mind can believe what appears to be not true. But it will not do to ſpeak out this Secret, &amp; tell the World plainly how it is. For then it would appear, that they are <hi>juſtified before Faith,</hi> and all would join to condemn them as <hi>groſs Antinomians.</hi> And therefore they are obliged to give ſuch an Account of their Faith, as in its own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture evidently implies a Contradiction. Nor can you get one of theſe Men coolly and impartially to attend to this Point, becauſe they are conſcious of an inſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Difficulty. Rather, they will bury themſelves in obſcurity, in a multitude of ambiguous Words, not at all to the Purpoſe.

And to the ſame Purpoſe, page 101, 195, 205, &amp;c.— Now, if it be a <hi>Conſequent</hi> of our Union with Chriſt by Faith, then it does not exiſt 'till after Faith.

            <p n="4">4. IN order to prove Mr. <hi>Sandeman's</hi> Faith, not to be juſtifying Faith, Mr. <hi>Wilſon</hi> uſes this Argument. <q>Every one who is poſſeſſed of juſtifying Faith, muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly be juſtifyed; but a general Belief of the Goſpel, or a general Aſſent to the Truth of the Facts recorded in the New Teſtament, is to be found with many who are never juſtified: therefore a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Faith or aſſent to the Truths of the Goſpel, &amp; Hiſtory of the Facts recorded in the new Teſtament, is not juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Faith</q>. p. 72.—This Argument he aſſerts to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive: But it is equally ſtrong againſt himſelf. For,— <q>every one who is poſſeſſed of Juſtifying Faith, muſt be undoubtedly juſtified; but a <hi>belief of the Rem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſſion of Sins, with application to a Mans ſelf,</hi> which is his own Definition of juſtifying Faith, p. 145. is to be found with many who were never juſtified; as he himſelfs own, p. 102. therefore this belief is not juſtifying Faith.</q>
            </p>
            <p>SHOULD he ſay, that Self-deceived Sinners do not believe their Sins to be forgiven, upon the Teſtimony of God in his Word<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the ſame is true on his Scheme, by his own Acknowledgement: for it was not true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he believed it. But the Teſtimony of God is true before we believe it, and whether we ever believe it or not: as he himſelf owns. Therefore his Faith is not built on the Divine Teſtimony: But rather, as Mr. <hi>Marſhall</hi> ſays, "is without any Evidence from Scripture Senſe or Reaſon."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:009339_0028_10317A195A1644B8"/>Or ſhould he ſay, that the Faith of deluded Sinners is not productive of Evangelical Graces: The ſame may be ſaid of his Faith. For no religious Affections can be called evangelical Graces, which do not reſult from the Knowledge and Belief of ſome Truth revealed in the Goſpel. But the ſuppoſed Truth, which is the Source of all their religious Affections, is not contained in the Goſpel: as they themſelves own.</p>
            <p>Or ſhould he ſay, that deceived Sinners are prompted to believe their Sins forgiven, from a ſelf-righteous Spirit: Juſt this is the Caſe on the Scheme of theſe Men. As I have proved at large, <hi>Eſſay,</hi> Sect. IX.— There is no poſſible Way then for him to get rid of the Force of his own Argument. It is equally Concluſive againſt his Scheme, and Mr. <hi>Sandeman</hi>'s: And does indeed confute them both at once.</p>
            <p>THUS we ſee, that the Faith of theſe Gentlemen, in which they profeſs to believe that to be true, which is not true before we believe it, — implies a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction in it's own Nature—is the belief of a Lie— is no Goſpel Faith—is nothing more than deluded Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners may have: it is therefore very far from being that precious Faith, which is peculiar to God's Elect, and which is infallibly connected with eternal Life — No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing therefore now remains, but to attend carefully to Mr. <hi>Wilſon</hi>'s Arguments in it's Vindication, which may be ſummed up in theſe four.</p>

                     </gap> any thing, but what is infallibly true, whether we believe it or not: This we beg Leave to deny. For as God in the Goſpel freely promiſes,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:009339_0030_10317A21A63B8190"/>
or makes an offer of Life and Salvation to Sinners thro' Jeſus Chriſt, it is evident, the Promiſe cannot be believed, but in the way of <hi>appropriating</hi> the Gift, or believing they ſhall be ſaved through his Blood: which certainly cannot be ſaid to be a Truth, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we believe it or not; for if it was, all who hear the Goſpel would infallibly be ſaved.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Matter is plainly this: the Goſpel no where propoſes it as a Truth to be believed, that Men ſhall be ſaved through Chriſt, whether they believe or not; but it every where teſtifies, that <hi>he that believeth ſhall be ſaved.</hi> Now this very Declaration publiſhed, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently repeated in the Goſpel for the Encouragement or Sinners, makes it warrantable, for every one of them to believe his own particular Salvation thro' Chriſt. And the Truth is, till he believes this upon the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the divine Promiſe, Faithfulneſs, or Veracity, he in effect, really and in the Senſe of Scripture, diſbelieves and calls in Queſtion the Truth of the divine Teſtimony made known in the Propoſition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-mentioned. That he does ſo, evidently appears by his not crediting it, ſo as to reſt his hope of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation wholly upon the Promiſe of God, and the Record which he has given of his Son, in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</q> p. 14, 15.</p>
               <p>Stop now, candid Reader, and critically examine theſe Words. "He diſbelieves the divine Teſtimony," ſays he But why? becauſe <q>he does not reſt his hope of Salvation wholly upon the Promiſe of God.</q>— but pray, what promiſe? Why this, <q>he that believeth ſhall be ſaved.</q> Which is ſo "frequently repeated in the Goſpel." — <hi>He that believeth!</hi> that believeth what! pray, what is the Sinner to believe? he is to believe "his own particular Salvation."—to "believe that he ſhall be ſaved."—But is this the meaning of the Text?

<pb n="29" facs="unknown:009339_0031_10317A262491C160"/>
Thing believed is a Lie. But to believe a Lie, is not to believe in Chriſt; unleſs they make this Lie, that very Chriſt, on which they venture their all for Eternity.— Read the Bible thro', O impenitent, unconverted chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Sinner, and you may find enough ſuch Declarations as theſe, <hi>Repent and be baptized in the Name of the Lord Jeſus for the Remiſſion of Sins—repent and be converted that thy Sins may be blotted out—Except ye repent ye ſhall periſh— repent, and believe the Goſpel—believe in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt and thou ſhall be ſaved</hi>—and theſe Declarations are all true before you believe them, and whether you believe them or not.—But you can no where find any thing like this, <hi>believe thy Sins are forgiven, and they ſhall be forgiven—believe thou ſhalt be ſaved, and thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi>—In this Caſe, what you believe is not true before you believe it, as they themſelves grant. And believing a Lie, tho' it may make it ſeem true to you, yet it will not make it in Fact true.</p>
               <p>PRAY, who is he that believes the divine Teſtimony? He that believes the very Thing God means to ſay; Or he that puts a new Meaning to God's Words, which God never intended, and which never came into his Heart?—May we not ſay of theſe Men, as our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our did of the <hi>Phariſees; by your Traditions you make the Command of God of none Effect.</hi> So by <hi>their Faith</hi> they make <hi>the Declarations of the Goſpel a Lie.</hi> The Goſpel declares, <hi>Except ye repent, ye ſhall all periſh: Repent and be converted, that your Sins may be blotted out.</hi> But theſe Men teach, that if an impenitent, unconverted Sinner, while ſuch, believes his Sins are blotted out, they are blotted out.—That is, if he believes a Thing to be true, which is directly contrary to the Declaration of the Goſpel, it ſhall become true: And ſo <hi>his Faith</hi> ſhall cauſe <hi>the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of the Goſpel to become a Lie.</hi>

                  <q>When God gave the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> a <hi>promiſe</hi> of entering into the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> ſays Mr. <hi>Wilſon,</hi> I preſume it will not be denied, that they had not only a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, but that it was their indiſpenſible Duty to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that he would bring them to the Poſſeſſion of

it, notwithſtanding the Difficulties they might have to encounter by the Way;—yet it cannot be ſaid it was infallibly true, that they ſhould enter into the promiſed Land whether they believed or not; for the Event pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the contrary. It is evident then, that they were called to believe ſomething that was not infallibly true, whether they believed it or not. p. 18, 19. This is equally true of the Promiſe of the Goſpel made to Sinners of Mankind indefinitely, p. 23. For God hath given to all who hear the Goſpel, a Promiſe of entering into his Reſt or Heaven; which gives every one of them ſufficient Warrant to believe, that — he ſhall be ſaved. p. 23, 24.— This Promiſe is the <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>immediate</hi> Foundation of Faith. — It is only by an <hi>appropriating</hi> and <hi>fiducial</hi> Peſwaſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, that any one can commence a true believer of the Goſpel, or attain to any certain Knowledge of his eternal Election.</q> p 25. However the Thing to be believed is not true before they believe it, and never will be true unleſs they do believe it. p. 18—26. And therefore he concludes, that in juſtifying Faith, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that to be true, which is not true before we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it. — To this I anſwer,</p>

When therefore the immediate Suggeſtion of the Divine Spirit came into their Minds, prompting them to declare, that a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular miraculous Event ſhould happen, they had, from that, and from the Promiſe of Chriſt, full Evidence to believe that it would be done on their Declaration. And on this Ground, <hi>Peter</hi> had a good Warrant to ſay, to the lame Man, in Act. iii. <hi>Riſe up, and walk:</hi> And full Evidence before he ſpake, to believe, that on his Speaking, the Man would he healed.

And we have the higheſt Evidence of the Thing.—What it is to aſk in Chriſt's Name, has been already ſhewn. (<hi>Eſſay.</hi> Sect. IV, and V.)</p>
