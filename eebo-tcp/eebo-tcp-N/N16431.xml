            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>MANKIND may amuſe themſelves with theoretic ſyſtems of liberty, and trace its ſocial and moral effects on ſciences, virtue, induſtry, and every improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of which the human mind is capable; but we can only diſcern its true value by the practical and wretched effects of ſlavery; and thus dreadfully will they be realiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when the inhabitants of the Eaſtern States are dragging out a miſerable exiſtence <hi>only</hi> on the gleanings of their fields; and the Southern, bleſſed with a ſofter and more fertile climate, are languiſhing in hopeleſs poverty; and when aſked, what is become of the flower of their crop, and the rich produce of their farms—they may anſwer in the hapleſs ſtile of the Man of <hi>La Mancha</hi>—"The ſtew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard of my Lord has ſeized and ſent it to <hi>Madrid.</hi>"—Or, in the moral literal language of truth—the <hi>exigencies</hi> of government require, that the collectors of the revenue ſhould tranſmit it to the <hi>Federal City.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Animated with the firmeſt zeal for the intereſt of this country, the peace and union of the American States, and the freedom and happineſs of a people who have made the moſt coſtly ſacrifices in the cauſe of liberty—who have braved the power of Britain, weathered the convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of war, and waded through the blood of friends and foes to eſtabliſh their independence, and to ſupport the freedom of the human mind, I cannot ſilently witneſs this degradation without calling on them, before they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to bluſh at their own ſervitude, and to turn back their languid eyes on their loſt liberties—to c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

He adds, "That even ſedition is not the moſt indubitable enemy to the public welfare; but that its moſt dreadful foe is deſpotiſm, which always changes the character of nations for the worſe, and is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of nothing but vice; that the tyrant no longer ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites to the purſuits of glory or virtue; it is not talents, it is baſeneſs and ſervility that he cheriſhes, and the weight of arbitrary power deſtroys the ſpring of emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion."<note n="*" place="bottom">HELV<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

It may be repeated, they have purchaſed it with their blood, and have gloried in their independence with a dignity of ſpirit which has made them the admiration of philoſophy, the pride of America, and the wonder of Europe.

               <note n="*" place="bottom">ABBE MABLE.</note> Do not theſe dignified principles ſtill exiſt among us? Or are they extinguiſhed in the breaſts of Americans, whoſe fields have been ſo recently crimſoned to repel the potent arm of a foreign Monarch, who had planted his enſigns of ſlavery in every city, with deſign to eraſe the veſtiges of freedom in this his laſt aſylum. It is yet to be hoped, for the honour of human nature, that no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binations, either foreign or domeſtic, have thus darkened this Weſtern hemiſphere. On theſe ſhores freedom has planted her ſtandard, dipped in the purple tide that flowed from the veins of her martyred heroes; and here every uncorrupted American yet hopes to ſee it ſupported by the vigour, the juſtice, the wiſdom, and unanimity of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in ſpite of the deep-laid plots, the ſecret intrigues, or the bold effrontery of thoſe intereſted and avaricious adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers for place, who, intoxicated with ideas of diſtinction and preferment, have proſtrated every worthy principle beneath the ſhrine of ambition. Yet theſe are the men who tell us, republicaniſm is dwindled into theory—that we are incapable of enjoying our liberties—and that we muſt have a maſter. Let us retroſpect the days of our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, and recollect who were then our friends; do we find them among the ſticklers for ariſtocratic authority? No—they were generally the ſame men who now wiſh to ſave us from the diſtractions of anarchy on the one hand, and the jaws of tyranny on the other; where then were the claſs who now come forth importunately urging that our political ſalvation depends on the adoption of a ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem at which freedom ſpurns? Were not ſome of them hidden in the corners or obſcurity, and others wrapping themſelves in the boſom of our enemies for ſafety? Some of them were in the arms of infancy, and others ſpeculat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for fortune, by ſporting with public money, while a few, a very few of them were magnanimouſly defending their country, and raiſing a character which I pray hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven may never be ſullied by aiding meaſures derogatory to their former exertions. But the revolutions in princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple which time produces among mankind, frequently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit the moſt mortifying inſtances of human weakneſs;
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:021112_0005_0FB23B57C540C1D0"/>
and this alone can account for the extraordinary appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a few names, once diſtinguiſhed in the honorable walks of patriotiſm, but now found on the liſt of the Maſſachuſetts aſſent to the ratification of a Conſtitution, which, by the undefined meaning of ſome parts, and the ambiguities of expreſſion in others, is dangerouſly adapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the purpoſes of an immediate <hi>ariſtocratic tyranny</hi>; that from the difficulty, if not impracticability of its ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, muſt ſoon terminate in the moſt <hi>uncontrouled deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potiſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All writers on government agree, and the feelings of the human mind witneſſes the truth of theſe political axioms, that man is born free, and poſſeſſed of certain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alienable rights—that government is inſtituted for the protection, ſafety, and happineſs of the people, and not for the profit, honour, or private intereſt of any man, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, or claſs of men. That the origin of all power is in the people, and that they have an inconteſtible right to check the creatures of their own creation, veſted with certain powers to guard the life, liberty, and property of the community: And if certain ſelected bodies of men, deputed on theſe principles, determine contrary to the wiſhes and expectations of their conſtituents, the people have an undoubted right to reject their deciſions, to call for a reviſion of their conduct, to depute others in their room, or, if they think proper, to demand further time for deliberation on matters, of the greateſt moment: it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is an unwarrantable ſtretch of authority or influence, if any methods are taken to preclude this reaſonable and peaceful mode of enquiry and deciſion. And it is with inexpreſſible anxiety, that many of the beſt friends to the Union—to the peaceable and equal participation of the rights of nature, and to the glory and dignity of this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, behold the inſidious arts, and the ſtrenuous efforts of the partiſans of arbitrary power, by their vague defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the beſt eſtabliſhed truths, endeavouring to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velope the mind in darkneſs—the concomitant of ſlavery; and to lock the ſtrong chains of domeſtic deſpotiſm on a country, which, by the moſt glorious and ſucceſsful ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles, is but newly emancipated from the ſceptre of foreign dominion.

ſee ſuch a paſſive diſpoſition prevail in ſome, who we muſt candidly ſuppoſe have liberal and enlarged ſentiments; while a ſupple multitude are paying a blind and idolatrous homage to the opinions of thoſe, who, by the moſt preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate ſteps, are treading down their dear-bought privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, and who are endeavouring, by all the arts of inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation and influence, to betray the people of the United States into an acceptance of a moſt complicated ſyſtem of government, marked on the one ſide with the <hi>dark, ſecret,</hi> and <hi>profound intrigues</hi> of the ſtateſman, long practiſed in the purlieus of deſpotiſm; and on the other, with the ideal projects of <hi>young ambition,</hi> with its wings juſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panded to ſoar to a ſummit which imagination has painted in ſuch gawdy colours as to intoxicate the <hi>inexperienced votary,</hi> and ſend <hi>him</hi> rambling from State to State, to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect materials to conſtruct the ladder of preferment.</p>
            <p>But as a variety of objections to the <hi>heterogeneous phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom,</hi> have been repeatedly laid before the public, by men of the beſt abilities and intentions, I will not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiate long on a Republican <hi>form</hi> of government, found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the principles of monarchy—a democratic branch with the <hi>features</hi> of ariſtocracy—and the extravagance of nobility pervading the minds of many of the candidates for office, with the poverty of peaſantry hanging heavily on them, and inſurmountable, from their taſte for expence, unleſs a generous proviſion ſhould be made in the arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the civil liſt, which may enable them with the champions of their cauſe, to "<hi>ſail down the new Pactolean channel.</hi>" Some gentlemen, with laboured zeal, have ſpent much time in urging the neceſſity of government, from the embarraſſments of trade—the want of reſpectability abroad, and confidence in the public engagements at home: Theſe are obvious truths which no one denies; and there are few who do not unite in the general wiſh for the reſtoration of public faith, the revival of commerce, arts, agriculture, and induſtry, under a lenient, peaceable, and energetic government: But the moſt ſagacious advocates for the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty have not, by fair diſcuſſion, and rational argumentation, evinced the neceſſity of adopting this many-headed mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; of ſuch motley mixture, that its enemies cannot trace a feature of Democratic or Republican extract; nor have its friends the courage to denominate it a Monarchy, an Ariſtocracy, or an Oligarchy, and the favoured bantling muſt have paſſed through the ſhort period of its exiſtence

<q>That the principle aim of ſociety is to protect individuals in the abſolute rights which were veſted in them by the immediate laws of nature, but which could not be preſerved in peace, without the mutual intercourſe which is gained by the inſtitution of friendly and ſocial communities.</q>
—And when ſociety has thus deputed a certain number of their equals to take care of their perſonal rights, and the intereſt of the whole community, it muſt be conſidered that reſponſibility is the great ſecurity of integrity and honour; and that annual e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection is the baſis of reſponſibility.—Man is not immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately corrupted, but power, without limitation, or amean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability, may endanger the brighteſt virtue—whereas a fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent return to the bar of their conſtituents is the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt check againſt the corruptions to which men are liable, either from the intrigues of others of more ſubtil genius, or the propenſities of their own hearts—and the gentlemen who have ſo warmly advocated in the late Convention of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts,</hi> the change from annual to biennial elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; may have been in the ſame predicament, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps with the ſame views that Mr. <hi>Hutchinſon</hi> once ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged himſelf, when in a letter to Lord <hi>Hillſborough</hi> he obſerved,
<q>that the grand difficulty of making a change in government againſt the general bent of the people had cauſed him to turn his thoughts to a variety of plans, in order to find one that might be executed in ſpite of oppoſition,</q>
and the firſt he propoſed was, that "inſtead of annual, the elections ſhould be only once in three years:" But the miniſter had not the hardineſs to attempt ſuch an innovation, even in the reviſion of colonial char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: Nor has any one ever defended biennial, triennial, or ſeptennial elections, either in the Britiſh houſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, or in the debates of provincial aſſemblies, on general and free principles: But it is unneceſſary to dwell long on this article, as the beſt political wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:021112_0008_0FB23B5C4579EAA0"/>
have ſupported the principles of annual elections with a preciſion that cannot be confuted, though they may be darkened by the ſophiſtical arguments that have been thrown out with deſign, to undermine all the barriers of freedom.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is no ſecurity in the profered ſyſtem, either for the rights of conſcience, or the liberty of the preſs:— Deſpotiſm uſually, while it is gaining ground; will ſuffer men to think, ſay, or write what they pleaſe; but when once eſtabliſhed, if it is thought neceſſary to ſubſerve the purpoſes of arbitrary power, the moſt unjuſt reſtrictions may take place in the firſt inſtance, and an <hi>imprimator</hi> on the preſs in the next, may ſilence the complaints, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid the moſt decent remonſtrances of an injured and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed people.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There are no well defined limits of the judiciary powers, they ſeem to be left as a boundleſs ocean, that has broken over the chart of the ſupreme lawgiver, "<hi>thus far ſhalt thou go and no farther,</hi>" and as they cannot be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended by the cleareſt capacity, or the moſt ſagacious mind, it would be an Herculean labour to attempt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the dangers with which they are replete.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The executive and the legiſlative are ſo dangerouſly blended as to give juſt cauſe of alarm, and every thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative thereto, is couched in ſuch ambiguous terms—in ſuch vague and indefinite expreſſions, as is a ſufficient ground without any other objection, for the reprobation of a ſyſtem, that the authors dare not hazard to a clear in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigation.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The abolition of trial by jury in civil cauſes.—This mode of trial, the learned judge Blackſtone obſerves,
<q>has been coeval with the firſt rudiments of civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that property, liberty and life, depend on main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining in its legal force the conſtitutional trial by jury.</q>
He bids his readers pauſe, and with Sir Matthew Hale obſerves, how admirably this mode is adapted to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigation of truth beyond any other the world can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce. Even the party who have been diſpoſed to ſwallow without examination, the propoſals of the <hi>ſecret conclave,</hi> have ſtarted on a diſcovery that this eſſential right was curtailed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſhall a privilege, the origin of which may be traced to our Saxon anceſtors—that has been a part of the law of nations, even in the ſeudatory ſyſtems of France, Germany, and Italy—and from the earlieſt records has
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:021112_0009_0FB23B5DC5577268"/>
been held ſo ſacred, both in ancient and modern Britain, that it could never be ſhaken by the introduction of Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man cuſtoms, or any other conqueſts or chance of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment —ſhall this ineſtimable privilege be relinquiſhed in America—either through the fear of inquiſition for unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted thouſands of public monies in the hands of ſome who have been officious in the fabrication of the <hi>conſolidat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſyſtem,</hi> or from the apprehenſion that ſome future delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, poſſeſſed of more power than integrity, may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to a trial by his peers in the hour of inveſtigation?</p>
            <p n="6">6. Though it has been ſaid by Mr. <hi>Wilſon,</hi> and many others, that a ſtanding army is neceſſary for the dignity and ſafety of America, yet freedom revolts at the idea, when the Divan, or the deſpot, may draw out his dragoons to ſuppreſs the murmurs of a few, who may yet cheriſh thoſe ſublime principles which call forth the exertions, and lead to the beſt improvment of the human mind. It is hoped this country may yet be governed by milder methods than are uſually diſplayed beneath the bannerets of military law. Standing armies have been the nurſery of vice, and the bane of liberty, from the Roman legions, to the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the artful Ximenes, and from the ruin of the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of Spain, to the planting the Britiſh Cohorts in the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitals of America.—By the edicts of authority veſted in the ſovereign power by the propoſed conſtitution, the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia of the country, the bulwark of defence, and the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of national liberty, is no longer under the controul of civil authority; but at the reſcript of the monarch, or the ariſtocracy, they may either be employed to extort the enormous ſums that will be neceſſary to ſupport the civil liſt—to maintain the regalia of power—and the ſplendour of the moſt uſeleſs part of the community, or they may be ſent into foreign countries for the fulfilment of treaties, ſtipulated by the preſident and two thirds of the ſenate.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Notwithſtanding the deluſory promiſe to guarantee a republican form of government to every ſtate in the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on —if the moſt diſcerning eye could diſcover any mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at all in the engagement, there are no reſources left for the ſupport of internal government, or the liquidation of the debts of the ſtate. Every ſource of revenue is in the monopoly of Congreſs, and if the ſeveral legiſlatures in their enfeebled ſtate, ſhould againſt their own feelings be neceſſitated to attempt a dry tax for the payment of their debts, and the ſupport of internal police, even this may
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:021112_0010_0FB23B5F5A598390"/>
be required for the purpoſes of the general government.</p>
            <p n="8">8. As the new Congreſs are impowered to determine their own ſalaries, the requiſitions for this purpoſe may not be very moderate, and the drain for public monies will probably riſe paſt all calculation; and it is to be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when America has conſolidated its deſpotiſm, the world will witneſs the truth of the aſſertion—
<q>that the pomp of an eaſtern monarch may impoſe on the vulgar who may eſtimate the force of a nation by the magnificence of its palaces; but the wiſe man judges differently, it is by that very magnificence he eſtimates its weakneſs. He ſees nothing more in the midſt of this impoſing pomp, where the tyrant ſets enthroned, than a ſumptuous and mournful decoration of the dead; the aparatus of a faſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous funeral, in the centre of which is a cold and life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs lump of unanimated earth, a phantom of power rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to diſappear before the enemy, by whom it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed!</q>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. There is no proviſion for a rotation, nor any thing to prevent the perpetuity of office in the ſame hands for life; which by a little well timed bribery, will probably be done, to the excluſion of men of the beſt abilities from their ſhare in the offices of government.—By this neglect we loſe the advantages of that check to the overbearing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence of office, which by rendering him ineligible at cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain periods, keeps the mind of man in equilibrio, and teaches him the feelings of the governed, and better qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifies him to govern in his turn.</p>
            <p n="10">10. The inhabitants of the United States, are liable to be dragged from the vicinity of their own county, or ſtate, to anſwer to the litigious or unjuſt ſuit of an adverſary, on the moſt diſtant borders of the continent: In ſhort, the appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late juriſdiction of the ſupreme federal court, includes an unwarrantable ſtretch of power over the liberty, life, and property of the ſubject, through the wide continent of America.</p>
            <p n="11">11. One repreſentative to thirty thouſand inhabitants is a very inadequate repreſentation; and every man who is not loſt to all ſenſe of freedom to his country, muſt repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate the idea of Congreſs altering by law, or on any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence whatever interfering with any regulations for the time, places, and manner of chooſing our own repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives.</p>

<pb n="12" facs="unknown:021112_0011_0FB23B60C8B8D578"/>
the circumſcribing the votes to only ten electors in this ſtate, and the ſame proportion in all the others, is nearly tantamount to the excluſion of the voice of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the choice of their firſt magiſtrate. It is veſting the choice ſolely in an ariſtocratic junto, who may eaſily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine in each ſtate to place at the head of the union the moſt convenient inſtrument for deſpotic ſway.</p>
            <p n="13">13. A ſenate choſen for ſix years, will in moſt inſtances, be an appointment for life, as the influence of ſuch a body over the minds of the people, will be coeval to the exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive powers with which they are veſted, and they will not only forget, but be forgotten by their conſtituents; a branch of the ſupreme legiſlature thus ſet beyond all reſponſibility, is totally repugnant to every principle of a free govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p n="14">14. There is no proviſion by a bill of rights to guard gainſt the dangerous encroachments of power in too many inſtances to be named: But I cannot paſs over in ſilence the inſecurity in which we are left with regard to warrants unſupported by evidence—the daring experiment of grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>writs of aſſiſtance</hi> in a former arbitrary adminiſtration is not yet forgotten in the Maſſachuſetts; nor can we be ſo ungrateful to the memory of the patriots who counteracted their operation, as ſo ſoon after their manly exertions to ſave us from ſuch a deteſtable inſtrument of arbitrary pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, to ſubject ourſelves to the inſolence of any petty reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue officer to enter our houſes, ſearch, inſult, and ſeize at pleaſure. We are told by a gentlemen of too much virtue and real probity to ſuſpect he has a deſign to deceive— "that the whole conſtitution is a declaration of rights,"— but mankind muſt think for themſelves, and to many ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry judicious and diſcerning characters, the whole conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, with very few exceptions, appears a perverſion of the rights of particular ſtates, and of private citizens—But the gentlemen goes on to tell us,
<q>that the primary object is the general government, and that the rights of indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals are only incidentally mentioned, and that there was a clear impropriety in being very particular about them.</q>
But, aſking pardon for diſſenting from ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable authority, who has been led into ſeveral miſtakes, more from his predilection in favour of certain modes of governmens, than from a want of underſtanding or vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, the rights of individuals ought to be the primary object of all government, and cannot be too ſecurely guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:021112_0012_0FB23B624B118AB8"/>
by the moſt explicit declarations in their favour. This has been the opinion of the Hampdens, the Pyms, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other illuſtrious names, that have ſtood forth in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Engliſh liberties; and even the Italian maſter of politics, the ſubtil and renowned Machiavel acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, that no republic ever yet ſtood on a ſtable founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion without ſatiſfying the common people.</p>
            <p n="15">15. The difficulty, if not impracticability, of exerciſing the equal and equitable powers of government by a ſingle legiſlature over an extent of territory that reaches from the Miſſiſippi to the weſtern lakes, and from them to the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantic ocean, is an inſuperable objection to the adoption of the new ſyſtem.—Mr. Hutchinſon, the great champion for arbitrary power, in the multitude of his machinations to ſubvert the liberties of this country, was obliged to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge in one of his letters, that "from the extent of country from north to ſouth, the ſcheme of one govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was impracticable." But if the authors of the preſent viſionary project, can by the arts of deception, precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and addreſs, obtain a majority of ſuffrages in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions of the ſtates to try the hazardous experiment, they may then make the ſame inglorious boaſt with this inſidious politician, who may perhaps be their model, that "the union of the colonies was pretty well broken, and that he hoped never to ſee it renewed."</p>
            <p n="16">16. It is an indiſputed fact, that not one legiſlature in the United States had the moſt diſtant idea when they firſt appointed members for a convention, entirely commercial, or when they afterwards authoriſed them to conſider on ſome amendments of the federal union, that they would, without any warrant from their conſtituents, preſume on ſo bold and daring a ſtride, as ultimately to deſtroy the ſtate governments, and offer a <hi>conſolidated ſyſtem,</hi> irrever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible but on conditions that the ſmalleſt degree of penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt diſcover to be impracticable.</p>
            <p n="17">17. The firſt appearance of the article which declares the ratification of nine ſtates ſufficient for the eſtabliſhment of the new ſyſtem, wears the face of diſſention, is a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the union of the conſederated ſtates, and tends to the introduction of anarchy and civil convulſions,— and may be a means of involving the whole country in blood.</p>
            <p n="18">18. The mode in which this conſtitution is recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the people to judge without either the advice of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:021112_0013_0FB23B63C6591F40"/>
or the legiſlatures of the ſeveral ſtates, is very repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible —it is an attempt to force it upon them before it could be thoroughly underſtood, and may leave us in that ſituation, that in the firſt moments of ſlavery the minds of the people, agitated by the remembrance of their loſt liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, will be like the ſea in a tempeſt, that ſweeps down every mound of ſecurity.</p>
            <p>But it is needleſs to enumerate other inſtances, in which the propoſed conſtitution appears contradictory to the firſt principles which ought to govern mankind; and it is equally ſo to enquire into the motives that induced to ſo bold a ſtep as the annihilation of the independence and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty of the thirteen diſtinct ſtates.—They are but too obvious through the whole progreſs o the buſineſs, from the firſt ſhutting up the doors of the Federal Convention, and reſolving that no member ſhould correſpond with gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen in the different ſtates on the ſubject under diſcuſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; till the trivial propoſition of recommending a few amendments was artfully uſhered into the convention of the Maſſachuſetts. The queſtions that were then before that honourable aſſembly were profound and important, they were of ſuch magnitude and extent, that the conſequences may run parallel with the exiſtence of the country; and to ſee them waved and haſtily terminated by a meaſure too abſurd to require a ſerious refutation, raiſes the honeſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation of every true lover of his country. Nor are they leſs grieved that the ill policy and arbitrary diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſome of the ſons of America, has thus precipitated to the contemplation and diſcuſſion of queſtions that no one could rationally ſuppoſe would have been agitated mong us, till time had blotted out the principles on which the late revolution was grounded; or till the laſt traits of the many political tracts, which defended the ſeparation from Britain, and the rights of men were conſigned to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> oblivion. After the ſevere conflicts this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try has ſuffered, it is preſumed, that they are diſpoſed to make every reaſonable ſacrifice before the altar of peace. But when we contemplate the nature of men, and conſider them originally on an equal footing, ſubject to the ſame feelings, ſtimulated by the ſame paſſions, and recollecting the ſtruggles they have recently made, for the ſecurity of their civil rights; it cannot be expected that the inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants of the Maſſachuſetts, can be eaſily lulled into a fatal ſecurity, by the declamatory effuſions of gentlemen, who,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:021112_0014_0FB23B6545740AB8"/>
contrary to the experience of all ages, would perſuade them there is no danger to be apprehended from veſting diſcretionary powers in the hands of man, which he may, or may not abuſe. The very ſuggeſtion, that we ought to truſt to the precarious hope of amendments and redreſs, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we have voluntarily fixed the ſhackles on our own necks, ſhould have awakened to a double degree of cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. —This people have not forgotten the artful inſinuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a former governor, when pleading the unlimited authority of parliament before the legiſlature of the Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſetts; nor that his arguments were very ſimilar to ſome lately urged by gentlemen who boaſt of oppoſing his meaſures, "<hi>with halters about their necks."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We were then told by him, in all the ſoft language of inſinuation, that no form of government of human con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction can be perfect—that we had nothing to fear— that we had no reaſon to complain—that we had only to acquieſce in their illegal claims, and to ſubmit to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitions of parliament, and doubtleſs the lenient hand of government would redreſs all grievances, and remove the oppreſſions of the people:—Yet we ſoon ſaw armies of mercenaries encamped on our plains—our commerce ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined —our harbours blockaded—and our cities burnt. It may be replied, that this was in conſequence of an obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate defence of our privileges; this may be true, and when the "<hi>ultima ratio</hi>" is called to aid, the weakeſt muſt fall. But let the beſt informed hiſtorian produce an inſtance, when bodies of men were entruſted with power, and the proper checks relinquiſhed, if they were ever found deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of ingenuity ſufficient to furniſh pretences to abuſe it. And the people at large are already ſenſible, that the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which America has claimed, which reaſon has juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and which have been ſo gloriouſly defended by the ſword of the brave, are not about to fall before the tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of foreign conqueſt; it is native uſurpation that is ſhak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the foundations of peace, and ſpreading the ſable cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of deſpotiſm over the United States. The banners of freedom were erected in the wilds of America by our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, while the wolf prowled for his prey on the one hand, and more ſavage man on the other; they have been ſince reſcued from the invading hand of foreign power, by the valor and blood of their poſterity; and there was reaſon to hope they would continue for ages to illumine a quarter of the globe, by nature kindly ſeparated from the
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:021112_0015_0FB23B66C5CB5A48"/>
proud monarchies of Europe, and the infernal darkneſs of Aſiatic ſlavery.</p>
            <p>And it is to be feared, we ſhall ſoon ſee this country ruſhing into the extremes of confuſion and violence, in conſequence of the proceedings of a ſet of gentlemen, who, diſregarding the purpoſes of their appointment, have aſſumed powers unauthoriſed by any commiſſion, have unneceſſarily rejected the conſederation of the United States, and annihilated the ſovereignty and independence of the individual governments. The cauſes which have inſpired a few men, aſſembled for very different purpoſes, with ſuch a degree of temerity as to break with a ſingle ſtroke the union of America, and diſſeminate the ſeeds of diſcord through the land, may be eaſily inveſtigated, when we ſurvey the partizans of monarchy in the State Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, urging the adoption of a mode of government that militates with the former profeſſions and exertions of this country, and with all ideas of republicaniſm, and the equal rights of men.</p>
            <p>Paſſion, prejudice, and error are characteriſtics of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature; and as it cannot be accounted for on any principles of philoſophy, religion, or good policy, to theſe ſhades in the human character muſt be attributed the mad zeal of ſome to precipitate to a blind adoption of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the late federal convention, without giving oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity for better information to thoſe who are miſled by influence or ignorance into erroneous opinions. Literary talents may be proſtituted, and the powers of genius de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſed to ſubſerve the purpoſes of ambition or avarice; but the feelings of the heart will dictate the language of truth, and the ſimplicity of her accents will proclaim the infamy of thoſe who betray the rights of the people, under the ſpecious and popular pretence of <hi>juſtice, conſolidation,</hi> and <hi>dignity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is preſumed the great body of the people unite in ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent with the writer of theſe obſervations, who moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly prays, that public credit may rear her declining head, and remunerative juſtice pervade the land; nor is there a doubt, if a free government is continued, that time and induſtry will enable both the public and private debtor to liquidate their arrearages in the moſt equitable manner. They wiſh to ſee the Confederated States bound together by the moſt indiſſoluble union, but without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing their ſeveral ſovereignties and independence,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:021112_0016_0FB23B6845EB9060"/>
and becoming tributaries to a conſolidated fabric of ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratic tyranny. They wiſh to ſee government eſtabliſhed, and peaceably holding the reins with honour, energy, and dignity; but they wiſh for no <hi>federal city,</hi> whoſe "<hi>cloud cap'd towers</hi>" may ſcreen the ſtate culprit from the hand of juſtice; while its excluſive juriſdiction may protect the riot of armies encamped within its limits. They depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate diſcord and civil convulſions, but they are not yet ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally prepared, with the ungrateful Iſraelites, to aſk a King, nor are their ſpirits ſufficiently broken to yield the beſt of their olive grounds to his ſervants, and to ſee their ſons appointed to run before his chariots. It has been obſerved, by a zealous advocate for the new ſyſtem, that moſt governments are the reſult of fraud or violence, and this with a view to recommend its acceptance; but has not almoſt every ſtep towards its fabrication been fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in the extreme? Did not the prohibition, ſtrictly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined by the general Convention, that no member ſhould make any communication to his conſtituents, or to gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of conſideration and abilities in the other States, bear evident marks of fraudulent deſigns? This circumſtance is regretted in ſtrong terms by Mr. Martin, a member from Maryland, who acknowledges
<q>he had no idea that all the wiſdom, integrity, and virtue of the States was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in that Convention, and that he wiſhed to have correſponded with gentlemen of eminent political cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters abroad, and give their ſentiments due weight.</q>
He adds,
<q>ſo extremely ſolicitous were they, that their proceedings ſhould not tranſpire, that the members were prohibited from taking copies of their reſolutions, or extracts from the journals, without expreſs permiſſion, by vote.</q>
And the hurry with which it has been urged to the acceptance of the people, without giving time, by adjournments, for better information and more unanimity, has a deceptive appearance; and if finally driven to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, as the only alternative between that and ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, till in the confuſion of diſcord, the reins ſhould be ſeized by the violence of ſome enterpriſing genius, that may ſweep down the laſt barrier of liberty, it muſt be added to the ſcore of criminality with which the fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent uſurpation at Philadelphia may be chargeable. Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven avert ſuch a tremendous ſcene! and let us ſtill hope a more happy termination of the preſent ferment:—may the people be calm, and wait a legal redreſs; may the mad

This ſtep might again re-eſtabliſh the Union, reſtore tranquility to the ruffled mind of the inhabitants, and ſave America from diſtreſſes dreadful even in contemplation.
<q>The great art of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning is to lay aſide all prejudices and attachments to particular opinions, claſſes, or individual characters; to conſult the ſpirit of the people; to give way to it; and, in ſo doing, to give it a turn capable of inſpiring thoſe ſentiments which may induce them to reliſh a change which an alteration of circumſtances may here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after make neceſſary.</q>
The education of the advocates for monarchy ſhould have taught them, and their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory ſhould have ſuggeſted, that
<q>monarchy is a ſpecies of government fit only for a people too much corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by luxury, avarice, and a paſſion for pleaſure, to have any love for their country, and whoſe vices the fear of puniſhment alone is able to reſtrain; but by no means calculated for a nation that is poor, and at the ſame time tenacious of their liberty—animated with a diſguſt of tyranny—and inſpired with the generous feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of patriotiſm and liberty, and at the ſame time, like the ancient Spartans, have been hardened by tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perence and manly exertions, and equally deſpiſing the fatigues of the field, and the fear of enemies;</q>
—and while they change their ground they ſhould recollect, that Ariſtocracy is ſtill a more formidable foe to public virtue, and the proſperity of a nation—that under ſuch a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment her patriots become mercenaries—her ſoldiers cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, and the people <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Though ſeveral State Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions have aſſented to, and ratified, yet the voice of the people appears at preſent ſtrong againſt the adoption of the Conſtitution. By the chicanery, intrigue, and falſe colouring of thoſe who plume themſelves more on their education and abilities, than their political, patriotic, or private virtues—by the imbecility of ſome, and the dupli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of others, a majority of the Convention of Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts have been flattered with the ideas of amendments when it will be too late to complain—While ſeveral

Yet Virginia, equally large and reſpectable, and who have done honour to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by their vigourous exertions from the firſt dawn of independence, have not yet acted upon the queſtion; they have wiſely taken time to conſider, before they introduce innovations of a moſt dangerous nature. Her inhabitants are brave, her burgeſſes are free, and they have a Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor who dares to think for himſelf, and to ſpeak his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion (without firſt pouring libations on the altar of popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity) though it ſhould militate with ſome of the moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed and illuſtrious characters.</p>
            <p>Maryland, who has no local intereſt to lead her to adopt, will doubtleſs reject the ſyſtem. I hope the ſame characters ſtill live, and that the ſame ſpirit which dictated to them a wiſe and cautious care againſt ſudden revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in government, and made them the laſt State that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded to the independence of America, will lead them to ſupport what they ſo deliberately claimed: Georgia, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive of a war with the Savages, has acceded, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to inſure protection. Pennſylvania has ſtruggled through much in the ſame manner as the Maſſachuſetts, againſt the manly feelings and maſterly reaſonings of a very reſpectable part of the Convention: They have adopted the ſyſtem, and ſeen ſome of its authors burnt in effigy—their towns thrown into riot and confuſion, and the minds of the people agitated by apprehenſion and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord.</p>
            <p>New-Jerſey and Delaware have united in the meaſure from the locality of their ſituation, and the ſelfiſh motives which too generally govern mankind. The Federal Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and the ſeat of government will naturally attract the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe of ſtrangers, the youth of enterpriſe, and the wealth of the nation to the central States.</p>
            <p>Connecticut has puſhed it through with the precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her neighbour, with few diſſentient voices; but

more from irritation and reſentment to a ſiſter State, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps partiality to herſelf in her commercial regulations, than from a comprehenſive view of the ſyſtem as a regard to the welfare of all. But New-York has motives that will undoubtedly lead her to a rejection, without being afraid to appeal to the underſtanding of mankind to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy the grounds of their refuſal to adopt a Conſtitution, that even the framers dare not riſque to the hazard of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, amendment, or reconſideration, laſt the whole ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtructure ſhould be demoliſhed by more ſkilful and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet architects.

               </gap>nas will take; but I hope their determinations will comport with the dignity and freedom of this country: their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſions will have great weight in the ſcale. But equally important are the ſmall States of New-Hampſhire and Rhode-Iſland:—New-York, the Carolinas, Virginia, Maryland, and theſe two leſſer States, may yet ſupport the liberties of the continent. If they refuſe a ratification, or poſtpone their proceedings till the ſpirits of the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity have time to cool, there is little doubt but the wiſe meaſures of another Federal Convention will be adopted, when the members would have the advantage of viewing at large, through the medium of truth, the objections that have been made from various quarters; ſuch a meaſure might be attended with the moſt ſalutary effects, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the dread conſequences of civil feuds. But even if ſome of thoſe large ſtates ſhould haſtily accede, yet we have frequently ſeen, in the ſtory of revolution, relief ſpring from a quarter leaſt expected.</p>
            <p>Though the virtues of a Cato could not ſave Rome, nor the abilities of a Padilla defend the citizens of Caſtile from falling under the yoke of Charles, yet a <hi>Tell</hi> once ſuddenly roſe from a little obſcure city, and boldly reſcued the liberties of his country. Every age has its Bruti and its Decii, as well as its Caeſars and Sejani. The happineſs of mankind depends much on the modes of government and the virtues of the governors; and America may yet produce characters who have genius and capacity ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to form the manners and correct the morals of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and virtue enough to lead their country to freedom. Since her diſmemberment from the Britiſh empire, Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica has, in many inſtances, reſembled the conduct of a reſtleſs, vigorous, luxurious youth, prematurely emanci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated from the authority of a parent, but without the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience

neceſſary to direct him to act with dignity or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion. Thus we have ſeen her break the ſhackles of foreign dominion, and all the bleſſings of peace reſtored on the moſt honourable terms. She acquired the liberty of framing her own laws, chooſing her own magiſtrates, and adopting manners and modes of government the moſt favourable to the freedom and happineſs of ſociety. But how little have we availed ourſelves of theſe ſuperior ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages: The glorious fabric of liberty, ſucceſsfully rear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſo much labour and aſſiduity, totters to the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and may be blown away, as the bubble of fancy, by the rude breath of military combinations, and the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticians of yeſterday.</p>
            <p>It is true this country lately armed in oppoſition to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal deſpotiſm—impoveriſhed by the expences of a long war, and unable immediately to fulfil their public or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate engagements, have appeared in ſome inſtances with a boldneſs of ſpirit that ſeemed to ſet at defiance all autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, government, or order, on the one hand, while on the other, there has been not only a ſecret wiſh, but an open avowal of the neceſſity of drawing the reins of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment much too taught, not only for republicaniſm, but for a wiſe and limited monarchy. But the character of this people is not averſe to a degree of ſubordination: the truth of this appears from the eaſy reſtoration of tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, after a dangerous inſurrection in one of the ſtates; this alſo evinces the little neceſſity of a complete revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of government throughout the Union. But it is a republican principle, that the majority ſhould rule; and if a ſpirit of moderation could be cultivated on both ſides, till the voice of the people at large could be fairly heard, it ſhould be held ſacred: And if, on ſuch a ſcrutiny, the propoſed conſtitution ſhould appear repugnant to their character and wiſhes—if they, in the language of a late elegant pen, ſhould acknowledge that
<q>no confuſion, in my mind, is more terrible to them, than the ſtern diſciplined regularity and vaunted police of arbitrary governments, where every heart is depraved by fear, where mankind dare not aſſume their natural characters, where the free ſpirit muſt crouch to the ſlave in office, where genius muſt repreſs her effuſions, or, like the Egyptian wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers, offer them in ſacrifice to the calves in power, and where the human mind, always in ſhackles, ſhrinks from every generous effort.</q>
Who would then have
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:021112_0021_0FB23B6FC5E75A40"/>
the effrontery to ſay, it ought not to be thrown out with indignation, however ſome reſpectable names have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to ſupport it. But if after all, on a diſpaſſionate and fair diſcuſſion, the people generally give their voice for a voluntary dereliction of their privileges, let every individual, who chooſes the active ſcenes of life, ſtrive to ſupport the peace and unanimity of his country, though every other bleſſing may expire; and while the ſtateſman is plodding for power, and the courtier practiſing the arts of diſſimulation without check; while the rapacious are growing rich by oppreſſion, and fortune throwing her gifts into the lap of fools, let the ſublimer characters, the philoſophic lovers of freedom, who have wept over her exit, retire to the calm ſhades of contemplation; there they may look down with pity on the inconſiſtency of human nature, the revolutions of ſtates, the riſe of king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, and the fall of empires.</p>
