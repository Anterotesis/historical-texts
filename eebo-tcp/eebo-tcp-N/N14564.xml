            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE generality of thoſe geographers, who have attempted a map, or deſcription of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica, ſeem either to have had no knowledge of Kentucke, or to have neglected it, although a place of infinite importance: And the reſt have proceeded ſo erroneouſly, that they have left the world as much in darkneſs as before. Many are the miſtakes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the ſubject of this work, in all other maps which I have yet ſeen; whereas I can truly ſay, I know of none in that which I here preſent to the world either from my own particular knowledge, or from the information of thoſe gentlemen with whoſe aſſiſtance I have been favoured, and who have been well acquainted with the country ſince the firſt ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. When I viſited Kentucke, I found it ſo far to exceed my expectations, although great, that I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded it was a pity, that the world had not adequate information of it. I conceived that a proper deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and map of it, were objects highly intereſting to the United States; and therefore, incredible as it may appear to ſome, I muſt declare, that this perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance is not publiſhed from lucrative motives, but ſolely to inform the world of the happy climate, and
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:018467_0004_0FA7A6755E25BA48"/>
plentiful ſoil of this favoured region. And I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine the reader will believe me the more eaſily when I inform him, that I am not an inhabitant of Kentuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke, but having been there ſome time, by my acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in it, am ſufficiently able to publiſh the truth, and from principle, have cautiouſly endeavoured to avoid every ſpecies of falſehood. The conſciouſneſs of this encourages me to hope for the public candour, where errors may poſſibly be found. The three gentlemen honouring this work with their recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, Col. Boon, Col. Todd, and Col. Harrod, were among the firſt ſettlers, and perfectly well acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the country. To them I acknowledge myſelf much indebted for their friendly aſſiſtance in this work, which they chearfully contributed with a diſintereſted view of being ſerviceable to the public. My thanks are more eſpecially due to Col. Boon, who was earli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er acquainted with the ſubject of this performance than any other now living, as appears by the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his adventures, which I eſteemed curious and intereſting, and therefore have publiſhed them from his own mouth. Much advantage may poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ariſe to the poſſeſſor of this book, as thoſe who wiſh to travel in Kentucke will undoubtedly find it a Compleat Guide. To ſuch I affirm, that there is nothing mentioned or deſcribed but what they will find true. Conſcious that it would be of general utility, I have omitted nothing, and been exceeding particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar in every part. That it may have the deſired effect, is the ſincere wiſh of</p>

            <head>THE DISCOVERY, PURCHASE AND SETTLEMENT, OF KENTUCKE.</head>
            <p>THE firſt white man we have certain ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of, who diſcovered this province, was one James M'Bride, who, in company with ſome others, in the year 1754, paſſing down the Ohio in Canoes, landed at the mouth of Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tucke river, and there marked a tree, with the firſt letters of his name, and the date, which remain to this day. Theſe men reconnoitred the country, and returned home with the pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing news of their diſcovery of the beſt tract of land in North-America, and probably in the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:018467_0007_0FA7A676B45E9208"/>
world. From this period it remained concealed till about the year 1767, when one John Finley, and ſome others, trading with the Indians, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately travelled over the fertile region, now called Kentucke, then but known to the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, by the name of the Dark and Bloody Ground, and ſometimes the Middle Ground. This country greatly engaged Mr. Finley's attention. Some time after, diſputes ariſing between the Indians and traders, he was obliged to decamp; and returned to his place of reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in North-Carolina, where he communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated his diſcovery to Col. Daniel Boon, and a few more, who conceiving it to be an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſting object, agreed in the year 1769 to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake a journey in order to explore it. After a long fatiguing march, over a mountainous wilderneſs, in a weſtward direction, they at length arrived upon its borders; and from the top of an eminence, with joy and wonder, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcried the beautiful landſcape of Kentucke. Here they encamped, and ſome went to hunt proviſions, which were readily procured, there being plenty of game, while Col. Boon and John Finley made a tour through the country, which they found far exceeding their expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and returning to camp, informed their companions of their diſcoveries: But in ſpite of this promiſing beginning, this company, meeting with nothing but hardſhips and adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:018467_0008_0FA7A677627BBE58"/>
grew exceedingly diſheartened, and was plundered, diſperſed, and killed by the Indians, except Col. Boon, who continued an inhabitant of the wilderneſs until the year 1771, when he returned home.</p>
            <p>About this time Kentucke had drawn the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of ſeveral gentlemen. Doctor Walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Virginia, with a number more, made a tour weſtward for diſcoveries, endeavouring to find the Ohio river; and afterwards he and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Lewis, at Fort Stanwix, purchaſed from the Five Nations of Indians the lands lying on the north ſide of Kentucke. Col. Donaldſon, of Virginia, being employed by the State to run a line from ſix miles above the Long Iſland, on Holſtein, to the mouth of the great Kenhawa, and finding thereby that an extenſive tract of excellent country would be cut off to the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, was ſolicited, by the inhabitants of Clench and Holſtein, to purchaſe the lands lying on the north ſide of Kentucke river from the Five Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. This purchaſe he compleated for five hundred pounds, ſpecie. It was then agreed, to fix a boundary line, running from the long Iſland on Holſtein to the head of Kentucke ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: thence down the ſame to the mouth; thence up the Ohio, to the mouth of Great Kenhawa; but this valuable purchaſe the State refuſed to confirm.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:018467_0009_0FA7A67E5854BAB0"/>Col. Henderſon, of North-Carolina, being informed of this country by Col. Boon, he, and ſome other gentlemen, held a treaty with the Cherokee Indians at Wataga, in March 1775, and then purchaſed from them the lands lying on the ſouth ſide of Kentucke river for goods, at valuable rates, to the amount of ſix thouſand pounds, ſpecie.</p>
            <p>Soon after this purchaſe, the State of Virginia took the alarm, agreed to pay the money Col. Donaldſon had contracted for, and then diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted Col. Henderſon's right of purchaſe, as a private gentlemen of another ſtate, in behalf of himſelf: However, for his eminent ſervices to this country, and for having been inſtrumental in making ſo valuable an acquiſition to Virginia, that ſtate was pleaſed to reward him with a tract of land, at the mouth of Green River, to the amount of two hundred thouſand acres; and the ſtate of North-Carolina gave him the like quantity in Powel's Valley. This region was formerly claimed by various tribes of Indians; whoſe title, if they had any, originated in ſuch a manner, as to render it doubtful which ought to poſſeſs it: Hence this fertile ſpot became an object of contention, a theatre of war, from which it was properly denominated the Bloody-Grounds. Their contentions not being likely to decide the Right to any particular tribe, as
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:018467_0010_0FA7A67F2A56C690"/>
ſoon as Mr. Henderſon and his friends propoſed to purchaſe, the Indians agreed to ſell; and notwithſtanding the valuable Conſideration they received, have continued ever ſince troubleſome neighbours to the new ſettlers.</p>

               <p>THE beautiful river Ohio, bounds Kentucke in its whole length, being a mile and ſometimes leſs in breadth, and is ſufficient to carry boats of great burthen. Its general courſe is ſouth 60 degrees weſt; and in its courſe it receives numbers of large and ſmall rivers, which pay tribute to its glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. The only diſadvantage this fine river has, is a rapid, one mile and an half long, and one mile and a quarter broad, called the Falls of Ohio. In this place the river runs over a rocky bottom, and the deſcent is ſo gradual, that the fall does not probably in the whole exceed twenty feet. In ſome places we may obſerve it to fall a few feet. When the ſtream is low, empty boats only can paſs and repaſs this ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid; their lading muſt be tranſported by land; but when high, boats of any burthen may paſs in ſafety. Excepting this place, there is not a finer river in the world for navigation by boats. Beſides this, Kentucke is watered by eight ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler rivers, and many large and ſmall creeks, as may be eaſily ſeen in the map.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="unknown:018467_0012_0FA7A6806F0ED830"/>Licking River heading in the mountains with Cumberland River, and the North Branch of Kentucke, runs in a N. W. direction for up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of a hundred miles, collecting its ſilver ſtreams from many branches, and is about one hundred yards broad at its mouth.</p>
               <p>Red River heads and interlocks with the main branch of Licking, and flows in a S. Weſt courſe into Kentucke River, being about ſixty miles long, and ſixty yards wide at its mouth.</p>
               <p>The Kentucke River riſes with three heads from a mountainous part of the Country. Its northern branch interlocks with Cumberland; runs half way in a weſtern direction, and the other half N. weſterly. It is amazingly crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, upwards of two hundred miles in length, and about one hundred and fifty yards broad.</p>
               <p>Elkhorn is a ſmall river which empties itſelf into Kentucke in a N. W. by W. courſe; is about fifty miles long, and fifty yards broad at the mouth.</p>
               <p>Dick's River joins the Kentucke in a N. Weſt direction; is about forty-five miles long, and forty-five yards wide at its mouth. This river curiouſly heads and interlocks its branches with Salt River, Green River, and the waters
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:018467_0013_0FA7A684CA543DC8"/>
of Rock-caſtle River.—Salt River riſes at four different places near each other. The windings of this river are curious, rolling its ſtreams round a ſpacious tract of fine land, and uniting almoſt fifteen miles before they approach the Ohio, and twenty miles below the Falls. It is amazingly crooked, runs a weſtern courſe near ninety miles, and is about eighty yards wide at the mouth.</p>
               <p>Green River interlocking with the heads of Dick's River, as mentioned above, is alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazingly crooked, keeps a weſtern courſe for upwards of one hundred and fifty miles, and is about eighty yards wide at its mouth, which is about two hundred and twenty miles below the Falls.</p>
               <p>Cumberland River, interlocks with the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern branch of Kentucke, as aforeſaid, and rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling round the other arms of Kentucke, among the mountains, in a ſouthern courſe for one hundred miles; then in a ſouth weſtern courſe for above one hundred miles; then in a ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern and S. weſtern courſe for about two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty more, finds the Ohio, four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and thirteen miles below the Falls. At the ſettlements it is two hundred yards broad; and at its mouth three hundred, having paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:018467_0014_0FA7A685A1DA8CB8"/>
through North-Carolina in about half its courſe.</p>
               <p>The Great Kenhawa, or New River, riſes in North-Carolina, runs a northern, and N. Weſt courſe for upwards of four hundred miles, and finds the Ohio four hundred miles above the Falls. It is about five hundred yards wide at its mouth. Theſe two rivers are juſt mentioned, being beyond our limits. They run contrary courſes, are exceeding large, and it is worth notice, that Clench, Holſtein, Nolachuckey, and French-Broad rivers, take their riſe between theſe two, or rather weſtward of New River, ſome of them riſing and interlocking with it; and when they meet, form what is called the Teneſe, or Cherokee River, which runs a weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern courſe, and finds the Ohio twelve miles below Cumberland River. It is very large, and has ſpacious tracts of fine land.</p>
               <p>Theſe rivers are navigable for boats almoſt to their ſources, without rapids, for the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of the year. This country is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally level, and abounding with limeſtone, which uſually lies about ſix feet deep, except in hollows, where ſtreams run, where we find the rock in the bottom of the channel.</p>
               <p>The ſprings and ſtreams leſſen in June, and
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:018467_0015_0FA7A685A8F5E2B8"/>
continue low, hindering navigation, until No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember, when the autumnal rains ſoon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the rivers for boats, and repleniſh the whole country with water; but although the ſtreams decreaſe, yet there is always ſufficient for domeſtic uſes. There are many fine ſprings, that never fail; every farmer has a good one at leaſt; and excellent wells may eaſily be dug.</p>

               <head>NATURE of the SOIL.</head>
               <p>THE country, in ſome parts, is nearly level; in others not ſo much ſo; in others again hilly, but moderately, and in ſuch places there is moſt water. The levels are not like a carpet, but interſperſed with ſmall riſings, and declivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which form a beautiful proſpect. A great part of the ſoil is amazingly fertile; ſome not ſo good, and ſome poor. The inhabitants diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh its quality by firſt, ſecond, and third rate lands; and ſcarcely any ſuch thing as a marſh or ſwamp is to be found. There is a ridge, where Kentucke riſes, nearly of the ſize of a mountain, which in the map we have repreſented as ſuch.</p>
               <p>All the land below the Great Kenhawa un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til we come near the waters of Licking River is broken, hilly, and generally poor; except in ſome valleys, and on Little and Big Sandy
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:018467_0016_0FA7A68662A314A8"/>
creeks, where there is ſome firſt rate land, but moſtly ſecond and third rate. It is ſaid, that near this water is found a pure ſalt rock. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the north branch of Licking, we find a great body of firſt rate land. This ſtream runs near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly parallel to the Ohio for a conſiderable di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and is about ſeven miles from the mouth of Limeſtone Creek, where is a fine harbour for boats coming down the Ohio, and now a common landing. It is ſixty-five miles from Lexington, to which there is a large waggon road. The main branch of Licking, is about twenty-two miles from Limeſtone. On this ſtream we find ſome firſt, but moſtly ſecond and third rate lands, and towards its head ſomething hilly. There we find the Blue Licks, two fine ſalt ſprings, where great plenty of ſalt may be made. Round theſe licks, the ſoil is poor for ſome diſtance, being much impregnat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſalt.</p>
               <p>The ſouthern branch of Licking, and all its other arms, as appears in the map, ſpread through a great body of firſt, and ſome ſecond rate land, where there is abundance of cane, and ſome ſalt licks, and ſprings. On theſe ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral branches of Licking, are good mill-ſeats, and navigation to the Ohio, from the fork down to its mouth. The land is hilly, and generally
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:018467_0017_0FA7A68722B21480"/>
poor, yet along the ſtreams and in valleys we find ſome excellent land.</p>
               <p>The Elkhorn lands are much eſteemed, being ſituated in a bend of Kentucke River, of great extent, in which this little river, or rather large creek, riſes. Here we find moſtly firſt rate land, and near the Kentucke River ſecond and third rate. This great tract is beautifully ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, covered with cane, wild rye, and clover; and many of the ſtreams afford fine mill ſeats.</p>
               <p>The lands below the mouth of Elkhorn, up Eagle Creek, and towards the Ohio, are hilly and poor, except thoſe contained in a great bend of the Ohio, oppoſite Great Miami, cut off, as appears in the map, by the Big-bone and Bank-lick creeks, interlocking, and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſeparate courſes. Here we find a great deal of good land, but ſomething hilly.</p>
               <p>On Kentucke River we find many fertile valleys, or bottoms along the river, eſpecially towards its riſe. There is good land alſo on Red River, but towards the heads of this, and Kentucke, the ſoil is broken; but even here, we find in valleys, and along ſtreams, a great deal of fruitful land. Generally the ſoil within a mile or two of Kentucke River is of the third
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:018467_0018_0FA7A687E1D679C0"/>
and fourth rates; from about that diſtance, as we leave it on either ſide, we approach good lands. The country through which it winds its courſe, for the moſt part, may be conſidered as level to its banks, or rather precipices; from the brow of which, we behold the river, three and ſometimes four hundred feet deep, like a great canal For a more particular account of this, we refer the reader to where we treat of the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſities of Kentucke.</p>
               <p>Dick's River runs through a great body of firſt rate land, abounding every where with cane, and affords many excellent mill ſeats. Many mills are already built on this ſtream, ſome of which are repreſented in the map, and will have a plentiful ſupply of water in the dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſeaſons. The banks of this river, near its mouth, are ſimilar to the banks of Kentucke. The ſeveral ſtreams and branches of Salt River afford excellent mill ſeats. Theſe roll them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves through a great tract of excellent land, but the country from the junction of theſe waters, and ſome miles above towards the Ohio, which may be about twenty-five miles, is level and poor, and has abundance of ponds. For a conſiderable diſtance from the head of this river, the land is of the firſt quality, well ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, and abounds with fine cane. Upon this,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:018467_0019_0FA7A688A1F2C7D8"/>
and Dick's River, the inhabitants are chiefly ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled, it being the ſafeſt part of the country from the incurſions of the Indians.</p>
               <p>Green River, affords excellent mill ſeats, and a conſtant ſtream. This is allowed to be the beſt watered part of Kentucke. On its banks we find many fine bottoms, ſome firſt rate, but moſtly ſecond and third rate lands; and at ſome diſtance, many knobs, ridges, and broken poor land. Below a creek, called Sinking Creek, on this river, within fifty miles of Ohio, towards Salt River, a great territory begins, called Green River Barrens, extending to the Ohio. Moſt of this is very good land, and level. It has no timber, and little water, but affords excellent paſturage for cattle. On ſome parts of this river, we find abundance of cane, ſome ſalt licks, and ſulphureous and bituminous ſprings. South of Green River, in the lands reſerved for the continental, and ſtate troops of Virginia, an exceeding valuable lead mine has lately been diſcovered. Iron ore is found on Rough Creek, a ſtream running into this river. That part of Cumberland River which is in the Kentucke country, traverſes a hilly poor land, though in ſome parts we find good ſoil along its ſides. The other rivers I mentioned (viz. Great Kenhawa, and Teneſe) are not in the Kentucke country, and therefore do not come properly within my plan.</p>

                  <pb n="21" facs="unknown:018467_0020_0FA7A68964570638"/>The reader, by caſting his eye upon the map, and viewing round the heads of Licking, from the Ohio, and round the heads of Kentucke, Dick's River, and down Green River to the Ohio, may view, in that great compaſs of above one hundred miles ſquare, the moſt extraordinary country that the ſun enlightens with his celeſtial beams.</p>
               <p>The Ohio River, the great reſervoir of all the numerous rivers that flow into it from both ſides, has many fine valleys along its ſides; and we obſerve that oppoſite to each of them there is a hill; theſe hills and bottoms changing ſides al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternately. It only remains under this head to inform the reader, that there is a great body of firſt rate land near the Falls, or Rapids, called Bare-graſs; and it will be ſufficient juſt to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that the country on the N. Weſt ſide of the Ohio, ſome of the waters of which I have repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in the map, is allowed by all travellers to be a moſt fertile, level country, and well wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered.</p>

               <head>AIR AND CLIMATE.</head>
               <p>THIS country is more temperate and healthy than the other ſettled parts of America. In Summer it wants the ſandy heats which Virginia and Carolina experience, and receives a fine air
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:018467_0021_0FA7A68A245CBF10"/>
from its rivers. In Winter, which at moſt only laſts three months, commonly two, and is but ſeldom ſevere, the people are ſafe in bad houſes; and the beaſts have a good ſupply without fodder. The Winter begins about Chriſtmas, and ends about the firſt of March, at fartheſt does not exceed the middle of that month. Snow ſeldom falls deep or lies long. The weſt winds often bring ſtorms, and the eaſt winds clear the ſky; but there is no ſteady rule of weather in that reſpect as in the northern ſtates. The weſt winds are ſometimes cold and nitrous. The Ohio running in that direction, and there being mountains on that quarter, the weſterly winds by ſweeping along their tops, in the cold regions of the air, and over a long tract of frozen water, collect cold in their courſe, and convey it over the Kentuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke country; but the weather is not ſo intenſely ſevere as theſe winds bring with them in Pennſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania. The air and ſeaſons depend very much on the winds, as to heat and cold, dryneſs and moiſture.</p>

               <head>SOIL AND PRODUCE.</head>
               <p>THE ſoil of Kentucke is of a looſe, deep black mould, without ſand, in the firſt rate lands about two or three feet deep, and exceeding lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urious in all its productions. In ſome places the mould inclines to brown. In ſome the wood, as
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:018467_0022_0FA7A7E563200120"/>
the natural conſequence of too rich a ſoil, is of little value, appearing like dead timber and large ſtumps in a field lately cleared. Theſe parts are not conſiderable. The country in general may be conſidered as well timbered, producing large trees of many kinds, and to be exceeded by no country in variety. Thoſe which are peculiar to Kentucke are the ſugar-tree, which grows in all parts in great plenty, and furniſhes every family with plenty of excellent ſugar. The honey-locuſt is curiouſly ſurrounded with large thorny ſpikes, bearing broad and long pods in form of peas, has a ſweet taſte, and makes excellent beer.</p>
               <p>The coffee-tree greatly reſembles the black oak, grows large, and alſo bears a pod, in which is encloſed good coffee. The pappa-tree does not grow to a great ſize, is a ſoft wood, bears a fine fruit much like a cucumber in ſhape and ſize, and taſtes ſweet. The cucumber-tree is ſmall and ſoft, with remarkable leaves, bears a fruit much reſembling that from which it is nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Black mulberry-trees are in abundance. The wild cherry-tree is here frequent, of a large ſize, and ſupplies the inhabitants with boards for all their buildings. Here alſo is the buck-eye, an exceeding ſoft wood, bearing a remarkable black fruit, and ſome other kinds of trees not common elſewhere. Here is great plenty of fine cane, on which the cattle feed, and grow fat. This plant
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:018467_0023_0FA7A7E6234D1430"/>
in general grows from three to twelve feet high, of a hard ſubſtance, with joints at eight or ten inches diſtance along the ſtalk, from which proceed leaves reſembling thoſe of the willow. There are many cane brakes ſo thick and tall that it is difficult to paſs through them. Where no cane grows there is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of wild-rye, clover, and buffalo-graſs, covering vaſt tracts of country, and affording ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent food for cattle. The fields are covered with abundance of wild herbage not common to other countries. The Shawaneſe ſallad, wild let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuce, and pepper-graſs, and many more, as yet unknown to the inhabitants, but which, no doubt, have excellent virtues. Here are ſeen the fineſt crown-imperial in the world, the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal flower, ſo much extolled for its ſcarlet co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour; and all the year, excepting the three Winter months, the plains and valleys are adorned with variety of flowers of the moſt admirable beauty. Here is alſo found the tulip-bearing laurel-tree, or magnolia, which has an exquiſite ſmell, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues to bloſſom and ſeed for ſeveral months together.</p>
               <p>This country is richeſt on the higher lands, exceeding the fineſt low grounds in the ſettled parts of the continent. When cultivated it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces in common fifty and ſixty buſhels per a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre; and I have heard it affirmed by credible perſons, that above one hundred buſhels of good
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:018467_0024_0FA7A7E6E5339328"/>
corn were produced from an acre in one ſeaſon. The firſt rate land is too rich for wheat till it has been reduced by four or five years cultivation.</p>
               <p>Col. Harrod, a gentleman of veracity in Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tucke, has lately experienced the production of ſmall grain, and affirms, that he had thirty-five buſhels of wheat, and fifty buſhels of rye per a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre.</p>
               <p>I think in common the land will produce a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout thirty buſhels of wheat, and rye, upon a moderate computation, per acre; and this is the general opinion of the inhabitants. We may ſuppoſe that barley and oats will increaſe abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly; as yet they have not been ſufficiently tried. The ſoil is very favourable to flax and hemp, turnips, potatoes and cotton, which grow in abundance; and the ſecond, third and fourth rate lands, are as proper for ſmall grain. Theſe accounts of ſuch amazing fertility may, to ſome, appear incredible, but are certainly true. Every huſbandman may have a good gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, or meadow, without water or manure, where he pleaſes. The ſoil, which is not of a thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty nature, is commonly well ſupplied with plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful ſhowers.</p>
               <p>Iron ore and lead are found in abundance, but we do not hear of any ſilver or gold mine as yet diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.</p>

                  <pb n="26" facs="unknown:018467_0025_0FA7A7E8DDC55A68"/>The weſtern waters produce plenty of fiſh and fowl. The fiſh common to the waters of the Ohio are the buffalo-fiſh, of a large ſize, and the cat-fiſh ſometimes exceeding one hundred weight. Salmons have been taken in Kentucke weighing thirty weight. The mullet, rock, perch, gar-fiſh, and eel, are here in plenty. It is ſaid that there are no trouts in the weſtern wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Suckers, ſun-fiſh, and other hook-fiſh, are abundant; but no ſhad, or herrings. We may ſuppoſe with a degree of certainty, that there are large ſubterraneous aqueducts ſtored with fiſh, from whence fine ſprings ariſe in many parts pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing fine hook-fiſh in variety. On theſe wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and eſpecially on the Ohio, the geeſe and ducks are amazingly numerous.</p>
               <p>The land fowls are turkeys, which are very frequent, pheaſants, partridges, and ravens: The perraquet, a bird every way reſembling a parrot, but much ſmaller; the ivory-bill wood-cock, of a whitiſh colour with a white plume, flies ſcream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exceeding ſharp. It is aſſerted, that the bill of this bird is pure ivory, a circumſtance very ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular in the plumy tribe. The great owl re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles its ſpecies in other parts, but is remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably different in its vociferation, ſometimes mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſtrange, ſurpriſing noiſe, like a man in the moſt extreme danger and difficulty.</p>

               <p>AMONG the native animals are the urus, or zorax, deſcribed by Ceſar, which we call a buffa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo, much reſembling a large bull, of a great ſize, with a large head, thick ſhort crooked horns, and broader in his forepart than behind. Upon his ſhoulder is a large lump of fleſh, covered with a thick boſs of long wool and curly hair, of a dark brown colour. They do not riſe from the ground as our cattle, but ſpring up at once up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their feet; are of a broad make and clumſy appearance, with ſhort legs, but run faſt, and turn not aſide for any thing when chaſed, except a ſtanding tree. They weigh from five to ten hundred weight, are excellent meat, ſupplying the inhabitants in many parts with beef, and their hides make good leather. I have heard a hunter aſſert, he ſaw above one thouſand buffaloes at the Blue Licks at once; ſo nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous were they before the firſt ſettlers had wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonly ſported away their lives.

               <p>The Anabaptiſts were the firſt that promoted public worſhip in Kentucke; and the Preſbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians have formed three large congregations near Harrod's ſtation, and have engaged the Rev. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid Rice, of Virginia, to be their paſtor. At
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:018467_0029_0FA7A7EE71CD1988"/>
Lexington, 35 miles from theſe, they have form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed another large congregation, and invited the Rev. Mr. Rankin, of Virginia, to undertake that charge among them. At preſent there are no other religious ſocieties formed, although ſeveral other ſects have numerous adherents. But from theſe early movements it is hoped that Kentucke will eminently ſhine in learning and piety, which will fulfil the wiſh of every virtuous citizen.</p>

               <head>CURIOSITIES.</head>
               <p>AMONGST the natural curioſities of this country, the winding banks, or rather precipices of Kentucke, and Dick's Rivers, deſerve the firſt place. The aſtoniſhed eye there beholds almoſt every where three or four hundred feet of a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid perpendicular lime-ſtone rock; in ſome parts a fine white marble, either curiouſly arched, pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lared or blocked up into fine building ſtones. Theſe precipices, as was obſerved before, are like the ſides of a deep trench, or canal; the land a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove being level, except where creeks ſet in, and crowned with fine groves of red cedar. It is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at particular places that this river can be croſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, one of which is worthy of admiration; a great road large enough for waggons made by buffaloes, ſloping with an eaſy deſcent from the top to the bottom of a very large ſteep hill, at or near the river above Lees-town.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="unknown:018467_0030_0FA7A7EF27646578"/>Caves are found in this country amazingly large; in ſome of which you may travel ſeveral miles under a fine limeſtone rock, ſupported by curious arches and pillars: In moſt of them runs a ſtream of water.</p>
               <p>Near the head of Salt River a ſubterranean lake or large pond has lately been diſcovered. Col. Bowman ſays, that he and a companion tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled in one four hours till he luckily came to the mouth again. The ſame gentleman men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions another which operates like an air furnace, and contains much ſulphur. An adventurer in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of theſe will have a perfect idea of primeval darkneſs.</p>
               <p>There appear to be great natural ſtores of ſulphur and ſalt in this country. A ſpring at Boonſburrow conſtantly emits ſulphureous par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, and near the ſame place is a ſalt ſpring. There is another ſulphureous ſpring upon Four Mile Creek, a third upon Green River, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others in different places, abounding with that uſeful mineral.</p>
               <p>There are three ſprings or ponds of bitumen near Green River, which do not form a ſtream, but diſgorge themſelves into a common reſervoir, and when uſed in lamps anſwer all the purpoſes of the fineſt oil.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="unknown:018467_0031_0FA7A7EFE5E38A08"/>There are different places abounding with cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peras, eaſily procured, and in its preſent impure ſtate ſufficient for the uſe of the inhabitants; and when refined, equal to any in the world.</p>
               <p>There is an allum bank on the ſouth ſide of Cumberland River, ſituated at the bottom of a cliff of rocks projecting over it. In its preſent ſtate it has the appearance and poſſeſſes the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of that mineral, and when purified is a beautiful allum.</p>
               <p>Many fine ſalt ſprings, whoſe places appear in the map, conſtantly emit water which, being manufactured, affords great quantities of fine ſalt. At preſent there is but one, called Bullet's Lick, improved, and this affords ſalt ſufficient for all Kentucke, and exports ſome to the Illinois. Salt ſells at preſent for twenty ſhillings per buſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el; but as ſome other ſprings are beginning to be worked, no doubt that neceſſary article will ſoon be much cheaper. Drenne's-lick, the Big-bone, and the Blue-licks, ſend forth ſtreams of ſalt water. The Nob-lick, and many others, do not produce water, but conſiſt of clay mixed with ſalt particles: To theſe the cattle repair, and reduce high hills rather to valleys than plains. The amazing herds of Buffaloes which reſort thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by their ſize and number, fill the traveller with amazement and terror, eſpecially when he
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:018467_0032_0FA7A7F0A3CCD738"/>
beholds the prodigious roads they have made from all quarters, as if leading to ſome populous city; the vaſt ſpace of land around theſe ſprings deſolat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as if by a ravaging enemy, and hills reduced to plains; for the land near thoſe ſprings are chiefly hilly. Theſe are truly curioſities, and the eye can ſcarcely be ſatisfied with admiring them.</p>
               <p>A medicinal ſpring is found near the Big-bone Lick, which has perfectly cured the itch by once bathing; and experience in time may diſcover in it other virtues. There is another of like nature near Drennen's-Lick.</p>
               <p>Near Lexington are to be ſeen curious ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chres, full of human ſkeletons, which are thus fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricated. Firſt, on the ground are laid large broad ſtones; on theſe were placed the bodies, ſeparated from each other by broad ſtones, covered with others, which ſerve as a baſis for the next arrangement of bodies. In this order they are built, without mortar, growing ſtill nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower to the height of a man. This method of burying appears to be totally different from that now practiſed by the Indians. For our conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures on this ſubject we beg leave to refer to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix No. 3.—At a ſalt ſpring, near Ohio river, very large bones are found, far ſurpaſſing the ſize of any ſpecies of animals now in America. The head appears to have been about three
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:018467_0033_0FA7A7F1657FB758"/>
feet long, the ribs ſeven, and the thigh bones a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout four; one of which is repoſited in the libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in Philadelphia, and ſaid to weigh ſeventy-eight pounds. The tuſks are above a foot in length, the grinders about five inches ſquare, and eight inches long. Theſe bones have equally excited the amazement of the ignorant, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted the attention of the philoſopher. Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens of them have been ſent both to France and England, where they have been examined with the greateſt diligence, and found upon compariſon to be remains of the ſame ſpecies of animals that produced thoſe other foſſil bones which have been diſcovered in Tartary, Chili, and ſeveral other places, both of the old and new continent. What animal this is, and by what means its ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ins are found in regions ſo widely different, and where none ſuch exiſts at preſent, is a queſtion of more difficult deciſion. The ignorant and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious Tartars attribute them to a creature, whom they call Maimon, who, they ſay, uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſides at the bottom of the rivers, and of whom they relate many marvellous ſtories; but as this is an aſſertion totally diveſted of proof, and even of probability, it has juſtly been reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the learned; and on the other hand it is certain, that no ſuch amphibious quadruped ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts in our American waters. The bones them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves bear a great reſemblance to thoſe of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lephant. There is no other terreſtrial animal now
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:018467_0034_0FA7A7F307CF7B30"/>
known large enough to produce them. The tuſks with which they are equally furniſhed, equally produce true ivory. Theſe external reſemblances have generally made ſuperficial obſervers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that they could belong to no other than that prince of quadrupeds; and when they firſt drew the attention of the world, philoſophers ſeem to have ſubſcribed to the ſame opinion.— But if ſo, whence is it that the whole ſpecies has diſappeared from America? An animal ſo laborious and ſo docile, that the induſtry of the Peruvians, which reduced to ſervitude and ſubjected to edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation ſpecies ſo vaſtly inferior in thoſe qualities, as the Llama and the Paca, could never have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked the elephant, if he had been to be found in their country. Whence is it that theſe bones are found in climates where the elephant, a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of the torrid zone, cannot even ſubſiſt in his wild ſtate, and in a ſtate of ſervitude will not propagate? Theſe are difficulties ſufficient to ſtagger credulity itſelf; and at length produced the enquiries of Dr. Hunter. That celebrated anatomiſt, having procured ſpecimens from the Ohio, examined them with that accuracy for which he is ſo much diſtinguiſhed. He diſcovered a conſiderable difference between the ſhape and ſtructure of the bones, and thoſe of the elephant. He obſerved from the form of the teeth, that they muſt have belonged to a carnivorous animal; whereas the habits of the elephant are foreign to
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:018467_0035_0FA7A7F6B53AA1F8"/>
ſuch ſuſtenance, and his jaws totally unprovided with the teeth neceſſary for its uſe: And from the whole he concluded to the ſatisfaction of natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, that theſe bones belonged to a quadruped now unknown, and whoſe race is probably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct, unleſs it may be be found in the extenſive continent of New Holland, whoſe receſſes have not yet been pervaded by the curioſity or avidity of civilized man. Can then ſo great a link have p<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="5 letters">

                  </gap>ed from the chain of nature? Happy we that it has. How formidable an enemy to the human ſpecies, an animal as large as the elephant, the tyrant of the foreſts, perhaps the devourer of man! Nations, ſuch as the Indians, muſt have been in perpetual alarm. The animoſities among the various tribes muſt have been ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed till the common enemy, who threatened the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry exiſtence of all, ſhould be extirpated. To this circumſtance we are probably indebted for a fact, which is perhaps ſingular in its kind, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction of a whole race of animals from the ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem of nature.</p>

               <head>RIGHTS OF LAND.</head>
               <p>THE proprietors of the Kentucke lands ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their patents from Virginia, and their rights are of three kinds, viz. Thoſe which ariſe from military ſervice, from ſettlement and pre-emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or from warrants from the treaſury. The
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:018467_0036_0FA7A7F7659F5CE8"/>
military rights are held by officers, or their repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives, as a reward for ſervices done in one of the two laſt wars. The Settlement and pre-emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion rights ariſe from occupation. Every man who, before March, 1780, had remained in the country one year, or raiſed a crop of corn, was allowed to have a ſettlement of four hundred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres, and a pre-emption adjoining it of one thouſand acres. Every man who had only built a cabbin, or made any improvement by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf or others, was entitled to a pre-emption of one thouſand acres where ſuch improvement was made.</p>
               <p>In March, 1780, the ſettlement and pre-emption rights ceaſed, and treaſury war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants were afterwards iſſued, authorizing their poſſeſſor to locate the quantity of land men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in them, wherever it could be found vacant in Virginia.</p>
               <p>The mode of procedure in theſe affairs may be inſtructive to the reader. After the entry is made in the land-office, there being one in each coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the perſon making the entry takes out a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py of the location, and proceeds to ſurvey when he pleaſes. The plot and certificate of ſuch ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey muſt be returned to the office within three months after the ſurvey is made, there to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded; and a copy of the record muſt be taken
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:018467_0037_0FA7A7F82528E8B0"/>
out in twelve months, after the return of the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey, and produced to the aſſiſtant regiſter of the land-office in Kentucke, where it muſt lie ſix months, that prior locators may have time and opportunity to enter a caveat, and prove their bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter right. If no caveat is entered in that time, the plot and certificate are ſent to the land-office at Richmond, in Virginia, and three months more are allowed to have the patent returned to the owner.</p>
               <p>The validity of the right of Virginia to this extenſive weſtern territory has been diſputed by ſome, but without reaſon. The weſtern boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary of that ſtate, by charter, reſtricted by the treaty of Paris, in 1763, is fixed upon the Ohio Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. She has purchaſed the ſoil from the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, has firſt ſettled it, and eſtabliſhed wholeſome laws for the regulation and government of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants; and therefore we conclude, that the right of Virginia to Kentucke is as permanent as the independence of America.</p>

                     <hi>From Philadelphia to Pittſburg is a land-car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of</hi> 320 <hi>miles, from Baltimore</hi> 280.</note> and from thence down the Ohio; and upon account of the difficulties and expences attending this route, for which there is no remedy, that goods would ever be dear. This opinion I have ſince reprobated, as the effect of ignorance of the trade up the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſſippi from New Orleans, or Mantchac, at the river or gut Iberville.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who are acquainted with America know the Miſſiſſippi and Ohio rivers to be the key to the northern parts of the weſtern continent. Theſe are the principal channels through which that extenſive region, bathed by their waters, and enriched by the many ſtreams they receive, communicate with the ſea, and may truly be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as the great paſſage made by the Hand of Nature for a variety of valuable purpoſes, and principally to promote the happineſs and benefit of mankind; amongſt which, the conveyance of the produce of that immenſe and fertile country lying weſtward of the United States is not the leaſt. A ſhort deſcription of theſe rivers, and ſome others flowing into them, are objects ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the reader's attention, in order to form
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:018467_0039_0FA7A7F9A3010B58"/>
a juſt idea of the favourable commercial circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of that important country.</p>
               <p>The Ohio river begins at Pittſburg, 320 miles weſt of Philadelphia, being there formed by the junction of the Alleghany and Monangehela rivers, and running a winding courſe of S. 60° Weſt, falls into the Miſſiſſippi 1074 miles, by the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the river, below Pittſburg. The only obſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to navigation on this river are the Rapids, as deſcribed before under the deſcription of the Kentucke rivers; but they are paſſed in ſafety when the ſtream is high.</p>
               <p>The moſt remarkable branches compoſing the head waters of Ohio are Red-ſtone Creek, Cheat River, and Yochiaghany. Theſe waters are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigable to a conſiderable diſtance above Pittſburg, from November until June, and the Ohio a month longer; but from great Kenhawa, which is one hundred and ninety-ſix miles and a half be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Pittſburg, the ſtream is navigable moſt of the year. Down this river great quantities of goods are brought, and ſome are conveyed up the Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tucke rivers, others on horſe-back or in waggons to the ſettled parts, and ſold on an average at one hundred pounds per cent. advance.</p>
               <p>The current of the Ohio deſcends about two miles an hour in autumn, and when the waters
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:018467_0040_0FA7A7FA63010388"/>
are high, about five miles. Thoſe of the Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tucke rivers are much the ſame, and without ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pids, and are of immenſe value to the country, affording fiſh and fowl, and tranſportation of the produce of the country to the beſt market. Theſe rivers increaſe the Ohio more in depth than breadth. At its mouth it is not more than one and a half mile in width, and enters the Miſſiſſippi in a S. weſt direction with a ſlow cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and a fine channel. This great river, at the junction with the Ohio, runs in a S. eaſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and afterwards in a S. weſt, having been a little before joined by a greater river called Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſouri,<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>The Miſſouri is ſuppoſed to be about</hi> 3000 <hi>miles long.</hi>
                  </note> which runs in an eaſtward direction through Louiſiana, and afterwards communicates to the Miſſiſſippi<note n="‡" place="bottom">
                     <hi>The Miſſiſſippi is ſaid to be about</hi> 2500 <hi>miles long.</hi>
                  </note> its own muddy and majeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic appearance. From the mouth of the Ohio to New Orleans, a diſtance not exceeding 460 miles in a ſtraight line, is about 856 by water. The depth is, in common, eight or ten fathoms until you approach its mouth, which empties itſelf by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral channels into the gulf of Mexico. Here the navigation is dangerous, on account of the many iſlands, ſand-bars and logs, interſperſed in its mouth, which is about twenty miles wide.
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:018467_0041_0FA7A7FB231C0598"/>
This diſadvantage may be remedied almoſt in the ſame manner that the ſtream was diſconcerted. The conflict between the ſea and this mighty ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, which brings down with its ſtream great numbers of trees, mud, leaves, &amp;c. cauſes them to ſubſide and form ſhoals. One of theſe trees, ſtopped by its roots or branches, will ſoon be join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by thouſands more, and ſo fixed, that no hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man force is able to remove them. In time they are conſolidated, every flood adds another layer to their height, forming iſlands, which at length are covered with ſhrubs, graſs and cane, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly ſhift the bed of the river. In this manner we ſuppoſe moſt of the country on each ſide of the Miſſiſſippi, below the Iberville, to have been formed, by iſlands uniting to iſlands, which in a ſucceſſion of time have greatly encroached on the ſea, and produced an extenſive tract of country. If ſome of the floating timber at the mouths of this river were moved into ſome of the channels, numbers more would incorporate with them; and the current being impeded in theſe, the whole force of the river uniting, one important chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel would forceably be opened, and ſufficiently cleared, to admit of the moſt excellent naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>About ninety-nine miles above Orleans is a fort, now called Mantchac by the Spaniards; formerly Fort Bute by the Engliſh, who built it. Near this is
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:018467_0042_0FA7A7FBE6CA5BE0"/>
a large gut, formed by the Miſſiſſippi, on the eaſt ſide, called Iberville; ſome have dignified it with the name of River, when the Miſſiſſippi, its ſource, is high. This is navigable at moſt not above four months in the year for the firſt ten miles; for three miles further it is from two to ſix feet in autumn, and from two to four fathoms the remaining part of the way to lake Maurepas, receiving in its courſe the river Amit, which is navigable for batteaux to a conſiderable diſtance.</p>
               <p>Lake Maurepas is about ten miles in length, and ſeven in breadth; and there is a paſſage of ſeven miles between this and Lake Pontchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>train.</p>
               <p>Lake Pontchartrain is about forty miles long, twenty-four broad, and eighteen feet deep. From this lake to the ſea the channel is ten miles long, and three hundred yards wide; and the water deep enough to admit large veſſels through theſe lakes, and their communications. This place, if attended to, might be of conſequence to all the the weſtern country, and to the commerce of Weſt-Florida: For it may reaſonably be ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the inhabitants and traders of the weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern country would rather trade at this place than at New Orleans, if they could have as good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns for their peltry, and the produce of their ſoil, as it makes a canſiderable difference in their
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:018467_0043_0FA7A7FD3B3DF460"/>
voyage, and ſaves labour, money and time. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience will doubtleſs produce conſiderable im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements, and render the navigation of the Miſſiſſippi, either by theſe lakes, or New Orleans, nearly as cheap as any other. That the Miſſiſſip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi can anſwer every valuable purpoſe of trade and commerce is proved already to a demonſtration by experience.</p>
               <p>I have reaſon to believe that the time is not far diſtant when New Orleans will be a great trading city, and perhaps another will be built near Mantchac, at Iberville, that may in time rival its glory.</p>
               <p>A prodigious number of iſlands, ſome of which are of great extent, are interſperſed in that migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty river; and the difficulty in aſcending it in the Spring when the floods are high, is compenſated by eddies or counter currents, which moſtly run in the bends near the banks of the river with nearly equal velocity againſt the ſtream, and aſſiſt the aſcending boats. This river is rapid in thoſe parts which have cluſters of iſlands, ſhoals and ſand-banks; but the rapidity of theſe places will be no inconvenience to the newly invented me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical boats,<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>This plan is now in agitation in Virginia, and recommended to government by two gentlemen of firſt rate abilities, Mr. Charles Rumſey and Doct. James M'Macken. Their propoſals are, "to conſtruct a ſpecies of boat, of the burthen of ten tons, that ſhall ſail, or be propelled by the force of mechanical pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers thereto applied, up the ſtream of a freſh water river the diſtance of between</hi> 25 <hi>and</hi> 40 <hi>miles a day, notwithſtanding the velocity of the water ſhould move at the rate of</hi> 10 <hi>miles an hour, to be wrought at no greater expence than that of three hands.</hi>"</note> it being their peculiar property to ſail beſt in ſmart currents.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="unknown:018467_0044_0FA7A800E23971B0"/>From New Orleans to the Falls of Ohio, bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teaux, carrying about 40 tons, have been rowed by eighteen or twenty men in eight or ten weeks, which, at the extent, will not amount to more than five hundred pounds expence, which expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience has proved to be about one third of that from Philadelphia. It is highly probable that in time the diſtance will be exceedingly ſhortened by cuting a-croſs bends of the river.</p>
               <p>Charlevoix relates, that at Coupee or Cut-point, the river formerly made a great turn, and ſome Canadians, by deepening the channel of a ſmall brook, diverted the waters of the river into it, The impetuoſity of the ſtream was ſo violent, and the ſoil of ſo rich and looſe a quality, that in a ſhort time the point was entirely cut through, and the old channel left dry, except in inunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, by which travellers ſave 14 leagues of their
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:018467_0045_0FA7A6912B3E4060"/>
voyage. The new channel has been ſounded with a line of thirty fathoms without finding bottom. When the diſtance is ſhortened, which I believe may readily be done, and the mechani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal boats brought to their higheſt improvement, the expences of a voyage from New Orleans to the Falls of Ohio will be attended with incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable expence. Now we know by experience that forty tons of goods cannot be taken to the Falls of Ohio from Philadelphia under ſixteen hundred pounds expence; but by improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on the Miſſiſſippi, with the conveniences of theſe boats, goods can be brought from New Orle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to the Falls for the tenth part of that expence; and if they are ſold at one hundred pounds per cent. now, when brought from Philadelphia at expences ſo great, what may the merchant af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford to ſell his goods at, who brings them ſo much cheaper? Beſides, the great advantages a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing from the exporting of peltry, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try produce, which never can be conveyed to the eaſtern ports to any advantage. It is evident al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that the market from which they receive im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, muſt conſequently receive their exports, which is the only return they can poſſibly make.</p>
               <p>By ſtating the commerce of Kentucke in its proper terms, we find the expences ſuch, that we conclude with propriety, that that country will
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:018467_0046_0FA7A68AE2B97EF0"/>
be ſupplied with goods as cheap as if ſituated but forty miles from Philadelphia.</p>
               <p>But perhaps it will be replied, New Orleans is in the poſſeſſion of the Spaniards, who, whenever they pleaſe, may make uſe of that fort, and ſome others they have on the Miſſiſſippi, to prevent the navigation, and ruin the trade. The paſſage through Iberville is alſo ſubject to the Spaniards, and beſides, inconvenient; that ſtream continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo ſhort a time, and in the moſt diſadvantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſeaſon.</p>
               <p>I grant it will be abſurd to expect a free navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Miſſiſſippi whilſt the Spaniards are in poſſeſſion of New Orleans. To ſuppoſe it, is an idea calculated to impoſe only upon the weak. They may perhaps trade with us upon their own terms, while they think it conſiſtent with their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Article</hi> 8<hi>th of the late Definitive Treaty, ſays, The navigation of the Miſſiſſippi River from its ſource to the ocean, ſhall for ever remain free and open to the ſubjects of Great-Britain and the citizens of the United States.</hi>
                  </note> but no friendſhip in trade exiſts when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt expires; therefore, when the weſtern coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try becomes populous and ripe for trade, ſound policy tells us the Floridas muſt be ours too. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the articles of the Definitive Treaty, we are to have a free and unmoleſted navigation

of the Miſſiſſippi; but experience teaches man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind that treaties are not always to be depended on, the moſt ſolemn being broken. Hence we learn that no one ſhould put much faith in any ſtate; and the trade and commerce of the Miſſiſſippi River cannot be ſo well ſecured in any other poſſeſſion as our own.</p>
               <p>Although the Iberville only admits of a ſhort and inconvenient navigation, yet if a commercial town were built there, it would be the center of the weſtern trade; and a land carriage of ten or twelve miles would be counted no diſadvantage to the merchant. Nay, I doubt not, that in time a canal will be broke through the gut of Iberville, which may divert the water of Miſſiſſippi that way, and render it a place of the greateſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence in America; but this important period is reſerved for futurity.</p>

               <p>CURIOSITY is natural to the ſoul of man, and intereſting objects have a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful influence on our affections. Let theſe influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encing powers actuate, by the permiſſion or diſpoſal of Providence, from ſelfiſh or ſocial views, yet in time the myſterious will of Heaven is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded, and we behold our conduct, from what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever motives excited, operating to anſwer the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant deſigns of heaven. Thus we behold Kentuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke, lately an howling wilderneſs, the habitation of ſavages and wild beaſts, become a fruitful field; this region, ſo favourably diſtinguiſhed by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, now become the habitation of civilization,

at a period unparalleled in hiſtory, in the midſt of a raging war, and under all the diſadvantages of emigration to a country ſo remote from the inhabited parts of the continent. Here, where the hand of violence ſhed the blood of the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent; where the horrid yells of ſavages, and the groans of the diſtreſſed, ſounded in our ears, we now hear the praiſes and adorations of our Creator; where wretched wigwams ſtood, the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable abodes of ſavages, we behold the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of cities laid, that, in all probability, will rival the glory of the greateſt upon earth. And we view Kentucke ſituated on the fertile banks of the great Ohio, riſing from obſcurity to ſhine with ſplendor, equal to any other of the ſtars of the American hemiſphere.</p>
               <p>The ſettling of this region well deſerves a place in hiſtory. Moſt of the memorable events I have myſelf been exerciſed in; and, for the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of the public, will briefly relate the circumſtances of my adventures, and ſcenes of life, from my firſt movement to this country un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til this day.</p>
               <p>It was on the firſt of May, in the year 1769, that I reſigned my domeſtic happineſs for a time, and left my family and peaceable habitation on the Yadkin River, in North-Carolina, to wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der through the wilderneſs of America, in queſt of
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:018467_0050_0FA7A68DE4798258"/>
the country of Kentucke, in company with John Finley, John Stewart, Joſeph Holden, James Monay, and William Cool. We proceeded ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully, and after a long and fatiguing journey through a mountainous wilderneſs, in a weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward direction, on the ſeventh day of June fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, we found ourſelves on Red-River, where John Finley had for merly been trading with the Indians, and, from the top of an eminence, ſaw with pleaſure the beautiful level of Kentuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke. Here let me obſerve, that for ſome time we had experienced the moſt uncomfortable wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as a prelibation of our future ſufferings. At this place we encamped, and made a ſhelter to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend us from the inclement ſeaſon, and began to hunt and reconnoitre the country. We found e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where abundance of wild beaſts of all ſorts, through this vaſt foreſt. The buffaloes were more frequent than I have ſeen cattle in the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements, browzing on the leaves of the cane, or croping the herbage on thoſe extenſive plains, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, becauſe ignorant, of the violence of man. Sometimes we ſaw hundreds in a drove, and the numbers about the ſalt ſprings were amazing. In this foreſt, the habitation of beaſts of every kind natural to America, we practiſed hunting with great ſucceſs until the twenty-ſecond day of December following.</p>
               <p>This day John Stewart and I had a pleaſing
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:018467_0051_0FA7A68EA4C7D138"/>
ramble, but fortune changed the ſcene in the cloſe of it. We had paſſed through a great fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, on which ſtood myriads of trees, ſome gay with bloſſoms, others rich with fruits. Nature was here a ſeries of wonders, and a fund of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. Here ſhe diſplayed her ingenuity and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry in a variety of flowers and fruits, beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully coloured, elegantly ſhaped, and charming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly flavoured; and we were diverted with innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable animals preſenting themſelves perpetual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to our view.—In the decline of the day, near Kentucke river, as we aſcended the brow of a ſmall hill, a number of Indians ruſhed out of a thick cane-brake upon us, and made us priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. The time of our ſorrow was now arrived, and the ſcene fully opened. The Indians plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered us of what we had, and kept us in confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeven days, treating us with common ſavage uſage. During this time we diſcovered no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs or deſire to eſcape, which made them leſs ſuſpicious of us; but in the dead of night, as we lay in a thick cane-brake by a large fire, when ſleep had locked up their ſenſes, my ſituation not diſpoſing me for reſt, I touched my companion and gently awoke him. We improved this favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble opportunity, and departed, leaving them to take their reſt, and ſpeedily directed our courſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our old camp, but found it plundered; and the company diſperſed and gone home. About this time
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:018467_0052_0FA7A691F0B669C8"/>
my brother, Squire Boon, with another adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turer, who came to explore the country ſhortly after us, was wandering through the foreſt, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to find me, if poſſible, and accidentally found our camp. Notwithſtanding the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate circumſtances of our company, and our dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous ſituation, as ſurrounded with hoſtile ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſavages, our meeting ſo fortunately in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs made us reciprocally ſenſible of the utmoſt ſatisfaction. So much does friendſhip triumph over misfortune, that ſorrows and ſufferings va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh at the meeting not only of real friends, but of the moſt diſtant acquaintances, and ſubſtitutes happineſs in their room.</p>
               <p>Soon after this, my companion in captivity, John Stewart, was killed by the ſavages, and the man that came with my brother returned home by himſelf. We were then in a dangerous, helpleſs ſituation, expoſed daily to perils and death amongſt ſavages and wild beaſts, not a white man in the country but ourſelves.</p>
               <p>Thus ſituated, many hundred miles from our families in the howling wilderneſs, I believe few would have equally enjoyed the happineſs we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced. I often obſerved to my brother, You ſee now how little nature requires to be ſatisfied. Felicity, the companion of content, is rather found in our own breaſts than in the enjoyment of external things: And I firmly believe it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:018467_0053_0FA7A69261FE6098"/>
but a little philoſophy to make a man happy in whatſoever ſtate he is. This conſiſts in a full reſignation to the will of Providence; and a reſigned ſoul finds pleaſure in a path ſtrew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with briars and thorns.</p>
               <p>We continued not in a ſtate of indolence, but hunted every day, and prepared a little cottage to defend us from the Winter ſtorms. We re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained there undiſturbed during the Winter; and on the firſt day of May, 1770, my brother returned home to the ſettlement by himſelf, for a new recruit of horſes and ammunition, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me by myſelf, without bread, ſalt or ſugar, without company of my fellow creatures, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a horſe or dog. I confeſs I never before was under greater neceſſity of exerciſing philoſophy and fortitude. A few days I paſſed uncomforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly. The idea of a beloved wife and family, and their anxiety upon the account of my abſence and expoſed ſituation, made ſenſible impreſſions on my heart. A thouſand dreadful apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions preſented themſelves to my view, and had undoubtedly diſpoſed me to melancholy, if further indulged.</p>
               <p>One day I undertook a tour through the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and the diverſity and beauties of nature I met with in this charming ſeaſon, expelled every gloomy and vexatious thought. Juſt at the cloſe
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:018467_0054_0FA7A69324FE8908"/>
of day the gentle gales retired, and left the place to the diſpoſal of a profound calm. Not a breeze ſhook the moſt tremulous leaf. I had gained the ſummit of a commanding ridge, and, looking round with aſtoniſhing delight, beheld the ample plains, the beauteous tracts below. On the other hand, I ſurveyed the famous river Ohio that rolled in ſilent dignity, marking the weſtern boundary of Kentucke with inconceivable grandeur. At a vaſt diſtance I beheld the mountains lift their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable brows, and penetrate the clouds. All things were ſtill. I kindled a fire near a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of ſweet water, and feaſted on the loin of a buck, which a few hours before I had killed. The ſullen ſhades of night ſoon overſpread the whole hemiſphere, and the earth ſeemed to gaſp after the hovering moiſture. My roving excur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion this day had fatigued my body, and diverted my imagination. I laid me down to ſleep, and I awoke not until the ſun had chaſed away the night. I continued this tour, and in a few days explored a conſiderable part of the country, each day equally pleaſed as the firſt. I returned again to my old camp, which was not diſturbed in my abſence. I did not confine my lodging to it, but often repoſed in thick cane-brakes, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the ſavages, who, I believe, often viſited my camp, but fortunately for me, in my abſence. In this ſituation I was conſtantly expoſed to danger, and death. How unhappy ſuch a ſituation for
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:018467_0055_0FA7A693E2DC5100"/>
a man tormented with fear, which is vain if no danger comes, and if it does, only augments the pain. It was my happineſs to be deſtitute of this afflicting paſſion, with which I had the greateſt reaſon to be affected. The prowling wolves di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted my nocturnal hours with perpetual howl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; and the various ſpecies of animals in this vaſt foreſt, in the daytime, were continually in my view.</p>
               <p>Thus I was ſurrounded with plenty in the midſt of want. I was happy in the midſt of dangers and inconveniences. In ſuch a diverſity it was impoſſible I ſhould be diſpoſed to melancholy. No populous city, with all the varieties of commerce and ſtately ſtructures, could afford ſo much plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to my mind, as the beauties of nature I found here.</p>
               <p>Thus, through an uninterrupted ſcene of ſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van pleaſures, I ſpent the time until the 27th day of July following, when my brother, to my great felicity, met me, according to appointment, at our old camp. Shortly after, we left this place, not thinking it ſafe to ſtay there longer, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to Cumberland river, reconnoitring that part of the country until March, 1771, and giving names to the different waters.</p>
               <p>Soon after, I returned home to my fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with a determination to bring them as ſoon as
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:018467_0056_0FA7A694A3C98790"/>
poſſible to live in Kentucke, which I eſteemed a ſecond paradiſe, at the riſk of my life and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</p>
               <p>I returned ſafe to my old habitation, and found my family in happy circumſtances. I ſold my farm on the Yadkin, and what goods we could not carry with us; and on the twenty-fifth day of September, 1773, bade a farewel to our friends, and proceeded on our journey to Kentucke, in company with five families more, and forty men that joined us in Powel's Valley, which is one hundred and fifty miles from the now ſettled parts of Kentucke. This promiſing beginning was ſoon overcaſt with a cloud of adverſity; for up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the tenth day of October, the rear of our company was attacked by a number of Indians, who killed ſix, and wounded one man. Of theſe my eldeſt ſon was one that fell in the action. Though we defended ourſelves, and repulſed the enemy, yet this unhappy affair ſcattered our cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, brought us into extreme difficulty, and ſo diſcouraged the whole company, that we retreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forty miles, to the ſettlement on Clench river. We had paſſed over two mountains, viz. Powel's and Walden's, and were approaching Cumberland mountain when this adverſe fortune overtook us. Theſe mountains are in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, as we paſs from the old ſettlements in Virginia to Kentucke, are ranged in a S. weſt and
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:018467_0057_0FA7A6956560C578"/>
N. eaſt direction, are of a great length and breadth, and not far diſtant from each other. Over theſe, nature hath formed paſſes, that are leſs difficult than might be expected from a view of ſuch huge piles. The aſpect of theſe cliffs is ſo wild and horrid, that it is impoſſible to behold them without terror. The ſpectator is apt to imagine that nature had formerly ſuffered ſome violent convulſion; and that theſe are the diſmembered remains of the dreadful ſhock; the ruins, not of Perſepolis or Palmyra, but of the world!</p>
               <p>I remained with my family on Clench until the ſixth of June, 1774. when I and one Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael Stoner were ſolicited by Governor Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, of Virginia, to go to the Falls of the Ohio, to conduct into the ſettlement a number of ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyors that had been ſent thither by him ſome months before; this country having about this time drawn the attention of many adventurers. We immediately complied with the Governor's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, and conducted in the ſurveyors, compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a tour of eight hundred miles, through ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny difficulties, in ſixty-two days.</p>
               <p>Soon after I returned home, I was ordered to take the command of three garriſons during the campaign, which Governor Dunmore carried on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Shawaneſe Indians: After the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of which, the Militia was diſcharged from
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:018467_0058_0FA7A69622003D28"/>
each garriſon, and I being relieved from my poſt, was ſolicited by a number of North-Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolina gentlemen, that were about purchaſing the lands lying on the S. ſide of Kentucke River, from the Cherokee Indians, to attend their trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty at Wataga, in March, 1775, to negotiate with them, and, mention the boundaries of the purchaſe. This I accepted, and at the requeſt of the ſame gentlemen, undertook to mark-out a road in the beſt paſſage from the ſettlement through the wilderneſs to Kentucke, with ſuch aſſiſtance as I thought neceſſary to employ for ſuch an important undertaking.</p>
               <p>I ſoon began this work, having collected a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of enterpriſing men, well armed We pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded with all poſſible expedition until we came within fifteen miles of where Boonſborough now ſtands, and where we were fired upon by a party of Indians that killed two, and wounded two of our number; yet, although ſurpriſed and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken at a diſadvantage, we ſtood our ground. This was on the twentieth of March, 1775. Three days after, we were fired upon again, and had two men killed, and three wounded. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards we proceeded on to Kentucke river with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out oppoſition; and on the firſt day of April be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to erect the fort of Boonſborough at a ſalt lick, about ſixty yards from the river, on the S. ſide.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="unknown:018467_0059_0FA7A698B5E8E358"/>On the fourth day, the Indians killed one of our men.—We were buſily employed in building this fort, until the fourteenth day of June following, without any farther oppoſition from the Indians; and having finiſhed the works, I returned to my family, on Clench.</p>
               <p>In a ſhort time, I proceeded to remove my family from Clench to this garriſon; where we ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived ſafe without any other difficulties than ſuch as are common to this paſſage, my wife and daughter being the firſt white women that ever ſtood on the banks of Kentucke river.</p>
               <p>On the twenty-fourth day of December fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing we had one man killed, and one wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by the Indians, who ſeemed determined to perſecute us for erecting this fortification.</p>
               <p>On the fourteenth day of July, 1776, two of Col. Calaway's daughters, and one of mine, were taken priſoners near the fort. I immediately pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued the Indians, with only eight men, and on the ſixteenth overtook them, killed two of the party, and recovered the girls. The ſame day on which this attempt was made, the Indians di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided themſelves into different parties, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked ſeveral forts, which were ſhortly before this time erected, doing a great deal of miſchief. This was extremely diſtreſſing to the new ſettlers. The
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:018467_0060_0FA7A699C8B14BC8"/>
innocent huſbandman was ſhot down, while bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy cultivating the ſoil for his family's ſupply. Moſt of the cattle around the ſtations were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed. They continued their hoſtilities in this manner until the fifteenth of April, 1777, when they attacked Boonſborough with a party of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove one hundred in number, killed one man, and wounded four.—Their loſs in this attack was not certainly known to us.</p>
               <p>On the fourth day of July following, a party of about two hundred Indians attacked Boonſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough, killed one man, and wounded two. They beſieged us forty-eight hours; during which time ſeven of them were killed, and at laſt, finding themſelves not likely to prevail, they raiſed the ſiege, and departed.</p>
               <p>The Indians had diſpoſed their warriors in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent parties at this time, and attacked the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent garriſons to prevent their aſſiſting each other, and did much injury to the diſtreſſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants.</p>
               <p>On the nineteenth day of this month, Col. Logan's fort was beſieged by a party of about two hundred Indians. During this dreadful ſiege they did a great deal of miſchief, diſtreſſed the garriſon, in which were only fifteen men, killed two, and wounded one. The enemies loſs was
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:018467_0061_0FA7A699E2A20720"/>
uncertain, from the common practice which the Indians have of carrying off their dead in time of battle. Col. Harrod's fort was then defended by only ſixty-five men, and Boonſborough by twenty two, there being no more forts or white men in the country, except at the Falls, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable diſtance from theſe, and all taken col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectively, were but a handful to the numerous warriors that were every where diſperſed through the country, intent upon doing all the miſchief that ſavage barbarity could invent. Thus we paſſed through a ſcene of ſufferings that exceeds deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>On the twenty-fifth of this month a reinforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of forty-five men arrived from North-Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolina, and about the twentieth of Auguſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, Col. Bowman arrived with one hundred men from Virginia. Now we began to ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, and from hence, for the ſpace of ſix weeks, we had ſkirmiſhes with Indians, in one quarter or other, almoſt every day.</p>
               <p>The ſavages now learned the ſuperiority of the Long Knife, as they call the Virginians, by experience; being out-generalled in almoſt eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry battle. Our affairs began to wear a new aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, and the enemy, not daring to venture on open war, practiſed ſecret michief at times.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="unknown:018467_0062_0FA7A69AA2582510"/>On the firſt day of January, 1778, I went with a party of thirty men to the Blue Licks, on Licking River, to make ſalt for the different garriſons in the country.</p>
               <p>On the ſeventh day of February, as I was hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to procure meat for the company, I met with a party of one hundred and two Indians, and two Frenchmen, on their march againſt Boonſborough, that place being particularly the object of the enemy.</p>
               <p>They purſued, and took me; and brought me on the eighth day to the Licks, where twenty ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of my party were, three of them having previouſly returned home with the ſalt. I know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it was impoſſible for them to eſcape, capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated with the enemy, and, at a diſtance in their view, gave notice to my men of their ſituation, with orders not to reſiſt, but ſurrender them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves captives.</p>
               <p>The generous uſage the Indians had promiſed before in my capitulation, was afterwards fully complied with, and we proceeded with them as pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners to old Chelicothe, the principal Indian town, on Little Miami, where we arrived, after an uncomfortable journey, in very ſevere weather, on the eighteenth day of February, and received as good treatment as priſoners could expect from ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages.
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:018467_0063_0FA7A78CE5A78AA8"/>
—On the tenth day of March following, I, and ten of my men, were conducted by forty Indians to Detroit, where we arrived the thirtieth day, and were treated by Governor Hamilton, the Britiſh commander at that poſt, with great humanity.</p>
               <p>During our travels, the Indians entertained me well; and their affection for me was ſo great, that they utterly refuſed to leave me there with the others, although the Governor offered them one hundred pounds Sterling for me, on purpoſe to give me a parole to go home. Several Engliſh gentlemen there, being ſenſible of my adverſe fortune, and touched with human ſympathy, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerouſly offered a friendly ſupply for my wants, which I refuſed, with many thanks for their kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; adding, that I never expected it would be in my power to recompenſe ſuch unmerited ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity.</p>
               <p>The Indians left my men in captivity with the Britiſh at Detroit, and on the tenth day of April brought me towards Old Chelicothe, where we arrived on the twenty-fifth day of the ſame month. This was a long and fatiguing march, through an exceeding fertile country, remarkable for fine ſprings and ſtreams of water. At Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licothe I ſpent my time as comfortably as I could expect; was adopted, according to their cuſtom,
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:018467_0064_0FA7A78DA62E5290"/>
into a family where I became a ſon, and had a great ſhare in the affection of my new parents, brothers, ſiſters, and friends. I was exceedingly familiar and friendly with them, always appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as chearful and ſatisfied as poſſible, and they put great confidence in me. I often went a hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them, and frequently gained their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe for my activity at our ſhooting-matches. I was careful not to exceed many of them in ſhooting; for no people are more envious than they in this ſport. I could obſerve, in their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances and geſtures, the greateſt expreſſions of joy when they exceeded me; and, when the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe happened, of envy. The Shawaneſe king took great notice of me, and treated me with profound reſpect, and entire friendſhip, often en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſting me to hunt at my liberty. I frequently returned with the ſpoils of the woods, and as often preſented ſome of what I had taken to him, expreſſive of duty to my ſovereign. My food and lodging was, in common, with them, not ſo good indeed as I could deſire, but neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty made every thing acceptable.</p>
               <p>I now began to meditate an eſcape, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully avoided their ſuſpicions, continuing with them at Old Chelicothe until the firſt day of June following, and then was taken by them to the ſalt ſprings on Sciotha, and kept there, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſalt, ten days. During this time I hunted
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:018467_0065_0FA7A78F5A9DF318"/>
ſome for them, and found the land, for a great extent about this river, to exceed the ſoil of Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tucke, if poſſible, and remarkably well watered.</p>
               <p>When I returned to Chelicothe, alarmed to ſee four hundred and fifty Indians, of their choiceſt warriors, painted and armed in a fearful man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, ready to march againſt Boonſborough, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to eſcape the firſt opportunity.</p>
               <p>On the ſixteenth, before ſun-riſe, I departed in the moſt ſecret manner, and arrived at Boonſbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough on the twentieth, after a journey of one hundred and ſixty miles; during which, I had but one meal.</p>
               <p>I found our fortreſs in a bad ſtate of defence, but we proceeded immediately to repair our flanks, ſtrengthen our gates and poſterns, and form double baſtions, which we compleated in ten days. In this time we daily expected the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival of the Indian army; and at length, one of my fellow priſoners, eſcaping from them, arrived, informing us that the enemy had an account of my departure, and poſtponed their expedition three weeks.—The Indians had ſpies out viewing our movements, and were greatly alarmed with our increaſe in number and fortifications. The Grand Councils of the nations were held frequently, and with more deliberation than uſual. They evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:018467_0066_0FA7A7932A2CA950"/>
ſaw the approaching hour when the Long Knife would diſpoſſeſs them of their deſirable ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations; and anxiouſly concerned for futurity, determined utterly to extirpate the whites out of Kentucke. We were not intimidated by their movements, but frequently gave them proofs of our courage.</p>
               <p>About the firſt of Auguſt, I made an incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion into the Indian country, with a party of nineteen men, in order to ſurpriſe a ſmall town up Sciotha, called Paint-Creek-Town. We ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced within four miles thereof, where we met a party of thirty Indians, on their march againſt Boonſborough, intending to join the others from Chelicoth<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. A ſmart fight enſued betwixt us for ſome time: At length the ſavages gave way, and fled. We had no loſs on our ſide: The enemy had one killed, and two wounded. We took from them three horſes, and all their baggage; and being informed, by two of our number that went to their town, that the Indians had entirely evacuated it, we proceeded no further, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned with all poſſible expedition to aſſiſt our garriſon againſt the other party. We paſſed by them on the ſixth day, and on the ſeventh, we arrived ſafe at Boonſborough.</p>
               <p>On the eighth, the Indian army arrived, being four hundred and forty-four in number, commanded
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:018467_0067_0FA7A793A3C49208"/>
by Capt. Duqueſne, eleven other Frenchmen, and ſome of their own chiefs, and marched up with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in view of our fort, with Britiſh and French co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours flying; and having ſent a ſummons to me, in his Britannick Majeſty's name, to ſurrender the fort, I requeſted two days conſideration, which was granted.</p>
               <p>It was now a critical period with us.—We were a ſmall number in the garriſon:—A powerful ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my before our walls, whoſe appearance proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed inevitable death, fearfully painted, and mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their footſteps with deſolation. Death was preferable to captivity; and if taken by ſtorm, we muſt inevitably be devoted to deſtruction. In this ſituation we concluded to maintain our garriſon, if poſſible. We immediately proceeded to collect what we could of our horſes, and other cattle, and bring them through the poſterns into the fort: And in the evening of the ninth, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned anſwer, that we were determined to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend our fort while a man was living —Now, ſaid I to their commander, who ſtood attentive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hearing my ſentiments, We laugh at all your formidable preparations: But thank you for giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us notice and time to provide for our defence. Your efforts will not prevail; for our gates ſhall for ever deny you admittance.—Whether this anſwer affected their courage, or not, I cannot tell; but contrary to our expectations, they
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:018467_0068_0FA7A794680145A0"/>
formed a ſcheme to deceive us, declaring it was their orders, from Governor Hamilton, to take us captives, and not to deſtroy us; but if nine of us would come out, and treat with them, they would immediatly withdraw their forces from our walls, and return home peaceably. This ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed grateful in our ears; and we agreed to the propoſal.</p>
               <p>We held the treaty within ſixty yards of the garriſon, on purpoſe to divert them from a breach of honour, as we could not avoid ſuſpicions of the ſavages. In this ſituation the articles were formally agreed to, and ſigned; and the Indians told us it was cuſtomary with them, on ſuch occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, for two Indians to ſhake hands with every white-man in the treaty, as an evidence of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire friendſhip. We agreed to this alſo, but were ſoon convinced their policy was to take us pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners.—They immediately grappled us; but, although ſurrounded by hundreds of ſavages, we extricated ourſelves from them, and eſcaped all ſafe into the garriſon, except one that was wounded, through a heavy fire from their army. They immediately attacked us on every ſide, and a conſtant heavy fire enſued between us day and night for the ſpace of nine days.</p>
               <p>In this time the enemy began to undermine our fort, which was ſituated ſixty yards from Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tucke
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:018467_0069_0FA7A795288C62E8"/>
river. They began at the water-mark, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in the bank ſome diſtance, which we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by their making the water muddy with the clay; and we immediately proceeded to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appoint their deſign, by cutting a trench a-croſs their ſubterranean paſſage. The enemy diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our counter-mine, by the clay we threw out of the fort, deſiſted from that ſtratagem: And ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience now fully convincing them that neither their power nor policy could effect their purpoſe, on the twentieth day of Auguſt they raiſed the ſiege, and departed.</p>
               <p>During this dreadful ſiege, which threatened death in every form, we had two men killed, and four wounded, beſides a number of cattle. We killed of the enemy thirty-ſeven, and wounded a great number. After they were gone, we pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up one hundred and twenty-five pounds weight of bullets, beſides what ſtuck in the logs of our fort; which certainly is a great proof of their induſtry. Soon after this, I went into the ſettlement, and nothing worthy of a place in this account paſſed in my affairs for ſome time.</p>
               <p>During my abſence from Kentucke, Col. Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man carried on an expedition againſt the Shawaneſe, at Old Chelicothe, with one hundred and ſixty men, in July, 1779. Here they arrived undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, and a battle enſued, which laſted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:018467_0070_0FA7A795E895E480"/>
ten o'clock, A. M. when Col. Bowman, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he could not ſucceed at this time, retreated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout thirty miles. The Indians, in the mean time, collecting all their forces, purſued and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertook him, when a ſmart fight continued near two hours, not to the advantage of Col. Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's party.</p>
               <p>Col. Harrod propoſed to mount a number of horſe, and furiouſly to ruſh upon the ſavages, who at this time fought with remarkable fury. This deſperate ſtep had a happy effect, broke their line of battle, and the ſavages fled on all ſides. In theſe two battles we had nine killed, and one wounded. The enemy's loſs uncertain, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly two ſcalps being taken.</p>
               <p>On the twenty-ſecond day of June, 1780, a large party of Indians and Canadians, about ſix hundred in number, commanded by Col. Bird, attacked Riddle's and Martin's ſtations, at the Forks of Licking River, with ſix pieces of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery. They carried this expedition ſo ſecretly, that the unwary inhabitants did not diſcover them, until they fired upon the forts; and, not being prepared to oppoſe them, were obliged to ſurrender themſelves miſerable captives to barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſavages, who immediately after tomahawked one man and two women, and loaded all the others with heavy baggage, forcing them along
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:018467_0071_0FA7A796A37F8640"/>
toward their towns, able or unable to march. Such as were weak and faint by the way, they tomahawked. The tender women, and helpleſs children, fell victims to their cruelty. This, and the ſavage treatment they received afterwards, is ſhocking to humanity, and too barbarous to relate.</p>
               <p>The hoſtile diſpoſition of the ſavages, and their allies, cauſed General Clark, the commandant at the Falls of the Ohio, immediately to begin an expedition with his own regiment, and the arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed force of the country, againſt Pecaway, the principal town of the Shawaneſe, on a branch of Great Miami, which he finiſhed with great ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, took ſeventeen ſcalps, and burnt the town to aſhes, with the loſs of ſeventeen men.</p>
               <p>About this time I returned to Kentucke with my family; and here, to avoid an enquiry into my conduct, the reader being before informed of my bringing my family to Kentucke, I am under the neceſſity of informing him that, during my captivity with the Indians, my wife, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaired of ever ſeeing me again, expecting the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians had put a period to my life, oppreſſed with the diſtreſſes of the country, and bereaved of me, her only happineſs, had, before I returned, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported my family and goods, on horſes, through the wilderneſs, amidſt a multitude of dangers, to her father's houſe, in North-Carolina.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="unknown:018467_0072_0FA7A7985F201BF0"/>Shortly after the troubles at Boonſborough, I went to them, and lived peaceably there until this time. The hiſtory of my going home, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning with my family, forms a ſeries of diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, an account of which would ſwell a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume, and being foreign to my purpoſe, I ſhall purpoſely omit them.</p>
               <p>I ſettled my family in Boonſborough once more; and ſhortly after, on the ſixth day of October, 1780, I went in company with my brother to the Blue Licks; and, on our return home, we were fired upon by a party of Indians. They ſhot him, and purſued me, by the ſcent of their dog, three miles; but I killed the dog, and eſcaped. The Winter ſoon came on, and was very ſevere, which confined the Indians to their wigwams.</p>
               <p>The ſeverity of this Winter cauſed great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties in Kentucke. The enemy had deſtroyed moſt of the corn, the Summer before. This ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary article was ſcarce, and dear; and the inhabitants lived chiefly on the fleſh of buffaloes. The circumſtances of many were very lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: However, being a hardy race of people, and accuſtomed to difficulties and neceſſities, they were wonderfully ſupported through all their ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, until the enſuing Fall, when we receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed abundance from the fertile ſoil.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="74" facs="unknown:018467_0073_0FA7A79BF4936190"/>Towards Spring, we were frequently haraſſed by Indians; and, in May, 1782, a party aſſaulted Aſhton's ſtation, killed one man, and took a Negro priſoner. Capt. Aſhton, with twenty-five men, purſued, and overtook the ſavages, and a ſmart fight enſued, which laſted two hours; but they being ſuperior in number, obliged Captain Aſhton's party to retreat, with the loſs of eight killed, and four mortally wounded; their brave commander himſelf being numbered among the dead.</p>
               <p>The Indians continued their hoſtilities; and, about the tenth of Auguſt following, two boys were taken from Major Hoy's ſtation. This party was purſued by Capt. Holder and ſeventeen men, who were alſo defeated, with the loſs of four men killed, and one wounded. Our affairs became more and more alarming. Several ſtations which had lately been erected in the country were conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually infeſted with ſavages, ſtealing their horſes and killing the men at every opportunity. In a field, near Lexington, an Indian ſhot a man, and running to ſcalp him, was himſelf ſhot from the fort, and fell dead upon his enemy.</p>
               <p>Every day we experienced recent miſchiefs. The barbarous ſavage nations of Shawaneſe, Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rokees, Wyandots, Tawas, Delawares, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral others near Detroit, united in a war againſt
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:018467_0074_0FA7A79CA335C758"/>
us, and aſſembled their choiceſt warriors at old Chelicothe, to go on the expedition, in order to deſtroy us, and entirely depopulate the country. Their ſavage minds were inflamed to miſchief by two abandoned men, Captains M'Kee and Girty. Theſe led them to execute every diaboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſcheme; and, on the fifteenth day of Auguſt, commanded a party of Indians and Canadians, of about five hundred in number, againſt Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant's ſtation, five miles from Lexington. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out demanding a ſurrender, they furiouſly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted the garriſon, which was happily prepared to oppoſe them; and, after they had expended much ammunition in vain, and killed the cattle round the fort, not being likely to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves maſters of this place, they raiſed the ſiege, and departed in the morning of the third day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they came, with the loſs of about thirty kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the number of wounded uncertain.—Of the garriſon four were killed, and three wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>On the eighteenth day Col. Todd, Col. Trigg, Major Harland, and myſelf, ſpeedily collected one hundred and ſeventy-ſix men, well armed, and purſued the ſavages. They had marched be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Blue Licks to a remarkable bend of the main fork of Licking River, about forty-three miles from Lexington, as it is particularly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in the map, where we overtook them on
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:018467_0075_0FA7A79D6776DFF0"/>
the nineteenth day. The ſavages obſerving us, gave way; and we, being ignorant of their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, paſſed the river. When the enemy ſaw our proceedings, having greatly the advantage of us in ſituation, they formed the line of battle, as repreſented in the map, from one bend of Lick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the other, about a mile from the Blue <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ks. An exceeding fierce battle immediately began, for about fifteen minutes, when we, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over-powered by numbers, were obliged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, with the loſs of ſixty-ſeven men; ſeven of whom were taken priſoners The brave and much lamented Colonels Todd and Trigg, Major Harland and my ſecond ſon, were among the dead. We were informed that the Indians, numbering their dead, found they had four killed more than we; and therefore, four of the priſoners they had taken, were, by general conſent, ordered to be killed, in a moſt barbarous manner, by the young warriors, in order to train them up to cruelty; and then they proceeded to their towns.</p>
               <p>On our retreat we were met by Col. Logan, haſtening to join us, with a number of well arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men. This powerful aſſiſtance we unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately wanted in the battle; for, notwithſtanding the enemy's ſuperiority of numbers, they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged that, if they had received one more fire from us, they ſhould undoubtedly have giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en way. So valiantly did our ſmall party fight,
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:018467_0076_0FA7A79E2424C308"/>
that, to the memory of thoſe who unfortunate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fell in the battle, enough of honour cannot be paid. Had Col. Logan and his party been with us, it is highly probable we ſhould have given the ſavages a total defeat.</p>
               <p>I cannot reflect upon this dreadful ſcene, but ſorrow fills my heart. A zeal for the defence of their country led theſe heroes to the ſcene of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though with a few men to attack a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful army of experienced warriors. When we gave way, they purſued us with the utmoſt ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerneſs, and in every quarter ſpread deſtruction. The river was difficult to croſs, and many were killed in the flight, ſome juſt entering the river, ſome in the water, others after croſſing in aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cliffs. Some eſcaped on horſe-back, a few on foot; and, being diſperſed every where, in a few hours, brought the melancholy news of this unfortunate battle to Lexington. Many wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows were now made. The reader may gueſs what ſorrow filled the hearts of the inhabitants, exceeding any thing that I am able to deſcribe. Being reinforced, we returned to bury the dead, and found their bodies ſtrewed every where, cut and mangled in a dreadful manner. This mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſcene exhibited a horror almoſt unparalleled: Some torn and eaten by wild beaſts; thoſe in the river eaten by fiſhes; all in ſuch a putrified con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:018467_0077_0FA7A79EE6A3E050"/>
that no one could be diſtinguiſhed from another.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as General Clark, then at the Falls of the Ohio, who was ever our ready friend, and merits the love and gratitude of all his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-men, underſtood the circumſtances of this unfortunate action, he ordered an expedition, with all poſſible haſte, to purſue the ſavages, which was ſo expeditiouſly effected, that we overtook them within two miles of their towns, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably might have obtained a great victory, had not two of their number met us about two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred poles before we come up. Theſe returned quick as lightening to their camp with the alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing news of a mighty army in view. The ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages fled in the utmoſt diſorder, evacuated their towns, and reluctantly left their territory to our mercy. We immediately took poſſeſſion of Old Chelicothe without oppoſition, being deſerted by its inhabitants. We continued our purſuit through five towns on the Miami rivers, Old Chelicothe, Pecaway, New Chelicothe, Will's Towns, and Chelicothe, burnt them all to aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, entirely deſtroyed their corn, and other fruits, and every where ſpread a ſcene of deſolation in the country. In this expedition we took ſeven priſoners and five ſcalps, with the loſs of only four men, two of whom were accidentally killed by our own army.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="unknown:018467_0078_0FA7A79FA60E4F40"/>This campaign in ſome meaſure damped the ſpirits of the Indians, and made them ſenſible of our ſuperiority. Their connections were diſſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, their armies ſcattered, and a future invaſion put entirely out of their power; yet they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to practiſe miſchief ſecretly upon the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, in the expoſed parts of the country.</p>
               <p>In October following, a party made an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſion into that diſtrict called the Crab Orchard, and one of them, being advanced ſome diſtance before the others, boldly entered the houſe of a poor defenceleſs family, in which was only a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gro man, a woman and her children, terrified with the apprehenſions of immediate death. The ſavage, perceiving their defenceleſs ſituation, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out offering violence to the family attempted to captivate the Negro, who, happily proved an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-match for him, threw him on the ground, and, in the ſtruggle, the mother of the children drew an ax from a corner of the cottage, and cut his head off, while her little daughter ſhut the door. The ſavages inſtantly appeared, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied their tomahawks to the door. An old ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty gun-barrel, without a lock, lay in a corner, which the mother put through a ſmall crevice, and the ſavages, perceiving it, fled. In the mean time, the alarm ſpread through the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; the armed men collected immediately, and purſued the ravagers into the wilderneſs. Thus
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:018467_0079_0FA7A7A065572888"/>
Providence, by the means of this Negro, ſaved the whole of the poor family from deſtruction. From that time, until the happy return of peace between the United States and Great-Britain, the Indians did us no miſchief. Finding the great king beyond the water diſappointed in his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations, and conſcious of the importance of the Long Knife, and their own wretchedneſs, ſome of the nations immediately deſired peace; to which, at preſent, they ſeem univerſally diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and are ſending ambaſſadors to General Clark, at the Falls of the Ohio, with the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes of their Councils; a ſpecimen of which, in the minutes of the Piankaſhaw Council, is ſubjoined.</p>
               <p>To conclude, I can now ſay that I have veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the ſaying of an old Indian who ſigned Col. Henderſon's deed. Taking me by the hand, at the delivery thereof, Brother, ſays he, we have given you a fine land, but I believe you will have much trouble in ſettling it.—My footſteps have often been marked with blood, and therefore I can truly ſubſcribe to its original name. Two darling ſons, and a brother, have I loſt by ſavage hands, which have alſo taken from me forty va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable horſes, and abundance of cattle. Many dark and ſleepleſs nights have I been a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion for owls, ſeparated from the chearful ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of men, ſcorched by the Summer's ſun, and
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:018467_0080_0FA7A7A36B534730"/>
pinched by the Winter's cold, an inſtrument or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to ſettle the wilderneſs. But now the ſcene is changed: Peace crowns the ſylvan ſhade.</p>
               <p>What thanks, what ardent and ceaſeleſs thanks are due to that all-ſuperintending Providence which has turned a cruel war into peace, brought order out of confuſion, made the fierce ſavages placid, and turned away their hoſtile weapons from our country! May the ſame Almighty Goodneſs baniſh the accurſed monſter, war, from all lands, with her hated aſſociates, rapine and inſatiable ambition. Let peace, deſcending from her native heaven, bid her olives ſpring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt the joyful nations; and plenty, in league with commerce, ſcatter bleſſings from her copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous hand.</p>
               <p>This account of my adventures will inform the reader of the moſt remarkable events of this country.—I now live in peace and ſafety, enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſweets of liberty, and the bounties of Providence, with my once fellow-ſufferers, in this delightful country, which I have ſeen pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed with a vaſt expence of blood and treaſure, delighting in the proſpect of its being, in a ſhort time, one of the moſt opulent and powerful ſtates on the continent of North-America; which, with the love and gratitude of my country-men,

               <p>WHAT I have often told you, is now come to paſs. This day I received news from my Great Chief, at the Falls of Ohio. Peace is made with the enemies of America. The White Fleſh, the Americans, French, Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards, Dutch and Engliſh, this day ſmoke out
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:018467_0082_0FA7A7A4E7DD1BD0"/>
of the peace-pipe. The tomahawk is buried, and they are now friends.</p>
               <p>I am told the Shawaneſe, Delawares, Chica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaws, Cherokees, and all other the Red Fleſh, have taken the Long Knife by the hand. They have given up to them the priſoners that were in their nations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My Children on Wabaſh,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Open your ears, and let what I tell you ſink deep in your hearts. You know me. Near twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years I have been among you. The Long Knife is my nation. I know their hearts; peace they carry in one hand, and war in the other.</p>
               <p>I leave you to yourſelves to judge. Conſider, and now accept the one, or the other. We ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver beg peace of our enemies. If you love your women and children, receive the belt of wampum I preſent you. Return me my fleſh you have in your villages, and the horſes you ſtole from my people at Kentucks. Your corn-fields were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver diſturbed by the Long Knife. Your women and children lived quiet in their houſes, while your warriors were killing and robbing my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. All this you know is the truth. This is the laſt time I ſhall ſpeak to you. I have waited ſix moons to hear you ſpeak, and to get my people from you. In ten nights I ſhall

leave the Wabaſh to ſee my Great Chief at the Falls of Ohio, where he will be glad to hear, from your own lips, what you have to ſay. Here is tobacco I give you: Smoke; and conſider what I have ſaid.—Then I delivered one belt of blue and white wampum; and ſaid, Piankaſhaw, ſpeak, ſpeak to the Americans.</p>
               <p>Then the Piankaſhaw Chief anſwered;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My Great Father, the Long Knife,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You have been many years among us. You have ſuffered by us. We ſtill hope you will have pity and compaſſion upon us, on our women and children; the day is clear. The ſun ſhines on us; and the good news of peace appears in our faces. This day, my Father, this is the day of joy to the Wabaſh Indians. With one tongue we now ſpeak.</p>
               <p>We accept your peace-belt. We return God thanks, you are the man that delivered us what we long wiſhed for, peace, with the White Fleſh. My Father, we have many times counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led before you knew us; and you know how ſome of us ſuffered before.</p>
               <p>We received the tomahawk from the Engliſh: Poverty forced us to it: We were attended by other nations: We are ſorry for it. We this day collect the bones of our friends that long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go were ſcattered upon the earth. We bury
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:018467_0084_0FA7A7A66858DF68"/>
them in one grave. We thus plant the tree of peace, that God may ſpread branches; ſo that we can all be ſecured from bad weather. They ſmoke as brothers out of the peace-pipe we now preſent you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Here, my Father, is the pipe that gives us joy. Smoke out of it. Our warriors are glad you are the man we preſent it to. You ſee, Father, we have buried the tomahawk: We now make a great chain of friendſhip never to be broken; and now, as one people, ſmoke out of your pipe. My Father, we know God was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with us for ſtealing your horſes, and diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your people. He has ſent us ſo much ſnow and cold weather, that God himſelf killed all your horſes, with our own.</p>
               <p>We are now a poor people. God, we hope, will help us; and our Father, the Long Knife, will have pity and compaſſion on our women and children. Your fleſh, my Father, is well that is among us; we ſhall collect them all together when they come in from hunting. Don't be ſorry, my Father, all the priſoners taken at Kentucke are alive and well; we love them, and ſo do our young women.</p>
               <p>Some of your people mend our guns, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers tell us they can make rum of the corn. Thoſe are now the ſame as we. In one moon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this, we will go with them to their friends at Kentucke. Some of your people will now go
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:018467_0085_0FA7A7A726ED83E0"/>
with Coſtea, a Chief of our nation, to ſee his Great Father, the Long Knife, at the Falls of Ohio.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My Father,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This being the day of joy to the Wabaſh Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, we beg a little drop of your milk, to let our warriors ſee it came from your own breaſt. We were born and raiſed in the woods; we could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver learn to make rum—God has made the White Fleſh maſters of the world; they make every thing; and we all love rum—</p>
               <p>Then they delivered three ſtrings of blue and white wampum, and the coronet of peace.</p>

               <head>OF THE INDIANS.</head>
               <p>WE have an account of twenty-eight dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent nations of Indians, Eaſtward of the Miſſiſſippi.—Their ſituation is as follows.</p>
               <p>The Cherokee Indians are neareſt to Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tucke, living upon the Teneſe River, near the mouths of Clench, Holſtein, Nolachucke, and French-Broad Rivers, which form the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe or Cherokee River, in the interior parts of North-Carolina, two hundred miles from Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tucke.</p>
               <p>The Chicamawgees live about ninety miles down the Teneſe from the Cherokees, at a place called Chicamawgee, which in our language ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies a Boiling Pot, there being a whirl-pool in the river dangerous for boats. The Dragomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, a Chief of the Cherokees, with ſixty more, broke off from that nation, and formed this
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:018467_0087_0FA7A7A8A988F710"/>
tribe, which is called by the name of the Whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pool.</p>
               <p>The Cheegees, and Middle-Settlement Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, are ſettled about fifty and eighty miles South of the Cherokees.—Theſe four tribes ſpeak one language, being deſcended from the Cherokees.</p>
               <p>The Chicaſaws inhabit about one hundred miles N. W. from our ſettlement at French Lick, on Cumberland River, on the heads of a river called Tombeche, which runs into Mobile Bay.</p>
               <p>The Choctaw nation are eighty miles from the Chicaſaws, down the ſame river.</p>
               <p>The Creek Indians live about one hundred and ſixty miles South of the Choctaws, on the Apa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lache River, which runs into the Gulph of Mex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ico, ſome little diſtance Eaſt of Mobile Bay.</p>
               <p>The Uchees Indians occupy four different places of reſidence, at the head of St. John's, the Fork of St. Mary's, the head of Cannuchee, and the head of St. Tillis. Theſe rivers riſe on the borders of Georgia, and run ſeparately into the ocean.</p>
               <p>The Catauba Indians are ſettled in North-Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolina,
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:018467_0088_0FA7A7A9664E3A88"/>
about two hundred miles diſtant from Charles-town, in S. Carolina.</p>
               <p>The tribes to the Weſtward of Ohio River are the Delawares<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> living upon the Miſkingum Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, which runs into the Ohio one hundred and eighty-ſeven miles above Sciotha, on the N. Weſt ſide.</p>
               <p>The Mingo Nation lives upon a N. W. branch of Sciotha River, as is repreſented in the map.</p>
               <p>The Wyandotts poſſeſs the banks of a river call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Sanduſky, which heads and interlocks with Sciotha, and, running in a contrary direction nearly N. W. for a great diſtance, falls into Lake Erie.</p>
               <p>The Six Nations are ſettled upon waters run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning into Lake Ontario, that head in the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, from whence the Ohio and Suſquehannah rivers riſe.</p>
               <p>The Shawaneſe Indians occupy five towns on the waters of Little and Great Miami, as appears in the map.</p>
               <p>The Gibbaways are fixed on the Eaſt ſide of Detroit River, and oppoſite the fort of that name<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This river runs out of Lake Huron
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:018467_0089_0FA7A7AE447F36F0"/>
into Lake Erie, is thirty-ſix miles in length, and the fort ſtands on the Weſt ſide, half way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt theſe lakes.</p>
               <p>The Hurons live ſix miles from the Gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baways, towards Lake Huron, and on the ſame ſide of the river.</p>
               <p>The Tawaws are found eighteen miles up the Mawmee or Omee River, which runs into Lake Erie.</p>
               <p>There is a ſmall tribe of Tawas ſettled at a place called the Rapids, ſome diſtance higher up the river than the former.</p>
               <p>The Mawmee Indians live two hundred and forty miles up this river, at a place called Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedebeau.</p>
               <p>The Piankaſhaws reſide about one hundred and ſixty miles up Wabaſh River:—</p>
               <p>The Vermilion Indians about ſixty miles higher;—and the Wyahtinaws about thirty miles ſtill further up the ſame river.</p>
               <p>The Wabaſh heads and interlocks with Maw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mee, and runs a contrary direction into Ohio, three hundred and eighteen miles below the Falls.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="91" facs="unknown:018467_0090_0FA7A7AEA3FA3868"/>The Long-iſle or Iſle-River Indians live on Iſle, or White River, which runs into Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſh.</p>
               <p>The Kickapoos are fixed on a branch of Mawmee River above the Long-iſle Indians.</p>
               <p>The Ozaw Nation lives on the Ozaw River, which runs into Miſſiſſippi:—</p>
               <p>And the Kakaſky Nation, on the Miſſiſſippi, two hundred miles above the Ozaws.</p>
               <p>The Illinois Indians inhabit upon the Illinois<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> River, which falls into the Miſſiſſippi;—</p>
               <p>And the Poutawottamies near St. Joſeph's, a town on a branch of the Illinois.</p>
               <p>The Sioux and Renards, are neighbours to the fort of Michillimackinac, on Lake Michigan<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe are the principal part of the Nations within the limits of the United States. Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about ſeven hundred to a nation or tribe, they will contain, in all, twenty thouſand ſouls, and conſequently may furniſh between four and five thouſand warriors.</p>
               <p>The Speculations of curious idleneſs have fram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:018467_0091_0FA7A7AF6B095D50"/>
many ſyſtems to account for the population of this immenſe continent. There is ſcarce a people in the old world which has not had its advocates; and there have not been wanting ſome, who<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> deſpairing to looſen, have cut the knot, by ſuppoſing that the power, which fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed America with plants, has in the ſame manner ſupplied it with men, or at leaſt, that a remnant in this continent was ſaved from the univerſal deluge, as well as in the other. As this ſubject is rather curious than uſeful, and, in its very nature, does not admit of certainty, every thing that paſſed in America before the arrival of the Europeans being plunged in Cimmerian darkneſs, except thoſe little traditional records, which diffuſe a glimmering light on the two empires of Mex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ico and Peru, for about two hundred years at moſt before that period, we ſhall only ſlightly touch on that ſubject; chiefly for the ſake of taking notice of ſome modern diſcoveries which ſeem to ſtrengthen the probability of ſome for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer theories. The great ſimilarity, or rather i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentity, of the perſons and manners of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mericans, and thoſe of the Tartars of the N. Eaſtern parts of Aſia, together with a preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which has long poſſeſſed the learned, that Aſia and America were united, or at leaſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated only by a narrow ſea, has inclined the more reflecting part of mankind to the opinion, that the true origin of the Indians is from this quarter. The immenſe ſeas, which ſeparate the
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:018467_0092_0FA7A7B029DFB230"/>
two continents on every other ſide, render it high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly improbable that any colonies could ever have been ſent a-croſs them before the diſcovery of the magnetical compaſs. The ingenious M. Buffon too has remarked, and the obſervation appears to be juſt, that there are no animals inhabiting in common the two continents, but ſuch as can bear the colds of the North. Thus there are no ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants, no lions, no tigers, no camels in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica; but bears, wolves, deer, and elks in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, abſolutely the ſame in both hemiſpheres. This hypotheſis, which has been gaining ground ever ſince its firſt appearance in the world, is now reduced almoſt to a certainty by the late diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries of Capt. Cook. That illuſtrious, but unfortunate navigator, in his laſt voyage, pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated for a conſiderable diſtance into the ſtrait which divides Aſia from America, which is only ſix leagues wide at its mouth; and therefore eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly practicable for canoes. We may now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conclude, that no farther enquiry will ever be made in to the general origin of the American tribes.</p>
               <p>Yet, after all, it is far from being improbable that various nations, by ſhipwreck, or otherwiſe, may have contributed, in ſome degree, to the popula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this continent. The Carthaginians, who had many ſettlements on the coaſt of Africa, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Straits of Gibraltar, and puſhed their diſcoveries as far as where the two continents in
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:018467_0093_0FA7A7B0E4DAEFC0"/>
that quarter approach each other the neareſt, may probably have been thrown by tempeſts on the American coaſt, and the companies of the veſſels finding it impracticable to return, may have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated with the former inhabitants, or have formed new ſettlements, which, from want of the neceſſary inſtruments to exerciſe the arts they were acquainted with, would naturally degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate into barbarity. There are indeed ſome an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient writers, who give us reaſon to ſuppoſe, that there were colonies regularly formed by that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in America, and that the communication, after having continued for ſome time, was ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped by order of the State. But it is difficult to conceive that any people, eſtabliſhed with all thoſe neceſſaries proper for their ſituation, ſhould ever degenerate, from ſo high a degree of cultivation as the Carthaginians poſſeſſed, to a total igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance even of the moſt neceſſary arts: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ſeems probable, that if that nation ever had ſuch colonies, they muſt have been out off by the natives, and every veſtige of them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed.</p>
               <p>About the ninth and tenth centuries, the Danes were the greateſt navigators in the univerſe. They diſcovered and ſettled Iceland; and from thence, in 964, planted a colony in Greenland. The ancient Icelandic chronicles, as reported by M. Mallet, contain an account of ſome Icelanders,
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:018467_0094_0FA7A7B1A89AB2F8"/>
who, in the cloſe of an unſucceſsful war, fled to Greenland, and from thence Weſtward, to a country covered with vines, which from thence they called Vinland.</p>
               <p>The adventurers returned home, and conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a colony to their new diſcovery; but diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances ariſing in Denmark, all communication with Greenland, as well as Vinland, ceaſed; and thoſe countries remained unknown to the reſt of the world for ſeveral ages. The remains of this colony are probably to be found on the coaſt of Labrador, in the nation of the Eſquimaux. The colour of their ſkins, their hairy bodies and buſhy beards, not to mention the difference of manners, mark an origin totally diſtinct from that of the other Indians.</p>
               <p>In the year 1170, Madoc<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſon of Owen Gwyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedh, Prince of Wales, diſſatisfied with the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation of affairs at home, left his country, as related by the Welſh hiſtorians, in queſt of new ſettlements, and leaving Ireland to the North, proceeded Weſt till he diſcovered a fertile coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; where, leaving a colony, he returned, and perſuading many of his country men to join him, put to ſea with ten ſhips, and was never more heard of.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="96" facs="unknown:018467_0095_0FA7A7B263425248"/>This account has, at ſeveral times, drawn the attention of the world; but as no veſtiges of them had then been found, it was concluded, perhaps too raſhly, to be a fable, or at leaſt, that no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of the colony exiſted. Of late years, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the Weſtern ſettlers have received frequent accounts of a nation, inhabiting at a great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance up the Miſſouri, in manners and appearance reſembling the other Indians, but ſpeaking Welſh, and retaining ſome ceremonies of the chriſtian worſhip; and at length, this is univerſally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved there to be a fact.</p>
               <p>Captain Abraham Chaplain, of Kentucke, a gentleman, whoſe veracity may be entirely depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon, aſſured the author, that in the late war, being with his company in garriſon at Kaſkaſky, ſome Indians came there, and, ſpeaking in the Welſh dialect, were perfectly underſtood and converſed with by two Welſhmen in his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and that they informed them of the ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their nation as mentioned above.</p>
               <p>The author is ſenſible of the ridicule which the vain and the petulant may attempt to throw on this account; but as truth only has guided his pen, he is regardleſs of the conſequences, and flatters himſelf, that, by calling the attention of mankind once more to this ſubject, he may be the means of procuring a more accurate inquiry
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:018467_0096_0FA7A7B5C48F57D8"/>
into its truth, which, if it ſhould even refute the ſtory of the Welſh, will at leaſt perform the important ſervice to the world, of promoting a more accurate diſcovery of this immenſe conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent.</p>
               <p>There are ſeveral ancient remains in Kentucke, which ſeem to prove, that this country was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly inhabited by a nation farther advanced in the arts of life than the Indians. Theſe are there uſually attributed to the Welſh, who are ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have formerly inhabited here; but having been expelled by the natives, were forced to take refuge near the ſources of the Miſſouri.</p>
               <p>It is well known, that no Indian nation has e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver practiſed the method of defending themſelves by entrenchments; and ſuch a work would even be no eaſy one, while theſe nations were unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the uſe of iron.</p>
               <p>In the neighbourhood of Lexington, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of two ancient fortifications are to be ſeen, furniſhed with ditches and baſtions. One of theſe contains about ſix acres of land, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nearly three. They are now overgrown with trees, which, by the number of circles in the wood, appear to be not leſs than one hundred and ſixty years old. Pieces of earthen veſſels have alſo been plowed up near Lexington, a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:018467_0097_0FA7A7B6F868CBC0"/>
with which the Indians were never ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted.</p>
               <p>The burying-grounds, which were mentioned above, under the head of Curioſities, form ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtrong argument that this country was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly inhabited by a people different from the preſent Indians. Although they do not diſcover any marks of extraordinary art in the ſtructure, yet, as many nations are particularly tenacious of their ancient cuſtoms, it may perhaps be worthy of enquiry, whether theſe repoſitories of the dead do not bear a conſiderable reſemblance to the ancient Britiſh remains. Some buildings, attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the Picts, are mentioned by the Scottiſh antiquaries, which, if the author miſtakes not, are formed nearly in the ſame manner. Let it be enough for him to point out the road, and hazard ſome uncertain conjectures. The day is not far diſtant, when the fartheſt receſſes of this continent will be explored, and the accounts of the Welſh eſtabliſhed beyond the poſſibility of a doubt, or conſigned to that oblivion which has already received ſo many ſuppoſitions founded on arguments as plauſible as theſe.</p>

                  <head>PERSONS AND HABITS.</head>
                  <p>THE Indians are not born white; and take
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:018467_0098_0FA7A7B70D5200F0"/>
a great deal of pains to darken their complexion, by anointing themſelves with greaſe, and lying in the ſun. They alſo paint their faces, breaſts and ſhoulders, of various colours, but generally red; and their features are well formed, eſpecially thoſe of the women. They are of a middle ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, their limbs clean and ſtraight, and ſcarcely any crooked or deformed perſon is to be found among them. In many parts of their bodies they prick in gun-powder in very pretty figures. They ſhave, or pluck the hair off their heads, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a patch about the crown, which is orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with beautiful feathers, beads, wampum, and ſuch like baubles. Their ears are pared, and ſtretched in a thong down to their ſhoulders. They are wound round with wire to expand them, and adorned with ſilver pendants, rings, and bells, which they likewiſe wear in their noſes. Some of them will have a large feather through the cartilage of the noſe; and thoſe who can af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford it, wear a collar of wampum, a ſilver breaſt-plate, and bracelets, on the arms and wriſts. A bit of cloth about the middle, a ſhirt of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh make, on which they beſtow innumerable broaches to adorn it, a ſort of cloth boots and mockaſons, which are ſhoes of a make peculiar to the Indians, ornamented with porcupine quills, with a blanket or match-coat thrown over all, compleats their dreſs at home; but when they go to war, they leave their trinkets behind, and
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:018467_0099_0FA7A7B7A3559FB0"/>
mere neceſſaries ſerve them. There is little dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the dreſs of the men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, excepting that a ſhort petticoat, and the hair, which is exceeding black, and long, club<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed behind, diſtinguiſh ſome of the latter. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the head and eye-brows, they pluck the hair, with great diligence, from all parts of the body, eſpecially the looſer part of the ſex.</p>
                  <p>Their warlike arms are guns, bows and arrows, darts, ſcalping-knives and tomahawks. This is one of their moſt uſeful pieces of field-furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſerving all the offices of the hatchet, pipe, and ſword. They are exceeding expert in throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, and will kill at a conſiderable diſtance. The world has no better marks men, with any wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon. They will kill birds flying, fiſhes ſwimming, and wild beaſts running.</p>

                  <p>THE Indians are not ſo ignorant as ſome ſuppoſe them, but are a very underſtanding peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, quick of apprehenſion, ſudden in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſubtle in buſineſs, exquiſite in invention, and induſtrious in action. They are of a very gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and amiable diſpoſition to thoſe they think their friends, but as implacable in their enmity; their revenge being only compleated, in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:018467_0100_0FA7A7B86629DDF0"/>
deſtruction of their enemies. They are very hardy, bearing heat, cold, hunger and thirſt, in a ſurpriſing manner, and yet no people are more addicted to exceſs in eating and drinking, when it is conveniently in their power. The follies, nay miſchief, they commit when inebriated, are entirely laid to the liquor, and no one will revenge any injury (murder excepted) received from one who is no more himſelf. Among the Indians, all men are equal, perſonal qualities being moſt eſteemed. No diſtinction of birth, no rank, renders any man capable of doing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to the rights of private perſons; and there is no pre-eminence from merit, which begets pride, and which makes others too ſenſible of their own inferiority. Though there is perhaps leſs delicacy of ſentiment in the Indians than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us; there is, however, abundantly more probity, with infinitely leſs ceremony, or equivocal compliments. Their public conferences ſhew them to be men of genius; and they have, in a high degree, the talent of natural eloquence.</p>
                  <p>They live diſperſed in ſmall villages, either in the woods, or on the banks of rivers, where they have little plantations of Indian-corn, and roots, not enough to ſupply their families half the year, and ſubſiſting the remainder of it by hunting, fiſhing and fowling, and the fruits of
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:018467_0101_0FA7A7B923FE9980"/>
the earth, which grow ſpontaneouſly in great plenty.</p>
                  <p>Their huts are generally built of ſmall logs, and covered with bark, each one having a chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and a door, on which they place a padlock.</p>
                  <p>Old Chelicothe is built in form of a Kentucke ſtation, that is, a parallelogram, or long ſquare; and ſome of their houſes are ſhingled A long Council-houſe extends the whole length of the town, where the King and Chiefs of the nation frequently meet, and conſult of all matters of importance, whether of a civil or military na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>Some huts are built by ſetting up a frame on forks, and placing bark againſt it; others of reeds, and ſurrounded with clay. The fire is in the middle of the wigwam, and the ſmoke paſſes through a little hole. They join reeds together by cords run through them, which ſerve them for tables and beds. They moſtly lie upon ſkins of wild beaſts, and ſit on the ground. They have braſs kettles and pots to boil their food; gourds or calabaſhes, cut aſunder, ſerve them for pails, cups and diſhes.</p>

                  <p>THE accounts of travellers, concerning their religion, are various; and although it cannot be abſolutely affirmed that they have none, yet it muſt be confeſſed very difficult to define what it is. All agree that they acknowledge one Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme God, but do not adore him. They have not ſeen him, they do not know him, believing him to be too far exalted above them, and too happy in himſelf to be concerned about the trifling affairs of poor mortals. They ſeem alſo to believe in a future ſtate, and that after death they ſhall be removed to their friends who have gone before them, to an elyſium, or paradiſe.</p>
                  <p>The Wyandotts, near Detroit, and ſome others, have the Roman Catholic religion introduced amongſt them by miſſionaries. Theſe have a church, a miniſter, and a regular burying-ground. Many of them appear zealous, and ſay prayers in their families. Theſe, by acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with white people, are a little civilized, which muſt of neceſſity precede chriſtianity.</p>
                  <p>The Shawaneſe, Cherokees, Chickaſaws, and ſome others, are little concerned about ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or religion. Others continue their former ſuperſtitious worſhip of the objects of their love
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:018467_0103_0FA7A7BAA3434C48"/>
and fear, and eſpecially thoſe beings whom they moſt dread, and whom therefore we generally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominate devils; though, at the ſame time, it is allowed they pray to the ſun, and other infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior benevolent deities, for ſucceſs in their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings, for plenty of food, and other neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in life.</p>
                  <p>They have their feſtivals, and other rejoicing-days, on which they ſing and dance in a ring, taking hands, having ſo painted and diſguiſed themſelves, that it is difficult to know any of them; and after enjoying this diverſion for a while, they retire to the place where they have prepared a feaſt of fiſh, fleſh, fowls and fruits; to which all are invited, and entertained with their country ſongs. They believe that there is great virtue in feaſts for the ſick. For this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a young buck muſt be killed, and boiled, the friends and near neighbours of the patient invited, and having firſt thrown tobacco on the the fire, and covered it up cloſe, they all ſit down in a ring, and raiſe a lamentable cry. They then uncover the fire, and kindle it up; and the head of the buck is firſt ſent about, every one taking a bit, and giving a loud croak, in imitation of crows. They afterwards proceed to eat all the buck, making a moſt harmonious, melancholy ſong; in which ſtrain their muſic is particularly excellent.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="105" facs="unknown:018467_0104_0FA7A7BB66865DA0"/>As they approach their towns, when ſome of their people are loſt in war, they make great la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations for their dead, and bear them long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in remembrance.</p>
                  <p>Some nations abhor adultery, do not approve of a plurality of wives, and are not guilty of theft; but there are other tribes that are not ſo ſcrupulous in theſe matters. Amongſt the Chicka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaws a huſband may cut off the noſe of his wife, if guilty of adultery; but men are allowed greater liberty. This nation deſpiſes a thief. Among the Cherokees they cut off the noſe and ears of an adultereſs; afterwards her huſband gives her a diſcharge; and from this time ſhe is not permitted to refuſe any one who preſents himſelf. Fornication is unnoticed; for they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low perſons in a ſingle ſtate unbounded free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
                  <p>Their form of marriage is ſhort—the man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore witneſſes, gives the bride a deer's foot, and ſhe, in return, preſents him with an ear of corn, as emblems of their ſeveral duties.</p>
                  <p>The women are very ſlaves to the men; which is a common caſe in rude, unpoliſhed nations, throughout the world. They are charged with being revengeful; but this revenge is only doing themſelves juſtice on thoſe who injure them,
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:018467_0105_0FA7A7BF6226EB80"/>
and is ſeldom executed, but in caſes of murder and adultery.</p>
                  <p>Their king has no power to put any one to death by his own authority; but the murderer is generally delivered up to the friends of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed, to do as they pleaſe. When one kills a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, his friend kills him, and ſo they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue until much blood is ſhed; and at laſt, the quarrel is ended by mutual preſents. Their kings are hereditary, but their authority extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly limited. No people are a more ſtriking evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the miſeries of mankind in the want of government than they. Every chief, when of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, breaks off with a party, ſettles at ſome diſtance, and then commences hoſtilities againſt his own people. They are generally at war with each other. Theſe are common circumſtances amongſt the Indians.</p>
                  <p>When they take captives in war, they are exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly cruel, treating the unhappy priſoners in ſuch a manner, that death would be preferable to life. They afterwards give them plenty of food, load them with burdens, and when they arrive at their towns, they muſt run the gauntlet. In this, the ſavages exerciſe ſo much cruelty, that one would think it impoſſible they ſhould ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive their ſufferings. Many are killed; but if one outlives this trial, he is adopted into a family as a

               <head>THE CONCLUSION.</head>
               <p>HAVING finiſhed my intended narrative, I ſhall cloſe the appendix, with a few obſervations upon the happy circumſtances, that the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of Kentucke will probably enjoy, from the poſſeſſion of a country ſo extenſive and fertile.</p>
               <p>There are four natural qualities neceſſary to promote the happineſs of a country, viz. A good ſoil, air, water and trade. Theſe taken collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, excepting the latter, Kentucke poſſeſſes in a ſuperior degree: And, agreeable to our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the weſtern trade, we conclude, that it will be nearly equal to any other on the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent of America, and the diſadvantages it is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to, be fully compenſated by the fertility of the ſoil.</p>
               <p>This fertile region, abounding with all the lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uries of nature, ſtored with all the principal ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials for art and induſtry, inhabited by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and ingenious citizens, muſt univerſally attract the attention of mankind, being ſituated in the central part of the extenſive American em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:018467_0107_0FA7A7C0A5D695A0"/>
(the limits of whoſe ample domains, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in the ſecond article of the late Definitive Treaty, are ſubjoined) where agriculture, induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, laws, arts and ſciences, flouriſh; where afflicted humanity raiſes her drooping head; where ſprings a harveſt for the poor; where con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ceaſes to be a ſlave, and laws are no more than the ſecurity of happineſs; where nature makes reparation for having created man; and government, ſo long proſtituted to the moſt crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal purpoſes, eſtabliſhes an aſylum in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs for the diſtreſſed of mankind.</p>
               <p>The recital of your happineſs will call to your country all the unfortunate of the earth, who, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing experienced oppreſſion, political or religious, will there find a deliverance from their chains. To you innumerable multitudes will emigrate from the hateful regions of deſpotiſm and tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; and you will ſurely welcome them as friends, as brothers; you will welcome them to partake with you of your happineſs.—Let the memory of Lycurgus, the Spartan legiſlator who baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed covetouſneſs, and the love of gold from his country; the excellent Locke, who firſt taught the doctrine of toleration; the venerable Penn, the firſt who founded a city of brethren; and Waſhington, the defender and protector of perſecuted liberty, be ever the illuſtrious exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of your political conduct. Avail yourſelves
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:018467_0108_0FA7A7C1646517C8"/>
of the benefits of nature, and of the fruitful coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try you inhabit.</p>
               <p>Let the iron of your mines, the wool of your flocks, your flax and hemp, the ſkins of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage animals that wander in your woods, be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhioned into manufactures, and take an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary value from your hands. Then will you rival the ſuperfluities of Europe, and know that happineſs may be found, without the commerce ſo univerſally deſired by mankind.</p>
               <p>In your country, like the land of promiſe, flowing with milk and honey, a land of brooks of water, of fountains and depths, that ſpring out of valleys and hills, a land of wheat and barley, and all kinds of fruits, you ſhall eat bread without ſcarceneſs, and not lack any thing in it; where you are neither chilled with the cold of capricorn, nor ſcorched with the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heat of cancer; the mildneſs of your air ſo great, that you neither feel the effects of infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious fogs, nor peſtilential vapours. Thus, your country, favoured with the ſmiles of heaven, will probably be inhabited by the firſt people the world ever knew.</p>
