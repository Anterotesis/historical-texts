            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The Excellency of the Example now before you, conſiſts in two Things, PUBLICK SPIRIT and RELIGION.—Public Spirit, <hi>in ſerving his Generation,—and Religion, in doing</hi> this <hi>according to the Will of God,</hi> or, (as it might be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated,) ſerving <hi>the Will of God,</hi> in his own Generation. The Union of theſe two Qualities ever compoſes the truly good and uſeful Man; a proper Member of human Society; and even of the grand Community of Angels and Saints. The one includes a Temper and Conduct agreeable to our <hi>ſocial</hi> Connections; and the other a Temper and Conduct agreeable to our Obligation to the Author of our Nature. And ſo inſeparable are theſe united, that the one cannot exiſt, in the entire Abſence of the other. Public Spirit and Benevolence without Religion, is but a warm Affection for the Subjects, to the Neglect of their Sovereign; or a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:009101_0006_1031030E13B10018"/>for the Children, in Contempt of their Father, who is infinitely more worthy of Love. And Religion without Publick Spirit and Benevolence, is but a ſullen, ſelfiſh, ſour and malignant Humour for Devotion, unworthy that ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

His Royal Prerogative was but an Obligation to <hi>ſerve;</hi> and his Authority but a Power of doing more extenſive Good. Was he an able <hi>General,</hi> and a mighty <hi>Conqueror?</hi> He fought, he conqured, not to gratify the ſordid Paſſions of Avarice, Ambition, or private Revenge; but to deliver his Country, to guard his Subjects, to chaſtiſe and reſtrain the Diſturbers of Mankind, and to execute publick Vengeance upon public Malefactors.

<pb n="6" facs="unknown:009101_0007_1031030F9EDF7528"/>to the Church. His Muſe was a heavenly Seraph, teaching Mortals to celebrate the Praiſes of JEHOVAH in a Language above Humanity; and furniſhing a divine Syſtem of Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mody, moſt perfectly adapted to that Religious Diſpenſation under which he lived; and capable of being accommodated, by a natural and eaſy Variation, to the more improved State of the Goſpel-Church. Could his <hi>Prophetic</hi> Eyes penetrate into Futurity, beyond the Ken of human Knowledge, and pry into "the deep Things of God?" This alſo was conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated to the Service of his Generation, and not converted into Oſtentation, Amuſement or idle Curioſity. In ſhort, all his Talents, natural ond ſupernatural, were ſacred to the Church, to his Country and Mankind; thus becoming univerſal and diſtinguiſhed Bleſſings.</p>
            <p>THIS, my dear Pupils, this is the Spirit, with which I would inſpire you. A public Spirit always appeared to me of the utmoſt Importance, this you are ſenſible is not the firſt Occaſion on which I have endeavoured to fire your Breaſts with the generous Flame. Devoid of this, though ſtationed in the moſt publick Offices, your Lives will be of little Uſe to Community; and all the valuable Ends of a liberal Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, will be loſt upon you. But if you feel the generous Impulſes of a publick Spirit, you can never be altogether inſignificant, you will never be mere Cyphers in the World, even in the obſcureſt and moſt ſequeſtered Vale of Life. Even in the loweſt Station, you will be of ſome Uſe to Mankind, a ſufficient Recompence this for the ſevere Conflict of ſixty or ſeventy Years. It is unknown to me, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps to yourſelves, in what Employment you will ſpend your future Lives. But whatever it be, whether you appear in the ſacred Deſk, as the <hi>Miniſters of God,</hi> and devote your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to that Office, in which you can have no bright Proſpects of ſecular Advantages, but only the benevolent and God-like Pleaſure of endeavouring to make Men wiſe, good and happy; or whether you appear at the Bar, as Advocates for Juſtice, and the Patrons of the Oppreſt; or whether you practiſe the <hi>healing Art</hi> in the Chambers of Affliction, to alleviate the Pains and Sickneſſes of your Fellow-Creatures, to reſtore the Sweets of Health, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the dubious Duration of Life; or whether you chooſe the ſerene and quiet Pleaſures of Retirement, and glide through the World in a private Station; whatever, I ſay,

Serve your Generation. Live not for your ſelves, but the Publick. Be the Servants of the Church; the Servants of your Country; the Servants of all.

The eternal World indeed is all Life and Action; and that State of Reſt, which remains for the People of God, is not a State of more idle Fruition, or quiet Inaction. It is indeed a Reſt from the painful La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of this State of Diſcipline and Trial; tho' it not only admits, but neceſſarily includes, Action of a more exalted and pleaſing Nature; a vigorous and indefatigable Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of high Offices in the grand Community of the Univerſe; Offices of more Importance, and more extenſive Utility, than the feeble Sons of Mortality can ſuſtain. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but ſuch a State of benevolent Activity, can be a proper Heaven for vigorous Immortals, whoſe Powers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand perpetual Exertion; and without it, they would be painful and cumberſome, or lie dormant and inſenſible; both which would be inconſiſtent with their perfect Felicity. Yet this is no Reaſon why we ſhould reſerve our Uſefulneſs to another State; for Time and Eternity have each its proper Work; and the Buſineſs of the one, can be no more done in the other, than if it were a State of entire

Eternity has its Work too; but it is Work of a more exalted Kind, not adapted to the preſent infant State of our Exiſtence. If you remain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>active and uſeleſs in this Life, the Buſineſs of it can never be done. If you ſerve the World at all, it muſt be in <hi>your own</hi> Age. You will never be able to make up the Neglect, in another Age of Time, or in the endleſs Ages, of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Nay, if you continue uſeleſs in your own Age, you will continue ſo through all the Periods of your immortal Exiſtence, For you ſhould never forget, that Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to a State of more extenſive Uſefulneſs in the eternal World, is the Reward only of faithful Labourers in this. Oh! remember the Doom of the <hi>ſlothful Servant,</hi> whom his Maſter diſcharged for ever from his Service, and delivered up to the Tormentors.</p>
            <p>THE other Part of <hi>David</hi>'s Character, which I would propoſe to your Imitation, is his RELIGION. He ſerved his Generation <hi>by,</hi> or <hi>according to</hi> THE WILL OF GOD. <note n="‖" place="bottom">The original Word here, ſignifies rather the <hi>Counſel,</hi> than the <hi>Will of God.</hi> And if we thus tranſlate it, the Meaning is, Either that David ſerved his Generation, according to the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of God in raiſing him up: Or, that he accompliſhed the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of God concerning him, and performed his deſtined Work.</note>
               <hi>The Will of God,</hi> was the Rule of his Beneficence to Men; and he ſerved his Generation, becauſe in ſo doing he ſerved his God. Whatever he did, he did heartily, as unto the <hi>Lord,</hi> and not unto <hi>Men.</hi> 'Tis this Regard to the Will of God, in Acts of Humanity and Public-Spirit, that ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies them, and renders them true Virtue and Religion. Without ſuch a Regard to the divine Will, they form but a monſtrous, atheſtical Patriotiſm, and an un-creature-like irreligious Benevolence. Without this, all our good Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to Men, as they are not intended, ſo neither will they be accepted, as Acts of Obedience to God. Certainly, it muſt be the Height of Impiety, to be capable of doing even what God commands, not <hi>becauſe</hi> he commands it, but for ſome other ſordid, ſelfiſh Reaſon. The greateſt Streſs is laid upon this, in the refined Morality of the Goſpel. To receive a righteous Man, as a righteous Man; to receive a Prophet <hi>in the Name</hi> of a Prophet; to give fo much as a
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:009101_0012_10310323597F5BE8"/>Cup of cold Water, to the leaſt of Chriſt's Diſciples <hi>becauſe he belongs to Chriſt;..</hi>.this is at once an Act of Charity and Piety. But without ſuch a Regard to God, it is but a poor, grovelling, ſelfiſh Humanity; and has no more real Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in it, than the Inſtinctive Fondneſs of a Brute for its Young.</p>
            <p>THEREFORE, my young Friends, let Religion be the Source of your Benevolence and Publick-Spirit; and have a Regard to the Will of God, in all your good Offices to Men. Let it not be your principal End, to gratify a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Benevolence of Temper; to procure Honour to your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or to accompliſh ſome intereſted Deſign; but to PLEASE GOD. Let this be the Center, in which all the Actions of your Life ſhall terminate, and the Scope to which they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>end. Then you may claim a Character more noble than even that of a Patriot, I mean a CHRISTIAN.</p>
            <p>THIS Thought will appear in a ſtill ſtronger Light, if we follow the other Verſion of the Text.... <q>David, in his own Generation, having ſerved <hi>the Will of God</hi>
               </q>....not his <hi>own</hi> Will; not the Will of <hi>Man;</hi> but the Will of <hi>God.</hi> All his Services were done in Obedience to the Will of his heavenly Maſter. He did not aſſume the Direction of his Conduct, nor the Management of himſelf; but he was Servant to the Will of God; that was his abſolute Rule in all Things; to which he yielded an unreſerved univerſal Obedience.</p>
            <p>THIS alſo I propoſe for your Imitation in future Life, Be not ambitious of Self-Government, but reſign yourſelves to the Will of God. Serve his Will, and be the Miniſters of his Pleaſure. Whatever is agreeable to it, purſue with all your Might; and let even its gentleſt Prohibitions, give you an effectual Check, in your moſt eager Career. In ſhort, do the Will of God, and then you will do all that is noble, all that is good, all that is benevolent and uſeful. To be dependent upon the capricious Will of a Mortal, is a wretched State of Indigence, Servility and Anxiety But the Divine Will is the ſupreme unerring Rule of Right; and in obſerving it, you will certainly promote your own Happineſs, and the Good of the Syſtem to which you belong, in the moſt effectual Manner.</p>
            <p>To finiſh what I have to ſay to you at preſent on the Head of <hi>Religion,</hi> I muſt add, That tho' I addreſs you in
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:009101_0013_10310325306509C0"/>the <hi>exhortatory</hi> Form, and would <hi>perſuade</hi> you to exert your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, yet I would by no Means intimate, that the Forces of mere Nature, in their utmoſt Exertion, can produce in you that public Spirit and Piety I am recommending, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Agency of the <hi>Holy Spirit.</hi> 'Tis He that is the ſole Author of all that little Religion and true Virtue, that is to be found here and there in our World. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to Him you muſt look; on Him you muſt depend; yet ſtill in the Exertion of all your natural Powers, and in the earneſt Uſe of all inſtituted Means; for the Idle have no Reaſon to expect his Aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>I MUST add farther, that great Change of Temper, that Extirpation of the corrupt Principles of Nature, and that Implantation of holy and ſupernatural Principles of Action, which the Scriptures expreſs by ſuch ſtrong and ſignificant Metaphors as <hi>Regeneration,</hi> a <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> a <hi>new Creation,</hi> and the like; I ſay, that divine Change of the Principles of Action, is the great Foundation of true Religion and ſocial Virtue; without which, you can never arrive at the finiſhed Character of good and great Men. Though you ſhould make a ſhining Figure in Life, and dazzle the World with the Luſtre of your Name; your true Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> a truly great and good Man, can never be built upon that Foundation. It may admit of the external Decorations of a whited Wall; but it is incapable of any true ſubſtantial Goodneſs, till there be <q>a new Creation; till old Things paſs away, and all Things be made new.</q> You muſt be "created in Chriſt Jeſus to good Works," before you can "walk in them." "A new Heart muſt be given you, and a new Spirit put within you," before you can "walk in God's Statutes, and keep his Judgments, and do them. Therefore let this

               <hi>Advices</hi> and <hi>Warnings;</hi> tho' the Hurry of the preſent Hour, will but admit of ſome conciſe Hints, for your own Tho'ts to improve.</p>
            <p>Do not imagine, you may now put an End to your Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, as having arrived to the utmoſt Limits of uſeful Knowledge. A College-Education does only lay the Foundation; on which to build, muſt be the Buſineſs of your future Life. If you neglect this, even the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation however ſkilfully laid, will gradually moulder away. You will live your Age <hi>backward;</hi> and be leſs wiſe at Sixty, than at Twenty. Therefore, as you can redeem Leiſure from the Buſineſs of your future Station, diligently proſecute your Studies; eſpecially in thoſe Branches of Knowledge, which are moſt practical, and ſubſervient to your particular Profeſſion.</p>
            <p>Let me alſo adviſe you, in the Choice of your Stations for Life, to follow Nature, and conſult the public Good; and fix upon that which is moſt agreeable to your natural Turn, which in ſome Meaſure is equal to your Abilities, and may be moſt conducive to the Service of your Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If you miſtake in your Choice upon your firſt ſetting out, you will make an awkward Appearance during Life, and be of very little Uſe in the World.</p>
            <p>Allow me alſo to ſolicite the Continuance of that Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to this Inſtitution, to which you are obliged for your Education, and the Proſpect of your future Importance; and to hope that your Inclination will at leaſt equal your Opportunities to promote the Intereſt of your ALMA MA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TER. Be not however prompted by the jealous and malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Spirit of Rivalſhip, in Oppoſition to other literary In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions; but ſhew yourſelves catholic diſintereſted Friends of Learning in general.</p>
            <p>Finally, I adviſe you to enter into the wide World, which is now before you, forewarned of the Dangers and Temptations, in which you will ſoon be involved. You are about to enter into a State of dubious Conflict, where all your Virtue will be put to the Proof; and where Strength more than human, Strength from God, is abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to render you victorious. Farewell now to this peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Retirement; this happy Receſs from the Temptations of the World. Now you are to act your Part in a new Scene, to enter upon other Buſineſs, and to mingle in
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:009101_0018_10310333DF4D9C60"/>Company. And alas! you will find yourſelves ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with new unſuſpected Snares; which with all your Vigilance, you will hardly eſcap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>. Allow me therefore, with the Love and Solicitude of a Father's Heart, to caution you particularly againſt ſome of the Dangers, to which you will be moſt incident.</p>
            <p>I ſolemnly warn you againſt indulging a Taſte for youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Pleaſures, and giving yourſelves up to ſenſual Gratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. This has been the Ruin of many a promiſing young Creature; and it is your Intereſt to learn Wiſdom and Circumſpection from their melancholy Fate.</p>
            <p>I alſo ſolemnly warn you againſt forming pernicious Connections with bad Company. This is the greateſt Miſchief into which you can fall; and which will puſh you headlong into the fouleſt Vices. Therefore, above all Things, be upon your Guard in this Reſpect.</p>
            <p>I warn you againſt a Life of Idleneſs and Trifling, which will be injurious to your own Intereſt, as well as that of others; and render you troubleſome Superfluities in the World. "Be not ſlothful in Buſineſs;" but diligent and induſtrious, in whatever Station Providence may fix you—"I ſpeak not theſe Things to ſhame you: but as my beloved Sons, I warn you."</p>
            <p>And now, my ever-dear Pupils, I muſt diſmiſs you from my Care, into the wide World, to ſhift for yourſelves. You enter into it with the great Advantage of a fair Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; for I muſt do you the Juſtice to declare, that you have always been dutiful teachable Pupils to me; and this whole Houſe can atteſt the regularity of your general Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, ſince you have been Members of it. Go on in this Path; and may it ſhine more and more till the perfect Day!</p>
            <p>FAREWELL! my dear young Friends,—I collect all the affectionate Powers of my Soul into one vigorous Effort, and repeat the cordial FAREWELL!—"The Lord bleſs you, and keep you: The Lord make his Face ſhine upon you, and be gracious to you," that you may faithfully and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably ſerve your Generation by the Will of GOD, and then gently fall aſleep in JESUS, and enter into the Joys of your LORD.—Grant this, Moſt merciful GOD, for the Sake of JESUS CHRIST. AMEN.</p>
