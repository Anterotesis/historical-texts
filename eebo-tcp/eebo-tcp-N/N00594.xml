            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>THAT little part of the Earth which this Age has known by the Name of <hi>New-England,</hi> has been an object of very signal both <hi>Frowns</hi> and <hi>Favours</hi> of Heaven. Besides those <hi>Stars of the first Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,</hi> which did sometimes <hi>Shine</hi> and at last <hi>Set,</hi> in this Horizon, there have been several men of Renown, who were preparing and fully resolved to Transport themselves hither, had not the Lord seen Us Unworthy of more such Mercies. It is still fresh in the memory of many yet Living, that that great man Dr. <hi>John Owen,</hi> had given order for his passage in a Vessel bound for <hi>Boston;</hi> being invited to Succeed the other Famous <hi>Johns,</hi> who had been <hi>Burning and Shining Lights</hi> in that which was the first Candlestick, set up in this Populous Town; but a special Providence diverted him. Long before that, Dr. <hi>Ames</hi> (whose Family and whose Library <hi>New-England</hi>
                     <pb n="4" facs="unknown:000724_0004_0FAA446D244650E0"/>
has had) was upon the Wing, for this <hi>American Desert:</hi> but-God then took him to the <hi>Heavenly Canaan.</hi> Whether he left his fellow upon Earth I know not: such acuteness of <hi>Judgment,</hi> and affectionate <hi>Zeal,</hi> as he Excelled in, seldom does meet together in the same Person. I have often thought of Mr. <hi>Paul Bayne,</hi> his farewel words to Dr. <hi>Ames</hi> when going for <hi>Holland;</hi> Mr. <hi>Bayne</hi> perceiving him to be a man of Extraordinary parts, <hi>Beware</hi> (said he) <hi>of a Strong Head, and a Cold Heart.</hi> It is rare for a <hi>Scholastical Wit,</hi> to be joined with an <hi>Heart warm in Religion:</hi> But in him it was so. He has sometimes said, that he could be willing to walk Twelve Miles on his Feet, on condition he might have an Opportunity to <hi>Preach</hi> a Sermon: And he seldom did Preach a Sermon without <hi>Tears.</hi> When he lay on his Death-bed, he had such Tasts of the <hi>First Fruits of Glory,</hi> as that a Learned Physitian (who was a Papist) wondring, said, <hi>Num Protestantes sic solent mori:</hi> Is the Latter End of <hi>Protestants</hi> like this mans? But although some Excellent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, have, by a Divine hand been kept from coming into these <hi>Ends of the Earth,</hi> yet there have been others, who whilest Living made this <hi>Land</hi> (which before their Arrival was an <hi>Hell of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>) to be a place full of <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Glory:</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monst whom the <hi>Champions,</hi> whose <hi>Lives</hi> are here described, are worthy to be reckoned as those that have <hi>attained to the First Three.</hi>

                     <hi>Paulus Freherus,</hi> who has Published two Volumns in <hi>Folio,</hi> with the Title of, <hi>Theatrum virorum Eruditione clarorum, ad haec usque Tempora.</hi> He proceeds as far as the year 1680. The other is <hi>Henningus Witten,</hi> who has Written, <hi>Memoriae Theologorum nostri seculi.</hi> It is a <hi>Trite</hi> (yet a <hi>true</hi>) Assertion, that <hi>Historical Studies</hi> are both Profitable and Pleasant. And of all Historical Narratives, those which give a Faithful account of the <hi>Lives</hi> of Eminent Saints, must needs be the most Edifying. The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est part of the <hi>Sacred Writings</hi> are <hi>Historical;</hi> and a Considerable part of them is taken up in relating the Actions, Speeches, Exemplary <hi>Lives,</hi> and <hi>Deaths,</hi> of such as had been choice Instruments in the Hand of the Lord, to promote His Glory in

the World. No doubt but that the Commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the <hi>Remarkable Providences</hi> of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards His Servants, will be some part of their Work in Heaven for ever, that so He may have Eternal Praises for the Wonders of His Grace in Christ towards them.

                  <p>Mr. <hi>Wilson</hi> (like <hi>John</hi> the Apostle) did Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel in <hi>Love:</hi> and he was also strong in <hi>Faith.</hi> In the Time of the <hi>Pequod-War,</hi> he did not only hope, but had assurance, that God would make the English Victorious. He declared that he was, as certain of it, as if he had with his Eyes seen the Victories obtained<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which came to pass according to his Faith. I well remember, that I heard him once say, that when one of his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters was Sick, and given up as Dead, past re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, he desired Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> to Pray with that Child, and (said he) <hi>Whilest</hi> Mr. <hi>Cotton was Praying I was sure that Child should not then Dy but Live.</hi> That Daughter did Live to be the Mother of many Children; Two of which are now Useful Ministers of Christ: and She is still Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, a Pious Widow, another <hi>Anna, Serving God Day and Night.</hi> When Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> was called from the Church of <hi>Ipswich</hi> to <hi>Boston,</hi> Mr. <hi>Natha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nael Rogers</hi> (that Excellent man who was Son to the Famous Mr. <hi>Rogers</hi> of <hi>Dedham</hi> in <hi>Essex,</hi> and Pastor of the Church of <hi>Ipswich</hi> in <hi>N.

or Rhetorick or both, get Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> from them at last; Mr. <hi>Rogers</hi> replyed, That <hi>He was afraid of his Faith, more than his Arguments.</hi> Sometimes he was transported with a Prophetical <hi>Afflatus,</hi> of which there were marvellous Instances.

When he arose from his knees, he saw a <hi>Purse</hi> on the Chamber floor, which was full of <hi>Gold,</hi> by which he could make his Keeper better natured than he had been. Many such passages, could that good man relate.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Norton,</hi> was one whose Memory I must acknowledge, I have peculiar cause to Love and Honour. I was his Pupil several years. He had

But I must now Observe unto my Reader, That more than a Score of years after the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the <hi>Age</hi> which is now expiring, our Lord Jesus Christ, With a Thousand Wonders of His Providence, carried into an <hi>American</hi> Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness, a People, Persecuted for their Desire, to See, and Seek a REFORMATION of the Church ACCORDING TO THE SCRIP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TURE: Of which Matter, it cannot give a <hi>Briefer,</hi> and yet <hi>Fuller,</hi> History, than by Reciting the Memorable Words, of that Great Man, Dr. JOHN OWEN, Who, in his Golden Book of, <hi>Communion with God,</hi> thus Expresses it; <q>They who hold <hi>Communion</hi> with the Lord Jesus Christ, will Admit <hi>Nothing,</hi> Practise <hi>Nothing,</hi> in the Worship of God, but what they have <hi>His</hi> War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for; Unless it comes in His Name, With a, <hi>Thus saith the Lord Jesus,</hi> they will not Hear an <hi>Angel from Heaven:</hi> They know, the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles</hi> themselves were to teach the Saints, only <hi>What He Commanded them:</hi> And <hi>You</hi> know, How many in this Very Nation, in the Dayes not long since passed, Yea, how many <hi>Thousands,</hi> Left their <hi>Native Soyl,</hi> and went into a Vast and howling <hi>Wilderness,</hi> in the uttermost parts of the World, to keep their Souls Undefiled, and Chast unto their dear Lord Jesus, as to <hi>This</hi> of His Worship and Institutions.</q> Now though the <hi>Reformed Church,</hi> thus <hi>Fled into the Wilderness,</hi> Enjoy'd not the Miraculous <hi>Pillar</hi>

and Salvations, of the Churches in my Country, from Corruption, and Oblivion; and <hi>Assist</hi> the Interests of <hi>Religion</hi> in the Churches abroad, with the <hi>Experiences</hi> of a Renowned Plantation, Settled in a NEW WORLD, Purely for the sake of the most <hi>Reformed Religion;</hi> I set my self to Write the <hi>Church-History</hi> of these <hi>American</hi> Colonies.

                  <p>§. 2. There was a good <hi>Heraldry</hi> in that speech of the Noble <hi>Romanus, It is not the Blood of my Progenitors, but my Christian Profession that makes me Noble.</hi> But our <hi>John Cotton,</hi> besides the Advantage of his <hi>Christian Profession,</hi> had a Descent from Honourable <hi>Progenitors,</hi> to render him <hi>dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly</hi> Honourable.

<pb n="3" facs="unknown:000724_0035_0FAA448CF3D44B98"/>
by some Injustice, Deprived of Great Revenues, his Father Mr. <hi>Roland Cotton,</hi> had the Education of a <hi>Lawyer</hi> bestowed by his Friends upon him, in hopes of his being the better capacitated there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to Recover the Estate, whereof his Family had been wronged; and so the Profession of a <hi>Lawyer,</hi> was that unto which this Gentleman ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied himself all his Dayes. But our <hi>John Cotton,</hi> in this Happier than <hi>Austin,</hi> whose <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> was carefuller to make an <hi>Orator</hi> than a <hi>Christian</hi> of him, while his Gracious <hi>Mother</hi> was making him on greater <hi>Accounts, A Son of her ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Tears,</hi> had a very pious <hi>Father</hi> in this worthy, <hi>Lawyer,</hi> as well as a pious <hi>Mother,</hi> to Interest him in the <hi>Covenant</hi> of God. That worthy man was indeed very singular in two most Imitable <hi>Practices.</hi> One was, that when any of his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours desirous to Sue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> one another, addressed him for <hi>Counsel,</hi> it was his manner, in the most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasive and obliging terms that could be, to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour a <hi>Reconciliation</hi> between both parties; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring the <hi>Consolations</hi> of a <hi>Peace-maker,</hi> before all the <hi>Fees,</hi> that he might have got by Blowing up of <hi>Differences.</hi> Another was, that every <hi>Night,</hi> it was his Custome to <hi>Examine Himself,</hi> with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections on the Transactions of the Day past; wherein, if he found, that he had not either, <hi>Done</hi> good unto others, or <hi>Got</hi> good unto his own Soul, he would be as much grieved as ever the Famous <hi>Titus</hi> was, when he could complain in

                  <p>§. 3. The Religious Parents of Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> were Solicitous to have him indued with a <hi>Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> as well as a <hi>Pious</hi> Education; and being nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther so <hi>Rich,</hi> that the <hi>Mater Artis,</hi> could have no Room to do her part, nor so <hi>Poor</hi> that the <hi>Res Augusta D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Blessing,</hi> made him a <hi>Rich Scholar;</hi> and his Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous mind found no little <hi>Nourishment</hi> by that <hi>Labour,</hi> which like the Sage Philosopher, he found <hi>Sweeter than any Idleness:</hi> insomuch that his being Elected Fellow of <hi>Trinity Colledge,</hi> as the Reward of his Quick-Proficiency, was Diverted by no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but this, that the Extraordinary Charges for their Great <hi>Hall</hi> then in Building, did put by their <hi>Election.</hi> And there was this Remarkable in the Education of this <hi>Chosen Vessel,</hi> at the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity: That while he continued <hi>there,</hi> his Father's Practice was, by the special Providence of God, augmented so much beyond what it had been <hi>before,</hi> as was enough to mentain him there: Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which Observation Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> afterwards would say, <hi>'Twas God that kept me at the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity!</hi> Indeed some have said, That the Great Notice quickly taken of the Eminency in the <hi>Son,</hi> was one Reason, why his <hi>Father,</hi> not only came to be complemented on all sides, and <hi>Omnes Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia Bona dicere, &amp; laudare Fortunas ejus, qui Filium haberet Tali Ingenio praeditum,</hi> but also had his <hi>Clients</hi> more than a little multiplied.</p>
                  <p>§. 4. Upon the Desires of <hi>Emanuel</hi>-Colledge, Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> was not only <hi>Removed</hi> unto that Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, but also <hi>Preferred</hi> unto a <hi>Fellowship</hi> in it; in order whereunto, he did according to the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical and Laudable <hi>Statutes</hi> of the House, go through a very severe <hi>Examen</hi> of his Fitness for
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:000724_0038_0FAA4491DE23F140"/>
such a Station; wherein 'twas particularly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked, that the <hi>Poser</hi> trying his <hi>Hebrew</hi>-skill by the Third Chapter of <hi>Isaiah,</hi> a Chapter which, containing more Hard Words, than any one <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph</hi> of the Bible, might therefore have puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zled a very good Hebrician, yet <hi>he</hi> made nothing of it. He was afterwards, the <hi>Head Lecturer,</hi> the <hi>Dean,</hi> the <hi>Catechist,</hi> in that Famous Colledge; and became a <hi>Tutor</hi> to many Scholars, who after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards proved Famous Persons, and had cause to Bless God, for the Faithful, and Ingenious and Laborious <hi>Communicativeness</hi> of this their <hi>Tutor. Here,</hi> all his Academical Exercises, whether in <hi>Disputations</hi> or in <hi>Common-places,</hi> or whatever else, did so <hi>smell of the, Lamp,</hi> that the Wit, the Strength, the Gravity, and the Fulness, both of <hi>Reason</hi> and of <hi>Reading</hi> in them, caused him to be much Admired by the Sparkling Wits of the University. But <hi>One</hi> thing among the Rest, which caused a Great Notice to be taken of him, throughout the whole University, was his <hi>Funeral Oration</hi> upon Dr. <hi>Some,</hi> the Master of <hi>Peter House,</hi> wherein he approved himself such a Master of <hi>Periclaean,</hi> or <hi>Ciceronian</hi> Oratory, that the Auditors were even ready to have Acclamed, <hi>Now Vox Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minem Sonat!</hi> And that which added unto the Reputation, thus Raised for him, was, an <hi>Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity-Sermon,</hi> wherein Aiming more to Preach <hi>Self,</hi> than <hi>Christ,</hi> he used such Florid Strains, as extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Recommended him, unto <hi>the most,</hi> who Relished

the <hi>Wisdom of words</hi> above the <hi>Words of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:</hi> though the Pompous Eloquence of that Sermon, afterwards gave such a Distast unto his own <hi>Renewed Soul,</hi> that with a Sacred Indignation he threw his Notes into the Fire.</p>
                  <p>§. 5. Hitherto we have seen the <hi>Life</hi> of Mr.<hi>Cotton,</hi> while he was not yet <hi>Alive!</hi> Though the Restraining and Preventing <hi>Grace</hi> of God, had kept him from such Out-breakings of Sin, as Defile the Lives of most in the World, yet like the <hi>Old man,</hi> who for such a cause ordered this Epitaph to he Written on his Grave, <hi>Here lyes an Old Man, who lived but Seven years,</hi> he Reckoned himself to have been but a <hi>Dead Man,</hi> as being <hi>Alienated from the Life of God,</hi> until he had Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced that <hi>Regeneration,</hi> in his own Soul, which was <hi>thus</hi> Accomplished. The Holy Spirit of God had been at work upon his <hi>Young Heart,</hi> by the Ministry of that Reverend and Renowned <hi>Preacher of Righteousness,</hi> Mr. <hi>Perkins;</hi> but he Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted and Smothered those <hi>Convictions,</hi> through a vain <hi>Perswasion,</hi> that if he became a <hi>Godly</hi> Man 'twould spoil him for being a <hi>Learned</hi> One.

On the other side, he consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, That it was his Duty to Preach with such a <hi>Plainness,</hi> as became the <hi>Oracles</hi> of God, which are intended for the Conduct of men in the <hi>Pathes of Life,</hi> and not for <hi>Theatrical</hi> Ostentations and Entertainments, and the Lord needed not any <hi>Sin</hi> of ours to mentain His own Glory. Hereupon Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> Resolved that he would Preach a <hi>Plain Sermon,</hi> even such a Sermon, as, in his own Conscience, he thought would be most pleasing unto the Lord Jesus Christ; And he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed Practically and Powerfully, but very so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidly upon the <hi>Plain</hi> Doctrine of <hi>Repentance.</hi> The Vain Wits of the University, Disappointed thus, with a <hi>more Excellent</hi> Sermon, that shot some Troublesome Admonitions into their Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, discovered their Vexation at this Disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by their not <hi>Humming,</hi> as according to

§. 7. The Well-disposed People of <hi>Boston</hi> in <hi>Lincolnshire,</hi> after this, Invited Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come their Minister; with which Invitation, out of a Sincere and Serious Desire to Serve our Lord in His Gospel, after the Solemnest Addres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to Heaven for Guidance in such a Solemn Affair, he complied. At this Time, the <hi>Mayor</hi> of the Town, with a more Corrupt Partie, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing procured another Scholar from <hi>Cambridge,</hi> more agreeable to them, would needs have him to Preach before Mr. <hi>Cotton:</hi> but the <hi>Church-Warden</hi> pretending to more of Influence, upon their Ecclesiastical matters, over-ruled it. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever when the matter came to a <hi>Vote,</hi> amongst those to whom the Right of Election did by Charter belong, there was an <hi>Equi-Vote</hi> for Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> and that other Person; Only the <hi>Mayor,</hi> who had the Casting-Vote, by a strange Mistake pricked for Mr. <hi>Cotton.</hi> When the <hi>Mayor</hi> saw his Mistake, a <hi>New-Vote</hi> was urged and granted; wherein it again proved an <hi>Equi-Vote;</hi> but the <hi>Mayor</hi> most unaccountably mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke again, as he did before. Extremely Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleas'd here at, he pressed for a <hi>Third Vote;</hi> but the Rest would not Consent unto it; and so the Election fell upon Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> by the <hi>Involuntary Cast</hi> of that very Hand, which had most oppos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it. This Obstruction to the Settlement of Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> in <hi>Boston,</hi> being thus Conquered, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther follow'd; For the Bishop of the <hi>Diocess,</hi>
                     <pb n="12" facs="unknown:000724_0044_0FAA44971ED762C0"/>
having understood that Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> was infected with <hi>Puritanism,</hi> set himself immediatly to Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage his being there; only he could Object nothing but, <hi>That</hi> Mr. Cotton, <hi>being a Young man, he was not so fit upon that Score, to be over such a Numerous and such a Factious People.</hi> And Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> having Learned no otherwise to value himself, than to Concur with the Apprehensions of the <hi>Bishop;</hi> intended, therefore, to Return unto <hi>Cambridge:</hi> But some of his Friends, against his Inclination, knowing the <hi>True way of doing it;</hi> soon charmed the <hi>Bishop,</hi> into a Declared O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion; that Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> was an Honest, and a Learned Man. Thus the Admission of Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> unto the Exercise of his Ministry in <hi>Boston,</hi> was Accomplished.</p>
                  <p>§. 8. Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> found the more <hi>Peaceable</hi> Reception among the People, through his own want of Internal <hi>Peace;</hi> and because his continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Exercises, from his <hi>Internal</hi> Temptations and Afflictions, made all People see, that instead o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </hi> so it was, that Mr. Dr. <hi>Baron,</hi> Son of Dr. <hi>Baron,</hi> (the Divinity Reader of <hi>Cambridge</hi>) first broach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

that which was, then, called <hi>Lutheranism;</hi> since <hi>Arminianism:</hi> as being indeed himself, Learned, Acute, Plausible in Discourse, and fit to Insinuate into the Hearts of his Neighbours. And though he were a <hi>Physitian</hi> by Profession (and of a good skill in that Art) yet he spent the greatest Strength of his Studies, in clearing and promoting the <hi>Arminian</hi> Tenents. Whence it came to pass, that in all the great <hi>Feasts</hi> of the Town, the chiefest-Discourse at the Table, did ordinarily fall upon <hi>Arminian</hi> Points, to the Great Offence of Godly Ministers, both in <hi>Boston,</hi> and Neighbour-Towns. I coming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, a <hi>Young man,</hi> thought it a part both of Modesty and Prudence, not to speak much to the Points, at first, among Strangers and Antients: Untill afterwards, after hearing of many Discourses, in Publick Meetings, and much Private Discourse with the Doctor, I had Learned at length, where all the great <hi>Strength</hi> of the Doctor <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

inasmuch as he had been Guilty of <hi>Non-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity,</hi> and <hi>Puritanism,</hi> the Crime was unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable; and therefore, said he, <hi>You must Fly for your Safety!</hi> Doubtless, it was from such unhappy <hi>Experiments,</hi> that Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> afterwards Published this Complaint; <hi>The Ecclesiastical Courts are like the Courts of the High Priests and Pharisees, which</hi> Solomon <hi>by a Spirit of Prophecy Styleth,</hi> Dens of Lyons, and Mountains of Leopards. <hi>And those who have to do with them, have found them Markets of the Sins of the People, the Cages of Uncleanness, the Forges of Extortion, the Tabler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles of Bribery, and they have been contrary to the End of Civil Government, which is,</hi> The <hi>Punishment</hi> of Evil Doers, and the <hi>Praise</hi> of them which do well.</p>

There were Diverse <hi>Churches</hi> Gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Country, before the Arrival of Mr. <hi>Cotton;</hi> but upon <hi>his</hi> Arrival, the Points of <hi>Church-Order,</hi> were with more of Exactness Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived, and Received in them, and <hi>further</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in such as were gathered after them. He found the whole Country in a perplexed, and a Divided Estate, as to their <hi>Civil Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,</hi> but at the Publick Desires, Preaching a Sermon on those Words Hag. 2. 4. <hi>Be Strong, O Zerubbabel, saith the Lord; and be Strong, O Joshua, son of Josedech the High Priest; and be Strong all ye People of the Land, saith the Lord, and Work; for I am with you, saith the Lord of Hosts.</hi>

The Good <hi>Spirit</hi> of God by that Sermon had a mighty Influence, upon all Ranks of men, in the <hi>Infant-Plantation;</hi> who from this time, carried on their Affairs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with a New-Life, Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and Unanimity. It was then, requested of Mr. <hi>Cotton;</hi> that he would, from the <hi>Laws,</hi> where-with God Governed His Ancient People, form an <hi>Abstract</hi> of such as were of a Moral and a Lasting <hi>Equity;</hi> which he performed, as Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptably; as Judiciously. But inasmuch as very much or an <hi>Athenian Demacracy,</hi> was in the Mould of the <hi>Government,</hi> by the <hi>Royal Charter,</hi> which was then Acted upon, Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> Effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally recommended it unto them, that none should be <hi>Electors</hi> nor <hi>Elected</hi> therein, except such as were <hi>Visible Subjects</hi> of our Lord Jesus Christ; personally <hi>Confederated</hi> in our Churches. In these, and many other ways, he Propounded unto them, an Endeavour after a <hi>Theocracy,</hi> as near, as might be, to that which was the Glory of <hi>Israel,</hi> the <hi>Peculiar People.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Ecclesiastical Constitution</hi> of the Country, was that on which, he Employ'd his Peculiar Cares; and he was one of those <hi>Olive Trees,</hi> which afforded a Singular measure of <hi>Oyl,</hi> for the Illumination of our <hi>Sanctuary.</hi> Now that the World may know the <hi>First Principles</hi> of <hi>New-England,</hi> it must be known, That until the <hi>Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form of Church Discipline,</hi> Published by a <hi>Synod</hi> in the year 1648 and Composed (chiefly) by

§. 21. <hi>The Churches now had Rest, and were Edified;</hi> and <hi>there were daily added unto the Churches, those that were to be Saved.</hi> Now, though the poor People were fed with <hi>the Bread of Adversity, and the Water of Affliction,</hi> yet they counted themselves abundantly compensated by This, That <hi>their Eyes might see such Teachers,</hi> as were now to be seen among them.

certain Scandalous Writer, having Publickly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> with his former Inclination to <hi>Remove,</hi> there was thereby provoked his Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and Patient Answer; which being a Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary Narrative of this whole Business, I shall here transcribe it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>There was a Generation of <hi>Familists,</hi> in our own and other Towns, who under Pretence of Holding forth, what I had taught, Touching <hi>Union</hi> with Christ, and <hi>Evidencing</hi> that Union, did Secretly vent Sundry and Dangerous Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and Heresies, denying all <hi>Inherent Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,</hi> and all Evidencing of a <hi>Good Estate</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by in any sort, and some of them also Deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>the Immortality of the Soul,</hi> and <hi>the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Body.</hi> When they were question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by some Brethren about those things, they carried it, as if they had Held forth nothing, but what they had Received from <hi>me:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, when I was Advised, to cleer my self, I Publickly Preached against those Errors. Then, said the Brethren to the Erring Party, <hi>See, Your Teacher declares himself cleerly to differ from you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> No matter</hi> (say the other) <hi>what he saith in Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, we understand him otherwise, and we know what he saith to us in Private.</hi> Yea, and I my self could not easily Believe that those Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Brethren and Sisters, were so Corrupt in their Judgments as they were Reported; they seeming to me forward Christians, and utterly

Denying any such Tenants, or any thing else but what they received from my self.

Which I discerning, it wrought in <hi>me,</hi> thoughts (as it did in many other sincerely Godly Brethren of our Church) not of a <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration</hi> from the Churches, but of a <hi>Removal</hi> to <hi>Newhaven,</hi> as being better known to the Pastor, and some others <hi>there,</hi> than to such as were, at that time Jealouse of me <hi>here.</hi> The true Ground whereof was an <hi>Inward Loathness to be Troublesome unto Godly Minds,</hi> and a Fear of the Unprofitableness of my <hi>Ministry</hi> there, where my <hi>way</hi> was suspected to be Doubtful and Dangerous. I chose therefore rather to meditate a <hi>Silent Departure,</hi> in Peace, than by Tarrying here, to make way for the Breaking forth of <hi>Temptations.</hi> But when, at the <hi>Synod,</hi> I had discovered the Corruption of the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Erring Brethren,</hi> and saw their Fraudulent pretence of Holding forth no other, but what they received from <hi>me</hi> (when as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they pleaded for Gross Errors contrary un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>my</hi> Judgment) I thereupon did bear Witness against them; and when in a private Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with some Chief <hi>Magistrates,</hi> and <hi>Elders,</hi> I perceived, that my Removal upon such Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences was Unwelcome to them, and that such

Tang, Reader, 'Twas none of Mr. <hi>Cottons;</hi> Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> was Troubled when he saw such a Passage, in an Imperfect Copy of his Writings, exposed unto the World, under his <hi>Name,</hi> against his <hi>Will:</hi> and he took an Opportunity, in the most Publick manner, to Declare as much unto the World. He was also sometimes put upon Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing yet more <hi>Polemically.</hi> Indeed there was one Occasion of so Writing, which he Declined med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling withal; and that was this. Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> having in his Younger years, Written to a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Friend some Things, tending (at his Desire) to Clear the Doctrine of <hi>Reprobation,</hi> from the Exceptions of the <hi>Arminians;</hi> and this Manus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cript falling into Dr. <hi>Twiss's</hi> Hand, that Learned man Published it, with his own Confutation of certain Passages in i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, which did not agree so well with the Doctor's own <hi>Supralapsarian Scheme.</hi> Now, when Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> saw himself Reviled for this Cause by <hi>Baily,</hi> as being a <hi>Pelagian,</hi> he only made this meek Reply; <hi>I hope God will give me Opportunity e're long to Consider of this, the Doctors Labour of Love. I Bless the Lord, who has taught me to be willing to be Taught, of a far meaner Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criple, than such a Doctor, whose Scholastical Acuteness, Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

Only I desire I may not be Condemned as a Pelagian or Arminian before I he heard.</hi> Moreover, Mr. <hi>Cawdry</hi> fell hard upon him; to whom he prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red an Answer, which was afterwards Published and Seconded by Dr. <hi>Owen.</hi> But besides these, he was twice compelled unto some other <hi>Eristical</hi> Writings: Once in <hi>Answer</hi> to <hi>Baily;</hi> another time in <hi>Answer</hi> to <hi>Williams:</hi> In both of which, like <hi>Job,</hi> he <hi>Turned the Books, which his Adversaries had written against him, into a Crown.</hi> I believe, never any meer Man, under such open and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Injuries as these two <hi>Reporters</hi> heaped upon Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> did <hi>Answer</hi> with more Christian <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience;</hi> his <hi>Answer</hi> are indeed a Pattern for all <hi>Answerers</hi> to the World's End. But it was par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly remarkable, that, in this matter, certain Persons, who had fallen under the <hi>Censures</hi> of the Civil Authority in the Country, Singled out Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> for the Object of their Displeasure, although <hi>he</hi> had, <hi>most, of all men,</hi> declined Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>esting himself in the Actions of the Magistrate, and had also done <hi>more than all men</hi> to obtain Healing and Favour for those ungrateful Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents.

If you <hi>Do,</hi> The <hi>Keeper of Israel, who neither Slumbereth nor Sleepeth,</hi> will not Take it well at your Hands.

This I speak <hi>as a Poor Prophet of the Lord, according to the Word of His Grace now Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us!</hi> But in the Second Place, whereas ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of our Brethren are Going to <hi>England,</hi> Let me Direct a Word unto <hi>Them</hi> also.

                  <p>The Gathering of the <hi>Second Church</hi> in <hi>Boston,</hi> was evidently very much to the Disadvantage of Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> in many of his Interests.

and therefore, with an Exemplary <hi>Self-Denial,</hi> Divesting himself of all carnal Respects, he set himself to Encourage the Foundation of that <hi>Church,</hi> out of Respect unto the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and Worship of our <hi>Common Lord.</hi> Now, it has Pleased the Lord so to Order it, That many years after his Decease, that <hi>Self Denial</hi> of His Holy Servant, has turned unto some Account, in the Opportunities which <hi>That very Church</hi> has given unto <hi>His</hi> Children, to Glorify the Lord Jesus Christ, in the Conduct of it: His Son in Law has been for more than <hi>Thrice Ten</hi> Years, and his Grandson for more than <hi>Twice Seven</hi> Years, the Ministers of the Gospel, in <hi>That very Church,</hi> accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated with Happy Opportunities, <hi>To Serve that Generation.</hi>

                  <head>THE LIFE OF Mr. JOHN NORTON.</head>
                  <p>§. 1. THERE was a Famous JOHN whose <hi>Atchievements</hi> are by our Lord <hi>Emblazoned</hi> in those Terms; <hi>He was a Burning and a Shining Light.</hi> In the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> of Old, erected by the Order and for the Worship, of God, there were those Two Things, A <hi>Candlestick,</hi> and an <hi>Altar;</hi> in the One a <hi>Light,</hi> that might never Go out, in the Other a <hi>Fire,</hi> that might never be Extinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and yet such an Affinity between these that there was a <hi>Fire</hi> in the <hi>Light</hi> of the One, and a <hi>Light</hi> in the <hi>Fire</hi> of the other. Such a Mixture of both <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> should be in Those, that
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:000724_0114_0FAA4752695DDFD0"/>
are employed about the Service of the <hi>Tabernacle:</hi> And though the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> erected for our Lord in this Wilderness, had many such <hi>Burning and Shining Lights;</hi> vet among the <hi>Chief</hi> of them is to be Reckoned, that <hi>JOHN</hi> which we had in our Blessed NORTON.</p>
                  <p>§. 2. He was Born, the Sixth of <hi>May</hi> 1605. at <hi>Starford</hi> in <hi>Hartfordshire;</hi> descended of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Ancestors. In his Early Childhood he discovered a Ripeness of Wit, which gave just Hopes of his proving <hi>Extraordinary:</hi> and under Mr. <hi>Strange</hi> in the School of <hi>Bunningford,</hi> he made <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> a Proficiency, that he could betimes Write Good <hi>Latin,</hi> with a more than common Elegancie and Invention. At <hi>Fourteen</hi> years of Age, being sent unto <hi>Peter-house,</hi> he staid there, till after his taking of his <hi>First Degree;</hi> where a <hi>Romish</hi> Emissary, taking a curious and exact Observation of his Notable Accomplishments, used all the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods he could think of, to have seduced him over unto the <hi>Romish</hi> Irreligion: but God intending him to be a <hi>Pillar</hi> in His own <hi>Temple,</hi> Mercifully pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented his Hearkening unto any Temptations to become a <hi>Support</hi> unto the Tower of <hi>Babel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§. 3. In his <hi>Youth,</hi> he was Accustomed unto some <hi>Youthful Vanities;</hi> especially unto <hi>Card-Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> an Evil which he did first <hi>Ponder</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form</hi> upon a Serious Admonition, which a <hi>Servant</hi> of his Father's gave unto him. When he came to Consider that a <hi>Lot,</hi> is a <hi>Solemn Appeal</hi> unto the
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:000724_0115_0FAA475512CBDBF0"/>
God of Heaven, and even by the Rudest Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles counted a <hi>Sacred Thing,</hi> he thought that <hi>Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> with it, was a Breach of the <hi>Third Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> in the Laws of our God; It should be used, he thought, rather <hi>Prayerfully,</hi> than <hi>Sportfully.</hi> He considered, that the <hi>Papists</hi> themselves do not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low these <hi>Games</hi> in <hi>Ecclesiastical Persons,</hi> and the <hi>Fathers</hi> do Reprove them with a Vehement Zeal in <hi>all sorts of Persons.</hi> He considered, that when the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire became a <hi>Christian,</hi> severe <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts</hi> were made against these <hi>Games,</hi> and that our Protestant <hi>Reformers</hi> have Branded them with an Infamous Character; Wherefore Inclining now to follow <hi>Whatsoever Things are of a Good Report,</hi> he would no longer meddle with <hi>Games</hi> that had so much of a <hi>Scandal</hi> in them.</p>
                  <p>§. 4. An Extreme Disaster befalling his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Estate, he left the <hi>University;</hi> and became at once <hi>Usher</hi> to the School, and <hi>Curate</hi> in the Church, at <hi>Starford:</hi> Where a <hi>Lecture</hi> being men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by a Combination of several Godly and Able Ministers, he, on that Occasion, fell into Acquaintance with several of them; especially Mr. <hi>Jeremiah Dyke</hi> of <hi>Epping,</hi> by whose Ministery the Holy Spirit of God, gave him a Discovery of his own Manifold Sinfulness and Wretchedness in an <hi>Unregenerate State,</hi> and Awakened him unto such a <hi>Self-Examination,</hi> as Drove him to a <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row</hi> little short of <hi>Despair:</hi> but after some, time,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:000724_0116_0FAA4755F75C0328"/>
the same Holy Spirit, enabled him to Receive the <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>Grace,</hi> tendered in the <hi>Promises of</hi> the <hi>Gospel,</hi> with an <hi>Unspeakable Consolation.</hi> Where upon he thought himself concerned in that Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of Heaven, <hi>When thou art Converted, Strengthen thy Brethren!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§. 5. Having before This, been well Studi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the <hi>Tongues</hi> and <hi>Arts,</hi> he was the better fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the Higher Studies of <hi>Divinity;</hi> whereto he now wholly Addicted himself: And being in his own Happy Experience Acquainted with <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Repentance,</hi> and <hi>Holiness,</hi> he did from that Experience now make <hi>Lively Sermons</hi> on those points unto his Hearers. He soon grew Eminent in his Ministry; setting off the Truths he Deliver'd, not only with such <hi>Ornaments</hi> of <hi>Laconic</hi> and Well contrived Expression, as made him worthy to be called, <hi>The Master of Sentences,</hi> but also with such <hi>Experimental Passages</hi> of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as made him Admired, for <hi>A Preacher seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out Acceptable Words.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§. 6. His Accomplishments Render'd him, as capable of <hi>Preferments,</hi> as most in his Age; but <hi>Preferments</hi> were then so Glogg'd, with Trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some and Scruplesome <hi>Impositions,</hi> that Mr. <hi>Norton,</hi> as well as other Conscientious Young Ministers, his Contemporaries, declined medling with them His <hi>Aversion,</hi> and indeed <hi>Antipathy,</hi> to <hi>Arminianism,</hi> and his Dislike of the <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> particularly hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:000724_0117_0FAA47577AF05160"/>
him from a Considerable Benefice, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Unkle might have helped him. Dr. <hi>Sibs</hi> also, the Master of <hi>Katharine Hall</hi> in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> taken with his Abilities, did earnestly Sollicite him, to have Accepted of a <hi>Fellowship</hi> in that, Colledge; but his Conscience being now Satisfied in the <hi>Unlawfulness</hi> of some Things then Requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Order thereunto, would not permit him to do it. Wherefore he contented himself with a more Private Life, as Chaplain in a Knights House at <hi>High-Laver</hi> in <hi>Essex,</hi> namely Sir <hi>William Masham's;</hi> there waiting, till God might furnish, him with <hi>Unexceptionable Opportunities,</hi> for his more Publick Preaching of the Gospel. But ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, all those who had any Tast of his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, had a very high Opinion of it; nor was there any man in that part of the Country more esteemed than <hi>he</hi> was, for all sorts of Excellencies; insomuch, that when he came away, an Ancient Minister said, <hi>He Believed there was not more Grace and Holiness left in all</hi> Essex, <hi>than what</hi> Mr. Norton, <hi>had carried with him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§. 7. His Natural Temper had a Tincture of <hi>Choler</hi> in it; but as the Sowrest and Harshest <hi>Fruits</hi> become the most <hi>Pleasant,</hi> when tempered with a due Proportion of <hi>Sweetness</hi> added there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, so the <hi>Grace</hi> of God <hi>Sweetned</hi> the Dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Good Man, into a most Affable, Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and Complaisant Behaviour, which render'd
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:000724_0118_0FAA47585DABB7E8"/>
him exceeding <hi>Amiable.</hi> Indeed when the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle speaks of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body,</hi> being <hi>Sanctified,</hi> some do by <hi>Spirit</hi> Understand the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural <hi>Temper,</hi> or <hi>Humour;</hi> and accordingly the <hi>Spirit</hi> of this <hi>Quick</hi> Man being <hi>Sanctified,</hi> he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a Man of an <hi>Excellent Spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§. 8. Vast was the Treasure of <hi>Learning</hi> in this Reverend Man. He was not only a most Accurate <hi>Grammarian,</hi> which is abundantly mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested by his Printed Works in Diverse Languages; but an Universal <hi>Scholar:</hi> nevertheless, 'twas as a <hi>School man</hi> that he show'd himself the most of a <hi>Scholar.</hi> He accounted that the Excellency of a <hi>Scholar,</hi> lay more in <hi>Distinctness of Judgment,</hi> than in <hi>Elegancy</hi> of <hi>Language;</hi> and therefore, though he had a neater Style than most other men, yet he was Desirous to furnish himself <hi>a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

He was a most Elegant Preacher, and the True Follower of Dr. <hi>Sibs!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§. 9. But let his <hi>Excellencies</hi> have been what they will, there was in those Dayes a <hi>Set of Men,</hi> Resolved that the Church of God should Lose the Benefit of all those Excellencies, except the
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:000724_0119_0FAA4758EB088E48"/>
Person which had them, could comply with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Uninstituted <hi>Rites</hi> in the Worship of God; which <hi>Our Mr. Norton</hi> could not; and it was <hi>That</hi> which made him <hi>Ours. This</hi> Drove him to the Remote Regions of <hi>America,</hi> where he <hi>hoped,</hi> as well he <hi>might,</hi> that there would never be done so <hi>Unreasonable</hi> a Thing, as to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct that <hi>Evangelical Worship</hi> of Our Lord Jesus Christ, for the sake <hi>whereof,</hi> those Regions have been added unto the <hi>English Dominions.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the year 1634. Having Married a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle woman both of Good Estate, and of Good Esteem, he took Shipping for <hi>New-England;</hi> accompanied in the same Ship with the Famous Mr. <hi>Thomas Shepard.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§. 10. In the Road betwixt <hi>Harwich</hi> and <hi>Yarmouth,</hi> he very narrowly escaped a Terrible. Shipwrack: for by the Venemency of a Storm, all their Anchors gave way, so that they were Driven within a Cables Length of the <hi>Sands;</hi> but yet the <hi>Anchor</hi> of their <hi>Hope</hi> in God, held fast unto the <hi>Last.</hi> Mr. <hi>Shepard</hi> having taken the <hi>Mariners</hi> above Decks, Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> took the <hi>Passengers</hi> between Decks, and each of them with their Company, applyed themselves unto Fervent Prayer, whereto the Almighty God gave a present Answer in their Wonderful Deliverance. After this Tempest, which Disappointed their Voyage to <hi>New England</hi> for that Season, Mr.
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:000724_0120_0FAA4759B5424ED0"/>
                     <hi>Norton</hi> Returned unto his Friends in <hi>Essex;</hi> where Mr. <hi>Dyke</hi> welcomed him, as One come from the Dead, professing to him, <hi>That he would have given many Pounds for such a Tryal of his Faith, as this his Friend had newly met withal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§. 11. The next year Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> Renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Voyage to <hi>New-England;</hi> but intervening Accidents made it very late in the year, before he could begin the Voyage: and so, coming upon the <hi>American</hi> Coast in the Month of <hi>October,</hi> they encountred with Another very Terrible Storm, which lasted Eight and fourty Hours, with Great Extremity, and had broken the Vessel to pieces, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> it had not had a Strength more than Ordinary. One Wave remarkably washed some of the <hi>Sea-men</hi> overboard on one side and then threw them in again on 'tother; and so Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement was the Storm, that they were forced at Length to undergird the Ship with the <hi>Cable,</hi> that they might keep her sides together. But within Ten Dayes after this, they were brought safe into <hi>Plymouth</hi> Harbour.</p>
                  <p>§. 12. There had been some Overtures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him, and Mr. <hi>Winslow,</hi> the Agent of <hi>Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> now on board with him, about his Accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Settlement in that Plantation; and the People of <hi>Plymouth</hi> now Courteously and Earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Invited him, accordingly to continue with them.
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:000724_0121_0FAA475A6E452760"/>
Nevertheless the State of Things in the <hi>Massachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set</hi> Colony, was more agreeable unto him; and the Church of <hi>Ipswich</hi> made their speedy Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations unto him, to take the Pastoral charge of <hi>them.</hi> This Occasioned his Deliberation, with his Friends in the <hi>Bay,</hi> What Course to Steer.</p>
                  <p>§. 13. While he Sojourned in his Unsettled State at <hi>Boston,</hi> he came into Acquaintance with the <hi>Ministers</hi> thereabouts, who entertained him with a very high Opinion of him; especially Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> of <hi>Dorchester,</hi> who though of longer standing than <hi>he,</hi> yet consulted him as an <hi>Oracle,</hi> in matters of greatest Consequence unto him; and found him to Accomplished and Experienced a Person, that he mentained a most Valuable <hi>Friendship</hi> with him to the Last. Yea, though he were yet a Young man, and short of <hi>Thirty,</hi> when he first came into the Country, yet the <hi>Magistrates</hi> of the Colony soon became so sensible of his Abilities, as to make use of him in some of their most arduous Affairs. And there happened se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Occasions to try the <hi>Scholastic</hi> Emmencies, whereto he was Arrived; One of which was, when there was in these parts a <hi>French Friar,</hi> who found in Mr. <hi>Norton,</hi> a Protestant, equal to his own <hi>School-men,</hi> and well Acquainted with them all. Indeed there was in him the Union of <hi>two Excellencies,</hi> which do not always meet. It was the Character of <hi>Hortensies,</hi> that he was
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:000724_0122_0FAA475B488A9D70"/>
Weak in <hi>Writing,</hi> and yet able to <hi>Speak;</hi> It was the Character of <hi>Abericus,</hi> that he was Weak in <hi>Speach,</hi> and yet Able in <hi>Writing;</hi> but our <hi>Norton</hi> was in both of these a very <hi>Able</hi> Person.</p>
                  <p>§. 14. It was the Church of <hi>Ipswich,</hi> that our Lord gave so Rich a Thing, as His Eminent Servant <hi>Norton:</hi> but besides the constant La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of his Holy and Fruitful Man, in that <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church,</hi> he there did several great Services of a more Extensive Influence to the <hi>whole Church</hi> of God; whereof One was <hi>This, Guiliel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus Apollonii,</hi> at the Direction of the Divines in <hi>Zealand,</hi> in the year 1644. Sent over to <hi>New-England</hi> a Number of Questions, relating to our Way of <hi>Church-Government;</hi> whereto the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of <hi>New-England</hi> unanimously imposed upon Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> the Task of Drawing up an Answer; which he finished in the year 1645. And it was, I suppose, the first <hi>Latin Book</hi> that ever was Written in this Country. What satisfaction it gave, may be gathered, not only from the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testations of Dr. <hi>Goodwyn,</hi> Mr. <hi>Nye,</hi> Mr. <hi>Sympson,</hi> thereunto, but also from the Expressions of Dr. <hi>Hornbeck,</hi> who frequently magnifies the <hi>Reason,</hi> and the <hi>Candour</hi> of our <hi>New-English</hi> Divine, even in those Points, wherein he dos himself Dissent from him. Nor is it amiss to add the Words, in Dr. <hi>Fullers</hi> Church History, hereupon; which are, <hi>Of all the Authors I have perused concerning
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:000724_0123_0FAA475BE521B108"/>
these Opinions, none to me was more Informative than</hi> Mr. John Norton, <hi>One of no less Learning than Modesty, in his Answer to</hi> Apollonius, <hi>Pastor in the Church of</hi> Middleburgh.</p>
                  <p>§. 15. It will do no Hurt, for me to Repeat one Passage on this Occasion, which to <hi>me</hi> seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed worthy of some Remark. While Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> was Deeply engaged in Writing his Latin Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of our <hi>Church-Discipline,</hi> some of his more Accurate and Judicious Hearers, Imagined that his <hi>Publick Sermons</hi> wanted a little of that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actness, which did use to attend them; Whereof one said something to that Mr. <hi>Whiting,</hi> whom I may well call the <hi>Angel</hi> in the Church of <hi>Lyn.</hi> Mr. <hi>Whiting</hi> hereupon in a very Respectful and Obliging manner, spoke to Mr. <hi>Norton,</hi> saying, <hi>Sir, There are some of your People, who think that the Services wherein you are engaged for all the Churches, Do something take off the Edge of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry, wherewith you should Serve your own particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Church: I would entreat you, Sir, to consider this matter; for our Greatest Work is to Preach the Gospel unto that Flock, whereof we are Overseers.</hi> Our Great and Good man took the <hi>Excellent Oyl</hi> of this Intimation, with the <hi>Kindness</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came such a Man, and made it Serviceable unto his Holy <hi>Studies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§. 16. Another considerable Service, which then called for the Studies of this Excellent man,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:000724_0124_0FAA475FE5757A40"/>
was the Advising, Modelling, and Recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Platform of Church Discipline,</hi> Agreed by a <hi>Synod</hi> at <hi>Cambridge</hi> in the year 1647. Into that <hi>Platform</hi> he would sain have had Inserted, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Propositions</hi> concerning the <hi>Watch,</hi> which our Churches are to have over the <hi>Children</hi> Born in them; which <hi>Propositions</hi> were certainly, <hi>The First Principles of New-England:</hi> only the fierce Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions of One eminent Person, caused him that was of a <hi>Peaceable Temper,</hi> to forbear urging them any further; by which means, when those very <hi>Propositions</hi> came to be Advanced and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced in Another <hi>Synod,</hi> more than twice Seven years after, many People did Ignorantly count them <hi>Novelties.</hi> Moreover, when the <hi>Synod</hi> first Assembled, it was a thing of some unhappy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, that the Church of <hi>Boston</hi> would not send any <hi>Messengers</hi> unto it: but Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> Preaching the next Lecture there, wherein he Handled the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Councils,</hi> and the <hi>Power</hi> of Civil <hi>Magistrates</hi> to call such Assemblies, and the <hi>Duty</hi> of the Churches in Regarding their <hi>Advice,</hi> the Church of <hi>Boston</hi> were therewithal so satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as to Testify their Communion with the Rest of the Churches, by sending three Messengers to accompany their Elders now in the <hi>Synod.</hi> And when the Result of the <hi>Synod,</hi> came to try it's Acceptance in the Churches; he did his part, especially in <hi>his own,</hi> with a Prudent and Pious Diligence, to obtain <hi>it;</hi> which was happily Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished.</p>

<pb n="37" facs="unknown:000724_0149_0FAA4776EB4DE060"/>
to <hi>Neglect;</hi> They supposed that a Minister, who should only Read <hi>Forms of Sermons</hi> composed for him, would as Truly Discharge the Duty of <hi>Preaching,</hi> as One that should only Read such <hi>Forms of Prayers,</hi> would the Duty of <hi>Praying,</hi> in it: They could not find, that any Humane <hi>Forms of Prayer</hi> were much used in any part of the Church, until about <hi>Four Hundred</hi> years after Christ, nor any made for more than some Single Province, until <hi>Six Hundred</hi> years; nor any Imposed until <hi>Eight Hundred,</hi> when all manner of <hi>Ill-formed Things,</hi> began to be found in the <hi>Temple</hi> of God: Nevertheless very many of our Greatest Ministers, in our more Early times, did not use to Expatiate with such a Significant and Admirable <hi>Variety</hi> in their <hi>Prayers</hi> before their <hi>Sermons,</hi> as many of our Later Times have attained unto: Nor indeed <hi>Then</hi> did <hi>They,</hi> nor <hi>Still</hi> do <hi>We,</hi> count all <hi>Forms of Prayer</hi> Simply Unlawful. But the more General Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Expressions of <hi>The Gift of Prayers,</hi> in our Ministers, have <hi>Since</hi> been the matter of Observation; and Particularly Mr. <hi>Norton,</hi> therein was truly Admirable!

<pb n="38" facs="unknown:000724_0150_0FAA4777A181B688"/>
we are furnished in the <hi>New-Covenant,</hi> for our <hi>Prayers.</hi> I have Heard of a Godly man in <hi>Ipswich,</hi> who after Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> Going to <hi>Boston,</hi> would Ordinarily Travel on foot from <hi>Ips<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich</hi> to <hi>Boston,</hi> which is about Thirty Miles, for nothing but the Weekly <hi>Lecture</hi> there; and he would profess, <hi>That it was worth a Greater Journey, to be a Partaker in One of Mr.</hi> Nortons <hi>Prayers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> This Pattern of <hi>Prayer</hi> in Mr. <hi>Norton,</hi> had some Influence upon it, that since his Time, our <hi>Pulpits</hi> have been fuller than ever, of <hi>Experimental Demonstrations,</hi> that the Ministers of the Gospel may on All Occasions present their Supplications be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, in the Discharge of their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, with more Pertinent, more Affecting, more Expanded <hi>Enlargments,</hi> than any <hi>Form</hi> could Afford unto them. <hi>New-England</hi> can show, even <hi>Young Ministers,</hi> who never did in all Things Repeat <hi>One Prayer</hi> twice over, in that part of their Ministry wherein we are <hi>First of All, to make Supplications, Prayers, Intercessions, and Thanksgivings;</hi> and yet some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, for much more than an <hi>Hour</hi> together, they pour out their Souls unto the Almighty God in such a Fervent, Copious, and yet <hi>Proper</hi> Manner, that their most Critical Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors, can complain of Nothing <hi>Disagreeable</hi> but profess themselves extreamly Edifyed.</p>

in the year 1602. When he came to stand for a <hi>Fellowship</hi> in that <hi>Colledge,</hi> his Antipathy to some Horrid Wickednesses, whereto a Detestable Wretch that had been Acquainted with him, would have betray'd him, caused that Malicious Wretch by Devised and Accursed <hi>Slanders</hi> to ruin so far the Reputation of this Chast Youth with the other <hi>Fellows,</hi> that had not the Provost, who was a Serious and a Reverend Person, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposed for him, he had utterly lost his Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; which now by the <hi>Major Vote</hi> he Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. But this Affliction put him upon many <hi>Thoughts</hi> and <hi>Prayers</hi> before the Lord.</p>
                  <p>§. 3. He had hitherto been, according to his Good Education, very <hi>Civilly</hi> and <hi>Soberly</hi> Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed: but being by the Good Hand of God, Led unto the Ministry of such Holy men as Mr. <hi>Rains,</hi> Dr. <hi>Taylor,</hi> Dr. <hi>Chadenton,</hi> he was by their Sermons Enlightned and A wakened, unto more Sollicitous Enquiries after, <hi>The One Thing yet Lack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in him.</hi> The Serious Dispositions of his Mind, were now such, that besides his pursuance after the <hi>Works</hi> of <hi>Repentance</hi> in himself, he took no little pains to pursue it in others; especially the <hi>Malefactors</hi> in the Prisons, which he Visited with a Devout, Sedulous, and Successful Industry. Nevertheless, being forestalled with Prejudices against the <hi>Puritans</hi> of those Times, as if they had held, he knew not well what <hi>Odd Things,</hi> he
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:000724_0156_0FAA477C217EA948"/>
Declined <hi>Their</hi> Acquaintance; although his Good Conversation had made him to be accounted <hi>One</hi> of them, <hi>Himself.</hi> Until going unto a <hi>Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellers</hi> Shop to Augment his Well-furnisht <hi>Library,</hi> he Lit upon that Famous Book of Mr. <hi>Richard Rogers,</hi> called, <hi>The Seven Treatises;</hi> which, when he had Read, he so Affected, not only the <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> but also the <hi>Author</hi> of the Book, that he took a Journey unto <hi>Wethersfield,</hi> on purpose to hear a Sermon, from that <hi>Boanerges.</hi> When, he had heard the Heavenly Passages that fell from the Lips of that Worthy Man, <hi>Privately,</hi> as well as <hi>Publickly,</hi> and compared therewithal the Writings of <hi>Greenham,</hi> of <hi>Dod,</hi> and of <hi>Dont,</hi> especially <hi>The Path way to Heaven,</hi> Written by the Author last mentioned, he saw that <hi>They</hi> who were Nicknamed, <hi>Puritans,</hi> were like to be the <hi>Desirablest Companions,</hi> for One that intended his own Everlasting Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness; and pursuant unto the Advice, which he had from Dr. <hi>Ames,</hi> he associated himself with a Pious Company in the University, who kept their Meetings in Mr. <hi>Wilsons</hi> Chamber, for <hi>Prayer, Fasting,</hi> Holy <hi>Conference,</hi> and the Exercises of true Devotion.</p>
                  <p>§. 4. But now, perceiving many Good men to Scruple many of the <hi>Rites,</hi> Practised and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> he furnished himself with all the <hi>Books,</hi> that he could find Written on the Case of <hi>Conformity,</hi> both <hi>Pro</hi> and

                     <hi>Con,</hi> and pondered with a most Conscientious Deliberation, the Arguments on both sides pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.

His Father, being hereof Advised, with all Paternal Affection, Wrote unto him to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form;</hi> and at the same Time, interceded with the Bishop, that he might have a Quarter of a year allowed him; in which time, if he could not be Reduced, he should then leave his <hi>Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> in the Colledge. Hereupon he sent him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to several <hi>Doctors</hi> of Great Fame, to get his Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections Resolved; but when much <hi>Discourse,</hi> and much <hi>Writing,</hi> had passed between them, he was rather the more confirmed in his Principles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Church-Reformation.</hi> Wherefore his Father, then diverting him from the Designs of the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry,</hi> disposed him to <hi>the Inns of Court;</hi> where he fell into Acquaintance with some Young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, who associated with him in constant Exercises of Devotion, to which Meetings the Repeated Sermons of Dr. <hi>Gouge</hi> were a continual Entertainment: and here it was, that he came into the Advantageous Knowledge of the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

Pray'd them, <hi>That their Talk might be of such Things, as might Sanctify the Day, and Edify their own Souls;</hi> which caused the former Gentleman to Renew his former Thankfulness for the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition. But Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi> the Ladys Husband, was very angry; whereof when the Lady ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised Mr. <hi>Wilson,</hi> wishing him to say something, that might Satisfy him, he Replyed, <hi>Good Madam, I know not wherein I have given any just Offence; and therefore, I know of no Satisfaction that I owe Your Ladyship has Invited me to Preach the Good Word of God among you; and so I have endeavoured according to my Ability: Now such Discourse as this, on the Lords Day, is Profane &amp; Disorderly: If your Husband Like me not, I will be gone.</hi> When the Lady informed her Husband how Peremptory Mr. <hi>Wilson</hi> was, in this matter, he mended his Countenance and Carriage; and the Effect of this Reproof was, that unsuitable Discourse, on the <hi>Lords Day,</hi> was cured among them.</p>

Diligence Visited the Congregations of the Neighbouring Towns, at their <hi>Weekly Lectures,</hi> until the Weaknesses of <hi>Old Age</hi> rendered him Uncapable. And it was a delightful Thing, then to see upon every Recurring Opportunity, a large Company of Christians, and even <hi>Magistrates</hi> and <hi>Ministers</hi> among them, and Mr. <hi>Wilson</hi> in the Head of them, Visiting the <hi>Lectures</hi> in all the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinage, with such Heavenly Discourses on the Road, as caused the Hearts of the Disciples, to <hi>Burn within them:</hi> and indeed it was Remark'd, That though the Christians <hi>Then</hi> Spent Less Time, in the <hi>Shop,</hi> or <hi>Field,</hi> than they do <hi>Now,</hi> yet they did in <hi>Both</hi> prosper more. But for Mr. <hi>Wilson,</hi> I am saying, That a <hi>Lecture</hi> was a <hi>Treasure</hi> unto him; he Priz'd it, he Sought it, until <hi>Old Age</hi> at Length brought with it <hi>a Sickness,</hi> which a Long while confined him. In this Illness, he took a Solemn Farewel of the <hi>Ministers,</hi> who had their Weekly Meetings, at his <hi>Hospitable House,</hi> and were now come together from all parts, at the Anniversary <hi>Election</hi> for the Government of the Colony. They asked him, to declare Solemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, what he thought might be the <hi>Sins,</hi> which provoked the Displeasure of God against the Country. Whereto his Answer was, <hi>I have long feared several Sins;</hi> Whereof; One, he said, was <hi>Corahism;</hi> 
                     <q>That is, when People rise up as <hi>Corah</hi> against their <hi>Ministers,</hi> as if they took too much upon them, when indeed they do but

Rule for Christ, and according to Christ; yet it is nothing for a Brother to stand up and Oppose, without Scripture, or Reason, the Word of an Elder, saying [<hi>I am not Satisfied!</hi>] And hence, if he do not like the Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (be it <hi>Baptism</hi> or the Like) he will turn his back upon God and His Ordinances, and Go away. And for our Neglect of <hi>Baptising</hi> the Children of the <hi>Church,</hi> those that some call <hi>Grand-children,</hi> I think God is provoked by it. Another Sin (<hi>said he</hi>) I take, to be the making Light of; and not Subjecting to the Authority of <hi>Synods,</hi> without which the Churches cannot long Subsist.</q>

                  <p>§. 2. Mr. <hi>John Davenport,</hi> was born at <hi>Coventry,</hi> in the year 1597. of Worthy Parents; a <hi>Father,</hi> who was Mayor of the City, and a Pious <hi>Mother,</hi> who having Lived just long enough, to devote him, as <hi>Hannah</hi> did her <hi>Samuel,</hi> unto the Service of the <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> left him under the more immediate Care of Heaven to fit him for that Service. The Grace of God Sanctified him with <hi>Good Principles,</hi> while he had not yet seen Two Sevens of years in an <hi>Evil World;</hi> and by that Age he had also made such Attainments in Learning, as to be admitted into <hi>Brasen-Nose</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in <hi>Oxford.</hi> From thence, when he was but Nineteen years Old, he was called unto Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick

and constant Preaching in the City of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> as an Assistent unto another Divine; where his Notable Accomplishments for a <hi>Minister,</hi> and his Couragious <hi>Residence</hi> with, and <hi>Visiting</hi> of, his Flock in a dreadful <hi>Plague time,</hi> caused much no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to be quickly taken of him. His Degree of <hi>Master of Arts,</hi> he took not until, in Course, he was to proceed <hi>Batchelour of Divinity;</hi> and then with Universal Approbation, he Received both of these <hi>Laurels</hi> together.</p>
                  <p>§. 3. This Pious man was both an hard <hi>Student,</hi> and a Great <hi>Preacher.</hi> His <hi>Custome</hi> was to sit up very late at his <hi>Lucubrations;</hi> whereby, though he found no sensible Damage himself, and never felt his Head ake, yet his Counsil was that other <hi>Students</hi> would not follow his Exemple.

§ 5. It happened that soon after this, the Famous Mr. <hi>John Cotton</hi> was fallen under such a Storm of Persecution for his <hi>Non Conformity,</hi> as made it necessary for him to propose and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose a Removal out of the Land: Whereupon, Mr. <hi>Davenport,</hi> with several other Great and Good men, considering the Eminent Learning, Prudence, and Holiness of that Excellent Person, could be at no Rest, until they had by a Solemn <hi>Conference</hi> inform'd themselves of what might move him to such a Resolution. The Issue of the <hi>Conference</hi> was, that instead of <hi>their</hi> Disswad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>him,</hi> from exposing himself to such Sufferings, as were now before him, <hi>he</hi> convinced <hi>them</hi> of the Truth in the <hi>Cause</hi> for which he Suffered and they became Satisfied both of the <hi>Evil</hi> in Sundry <hi>Matters</hi> of <hi>Worship</hi> and <hi>Order</hi> imposed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and of the <hi>Duty,</hi> which lay upon them, in their places to endeavour the <hi>Reformation</hi> of things in the Church according to the Word of God. Mr. <hi>Davenports</hi> Inclination to <hi>Non Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity</hi> from this time, felt under the Notice, and Anger of his <hi>Diocesan;</hi> who presently determined the Marks of his Vengeance for him: Of which being Seasonably and Sufficiently advertised, he convened the Principal Persons under his Pasto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Charge in <hi>Coleman-street,</hi> at a General <hi>Vestry,</hi> desiring them on this Occasion to declare, what they would advise; for, acknowledging the <hi>Right,</hi> which they had in him, as their <hi>Pastor,</hi> he would
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:000724_0204_0FAA46FFE2D294D0"/>
not, by any Danger, be driven from any Service, which they should expect or demand at his hands; but he would Imitate the Exemple of <hi>Luther,</hi> who upon Letters from the Church of <hi>Written berg,</hi> from whence he had with-drawn for his Security, upon the Direction of the Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> returned unto the Couragious Exercise of his Ministry. Upon a Serious Deliberation, they Discharged his <hi>Conscentious Obligations,</hi> by Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him, that it would be best for him to <hi>Resign;</hi> but although he now Hoped for some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of a Quiet Life, his <hi>Hope,</hi> was disappointed; for he was continually dogg'd by Raging, Busy <hi>Pursevants,</hi> from whom he had no safety but by Retiring into <hi>Holland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§. 6. Over to <hi>Holland</hi> he went, in the Lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end of the year 1633. Where the Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of the Church under the charge of Mr. <hi>Paget,</hi> met him in his way to <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> inviting him to become the Collegue of their Aged Pastor. But Mr. <hi>Davenport</hi> had not been long there, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Indisposition to the Promiscuous Baptising of <hi>Children,</hi> concerning whom there was no <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable</hi> or <hi>Tolerable</hi> Testimony of their belonging to <hi>Christian Parents,</hi> was by Mr. <hi>Paget</hi> so improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed against him, as to procure him the Displeasure of the Dutch <hi>Classes</hi> in the Neighbourhood. The <hi>Contention</hi> on this Occasion, proceeded so far, that though the Dutch Ministers had under their
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:000724_0205_0FAA4700792FFBF0"/>
Hands declared.—<hi>We desire nothing more, than that</hi> Mr. Davenport, <hi>whose Eminent Learning and Singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Piety is much approved and commended of all the English our Brethren, may be Lawfully promoted unto the Ministry of the English Church; We do also great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly approve of his Good Zeal and Care, of his having some precedent private Examination of the Parents, and Sureties of Children to be Baptised, in the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion:</hi> Yet the matter could not be Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated; Mr. <hi>Davenport</hi> could not be allowed except he would promise to Baptise the <hi>Children</hi> of such whose <hi>Parents</hi> and <hi>Sureties</hi> were, upon Examination, found never so much <hi>Unchristianised,</hi> Ignorant or Scandalous. He, therefore, desisted from his Publick Ministry in <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> about the Beginning of the year 1635. Contenting himself to set up a <hi>Catechetical Exercise</hi> in the Family, where he sojourned, on the Afternoon of the <hi>Lords Days,</hi> and Hour after the Publick Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons were over. But some considerable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of People, at Length, resorting to this Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise, a Jealousy was pretended by his Adversary, that the Design of it was to <hi>Promote</hi> such <hi>Sects,</hi> as indeed the chief Design of it was to <hi>Prevent;</hi> and, upon this pretence, he was hindered, even from this Lesser Opportunity of Doing Service also. The fuller Story of these Uncomfortable, and Unreasonable Brangles, the Reader may find in an <hi>Apologetical Discourse</hi> of Mr. <hi>Davenports,</hi> Published for his own Vindication; wherein he
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:000724_0206_0FAA47030D7D2FA0"/>
do's with a Learned Pen, handle several points much controverted in the <hi>Reformed Churches,</hi> and show himself a Divine well studied in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies of the Present, and the Former Ages. But the Upshot of all was, that he Returned back to <hi>London;</hi> where he told his Friends, <hi>That he thought God carried him over into</hi> Holland, <hi>on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to bear Witness against that</hi> Promiscuous Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, <hi>which at least Bordered very near upon a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanation of the Holy Institution.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§ 7. He observed, that when a <hi>Reformation</hi> of the Church has been brought about in any part of the World, it has rarely been <hi>Afterwards</hi> carried on any One step further, than the <hi>First Reformers</hi> did Succeed in their <hi>first Endeavours;</hi> He observed that as easily might the <hi>Ark</hi> have been removed from the Mountains of <hi>Ararat,</hi> where it first Grounded, as a People get any Ground in <hi>Reformation,</hi> after <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> beyond the <hi>first Remove</hi> of the <hi>Reformers.</hi> And this Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion quickened him to Embark in a Design of <hi>Reformation,</hi> wherein he might have Opportunity to Drive things in the <hi>First Essay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> as near to the Precept and Pattern of <hi>Scripture,</hi> as they could be driven. The Plantation of <hi>New England</hi> afforded him this Opportunity, with the Chief Undertakers whereof he had many Consultations, before he had ever taken up any Purpose of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself into that part of the World; and he
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:000724_0207_0FAA4703CD808EE8"/>
had, indeed, a very great stroke in the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging and Enlivening of that <hi>Noble Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking.</hi> He was one of those by whom the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent for the <hi>Massachuset</hi> Colony was procured; and though his <hi>Name</hi> were not among the <hi>Paten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees,</hi> because he himself desired it might be omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, Left his Enemy, the Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> then of the Kings Privy. Council, should upon <hi>his</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count appear the more fiercely against it, yet his <hi>Purse</hi> was in it, his <hi>Time</hi> was in it, and he contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted unto it all manner of Assistences: This he did before his Going to <hi>Holland.</hi> And while he was in <hi>Holland,</hi> he received Letters of Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> from the Country whereto he had thus been a <hi>Father;</hi> telling him, <hi>That the Order of the Churches, and of the Common wealth, was now so settled in</hi> New England <hi>by common consent, that it brought into his Mind the New Heaven and the New Earth, wherein dwells Righteousness.</hi> Wherefore, soon after his Return for <hi>London,</hi> he Shipt himself with several Eminent Christians and their Families, for <hi>New England;</hi> where, by the Good Hand of God upon them, they arrived in the Summer of the year 1637.</p>
                  <p>§. 8. Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> welcomed Mr. <hi>Davenport,</hi> as <hi>Moses</hi> did <hi>Jethro,</hi> hoping that he would be <hi>as Eyes unto them in the Wilderness.</hi> For by the Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Malice of <hi>Satan,</hi> all things in this <hi>New-English Wilderness,</hi> were then <hi>Surprised,</hi> into a deal of Confusion, on the Occasion of the <hi>Antinomian</hi>

Having done his part in that <hi>Blessed Work,</hi> (as we have else where more fully related) <hi>He,</hi> with his Friends, who were more fit for <hi>Zebulons</hi> Ports, than for <hi>Issachars</hi> Tents, chose to go farther West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; Where they began a Plantation, and a Colony, since distinguished by the Name of NEW-HAVEN; and Endeavoured, according to his Understanding, a yet stricter Conformity, to the <hi>Word of God,</hi> in Settling of all Matters, both <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Sacred,</hi> than he had yet seen Exempli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in any other Part of the World. There, the Famous Church of <hi>New haven,</hi> as well as the other Neighbouring Towns, Enjoyed his <hi>Ministry,</hi> his <hi>Discipline,</hi> his <hi>Government,</hi> and his Universal <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,</hi> for many years together; Even, till, after the Restoration of K. <hi>Charles</hi> II. <hi>Connecticut,</hi> and <hi>New haven,</hi> were by <hi>One Charter</hi> Incorporated. And here, with what <hi>Holiness,</hi> with what <hi>Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness,</hi> with what <hi>Usefulness</hi> he discharged his <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry,</hi> it is Worthy of a Remembrance, among all that would propose unto themselves a Worthy <hi>Exemple.</hi> Nevertheless, all that I shall here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve of it, is this One Article. A Young Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, once Receiving of Wise and Good Counsils, from this Good and Wise and Great Man, he Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived

                     <hi>this</hi> among the rest, <hi>That he should be much in Circulatory Prayer:</hi> for indeed, <hi>Ejacula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Prayers, As Arrows in the Hand of a Mighty Man, so are</hi> they, <hi>Happy is the man that has his Quiver full of them!</hi> And it was Believed, by some Curious Observers, That Mr. <hi>Davenport</hi> himself, was well used unto that Sacred skill of, <hi>Walking with God,</hi> and, <hi>Having his Eyes ever to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Lord,</hi> and, <hi>Being in the Fear of the Lord all the Day Long,</hi> by the use of <hi>Ejaculatory Prayers,</hi> on the Innumerable Occasions, which every <hi>Turn</hi> of our Livers does bring for those Devotions. He was not only Constant in more <hi>Settled,</hi> whether <hi>Social,</hi> or <hi>Secret,</hi> Prayers; but also in the midst of all Besieging Incumbrances, tying the Wishes of his Devout Soul, unto the <hi>Arrows</hi> of <hi>Ejaculatory Prayers,</hi> he would shoot them away unto the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,</hi> from whence he still Expected all his <hi>Help.</hi> With such a <hi>Glory,</hi> with such a <hi>Defence,</hi> was <hi>New-haven</hi> Blessed!</p>
                  <p>§ 9. But his Influences were not Confined unto his own <hi>Colony</hi> of <hi>New-haven;</hi> they were Extended, as far as his General and Generous, <hi>Care of all the Churches,</hi> could carry him. And hence, I find him, in a Particular manner, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing his Good Affections, unto the <hi>Irenio</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs and Studies, which were in those Dayes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging by some Great Men, for the Restoring of <hi>Communion,</hi> among the Divided Churches of the

                  <p>On June 6. 1662. At <hi>New haven,</hi> there was a most Unparallel'd Wretch, one <hi>Potter</hi> by Name, about Sixty years of Age, Executed for Damnable <hi>Bestialities;</hi> although this Wretch, had been for now Twenty years, a Member of

the Church in that Place, and kept up among the holy People of God there, a Reputation, for Serious Christianity. It seems that the <hi>Unclean Devil,</hi> which had the possession of this Monster, had carried all his Lusts with so much Fury into this One Channel of Wickedness, that there was no Notice taken of his being Wicked in any other. Hence t'was, that he was <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout</hi> in Worship, <hi>Gifted</hi> in Prayer, <hi>Forward</hi> in Edifying Discourse among the Religious, and <hi>Zealous</hi> in Reproving the Sins of the other Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; Every one counted him, <hi>A Saint:</hi> And he Enjoy'd such a <hi>Peace</hi> in his own mind, that in several Fits of Sickness, wherein he seem'd <hi>Nigh unto Death,</hi> he seem'd <hi>Willing to Dy;</hi> Yea, <hi>Death</hi> (he said) <hi>Smiled on him.</hi> Nevertheless, this Diabolical Creature, had Lived in most infandous <hi>Buggeries</hi> for no less than Fifty years together; and now at the Gallows, there were killed before his Eyes, a <hi>Cow,</hi> Two <hi>Heifers,</hi> Three <hi>Sheep,</hi> and Two <hi>Sowes,</hi> with all of which he had Committed his <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talities.</hi> His <hi>Wife</hi> had seen him Confounding himself with a <hi>Bitch,</hi> Ten years before; and he then Excused his Filthiness, as well as he could, unto her, but Conjured her to keep it Secret: but he afterwards Hanged that Fitch himself, and then Returned unto his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Villanies, until <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Tis that HOOKER, of whom I may venture to say, that the famous <hi>Romanist,</hi> who wrote a Book, <hi>De Tribus THOMIS,</hi> or, <hi>of Three THOMASes,</hi> meaning THOMAS the <hi>Apostle, THOMAS Becket,</hi> and Sir <hi>THOMAS MORE,</hi> did not a thousandth part so well sort his THOMAS's, as a <hi>New Englander</hi> might; if he should write a Book, <hi>De Duckus THOMIS,</hi> or, <hi>Of Two THOMAS's;</hi> and with THOMAS the <hi>Apostle,</hi> joyn our Celebrious THOMAS HOOK<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ER: my <hi>One</hi> THOMAS, even our <hi>Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> HOOKER, would in <hi>Just Ballances</hi> weigh down two of Campians Rebellious <hi>Archbishops,</hi> or bigotted <hi>Lord-Chancellours.</hi>

Abuses, when he was one of the <hi>Procters</hi> in the University, was a Thing, that more eminently Signalized him, when his more publick Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in the Worl§d was coming on: which was attended with an Advancement unto a <hi>Fellowship</hi> in <hi>Emanuel</hi> Colle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p n="3">§ 3. With what Ability and Fidelity be acquitted himself in his <hi>Fellowship,</hi> it was a Thing sensible unto the whole University. And it was while he was in this Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that the more Effectual <hi>Grace</hi> of God, gave him the Experience of a true <hi>Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> It pleased the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God very Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully to break into the Soul of this person, with such a Sense of his being Exposed unto the Just <hi>Wrath</hi> of Heaven, as fill'd him with most unusual Degrees of Horror and Anguish, which broke not only his <hi>Rest,</hi> but his <hi>Heart</hi> also, and caused him to cry out, <hi>While I suffer thy Terrors, O Lord, I am Distracted!</hi> While he long had a Soul Harassed with such Distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, he had a singular Help in the Prudent and Piteous Carriage of Mr. <hi>Ash,</hi> who was the Sizer, that then waited upon him; and attended him, with such Discreet and Proper Compassions, as made him afterwards to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect him highly all his Dayes. He after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:000724_0233_0FAA471C820E13C8"/>
gave this Account of himself, <hi>That in the time of his Agonies, he could Reason himself to the Rule, and Conclude that there was no way but Submission to God, and Lying, at the Foot of his Mercy in Christ Jesus, and waiting humbly there, till He should please to perswade the Soul of his Favour: nevertheless when he came to apply this Rule unto himself in his own Condition, his Reasoning would fall him, he was able to Do nothing.</hi> Having bin a considerable while thus Troubled with such Impressions from the <hi>Spirit of Bondage,</hi> as were to fit him for the Great Services and Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which God intended him; at length he Received the <hi>Spirit of Adoption,</hi> with well groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Perswasions of his Interest in the New-Covenant. It became his manner, at his Lying down for Sleep in the Evening, to Single out some certain <hi>Promise</hi> of God, which he would Repeat, and Ponder, and Keep his Heart close unto it, until he found that satisfaction of Soul where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he could say, <hi>I will Lay me down in Peace, and Sleep; for thou, O Lord, makest me Dwell in Assurance.</hi> And he would afterwards Counsel others to take the same Course; telling them, <hi>That the Promise was the Boat, which was to carry a Perishing Sinner over unto the Lord Jesus Christ.</hi>

of the Gospel, and the way of Employing and Applying those Truths, he was willing to Serve the Church of God in the <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry,</hi> whereto he was Devoted. At his first leaving of the University, he Sojourned in the House of Mr. <hi>Drake,</hi> a Gentleman of great Note, not far from <hi>London;</hi> whose worthy Comfort being Visited with such Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresses of Soul, as Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> himself had passed through, it proved an unspeakable advantage unto both of them, that he had that opportunity of being Serviceable; for, indeed, he now had no <hi>Superiour,</hi> and scarce any <hi>Equal,</hi> for the Skill of Treating a <hi>Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled Soul.</hi> When he left Mr. <hi>Drakes</hi> Family, he did more publickly and frequently Preach about <hi>London;</hi> and in a little time, he grew famous for his Ministerial Abilities, but es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially for his Notable Faculty at the wise and fit management of <hi>Wounded Spirits.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he was not Ambitious to Exercise his Ministry among the <hi>Great Ones</hi> of the World, from whom the most of Preferment might be expected: but in this, Imitating the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample and Character of our blessed Saviour, of whom 'tis noted, that according to the Prophesie of <hi>Isatah,</hi> by Him, <hi>The Poor had the Gospel Preached unto them;</hi> he chose to be where great numbers of <hi>the Poor</hi> might Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the <hi>Gospel</hi> from him.</p>

§ 5.

                  <p>When he first Set up his Lecture, there was more <hi>Prophaneness</hi> than <hi>Devotion</hi> in the Town: and the Multitude of <hi>Inns</hi> and <hi>Shops</hi> in the Town produced one particular Disorder, of <hi>Peoples</hi> filling the Streets with unsuitable Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours,

after the Publick Services of the <hi>Lords-Day</hi> were over.

                  <p n="7">§ 7.

It was his Opinion, That there were <hi>Two great Reserves of Enquiry,</hi> for this Age of the World; the First, Wherein the <hi>Spiritual Rule</hi> of our <hi>Lord's Kingdom</hi> does Consist, and after what manner it is <hi>Internal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> Revealed, Managed, and Maintained in the Souls of his People? The Second, After what Order the <hi>Government</hi> of our Lord's Kingdom is to be <hi>Externally</hi> Managed and Maintained in his Churches?

Upon this Occasion, he Wrote his Excellent Book. which is Entituled, <hi>A Survey of Church Discipline;</hi> wherein, having in the Name of the other Ministers in the Country, as well as his own, professed his Concurrence with Holy, and Learned, Mr. <hi>Rutherford,</hi> as to the <hi>Number</hi> and <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Church Officers;</hi> The Right of <hi>People</hi> to call their own <hi>Officers;</hi> The Unfitness of <hi>Scandalous Persons</hi> to be Members of a <hi>Visible Church;</hi> The Unwarrantableness of S<hi>eparation</hi> from Churches for certain Defective Circumstances; The Lawfulness, yea, Needfulness, of a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sociation</hi> among Churches; and Calling in the Help of such <hi>Consociations,</hi> upon Emerging Difficulties; and the Power of such <hi>Consocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> to proceed against a <hi>Particular Church,</hi> pertinaciously offending, with a Sentence of <hi>Non-Communion:</hi> He then proceeds to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, a <hi>Church-Congregational compleatly constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with all its Officers, as having full power in its self to Exercise all Church Discipline, in all the Censures thereof;</hi> and the Interest, which the <hi>Consent of the People</hi> is to have in the Exercise of this <hi>Discipline.</hi> The first fair and full Copy of this Book, was Drowned in its

§ 25. In his Administration of <hi>Church-Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline</hi> there were several Things, as <hi>Imitable,</hi> as <hi>Observable.</hi> As he was an hearty Friend unto the <hi>Consociation of Churches;</hi> and hence all the time, that he Lived, the <hi>Pastors</hi> of the Nighbouring Churches, held their frequent Meetings for mutual Consultation in things of common Concernment; so, in his own <hi>particular Church,</hi> he was very careful, to have every thing done with a Christian <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,</hi> and <hi>Unanimity.</hi> Wherefore he would have nothing publickly propounded unto the <hi>Brethren</hi> of the Church, but what had been first privately prepared by the <hi>Elders;</hi> and if he feared the happening of any <hi>Debate,</hi> his way aforehand was, to visit some of the more Noted and Leading <hi>Brethren,</hi> and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Engaged <hi>Them</hi> to second what he should move unto the Church, he rarely missed of a full Concurrence: to which purpose he would say, <hi>The Elders must have a Church in a Church, if they would preserve the Peace of the Church.</hi> But if any difficult or divided Agitation was Raised in the Church, about any matter offered, he would ever put a stop to that publick Agitation, by Delaying the <hi>Vote,</hi> until another Meeting; before which time, he would ordinarily by private Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, gain over such as were unsatisfied. As
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:000724_0266_0FAA473C3AC643C0"/>
for the <hi>Admission</hi> of Communicants unto the <hi>Lord's Table,</hi> he kept the <hi>Examination</hi> of them unto the <hi>Elders</hi> of the Church, as properly belonging unto their <hi>Work</hi> and <hi>Charge;</hi> and with his Elders he would order them to make before the whole Church a Profession of a <hi>Repenting Faith,</hi> as they were able, or willing to do it. Some, that could unto E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification do it, he put upon thus Relating the manner of their <hi>Conversion</hi> to God; but usually they only answered unto certain pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batory <hi>Questions,</hi> which were rendered them; and so after their <hi>Names</hi> had been for a few weeks before signified unto the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, to Learn whether any <hi>Objection</hi> or <hi>Exception</hi> could be made against them, of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing <hi>Scandalous</hi> in their <hi>Conversations,</hi> now Consenting unto, <hi>The Covenant,</hi> they were Admitted into the <hi>Church Communion.</hi> As for <hi>Ecclesiastical Censures,</hi> he was very watchful to prevent all Proceedures unto <hi>Them,</hi> as far as was consistent with the Rules of our Lord; for which cause (except in grosser Abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations) when <hi>Offences</hi> happened, he did his utmost, that the Notice thereof might be extended no further, than it was when they first were laid before him; and having Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled the Offenders with sensible and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient <hi>Acknowledgments</hi> of their Miscarriages, he would let the Notice thereof be confined

unto such as were aforehand therewith ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted; and hence there was but one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son <hi>Admonished</hi> in, and but one person <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated</hi> from, the Church of <hi>Hartford,</hi> in all the fourteen years, that Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> Lived there. He was much troubled at the too frequent <hi>Censures</hi> in some other Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; and he would say, <q>
                        <hi>Church Censures</hi> are things, wherewith neither we, nor our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have been acquainted, in the practice of them; and therefore the utmost Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection is needful, that we do not spoil the Ordinances of God, by our management thereof.</q> In this point he was like <hi>Beza,</hi> who defended the Ordinance of <hi>Excommunication</hi> against <hi>Erastus;</hi> and yet, he with his Collegues, were so cautelous in the use of it, that in eleven years, there was but one <hi>Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> passed in all <hi>Geneva.</hi>
