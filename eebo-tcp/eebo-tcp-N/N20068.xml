            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE quick ſale of the firſt impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his Treatiſe on the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes of Children, has encouraged the author to take ſome pains in correcting and enlarging this ſecond edition. He has at the ſame time endeavoured to avoid all unneceſſary details, and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs diſtinctions, as well as extending it to ſubjects foreign from the immediate deſign. Should the reader apprehend any little exceptions in this reſpect, he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> readily perceive the inducement; and although the accuracy of ſyſtem ſhould really be violated, it is preſumed, it has only given way to motives of humanity and uſefulneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vi" facs="unknown:026291_0003_0FCFAA3ACC3DF4F8"/>
Perfectly ſenſible, however, of nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous defects, the writer relies again upon the indulgence of the Public, though he hopes this edition will be found ſomewhat more compleat, and more worthy of a continuance of that favourable reception wherewith the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer was ſo generally honoured. Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular acknowledgements, indeed, are due for the approbation of the faculty; and the like candor, it is hoped, will now excuſe any alterations that have been intended to render this edition more eaſy and familiar to common read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. For the ſake of public utility, the writer has carefully avoided all technical terms, or has ſo explained them, and ſo enlarged on the nature of diſeaſes, and the doſes of medicines, that parents, and others not verſed in the practice of phyſic, may find all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon directions ſufficiently explicit: whenever they appear otherwiſe, read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of that deſcription ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the caſe is too difficult for their management, and that probably the beſt guide might miſlead them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vii" facs="unknown:026291_0004_0FD0DC26F8650EB8"/>
The prolixity of other parts may be equally diſagreeable to profeſſional men.—For the ſtyle in general, indeed, the author pretends to have but little to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer. Had he more leiſure, poſſibly the faults might have been fewer; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, the neceſſity of clearly and intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligibly expreſſing what is to be ſaid, may, in this inſtance, be pleaded with thoſe who expect conciſeneſs and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy; which every writer ſhould aim at. It may therefore be obſerved, that ſome conſentaneous diſeaſes have been longer dwelt upon, and their remedies oftener hinted, than might be neceſſary for many readers. To ſuch, however, as are themſelves obliged to ſuperintend the health of their children, and to thoſe who derive a happineſs from contribut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that of their offspring, there will not be much apology neceſſary, either for entering ſo fully into the LITTLE matters that compoſe the SECOND part of the work, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> for enlarging elſewhere on many circumſtances that may appear trifling when ſeparately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered. It was, indeed, very much with a view to their uſe and profit, that
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:026291_0005_0FCFAA3963DAF480"/>
the work was originally undertaken; and to their notice and protection it is again ſubmitted, in its improved ſtate, with all Deference and Reſpect.</p>

            <p>THE following pages being conceived to contain a pretty full account of the diſeaſes incident to childhood, and ſome of them ſcarcely known to preceding writers, may poſſibly throw ſome additional light on this important ſubject. They are, in this hope, reſpectfully offered to the notice of ſuch practitioners in phyſic, as may not have made the complaints of children their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſtudy. The motives which have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the writer to extend his plan to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther claſs of readers, it is preſumed, may juſtify ſuch an attempt. He has, indeed, long lamented the very improper method in which the diſorders of infants are treated by thoſe who deſign them the greateſt kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but whoſe miſtaken opinions too often counteract their benevolent intentions. The laudable affection of the fondeſt mother fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently becomes a ſource of manifold injury to her tender offspring: And this is not only the caſe among the lower claſs of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:026291_0019_0FCFAA20771E0028"/>
or in ſituations where medical aſſiſtance is procured with difficulty, but even in the metropolis itſelf, and in the higher ranks of the community, where many prejudices very hurtful to the eaſe and health of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſtill prevail.</p>
            <p>It is intelligent Parents therefore, as well as the medical world, to whoſe notice this work is addreſſed; and it is hoped, in the eſtimation of both, no formal apology can be neceſſary for taking up a ſubject, that has long called for a thorough inveſtigation.—For the manner in which it has been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted, the author, indeed, again ſolicits the candor of the public. The moſt reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table authorities, however, have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted, a proper attention been paid to facts, and his beſt endeavours exerted to obviate the effects of that peculiar veil<note n="*" place="bottom">There is nothing to which this peculiar obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity may be referred, but the incapacity of infants to deſcribe their own feelings.—There are, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, other ſources of information, leſs fallaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſometimes than the more literal deſcriptions of adults, which in nervous complaints particularly, would tend to perplex the ableſt phyſician if he ſhould always be led by them; and the like diſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination will ſerve him equally well in the treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of infants.</note> which is ſaid to obſcure infantile diſorders. A prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical arrangement of them has been ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and regard had to their reſpective cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and ſymptoms, tending to elucidate their
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:026291_0020_0FCFAA1E051010F8"/>
nature, and render their treatment more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious than has been generally imagined.</p>
            <p>To their immediate Diſeaſes, is added an attention to ſome of the principal Accidents and little Injuries to which infancy and childhood are peculiarly liable; which though not neceſſary, indeed, for ſome readers, it is preſumed will have their uſe, and may, poſſibly, prove no ſmall ſatisfaction to others. And here it may not be improper to obſerve, that whatever merit former publications may poſſeſs, it may, nevertheleſs, with great propriety be remarked, that they either make a part of ſome large ſyſtematic work, the bulk of which muſt be foreign from the intentions of a tract of this kind, or elſe they are far too conciſe, and have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted many complaints of too much import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to be overlooked.</p>
            <p>It has been generally lamented by writers on theſe diſeaſes, that this branch of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine has remained too much uncultivated. And, indeed, till of later years, little more has been attempted than getting rid of the wild prejudices and anile preſcriptions of the old writers, which had too often ſerved on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to obſcure the true nature of children's diſeaſes. Another, and a very principal cauſe of ſo ſtrange a neglect, has ariſen from an idea ſome people have entertained, that, as medical people can have but a very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect knowledge of the complaints of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:026291_0021_0FCFAA190D87C690"/>
from the inability of children to give any account of them, it is ſafer to intruſt the management of them to old women and nurſes; who, at leaſt, are not likely to do miſchief by violent remedies, though they may ſometimes make uſe of improper and inadequate ones.</p>
            <p>How fatal ſuch a miſtake muſt be, is ſurely ſufficiently obvious; ſince the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of infants is eventually the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of adults, of population, wealth, and every thing that can prove uſeful to ſociety, or add to the ſtrength and grandeur of a kingdom. It may, moreover, be obſerved, that where miſmanagement at this period does not actually deſtroy the life, it often very eſſentially impairs the health; the foundation of a future good or bad conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being frequently laid in a ſtate of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy.</p>
            <p>It is true, indeed, ſome laudable attempts have been made of late years to reſcue this important truſt from being indiſcriminately committed to ſuch dangerous hands; but it is ſtill to be lamented, that even in this libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral age, ſuch attempts have not been at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with all the ſucceſs they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. It cannot therefore be improper, that ſomething farther ſhould be advanced on the ſubject, in the hope of ſilencing the weak objections hitherto made againſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing the beſt advice as early as poſſible.
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:026291_0022_0FCF8B68478435A8"/>
And this is the more neceſſary, becauſe thoſe who have the greateſt intereſt in the ſubject, the moſt authority on the occaſion, and the ſincereſt affection for their offspring, have frequently the greateſt objections to medical aſſiſtance, till it is, ſometimes, too late to employ it with effect.—I may, indeed, be very inadequate to the taſk of obviating ſuch prejudices, but I ſhall ſtate an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or two that has always appeared to me of great weight.</p>
            <p>A principal objection, taken from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the incapacity of infants to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe their complaints, has been ſlightly no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed already, and has been more fully diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed in a treatiſe written about twenty years ſince, by Dr. Armſtrong.<note n="*" place="bottom">This edition did not contain more than a dozen diſeaſes; being confined to the hooping-cough, ſcro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fula, teething, and the diſorders of the firſt-paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages. In the year 1783, Dr. Armſtrong publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſecond edition conſiderably enlarged. It ſo happened, that I had not ſeen it when the firſt edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the preſent work appeared, or I ſhould cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taily have taken due notice of it, in regard to ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral diſorders, mentioned in the Doctor's latter edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; to which therefore I ſhall now attend, as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion ſhall offer.</note> It is apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remarked by this writer, that the ſame difficulty occurs in a variety of the moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous complaints of adults at every period of life, which confeſſedly require the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt aſſiſtance; ſuch are attacks of phrenzy,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:026291_0023_0FCF8B4F21EEF748"/>
delirium, and ſome kinds of convulſions: to which may be added, all the diſorders of idiots and lunatics. But theſe have been ſucceſsfully treated in every age, not except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing even lunacy itſelf, and the melancholy ſubject happily reſtored to ſociety, his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and himſelf.</p>
            <p>It has likewiſe been obſerved, if infants for the reaſons abovementioned are to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the benefit of a phyſician's advice, it is difficult to ſay at what age children may ſafely be intruſted to his care; ſince at the age of five or ſix years, they would fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently miſlead the enquirer, who ſhould truſt to their own account of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints. Their ideas of things are too in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinct to afford us ſufficient information, and they accordingly often call ſickneſs at the ſtomach, pain, and pain, ſickneſs; they will frequently make no reply to general queſtions, and when they are aſked more particularly whether they have any pain in one or another part of the body, they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt certainly anſwer in the affirmative; though it afterwards frequently turns out they were miſtaken.</p>
            <p>To this idea I will venture to add, that although infants can give no account of their complaints in the manner we receive information from adults, their diſeaſes are all plainly and ſufficiently marked by the countenance, the age, the manifeſt ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:026291_0024_0FCFAA1793C71858"/>
and the faithful account given by the parent, or an intelligent nurſe. This I am ſo confident of, that I never feel more at my eaſe, in preſcribing for any diſorders than thoſe of infants, and never ſucceed with more uniformity, or more agreeable to the opinion I may have adopted of the ſeat and nature of the diſeaſe. Every diſtemper may be ſaid, in ſome ſenſe, to have a language of its own, and it is the buſineſs of the phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician to be acquainted with it; nor do thoſe of children ſpeak leſs intelligibly.<note n="*" place="bottom">In neither of theſe ſentiments do I ſtand alone; Harris, of whoſe work Sydenham is thought to have ſpoken ſo highly, has ſaid the ſame things—"In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certae vero diagnoſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Having briefly ſtated this matter, as I hope, with impartiality, and given it the attention its importance demands, I ſhall next obſerve, that, as the complaints of infants are more obvious than it has been generally ſuppoſed, ſo their number is comparatively ſmall, their cauſe uniform,<note n="†" place="bottom">It may perhaps be objected to this idea, that their various diſeaſes cannot all originate from one and the <hi>ſame</hi> cauſe; nor is it my intention to aſſert it, though it is, indeed, true, in regard to a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of them. It is to be remarked likewiſe, that it is the complaints of <hi>early infancy</hi> that are here particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly ſpoken of; though it is nevertheleſs very evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that there is a greater <hi>uniformity</hi> alſo in the <hi>cauſes</hi> of ſeveral diſorders even of older children, than there is in thoſe of adults, which have very often various, and diſſimular remote cauſes, at diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent times, and in different habits: E.

For the proof of this, as well as in order to eſtabliſh a rational practice, I ſhall firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Cauſes and Diagnoſtics, or ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic nature of their complaints, before I at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to enter upon their Cure.</p>
            <p>And here I ſhall not attend to the various remote cauſes, but ſhall confine myſelf to a practical conſideration of the ſubject, and briefly point out their obvious occaſions and ſymptoms. And on this account, I ſhall not take notice of the various changes which nature herſelf induces during the growth of the infant, as it paſſes from one ſtage of life to another; which is, doubtleſs, a remote cauſe of ſome of their complaints.</p>
            <p>A principal CAUSE, mentioned by anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and modern writers, is the great moiſture and laxity of infants; which is neceſſary, however, in order to the extenſion of parts, and the rapid growth of young children. This laxity ariſes from the vaſt glandular ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, their glands in general being much larger in proportion, than thoſe of adults. I might inſtance in the thymus gland, and particularly in the pancreas and liver. But beſides theſe, there are innumerable glands ſituate within the mouth, in the gullet, ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach and bowels, which are continually pouring out their contents into the firſt-paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages. This is, doubtleſs, a wiſe proviſion of nature, and I cannot, therefore, think with Dr. Armſtrong, that the gaſtric, or
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:026291_0027_0FCFAA0E011E83A8"/>
ſtomach juice, renders the chyle leſs fit for abſorption; but, as we do not ſtrictly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low her dictates in the management of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, as to their food, manner of clothing, ſleeping, &amp;c. this abundance of ſlimy mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may often overload the ſtomach and bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, the conſtant ſeat of the firſt complaints in the infant ſtate.<note n="*" place="bottom">Non quod aetas per ſe ſit cauſa illius morbi, eſt enim res naturalis et temporis determinatio, ſed quia diſponit ad morbos quoſdam facilius ſuſcipiendos, ſi causae corum acceſſerint.—PRIMEROS: <hi>de Morb.

In addition to theſe gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral cauſes may be reckoned the want of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, which at a more advanced age, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily for us, we are obliged to make uſe of, and which art, in general, does not duly ſupply in regard to children.<note n="†" place="bottom">Exerciſe is the grand mean of health.—The ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rational ſpecies are capable of affording it to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves almoſt as ſoon as born; and though infant children are not, they are paſſive, and can be <hi>exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed.</hi> Nature and inſtinct point out the expediency of it, and the fond mother who follows only her own inclination, naturally, and inſenſibly adopts it, and is continually ſtroking and playing with the little idol of her heart, whenever it is awake; and as it grows older, ſhe is led on to give it more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, as it can bear it, and according to the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction the infant never fails to manifeſt on the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.</note>

            <p>Having thus briefly adverted to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Cauſes and Symptoms, I ſhall now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the conſideration of the Diſorders themſelves; and ſhall begin with the</p>

               <p>THE Meconium is that black, viſcid, or tenacious matter, which, it is well known, every infant parts with by ſtool, for the two or three firſt days after it is born, or retains it to its manifeſt injury.</p>
               <p>The ordinary ſource of infantile com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints has already been ſaid to originate from ſomething amiſs in the firſt paſſages, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the moſt ancient opinions<note n="*" place="bottom">HIPPOC.

<pb n="13" facs="unknown:026291_0030_0FCFAA0ADB66B988"/>
place, that though it ſhould not be all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, yet a part will often remain much longer than has been uſually imagined, and will come away, perhaps unnoticed, at a late period, where no retention of it has been ſuſpected. Of this I can have no doubt, having been called to viſit infants after the month has been expired, who have been unwell through all that period, for want of having been properly purged, and from whom meconium has ſtill been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away. A tea-ſpoonful of caſtor-oil, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven once or more, has ſoon carried off a great quantity; upon which all their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints have diſappeared.</p>
               <p>The meconium appears to be no longer of uſe after the child is come into the world, unleſs it be to keep the bowels from collap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, till they be repleniſhed with the aliment the child is ſoon afterwards to receive. Whereas, if it be not ſoon carried off, it will not only change the quality of the milk, or other food, as it deſcends into the bowels, but itſelf alſo becomes highly acrid, (as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts chiefly of gall) and cannot fail to produce indigeſtion, flatulency, pain, purging or coſtiveneſs, and other ſimilar evils: And the meconium is farther diſpoſed to this acrid ſtate, on another account, <abbr>

For though a child ſhould even be ſuckled by its own mother, (in which caſe, there is, doubtleſs, leſs occaſion for other aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance) yet we know that nature doth not, in every inſtance, always fully accompliſh her own deſigns: and it is from ſome ſtriking inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the truth of theſe obſervations, that I have ſaid ſo much on this ſubject, which I have alſo been the more inclined to, becauſe ſo many writers have paſſed it over almoſt in ſilence.</p>

               <p>For this purpoſe, amongſt others, a new remedy has of late years been recommended as preferable to any purging medicines what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.<note n="†" place="bottom">Dr. ARMSTRONG <hi>on the Diſeaſes moſt fatal to infants.</hi> 1767.</note> Mankind has ever delighted in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes—no ſooner has any thing, formerly judged to be hurtful, or even poiſonous, been found in certain caſes, to be very uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, than it is ſuppoſed to be capable of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every thing, and ſuperſedes all that the wiſdom of former ages has proved to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutary. Hence, ſome advantages experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced from the uſe of wine of antimony, in a variety of children's complaints, as far as they ariſe from one common cauſe, has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced ſome people to extol it as an univerſal remedy.

The ſtomach contains ſtill leſs, as no bile can enter it but by regurgitation from the <hi>duo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denum,</hi> and the gaſtric juice is in ſmall quantity, not enough to be brought up by an emetic without violent ſtraining; which I ſhould imagine it can anſwer no good end to excite by a vomit, the firſt hour a child comes into the world.</note> It is univerſally allowed, and by this

writer alſo, that emetics are not to be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtered when the bowels are full, which, in this inſtance, is preciſely the caſe. It is true, the wine of antimony does not always vomit children, nor will a little matter often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times do this, (as I ſhall have occaſion to take notice very ſoon); it is ſometimes, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, found to act as a purgative: but if this be the intention, why not adhere to the old, and more certain method, and direct at once ſuch things whoſe proper operation may be depended upon? Not the ſtomach, but the bowels, are the natural and ſafe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let for moſt complaints of children, and a want of due attention to this circumſtance has been productive of ſome evils, which many practitioners, I think, are not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently aware of.</p>
               <p>It is very evident, that ſome gentle pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative is indicated on this occaſion, and that it ſhould be of a kind that will create as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle diſturbance as poſſible, and eſpecially ſhould not be of an offenſive, or indigeſtible nature; though ſuch have been very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly adviſed.

little matter will ſuffice; perhaps a little ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup of roſes, diluted with ſome thin gruel, and given occaſionally by tea-ſpoonfuls, will moſtly anſwer the end; will alſo ſerve to keep the child quiet, and ſo prevent the nurſe from giving it improper food. But if this ſhould fail to procure ſtools, a watery infuſion of rhubarb, (or a tea-ſpoonful of the wine, diluted as above) will be found preferable to the indigeſtible oily mixtures in common uſe.<note n="*" place="bottom">See HARRIS.</note> In the country, where the above medicines may not be at hand, a little freſh whey and honey will be an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſubſtitute.<note n="†" place="bottom">

Indeed, it were impoſſible, in many inſtances, ſo to preſcribe, as to afford no lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to the diſcretion of thoſe who are watching the infant, and are eye-witneſſes to all its complaints; and I might rather lead the leſs intelligent into er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, by attempting to lay down very particular and preciſe directions.</p>
                     <p>The rules I ſhall here offer will chiefly refer to <hi>vomits, purges, anodynes,</hi> (or <hi>compoſing</hi> medicines) and the <hi>teſtaceous powders,</hi> or <hi>abſorbents.</hi>

The objection now made to oily medicines is very much increaſed, from nurſes ſcarcely ever giving the quantity that is directed, in the courſe of the firſt twenty-four hours, as it is always deſigned; and adminiſtering the reſt long after the child has begun to ſuck, or to feed. At this period, mixing with the nouriſhment, it has a direct tendency to produce indigeſtion, wind, and the very complaints, which the oils, adminiſtered in proper time, were deſigned to prevent. Not to add, that ſome kind of oily medicine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the uſual purgative on this occaſion, is an inducement to parents and nurſes to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure

               <p>But it has been obſerved, the meconium is not always diſpoſed to come away, even by the aſſiſtance of common purgative me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines. Having, therefore, begun with ſuch as the above, if the child has no ſtool for twelve or fourteen hours after birth, and eſpecially if it ſhould ſeem to be in pain, a cliſter ought to be thrown up; which may be repeated, if neceſſary, a few hours af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards. And here I would obſerve, that in the caſes where more powerful means are required, ſcarcely any evacuation will be procured by theſe gentle means; for, as I have ſeen, wherever I could procure one copious ſtool by a clyſter, or gentle laxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, the reſt of the meconium has come away with little, or no farther aſſiſtance. But as it ſometimes happens, that neither clyſters nor purgatives have any ſufficient ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect for ſeveral days, very powerful means muſt then be made uſe of; there being rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ſuſpect a ſuſpenſion of nervous influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.

I ſhall cloſe this ſubject therefore, with a recent inſtance of this kind, (of which, I have ſeen many) as a proof of what powerful remedies may ſometimes be required, and how neceſſary it is to pay ſome attention to this firſt complaint of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants.</p>
               <p>The child was born of very healthy pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, (not at all of conſtipated habits) after a quick and comprehenſively eaſy labour, on the 22d. of February.—To avoid prolixity, I ſhall not ſtate the caſe in the form of jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; but ſhall only obſerve, that the child took a little rhubarb an hour or two after it was born; but having had no ſtool when I ſaw it the next day, I ordered a clyſter to be thrown up. In the evening, the child be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came drowſy and inſenſible, and when rouz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it moaned, but ſeemed unable to cry. It continued pretty much in this ſtate, (and at times, ſeemingly, in great pain, and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently convulſed) for ſix days; and was nouriſhed chiefly by a tea-ſpoon with a little breaſt-milk, ſeldom reviving ſufficiently to to ſuck.</p>
               <p>It had no ſtools, but ſuch as made only a few ſpots on the cloths about the ſize of a ſhilling, till the twenty-ſeventh, and thoſe were very ſmall, hard, and lumpy. On the twenty-eighth it had more of this kind, and it had not till the twenty-ninth any thing like a proper ſtool, which was alſo
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:026291_0039_0FCFA9FC8D9BC7A8"/>
mixed with hard lumps; but on the third of March, they were thinner, and on the fifth came very freely.—In the courſe of ſix and thirty hours, I preſcribed two ounces of the common infuſion of ſenna, two drams of ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelle ſalts, four grains of jalap, and a grain of calomel; beſides purging clyſters, and the uſe of the warm bath. The next day the child took four grains of ipecacuanha at two doſes, and forty drops of the new wine of antimony, at four times (in the courſe of an hour) without any effect; and at another period, ſix drams of caſtor-oil, beſides ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral doſes of manna.<note n="*" place="bottom">From ſuch inſtances as theſe, as well as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark already offered on the <hi>Locked jaw</hi> of the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> the expediency of having recourſe to ſome ſafe and effectual means of purging off the meconium ſeems to be evidently pointed out; more eſpecially when we conſider the dangerous complaints, which are ſaid to ariſe in ſome of the hoſpitals in <hi>Paris</hi> from an undue retention of this viſcid matter.</note> Three days after the child got rid of the meconium, the thruſh made its appearance; which was ſlight, but continued above three weeks.</p>

               <p>THE Jaundice of infants ſeems always to have been improperly conceived of. Thoſe who have written only on children's

On the other hand, parents and nurſes have uſually ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the common yellowneſs that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears about the third day after birth (term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſome yellow-gum) as the true jaundice. Neither of theſe opinions ſeem to me to be juſt; for the latter of theſe appearances re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires no attention at all, and though infants are not ſubject to the troubleſome jaundice of adults, (unleſs infected by the breaſt-milk) they nevertheleſs are liable to ſome affections of that kind which claim ſome at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. Theſe are eaſily diſtinguiſhed from the common yellowneſs, mentioned above, by the <hi>tunica albuginea,</hi> or white of the eyes being always very yellow; but the nails are not tinged, as in the jaundice of adults, though it is probable they uſually would be, if the complaint were long neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, and the child ſuffered to be coſtive. I have waited ſome days to ſee if the yellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs would go off of itſelf, as the uſual tinge does; but it has always increaſed ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than diminiſhed. It ariſes from viſcid matter obſtructing the gall-ducts, which open into the <hi>duodenum,</hi> and therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a little emetic. Wine of antimony is a very proper one on this occaſion, as it may likewiſe procure two or three ſtools;
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:026291_0041_0FCFA9FACA2EFAB8"/>
but as children in this complaint are not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily made to vomit, ſhould the wine fail, I would adviſe three or four grains of the the powder of ipecacuanha, which is more certain in its operation; and the next day give four or five grains of rhubarb. Should the ſymptoms continue, the emetic ought to be repeated after two or three days, and rhubarb be given about every other day, till the yellowneſs diſappears; which, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this treatment, never continues more than ten or twelve days, unleſs the ſtools are of a very pale colour; in which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The true jaundice, diſtinguiſhed by the ſkin being every where diſcoloured, as well as the whites of the eyes, ſeems to be much more common among new-born infants in France, than in this country; as appears by a memoir written by Mr. Baumes, and to which a prize-medal of the <hi>Faculty of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine</hi> in <hi>Paris</hi> has been adjudged.</p>
               <p>In this work the various cauſes and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the diſeaſe are diſtinguiſhed; and a correſpondent treatment pointed out with great accuracy and judgment.

               <p>ANY derangement of the firſt-paſſages is capable of giving riſe to various complaints, among which, that of inward-fits, has lately been taken notice of by ſome medical people, but I think ſcarcely deſerves the name of a diſeaſe. It demands atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, however, becauſe ſo much has been ſaid about it as to expoſe the fond parent to continual apprehenſions, left this ſubtile diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe ſhould be inſenſibly at work, and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing way for more ſevere and outward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions.</p>
               <p>A conſtant ſymptom in this kind of fit, as it is called, is the infant's little mouth being drawn into a ſmile; which whoever has no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed muſt have beheld it with pleaſure. And if the complaint extends no farther than this ſmiling, which is generally in its ſleep, it ariſes merely from a little wind, and is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly harmleſs, becauſe the wind in this caſe is not really confined; and therefore an immediate recourſe to pukes or purges, is more likely to do harm, by ſtraining the ſtomach, or by relaxing the bowels, than to do any good. Every body is acquainted with the effects of different degrees of irritation of the nerves, from the ſenſation produced by tickling with a feather, to that of a hard
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:026291_0044_0FCFA9F38E2B1340"/>
gripe, or a violent ſtroke. The firſt may be ſaid to be pleaſing; and ſuch, I doubt not, is the ſtimulus in queſtion on the ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous coat of the ſtomach of little infants, and therefore produces ſo agreeable a ſmile, that I could never conſider it as an indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of pain. Indeed, I know of no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint that ought to be termed inward fits; and I mention this, becauſe nurſes are continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally talking to us about them, when children are perfectly well, and often give the fond parent needleſs diſtreſs, as well as many an unpleaſant medicine to the child.<note n="*" place="bottom">It were certainly a good rule, to adminiſter no medicine to infants for ſuch ſymptoms as do not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate ſome real complaint, unleſs where experience proves that ſuch ſymptoms neglected are apt to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run ſome well known diſeaſe.</note> They are at the ſame time treating the true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion, whilſt ſlight, in the ſame way, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing led into the error by the ideas of inward fits; a term they are ever uſing but have no preciſe ideas of, nor do any two of them mean the ſame thing by it. It were therefore better, perhaps, the term were altogether aboliſhed; as the child is either evidently convulſed, or has no kind of fit, at leaſt none for which any remedy can be offered.<note n="†" place="bottom">Infants, as well as adults, do ſometimes, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, die ſuddenly without any manifeſt convulſion. But this more frequently happens after over-feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ariſes from a ſpaſm of the ſtomach; or ſometimes of the heart or lungs; and infants may then be ſaid to die of inward-fits, there being no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal convulſion; but this is, by no means, the kind of affection uſually underſtood by that term.</note>—If the child ſhould
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:026291_0045_0FCFA9F2B50355B8"/>
ſleep too long, and this ſmile ſhould often return, the infant may be taken up, gently tapped on the back, and its ſtomach and belly be well rubbed by the fire; which is all that can be neceſſary. This gentle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe will bring a little wind from its ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, and the child will go to ſleep again quietly.</p>
               <p>This complaint, however, is largely treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of by ſome writers, and Dr. Armſtrong wiſhes to give a few drops of the wine of antimony; but it is very apparent, that when he conſiders it as worthy of more at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention than I have juſt now adviſed, it is either a true convulſion, in which the eyes are diſtorted, and the mouth is diſcompoſed, inſtead of putting on a ſmile, or elſe he is preſcribing for another diſeaſe under the name of inward-fits, which former writers have treated under the head of diſorders ariſing from coſtiveneſs and wind. But if this little turn of the features ſhould ariſe from conſtant over-feeding it, were endleſs to adminiſter emetics; the cauſe of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:026291_0046_0FCFA9EEDAAE2B70"/>
is obvious, and upon the removal of it the remedy muſt reſt.</p>
               <p>Such has ever been my opinion of this much-talked-of complaint; and indeed I have not to this day, after a good deal of attention to infants, ſeen any thing myſelf to induce me alter it; or I would in this edition, have cheerfully retracted the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding obſervations. As I wiſh, however, to afford all the information I can on every complaint, I have to obſerve, that it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by ſome gentlemen of great reſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and experience, that though the term, inward-fits, has been often miſapplied, there is really ſuch a complaint, and that it gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally proves fatal. Beſides a little blueneſs of the lips, and ſlight turning up of the eyes, often noticed by nurſes, this complaint is deſcribed to me as attended with a peculiar ſound of the voice (ſomewhat like the croup) and a very quick breathing, at intervals; and is ſuppoſed to ariſe from a ſpaſm of the ſtomach, lungs, or other vital organ; a complaint I have indeed too frequently ſeen,<note n="*" place="bottom">See Note, pages, 27, 28.</note> but certainly very different from that uſually known by inward-fits.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſymptoms are ſaid frequently to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack the child in the ſleep; and in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement will go off upon taking it up
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:026291_0047_0FCFA9EAC174DD20"/>
from its cradle. They are likewiſe obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be induced by ſucking or feeding, and to be increaſed upon any little exertion of body, or tranſient ſurpriſe, and in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to recur for a length of time, before they become alarming. The remedies pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed for the cure of this complaint are an emetic, on the firſt attack, and afterwards volatiles and fetids; but, as it has been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, not often to good effect.</p>
               <p>In regard to coſtiveneſs and wind, which have been ſaid to be the parent of what nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes commonly term inward-fits, as they do not always ariſe from one and the ſame cauſe, and are productive of other complaints than thoſe above mentioned, I ſhall conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them by themſelves; which, it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, will be purſuing a more rational plan, than adhering to a term obſcure in itſelf, and indicative of a diſeaſe not well defined, and which therefore may tend to miſlead the generality of readers.</p>

               <p>IT has been uſual with ancient writers, when conciſeneſs and accuracy were not ſo much conſidered as in the preſent day, to treat of coſtiveneſs and wind as diſtinct heads of complaint; and for the reaſons aforementioned, as well as from this little tract being calculated for general uſefulneſs, and not merely for medical readers, it may not be altogether improper to comply with this cuſtom.</p>
               <p>Wind is but a mere ſymptom of ſome preceding or attending complaint; nor are its troubleſome effects either occaſioned or increaſed by air taken in with the food, as many people have imagined; atmoſpheric air being eſſentially different from that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by indigeſtion, whether owing to the weakneſs of the ſtomach, as it is called, or the improper quality or quantity of the food taken into it. It may, however, prove a ſource of many complaints, and create watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, ſtartings, hiccoughs, vomitings, and even convulſions, if not timely attended to, eſpecially if the infant is coſtive.</p>
               <p>Coſtiveneſs is either conſtitutional, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental, which ought always to be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, the former being oftentimes harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs; and, indeed, children of ſuch a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit

And this will be eſpecially neceſſary, in the caſe of children who are ſubject to fits; fine luſty infants being often ſeized with violent convulſions, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other apparent cauſe than a natural coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſtate of the bowels, and as uniformly recovered from the fits, merely by procur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtools, and breaking off the wind. And this diſpoſition to fits has taken place long before the ordinary period of teething, and has continued till children have been a twelve-month old; at which time the ſolids, and eſpecially the nervous ſyſtem, has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to get ſtronger. In ſuch habits, a quarter of an ounce of manna, or the like quantity of the ſyrup of roſes, may be put into any liquid, and as much of it given by tea-ſpoonsful, as ſhall open the belly: or a tea-ſpoonful of caſtor-oil,<note n="*" place="bottom">Oil of caſtor may be rendered very acceptable to children, if rubbed down with gum arabic, and a little manna, and afterwards made into a draught or mixture with ſome dill-water, and the addition of a drop or two of the compound ſpirit of ammonia, where that may be proper.</note> or from five to ten drops of the compound tincture of aloes,
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:026291_0050_0FCFA9E611C1E218"/>
may be taken two or three times a-week. And here it may not be uſeleſs to obſerve, that rhubarb will not be a fit purgative, though it be joined with magneſia, which will not ſufficiently counteract its reſtringen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. Another reaſon for objecting to this compound, is that of its being the almoſt conſtant preſcription of nurſes on every oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, whoſe <hi>indiſcriminate</hi> uſe of it is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally needleſs, and ſometimes prejudicial; rhubarb alone, in ordinary caſes, anſwering all the purpoſe intended, whilſt the magne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia makes an unneceſſary addition to the bulk of the medicine, which ſhould always be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided for children. A few grains of mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſia in a ſpoonful of water, and ſweetened with a little manna, forms a much neater medicine, and in coſtive habits, which uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally abound with acidity, anſwers very well in <hi>early</hi> infancy.</p>
               <p>But if the child be otherwiſe in health, it has been ſaid, it is, in general, inadviſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to do much to counteract the natural habit of body. I have formerly, even dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the month, directed manna, even to half an ounce at a time, to very little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, unleſs it were almoſt daily repeated, and have at other times given from three to five grains of jalap; till I learned there are ſome conſtitutions, even in infants, where the bowels cannot be kept open without a daily exhibition of ſome purgative medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:026291_0051_0FCFA9E3EC5C3B50"/>
and that many ſuch children are as well left to themſelves, and require only to be watched. If a ſtool ſhould be wanted, however, a ſuppoſitory made of a little ſlip of paper, twiſted up, and well moiſtened with oil, may be very eaſily introduced, and will generally anſwer the purpoſe: or ſhould this fail, a bit of <hi>Caſtile</hi> ſoap may be intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in like manner.</p>

If the child be not uſually coſtive, rhubarb<note n="*" place="bottom">Some writers have in this caſe recommended oil, and particularly the <hi>French,</hi> who adminiſter oil of almonds to infants much too frequently.

complaint, eſpecially if brought up by hand. It ſometimes happens, however, that much more powerful medicines than rhubarb may be required, whether the child be natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly coſtive, or not; and in ſuch caſes, much caution is neceſſary on the part of parents and nurſes: For, where a proper doſe of ſenna-tea has proved ineffectual, it is ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing what large doſes even of rough pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges have been given in vain, or ſometimes to the injury of the child. On ſuch occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, I would rather adviſe a recourſe to clyſters, and eſpecially thoſe made of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cotorine aloes. From five to twenty grains, according to the age of the infant, diſſolved in boiled milk, will rarely, if ever fail of procuring two or three ſtools, eſpecially if preceded by the exhibition of a purge.

in the bowels, which had long continued obſtinate, though, in other reſpects, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly treated.</p>
               <p>As there is uſually too much acidity in the firſt-paſſages in coſtive and windy habits, a little magneſia may be given for a few days after the coſtiveneſs has been remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and if the child be ſuckled, the nurſe's diet muſt be attended to. If any flatulency ſhould ſtill remain, (which will not often be the caſe if it has ariſen merely from conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation) a little dill-water is the moſt harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs carminative. But ſhould it be an atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant upon a lax ſtate of the bowels and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digeſtion, its remedy will conſiſt in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of thoſe complaints, which will be noticed in their place.</p>
               <p>I have hitherto ſpoken chiefly of Coſtive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; wind being, however, likewiſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a real complaint, though it ſhould not happen to be ſo confined as to become an occaſion of fits. The only inſtances of this kind, indeed, that I remember having ſeen, have been in new-born and very luſty infants, whoſe mothers have alſo been pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly diſtreſſed by affections of that kind. This is, indeed, a ſomewhat anile way of ſpeaking, but it ſtates the preciſe fact; and one inſtance of an infant ſuffering in this way was ſo remarkable, that it may be worth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticing in this place.</p>
               <p>In this caſe, the meconium began to paſs off ſoon after birth, but not without repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:026291_0054_0FCFA9DD0D467BB8"/>
clyſters, purgatives, and the warm-bath, and was peculiarly viſcid, as well as in vaſt quantity. Nevertheleſs, the infant appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for ſeveral days, likely to be ſtrangled, and was black in the face, merely through the abundance of wind in the firſt-paſſages; though it was continually breaking off both by the mouth and the bowels, and by that peculiar, and very loud noiſe, when it came upwards, frequently obſerved in the hyſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical ſpaſm of adults, and continuing for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral hours together, ſo that the infant was often thought to be dying. The whole face, except the noſe, became exceedingly ſwelled, ſo that the infant could ſcarcely open its eyes, though without any diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louration of the ſkin; being probably ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to wind diffuſed through the cellular membrane; the tumor ſubſiding immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately upon getting rid of the wind from the ſtomach and bowels.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſymptoms, however, yielded to carminative juleps, and purging medicines; and the infant after the meconium was all come away, was freed from every com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, without any farther ſemblance of fits, though frequently apprehended.</p>

               <p>THIS is frequently a ſymptom of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going complaints, and is to be remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by opening the belly, and afterwards adminiſtering ſome pleaſant and carminative pearl-julep;<note n="*" place="bottom">This remedy has been ſo called from having been formerly compoſed of prepared pearls, and the name is here retained becauſe familiar to ſome readers; but the pearls having no virtue peculiar to them, are very ſeldom made uſe of.

               <p>Watchings may ariſe from worms, purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, gripings from acrid breaſt-milk, or other food, and from indigeſtion, as well as from every thing capable of producing pain; each of which will be conſidered in their proper place. The ſeat of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint is, indeed, uſually in the firſt paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and in very young infants is frequently owing to coſtiveneſs.

               <p>Theſe ſources of diſeaſe are mentioned merely with the view of pointing out the ſymptoms by which they may be known, and not of attempting a remedy; which is out of our power. The recital, however, may ſerve to prevent fruitleſs attempts, and
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:026291_0058_0FCF8B3CF1165090"/>
perhaps the aggravation of the ſymptoms, and conſequent diſtreſs of the patient, where upon due knowledge of the diſeaſe, art has, evidently, nothing to offer. The imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections are owing merely to an original malformation of parts, or in the two latter inſtances, to a deficiency in the powers of the ſyſtem ſoon after birth; the only time in which that diverſion to the circulation can take place, which nature has intended upon the change made in conſequence of reſpiration.</p>
               <p>The preciſe time when this change ſhould take place, is not attempted to be ſettled, the paſſages being open in children of very different ages; nor do both always cloſe at the ſame time. It is conjectured, however, that this proceſs ought to begin from the birth, as it is found to do in the remains of the veſſels of the navel-ſtring;<note n="*" place="bottom">It is probable, however, that they are not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry firmly cloſed for ſome time, as I have eaſily for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the veſſels open, by an injection, in children who died at the end of the month.</note> ſo that, although the fatal apertures in the heart ſhould not be actually impervious at the end of ſome months, it is imagined a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction uſually takes place, and that, at leaſt, ſome check is given to the blood's paſſing from one ſide of the heart to the other, in the free manner it does in the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:026291_0059_0FCFA9D417278938"/>
This, it is natural enough to conceive, and I apprehend, is owing to a greater quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of blood ruſhing into the lungs, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of reſpiration, (which leſſens the difficulty of entering that organ); by which means, a greater quantity flows into the left auricle from the pulmonary veins, which filling the part, prohibits an entry from the right. Upon the like principle, the <hi>aorta</hi> being more diſtended by a large quantity of blood from the left ventricle, prevents the pulmonary artery from emptying itſelf into it by the <hi>canalis arterioſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sometimes one of theſe apertures is found open, and the other cloſed up, eſpecially the <hi>canalis arterioſus,</hi> which is of the greater conſequence; the <hi>foramen ovale</hi> having in ſeveral inſtances been found pervious in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dults; and it is imagined is always ſo, in thoſe divers, who can remain the better part of an hour under water.</p>
               <p>Whether the preternatural aperture be in the veſſels, auricles, or ventricles, or whereſoever any morbid ſtricture may be, whenever it may prove of any conſequence, the conſtant ſymptoms attending it are a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colouration of the face and neck, with a ſloe-blue, or leaden colour of the lips, ſuch as is met with in ſome fits of aſthma. Theſe take place ſoon after birth, and the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louration is increaſed, and attended with
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:026291_0060_0FCFA9D28C0DEC18"/>
difficulty of breathing, as often as the child is any wiſe agitated; but are not relieved by procuring ſtools, by the warm-bath, or any other mean made uſe of as a remedy for fits; nor can be, but by the child being kept as tranquil as poſſible.</p>
               <p>If the aperture be in the <hi>canalis arteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſus,</hi> children uſually ſink very ſoon under the complaint, of which I have ſeen one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance only a few months ſince; but if the aperture be in the inferior parts of the heart, infants may ſurvive for months, or even for years.

The ſwelling is but mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate, but after becoming hard, the parts turn purple, livid, and very often mortify; eſpecially in boys, when it falls on the ſcro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum; the penis ſwells, and the prepuce puts on that kind of emphyſematous, or windy appearance, which it has in children when a ſtone is ſticking in the paſſage; or in the dropſy of the ſcrotum.</p>
               <p>Upon examining ſeveral bodies after death, the contents of the belly have frequently been found glued together, and their ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face covered with inflammatory exudation, exactly ſimilar to that found in women who
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:026291_0063_0FCFA9CB4B5B5940"/>
have died of puerperal fever. In males, the <hi>tunicae vaginales</hi> have been ſometimes filled with matter, which has evidently made its way from the cavity of the abdomen, and accounts for the appearances of the organs of generation juſt now deſcribed: in fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males, the <hi>labia pudendi</hi> are affected in like manner, the pus having forced a paſſage through the abdominal rings.</p>
               <p>Various means were made uſe of at the <hi>Britiſh Lying-in Hoſpital</hi> without ſucceſs, though the progreſs of the inflammation ſeemed to be checked for a while by ſatur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine fomentations and poultices, applied on the the very firſt appearance of the inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; but it ſoon ſpread, and a mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation preſently came on; or where matter had been formed, the tender infant ſunk un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the diſcharge. It is now ſome years ſince I propoſed making trial of the bark, to which ſometimes a little confectio aromatica has been added; from which time ſeveral have recovered. My colleague Dr. Garthſhore, has for ſeveral years paſt directed the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of linen compreſſes wrung out of cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorated ſpirit, in the place of the compound water of acitated litharge which has proved more ſucceſsful in checking the inflammation in ſeveral inſtances; nevertheleſs, the greater number of infants attacked with this diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ſtill ſink under its violence, and many of them in a very few days.</p>

Since the former edition of this tract, the ſame diſeaſe, as I apprehend, has appeared once in a new form, in the <hi>Britiſh Lying-in Hoſpital.</hi> In this inſtance, the infant was not only <hi>born</hi> with hard, and ſublivid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammatory patches, and ichorous veſicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, about the belly and thighs, but other ſpots were already actually in a ſtate of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification. An eſchar ſoon ſpread to near three inches in length upon the ſpine of the <hi>tibia,</hi> and other ſmaller ones appeared about the legs, and on ſeveral of the toes and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. The parents of the child appeared to enjoy good health, and the mother had plenty of good milk, which her infant was fortunately able to take in great quantity. The child was hereby duly nouriſhed; and taking likewiſe every day, from the time the mortification began to ſpread, from four to ſix ounces of a ſtrong decoction of the bark, it was ſupported under an exceſſive diſcharge of matter, through this tedious diſeaſe. The parts affected were at the ſame time frequently fomented, and were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times wrapped up in warm cataplaſms, and at others, dreſſed with <hi>theriaca,</hi> as the ſloughs became looſe; and were covered with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes wrung out of camphorated ſpirit. The infant, however, loſt two joints of one of its fingers, and the firſt of another; all the other fingers, and the toes, contrary to expectation, throwing off the mortified parts,
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:026291_0065_0FCFA9C8C8F0DD38"/>
were recovered entirely, and the child was ſent out of the hoſpital perfectly well; and I had the ſatisfaction of ſeeing it in good health, ſeveral months afterwards.</p>

               <head>APTHAE, or THRUSH.</head>
               <p>HAVING conſidered the above early com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, I return to thoſe which owe their immediate origin to ſome affection of the firſt paſſages, as they are called.</p>
               <p>It is amongſt the vulgar errors, that the thruſh is a very harmleſs complaint, or is even deſirable to a child in the month; for it is ſaid, if it does not then make its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, it certainly will at a more advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed age, and will then prove fatal, or will, at leaſt, attend the patient in his laſt illneſs. The fact is, it is a diſeaſe of debility, and therefore attacks very young, and very old ſubjects, eſpecially if otherwiſe weakened. From the above miſtake, however, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order is often neglected in the beginning, whereby the acidity in the firſt paſſages is ſuffered to increaſe, which always aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates the complaint. It is, indeed, a much milder diſorder in this iſland than on moſt parts of the Continent (through <hi>a priori</hi> we might perhaps, ſupoſe it would be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe) particularly in <hi>France,</hi> where it reigns as a malignant epidemic, eſpecially in the

                  <hi>Hotel Dieu,</hi> and <hi>Foundling Hoſpitals,</hi> known by the names of <hi>Muguet</hi> and <hi>Millet.</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <p>It has been already remarked, that ſeveral hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal diſeaſes in <hi>France</hi> are more complex than with us, poſſibly from their infirmaries receiving a much greater number of patients than ours, and their apartments and beds being conſequently leſs clean, as well as the air more foul, and diſpoſed to multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the contagion.</p>
                     <p>This is remarkably the caſe in regard to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes of infants, whoſe temperament is a ſingular union of debility and ſpaſm, which the <hi>French</hi> have aptly termed <hi>Laxité vibratile.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Muguet</hi> is a ſtriking inſtance of the above mentioned tendency, it being altogether an hoſpital diſeaſe; which though diſtinguiſhed by this name, appears to be a malignant thruſh, and is frequently ly attended with a ſpecies of the infantile eryſipelas.</p>

                  </note> The thruſh, however, is as much a diſeaſe, as any other that appears in the month, and is connected with moſt of the foregoing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints; a proper attention to which may very frequently prevent it.</p>
               <p>This diſorder is ſo well known, as ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to require any deſcription, and generally appears firſt in the angles of the lips, and then on the tongue and cheeks, in the form
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:026291_0067_0FCFA9C2D8E92E98"/>
of little white ſpecks. Theſe increaſing in number and ſize, run together more or leſs, according to the degree of malignity, and compoſe a thin, white cruſt, which at length lines the whole inſide of the mouth, from the lips even to the gullet, and is ſaid to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend into the ſtomach, and through the length of the bowels; producing alſo a red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs about the anus. When the cruſt falls off, it is frequently ſucceeded by others, which are uſually of a darker colour than the former. But this is true only in the worſt kind of thruſh; for there is a milder ſort, that is ſpread thinly over the lips and tongue, which returns a great many times, and always laſts for ſeveral weeks. I have ſeen this ſo very often the caſe, that when I obſerve a child to have the complaint very very lightly, and that it does not increaſe after two or three days, I venture to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce it will continue a long time, but will be of no conſequence. Care, however, ought to be taken that the child be not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to cold.</p>
               <p>The thruſh is ſaid to be generally attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with fever, but this is not uſually the caſe where the thruſh is an original diſeaſe but when conſequent to ſevere bowel com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, eryſipelas, and other infantile diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, it is, indeed, often accompanied with fever, and when ſo, proves either favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly critical, or the infant uſually ſinks very
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:026291_0068_0FCF8B36C355ED78"/>
ſoon. In ordinary caſes, however, I am confident in nine out of ten, there is not the leaſt fever, though the mouth is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſo much heated, as to excoriate the niples of the nurſe, and becomes ſo tender, that the child is often obſerved to ſuck with reluctance and caution.—It is an old obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation amongſt nurſes, and there is ſome foundation for it, that very long ſleeping, in the courſe of the firſt week or two, is often a forerunner of this complaint.</p>
               <p>It has long been a received opinion, that the thruſh muſt appear at the anus, and nurſes will ſeldom allow it to be cured if it does not; but the truth is, that its appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance there is only a mark of the degree of the diſeaſe, and not in the leaſt of its cure, and is not, therefore, generally to be wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for. The redneſs about this part is oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by the ſharpneſs of the ſecretions in the bowels, and conſequently of the ſtools, which lightly inflame and ſometimes excoriate the parts about the anus, and in a bad thruſh will do ſo long before the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint is going off; but in the lighter kind, no ſuch effects are produced, or are, at leaſt, very ſlight. And, indeed, this redneſs has been ſo often mentioned to me as an indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that infants muſt certainly have already had a ſlight thruſh, or be likely to ſuffer by it very ſoon, where children have eſcaped it altogether; that I have ventured to imagine
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:026291_0069_0FCFA9BF0D2F9088"/>
ſuch infants may be leaſt of all liable to it, if otherwiſe in good health; at leaſt, my experience ſeems hitherto to ſupport that idea. And I have even conceived, that the acidity of the firſt paſſages being in ſome children more confined, may prove a remote cauſe of ſuch infants being troubled with the thruſh; whilſt others by an open belly, and firmer <hi>viſcera,</hi> may eſcape it, at the expence only of this ſoreneſs of the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal parts, which often continues for ſeveral days.</p>
               <p>The remote cauſe of this diſeaſe, ſeems to be indigeſtion, whether occaſioned by bad milk, or other unwholeſome food, or by the weakneſs of the ſtomach.—Perhaps thick victuals, particularly if taken hot, and made very ſweet; alſo covering the face of the child when it ſleeps, or its breathing the confined air of the mother's bed, may be amogſt theſe cauſes, and ought therefore to be avoided.—The proximate cauſe,<note n="*" place="bottom">If ſuch a term, after all that Gaubius and later profeſſors have advanced, may be uſed in any ſenſe diſtinguiſhable from the diſeaſe itſelf, it is preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the circumſtances enumerated may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed from thoſe termed <hi>remote</hi> cauſes. Should this not be allowed of, the term <hi>proximate cauſe,</hi> ſeems to be perfectly uſeleſs, and one to which we can never affix any preciſe ideas; the <hi>cauſe</hi> and the <hi>effect</hi> being confounded.—But I do not mean to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter far into ſuch a controverſy, and have touched upon it rather by way of apology for the uſe I have made of the term, in this and other parts, and to mark an obſcurity which I leave thoſe to ſettle whoſe province it may be to take the lead in ſuch matters. It were well, however, if ſome able pathologiſt could affix ſome idea that might be univerſally adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſo that when we meet with the term in different authors, no reader might be at a loſs for the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> is
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:026291_0070_0FCFA9BD8F22D120"/>
the thickneſs, or acrimony of the juices ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creted from the mouth, fauces, ſtomach, &amp;c. producing heat and ſoreneſs in theſe parts.—A tea ſpoonful of cold water given every morning has been a good prophylactic, or preventive.</p>
               <p>Much has been ſaid in favor of emetics, eſpecially wine of antimony, as being almoſt a ſpecific for this diſeaſe, but I cannot ſay it has proved ſo with me; nor can I ſee any ſufficient cauſe for departing from the more ancient practice, in the treatment of this very common complaint.</p>
               <p>There can be no objection, after having properly opened the bowels, to adminiſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an emetic, and where the thruſh is of a dark colour, and the whole inſide of the cheeks are lined with it, I believe it will be uſeful, by emptying the ſtomach of the crude juices oozing into it from the glands of this part. But, I think it would be almoſt as endleſs, as it would generally be prejudicial, to perſevere in the uſe of emetics, for days, and even weeks together, and is both a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere, and an unnatural method of treating
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:026291_0071_0FCFA9BC0D5B6F00"/>
a tender infant, in which the bowels are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the moſt natural outlet for its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints; on which, therefore, nature uniform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly throws the offending matter on almoſt every occaſion, as appears plainly in teeth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in which the firſt paſſages cannot be primarily affected.</p>
               <p>I believe, therefore, where there is no fever, nor any uncommon ſymptom, teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceous powders are the beſt and ſafeſt reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; which may be joined with a little mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſia, if the body be coſtive; or if in the other extreme, and the child is very weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, two or three grains of the compound powder of contrayerva in its ſtead. Some ſuch preparation ſhould be adminiſtered for three or four days ſucceſſively, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſomething more purgative, to carry down the ſcales as they fall off from the parts. For this purpoſe, rhubarb is generally the beſt; but when the thruſh is very violent, is of a dark colour, has come on very rapidly, and the child is luſty and ſtrong, a grain or two of the powder of ſcammony with calo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel,<note n="*" place="bottom">A very good method of adminiſtering this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and other metalline preparations, is that men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by <hi>Dr. Armſtrong,</hi> by directing it in the form of a pill which may be broken into ſmall pieces, and given mixed up with the child's food; by which means, it will not precipitate, and be left at the bottom of the ſpoon, as is ſometimes the caſe when ſuch remedies are adminiſtered in powder.</note> may be joined with it, agreeably to
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:026291_0072_0FCFA9B9D285F568"/>
the idea of HEISTER; but this muſt be given with caution. After the purgative, the teſtaceous powders ſhould be repeated for two or three days as before, till the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order begins to give way. Afterwards a tea-ſpoonful of camomile-tea, or a few drops of the compound tincture of gentian, well diluted, may be given two or three times a day with advantage.</p>
               <p>The choice of the teſtaceous powders, on which ſome writers have ſaid ſo much, is, I believe, of very little importance; the pureſt and ſofteſt are preferable. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of theſe medicines, being to abſorb and correct the predominant acidity,<note n="*" place="bottom">The French phyſicians are of opinion, that the thruſh is owing to what they call a putrid alcaline humour, or ſomething analogous thereto, rather than to an acid. But this cannot be the caſe in the ordinary thruſh, as is manifeſt both from the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, and the ſour ſmell of the ſtools, as well as from the more certain remedies for the complaint, which are alcalis and abſorbents.</note> their effect will be diſcovered from the kind of ſtools that ſucceed, and the doſe may therefore be increaſed or diminiſhed, or they may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together diſcontinued, as circumſtances di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect. In the mean time, if the child is ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, the nurſe's diet ſhould be attended to, and in general, her uſual quantity of porter or ale, (which is almoſt always more than ſufficient) ſhould be diminiſhed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="unknown:026291_0073_0FCFA9B86BB7D560"/>
In regard to applications to the part, it is neceſſary to obſerve, that as they have lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to do in curing the complaint, it will be improper to have recourſe to them very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. I know, indeed, it is very common to begin with them, but they ſerve only to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the ſoreneſs of the parts, (eſpecially in the manner they are generally uſed) and to give a deceitful appearance of amendment. If the inſide of the cheeks and tongue are thickly covered with ſloughs, it may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times be convenient to clean the mouth once a day; but it will in general be uſeleſs, till the complaint is paſt the height, the ſloughs diſpoſed to fall off, and the parts under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath inclined to heal. Proper applications will then have their uſe, both by keeping the mouth clean, and conſtricting and heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the raw, and open mouths of the excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory veſſels.</p>
               <p>For this purpoſe, an hundred different lotions and gargles have been invented, which from the earlieſt times have all been of an aſtringent nature.—Honey of roſes and ſpirit of vitriol, or of ſea-ſalt, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended by Etmuller and Dr. Shaw, form a very good one; but nothing is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable to borax, which ſome adviſe to be mixed up with ſugar, in the proportion of one part of the former to ſeven of the latter: a pinch of this put upon the child's tongue will be licked to all parts of the mouth. But
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:026291_0074_0FCF8B34A970CF78"/>
I prefer a mixture of borax and common honey, (about two ſcruples or a dram of the former to an ounce of the latter) which hangs about the fauces better than in the form of powder. Either of theſe may be made uſe of as often in the day as ſhall be neceſſary to keep the parts clean, which they will effectually do, without putting the infant to pain, by being forcibly rubbed on. I muſt own, I have frequently been diſtreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, at ſeeing nurſes rub the mouth of a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle infant, with a rag-mop, as they term it, till they have made it bleed; and this ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration they will often repeat half a dozen times in a day.</p>
               <p>It only remains to take notice of the black thruſh, as it is called, which is confeſſedly a very uncommon complaint in the infant ſtate. Dr. Armſtrong ſays he has never met with it. I have ſeen only two inſtances of it, which were in ſtrong and healthy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; but the parts were not perfectly black, and if that be intended by the name, theſe caſes might not be preciſely that complaint: they, however, both proved fatal. After the ſtomach and bowels have been cleanſed, I believe, a decoction of the bark, with a little aromatic confection, is the moſt likely medicine to be of ſervice, and is ſometimes neceſſary in the worſt kind of common thruſh, when the ſucceeding ſloughs are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:026291_0075_0FCFA9B6D21AE728"/>

               <head>ERUPTIONS on the SKIN.</head>
               <p>IT is, by no means, my intention to enter largely into this extenſive ſubject, but imperfectly underſtood, perhaps, even to this day. In another part of the work I ſhall treat of the ſcall'd-head, and two or three other troubleſome affections of the ſkin, but ſhall at preſent confine myſelf to ſuch eruptions as are peculiar to the ſtate of infancy.</p>
               <p>Infants are liable to various anomalous kinds of raſh, both in the mouth, and till the period of teething is over. The early ones may be regarded as a ſort of red-gum, and children who are moſt ſubject to them, generally have their bowels in a better ſtate; the raſh carrying off, as has been ſaid, the acidity<note n="*" place="bottom">See Harris, Pages 22, 23.</note> with which they ſo much abound.</p>
               <p>It may be remarked, however, that when infants at the breaſt are inclined to frequent returns of ſome eruption on the ſkin, if the child be always indiſpoſed at ſuch ſeaſons, the raſh will often be found owing to ſome ill quality in the breaſt of milk, which ought therefore to be examined, and particularly in regard to its taſte. On ſuch occaſions I
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:026291_0078_0FCFA9B29135D2A0"/>
have found, that milk which has been above a twelve-month old, has contracted <hi>a very unpleaſant</hi> flavour, and that upon changing the wet nurſe, a very ill looking raſh has ſoon afterwards entirely diſappeared, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the other complaints.</p>
               <p>One ſpecies of theſe early raſhes often takes place about the time of teething, and not unfrequently at the decline of fevers or ſevere bowel complaints; inſomuch that, upon a ſudden appearance of it during a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious illneſs, I have often ventured to prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſticate the recovery. This raſh very much reſembles the itch, both in regard to the little watery heads and foul blotches; and is confined to no particular part of the body, though it appears more frequently about the face and neck. Indeed, I have ſeen the whole body ſo covered with it (and mixed with an eruption about the face, of a different appearance, and evidently red-gum) that in a conſultation, it has been by ſome taken to be the true itch. This eruption is certainly ſalutary, and even critical, requires nothing but to avoid taking cold, and is mentioned only becauſe it is not an uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon appearance, and parents who are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with it, are apt to be alarmed at it.</p>
               <p>But there is a very common raſh that calls for more attention, and to which medical writers have given the name of <hi>Cruſta lacte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

(Lactumen,</hi> or milk blotches), which has a very unpleaſant appearance, but is not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding equally innocent with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and even prevents other complaints. I think I never ſaw an infant much loaded with it, but it has always been healthy, and cut its teeth remarkably well. Indeed, it falls to the lot of the fineſt children, and ſuch as are well nouriſhed; whence ſome have imagined it owing only to the richneſs of the milk.<note n="*" place="bottom">See Aſtruc</note> And it is remarkable in this eruption, that however thick and long-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued the ſcabs may be, the cruſta lactea never excoriates, nor leaves any ſcar on the parts.</p>
               <p>It appears firſt on the forehead, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times on the ſcalp, often extends half-way over the face, in the form of large looſe ſcabs, and appears not very unlike the ſmall pox after they are turned. Very little, I believe, is neceſſary to be done; but in bad caſes a perpetual bliſter may ſometimes be of ſervice. It uſually diſappears of itſelf when the child has cut three or four teeth, though it may ſometimes continue for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral months, and in a very few inſtances even for years: in ſuch caſes, the <hi>Harrowgate,</hi> or any other ſulphureous water will have a good effect; but the medicines commonly preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed do nothing. I have known teſtaceous
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:026291_0080_0FCFA9AF61405828"/>
powders and various alteratives adminiſtered to no purpoſe, as people of rank are very anxious to have it removed if it be poſſible. I was lately conſulted for a child who had taken a grain of calomel, at ſhort intervals, for ſeveral months without any benefit, and fortunately without any injury; which is rarely the caſe when powerful medicines are adminiſtered unneceſſarily. This raſh will now and then make make its appearance very early, and has then been miſtaken by thoſe who are not much accuſtomed to very young children, for the effects the venereal diſeaſe. I not long ago ſaw ſuch a caſe, and adviſed only to keep the body open with a little magneſia; the complaint got no worſe, and upon cutting ſome teeth, diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared as uſual. I have known it, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, diſappear ſuddenly, previouſly to any teeth being cut, and after ſome weeks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more violent than ever; the infant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining all the while in perfect health.</p>
               <p>It were almoſt endleſs to enumerate the various kinds of raſh to which infants are liable, but I mean chiefly to confine my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks to the more important, or rare ones, and ſuch as may not have been deſcribed by preceding writers. Among ſuch is the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, whoſe unuſual appearance are apt to alarm parents and others, not accuſtomed to ſee them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="unknown:026291_0081_0FCFA9AE191A3948"/>
The firſt I ſhall notice appears chiefly in teething children, very much reſembles the meaſles, and has been ſometimes miſtaken for it. It is preceded by ſickneſs at the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, but is it attended with very little fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, though the raſh continues very florid for three days, like the meaſles, but does not dry off in the manner of that diſeaſe. It requires nothing more than the ſhell-pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, or ſometimes the addition of a little nitre and compound powder of contrayerva, with a doſe or two of rhubarb, or other gentle laxative, on the going off of the raſh.</p>
               <p>An eruption ſtill leſs frequently met with appears ſometimes after children have cut all their firſt teeth. I know not what name ought to be given to this kind of eruption, which breaks out in the form of round lumps as large as midling-ſized peas, very hard, with a very red baſe, and white at the top, as if they contained a little lymph.</p>
               <p>They come out ſuddenly without previous ſickneſs at the ſtomach, are not ſore, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to itch, nor ever give any trouble, and are ſeldom ſeen but on parts that are uſually uncovered, and are ſometimes there in great numbers, reſembling the diſtinct ſmall-pox; but are harder, more inflamed, and leſs purulent.</p>
               <p>Alarming, as well as unuſual, as is this appearance, I believe the eruption is always
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:026291_0082_0FCFA9A8EDCB8A90"/>
perfectly harmleſs, if not repelled by cold, or improper treatment; and will dry away in three or four days: nothing more being neceſſary than the little remedies, directed for the former, and to keep the child with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in doors, if the weather be cold.</p>
               <p>An eruption of an appearance equally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common and analogous to the above, I have met with only in children of at leaſt three or four years of age, and ſuch as have alſo been affected with ſlight ſymptoms of ſcrofu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la; though I have not ſeen it frequently enough to aſcertain its being, in any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, owing to that ſpecific virus. It breaks out ſuddenly, covering at once the greater part of the body, but occaſioning neither pain nor itching, nor are children ſick at the ſtomach nor otherwiſe ill with it, though it laſts for two or three weeks.</p>
               <p>This eruption, therefore, like ſome others, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> taken notice of chiefly for its ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular appearance, which, though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what like the nettle-raſh, is of a different figure, but may be pretty exactly conceived of by the little red lumps ſometimes left by ſmall-pox, after they are turned, and alſo rubbed, or picked off; eſpecially after the chryſtalline or warty ſpecies, and where the puſtules have been pretty numerous.</p>
               <p>If the firſt-paſſages are at all diſturbed, my attention is principally directed to them, otherwiſe to the ſtate of the ſkin; and in
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:026291_0083_0FCFA99F9E0B9EB0"/>
this caſe, I have uſually directed ſmall doſes of Dr James's powder, to be taken for a few nights at going to bed, and the poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chreſt ſalt and rhubarb, occaſionally, in the courſe of the day, with or without the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of a little of the acitated water of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monia.</p>
               <p>In the courſe of a few days the eruption puts on a darker colour, is leſs prominent, and begins to ſcale off in a branny ſcurf, ſomewhat like the meaſles: but ſhould no ſuch change take place, the vinum antimonii ſhould be taken two or three times a day; to which, if no amendment ſhould ſoon be perceived, a few drops of the tinctura can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharidis may be added; a remedy often ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry efficacious in diſorders of the ſkin; but ſhould be adminiſtered with caution.</p>
               <p>Another raſh, or rather eruption, takes place both in bowel complaints and in teething, and always appears to be benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial. It conſiſts of veſications or bliſters of different ſizes, reſembling little ſcalds or burns, and continues for ſeveral days. They come out in different parts, but chiefly on the belly, ribs, and thighs; and contain a ſharp lymph, which it may be prudent to let out by a puncture with a needle, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally from the larger ones. No medicine is neceſſary but ſuch as the particular ſtate of the bowels may call for, which uſualy abound
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:026291_0084_0FCFA99D6C445238"/>
with acidity whenever there is much erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on the ſkin.</p>
               <p>An eruption, vulgarly termed ſcorbutic, infeſting the face and neck, and diſcharging a ſharp ichor that excoriates wherever it runs, and difficult of cure by chemical alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratives, will often yield in a very ſhort time to the expreſſed juice of the <hi>ſium aquaticum.</hi> From one, to four or five table ſpoonfuls may be given, mixed with one or more lpoonful of new milk, three times a day, according to the child's age, and the ſtate of its ſtomach; taking care at the ſame time, to keep the bowels open by ſenna-tea or other common laxative.</p>
               <p>I ſhall cloſe this account with a deſcription of an eruption that is ſingular enough, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling very much the herpes or broad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring worm, or the aduſt-coloured ſpots left on the face after an attack of St. Anthony's fire. I have ſeen it in various parts, but I think only on ſuch as are more or leſs liable to be fretted by ſome part of the infant's dreſs, eſpecially on the nates and contigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous parts covered by the cloths, where the blotches are always the broadeſt and moſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ank. Were it to appear no where elſe, it would ſeem to be occaſioned by ſome ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the urine and ſtools, as the ſkin has a very heated appearance, though the erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I believe, is not at all painful. It fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently breaks out before the period of
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:026291_0085_0FCFA99BEB375EA8"/>
teething, but the bowels are generally ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what diſordered, and the ſtools voided very green, or elſe become ſo very ſoon afterwards. This I take to be one of thoſe eruptions oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by ſome bad quality of the breaſt-milk as I have never met with it but in young infants whoſe nurſe's milk has been old, and has alſo contracted a very diſagreeable taſte. If that ſhould not be the caſe, the raſh will probably require nothing but the light ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorbent medicines before mentioned, and to guard againſt conſtipation. But if theſe means ſhould not ſucceed in a ſhort time, the nurſe ought to be changed.</p>
               <p>In all the eruptive complaints of infants, taking cold ought to be carefully avoided, and great caution be uſed in regard to all external applications, as well as keeping the belly open. If the child is ſick at the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, a little magneſia, teſtaceous powders, or the compound powder of contrayerva joined with them, may be given now and then; or ſhould the raſh be haſtily ſtruck in, and the child be ill, it ſhould be immediately put into a warm-bath and afterwards take five or ſix grains of the aromatic confection, with, or without a few drops of the wine of antimony, in ſimple mint water.</p>
               <p>Should any ſcabs become very dry and hard, which the <hi>cruſta lactea</hi> will ſometimes be, eſpecially when they extend to the
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:026291_0086_0FCFA9998E9EEB80"/>
crown of the head, and ſeem to give pain, they may be touched with a little cream, or with oil of almonds mixed with a few drops of the water of kali; but not a large ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face at a time. Or ſhould they be very moiſt, and cauſe pain by ſticking to the cap, they may be duſted with a little common powder, or with flowers of ſulphur, and covered with a ſinged rag, but I ſhould be very cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious of doing much more; as the ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of any conſiderable eruption on the ſkin may occaſion the worſt effects eſpcially du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time of teething.</p>

               <p>SLIGHT bliſters and ulcerations behind the ears of infants are ſo very common, that almoſt every parent is well-acquainted with them, and in general require only to be waſhed with cold water, or covered with a ſinged rag, to keep the cap from ſticking to them, and thereby giving the child pain. They are, moreover, often very uſeful, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially during bowel complaints, or the eruption of the teeth. But there is in ſome children of a groſs habit of body, and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially about the time of teething, a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of ulcer that often requires attention, on account of its extending low down in the neck, occaſioning great pain, and ſpreading
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:026291_0087_0FCFA99897003EA0"/>
into large and deep ſores, inſomuch that a mortification has ſometimes come on, and even the <hi>proceſſus maſtoideus</hi> has become ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious. Here fomentations will be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, eſpecially thoſe of bark, and its pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſhould be adminiſtered internally. Such caſes, however, do not often occur; but whenever the ſores are large the cure ſhould be begun by a bliſter on the back, in order to draw off the heated ſerum that flows to the parts. I have uſually given an opening powder of teſtecea and rhubarb, with a little nutmeg, and ſometimes nitre, to which is added either calomel, cinnabar of antimony, or <hi>hydrargyrus cum ſulphure;</hi> the latter of which, I think I have found more ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in ſome eruptive complaints in young children, than ſeem to be generally imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But above all, ſome mercurial ſhould be made uſe of to the ſores, which, though they are often apparently inflamed, never offends them. A very clean and elegant preparation of this kind is the following,

               <p>A little of this liniment ſpread on each ſide of a piece of doubled linen cloth, and applied twice a day, will do more than all the fomentations, or healing ointments, that I have ever ſeen uſed; and indeed has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſucceeded with me, though I have been
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:026291_0088_0FCFA9950CF039B0"/>
told the ſores had ſpread deeper from day to day under various other applications. From ſuch treatment I have never found the leaſt ill effects, but children have preſerved their health as well as if the ſores had kept open, which, when benign, are certainly deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by nature as a preſervative from ſome other complaints, eſpecially thoſe of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach and bowels, of which I now proceed to take notice.</p>

               <head>VOMITING.</head>
               <p>VOMITING is certainly not a common complaint of infants, I mean when con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as a <hi>diſeaſe,</hi> unleſs it be attendant upon ſome other, of which it is then rather a ſymptom, or the conſequence of ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe improperly treated. Neither are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants in health diſpoſed to vomit frequently, unleſs the ſtomach is overloaded, the milk is then uſually ejected as ſoon as it is taken, and comes up unchanged. Nor is this to be conſidered as a diſeaſe, or as calling for the diſcipline recommended by ſome writers. Wherefore ſhould the reſidue of the ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be forced off the ſtomach by an eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic, when it has already parted with all the oppreſſive abundance? This kind of puking is not attended with any violence to the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach: the milk, or other food ſeems to
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:026291_0089_0FCF8B31DC8D20B8"/>
come up without an ſenſible action of the ſtomach, or the child being ſick. Nay, it is at once ſo common to ſome of the fineſt children, that it is a ſaying with ſome old nurſes, (though I am not very partial to many of their proverbs) that a puking child is a thriving child; and when ſuch ejection comes only ſoon after ſucking or feeding, and the aliment is caſt up, ſcarcely changed, matter of fact verifies the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.<note n="*" place="bottom">See PRIMEROS: <hi>De Morbis Infant.</hi>
                  </note> But if the food remains ſome time on the ſtomach, it will then be thrown up in a curdled ſtate, which is an indication to attend to it, if it happens frequently. Not that the milk ought not to curdle on the ſtomach, which it always muſt do, in order to a due ſeparation of its component parts, and is the chief, if not the only di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, it undergoes in the ſtomach. The whey and the rich oil are there ſeparated from the curd and earthy particles, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer being taken up by the lacteal, or milky-veſſels in the bowels,<note n="†" place="bottom">It is not intended in this place to ſpeak with phyſiological accuracy, but merely to afford common readers ſome idea of the nature of the firſt digeſtion; in the ſecond, indeed, it is probable, that ſome por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of every conſtituent part of our food may be farther prepared to become nutritious; the thinner ſerving to renew the finer parts of our ſyſtem, and the groſſer, ſuch as the earthy particles, &amp;c. more adapted to the renovation of the muſcles, tendons, bones, &amp;c. may be depoſited in theſe parts.</note> is converted into blood; whilſt the bulk of the latter is carried down and expelled with the other excrementious parts of the food, and gaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tric

juices, for which nature has no uſe. This curdling of the milk, therefore, is the natural courſe of digeſtion, though many writers have not been ſufficiently attentive to it, and Harris has aſſerted it is owing to a predominant acid. But when the milk comes up in a curdled ſtate, it proves that the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach having digeſted what it had received, hath not power to puſh it forward into the bowels, and therefore throws up a part of it.<note n="*" place="bottom">I have known a child throw up a piece of curd full as large as the thumb of a grown perſon, and as firm as a piece of dough; and be perfectly well the next minute.—When infants, not over-fed, throw up the milk uncurdled, after it has been ſometime in the ſtomach, it is always a worſe ſign.</note> If this be the caſe, the ſtomach may perhaps require to be emptied of its whole contents, which may be eaſily done by giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a little warm water, or camomile tea. The cauſe of the indigeſtion was an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental repletion; that removed, together with the conſequent foulneſs, or bad juices of the ſtomach, the effect alſo will generally ceaſe, and unleſs the vomiting returns, from any farther injury the repletion may have occaſioned, it requires nothing more. To

diſtreſs the child, on every ſuch occaſion, with a ſickening emetic, or drench it with rhubarb and magneſia, is as needleſs as it would be to awake a patient out of a ſound ſleep to give him an opiate. Only let the child faſt a little after having emptied the ſtomach of its load, and the nurſe be careful not to overfill it for the future, and it will rarely want any other aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>If the vomiting, on the other hand, has ariſen from acrid diet, a little farther diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline may be requiſite, becauſe ſome half-digeſted food has got into the bowels, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps for ſeveral days together. In this caſe, a gentle laxative, and change of food for one of a milder kind, is all that is generally neceſſary; or if there be a prevailing acidity in the ſtomach, either the teſtaceous pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, or magneſia, (according to the ſtate of the bowels) may be mixed with the food, or be otherwiſe adminiſtered for two or three days, as the occaſion may require. Or a drop or two of the water of kali, or a little <hi>caſtile,</hi> or almond ſoap, are excellent remedies, eſpecially when the ſtools are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſually green, or clayey; not only as they will tend to promote a ſecretion of the gall, but correct acidity.<note n="*" place="bottom">It is well known, how ſmall a quantity of ſoap put into a churn will prevent a due ſeparation of the component parts of the milk, ſo as to allow very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, or no butter to be made; whereas, a little vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar effects the ſeparation almoſt inſtantaneouſly, and ſaves a vaſt deal of trouble.</note> For which purpoſe

alſo, myrrhe, though an obſolete, ſeems to be an excellent remedy, when infants are a few months old. Should the vomiting be a ſymptom attending ſome other diſeaſe, its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy will turn on the proper treatment of its cauſe. If ſuch cauſe be the ſudden diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of ſome eruption on the ſkin, the child may be put into a tepid bath, the limbs be well rubbed as ſoon as it is taken out of the water, and the infant be then put to bed: and if the vomiting continues, an emetic ſhould be given, and afterwards a bliſter ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the pit of the ſtomach.</p>
               <p>Having mentioned emetics, I ſhall take this occaſion to obſerve, that the choice of them will be always beſt determined by the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the complaints for which they are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtered. In thoſe of the firſt-paſſages, ipecacuanha is generally the beſt, but if a fever ſhould attend, or it be wiſhed to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote a gentle perſpiration, thoſe of antimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are preferable; or laſtly, in diſorders of the breaſt, the oxymel, conſerve, or tincture of ſquills.</p>
               <p>But a more troubleſome vomiting will ſometimes ariſe in unhealthy children, from too great a ſenſibility, or too great an irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability of the nerves of the ſtomach. Such
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:026291_0093_0FCFA9921A610D40"/>
medicines are then indicated as will brace, or ſtrengthen that organ, and abate its ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility. For the former, a cold infuſion of the bark, or of camomile flowers, with orange peel, and ſometimes a little rhubarb. For the latter, a ſaline mixture with a drop or two of laudanum. And the benefit of theſe may be increaſed by aromatic and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituous fomentations to the pit of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, or by the labdanum plaiſter, with a little theriaca added to it.</p>

               <p>UNDER the article of vomiting it was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that frequent puking is oftentimes an attendant upon ſome other complaint, and then demands a peculiar attention, and is to be treated agreeably to the nature of ſuch complaints; and there is, perhaps, none which it more frequently accompanies than a Diarrhoea, or Purging.</p>
               <p>Vomiting and Purging very often ariſe from unwholeſome milk or other food, from a moiſt cold air, or from the ſudden diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of ſome eruption on the ſkin. The purging is not then haſtily to be ſtopped, nor even abſorbent powders to be given, till the offenſive matter be firſt carried off; and if a vomiting attend, the cure ſhould begin by adminiſtering an emetic. But though the purging ought not to be checked with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out previous evacuations, nor to be ſtopped haſtily, yet it is not to be treated with a daily exhibition of rhubarb, which though a common practice with many, ſerves to keep up a purging after the cauſe has been remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by creating a continual irritation in the bowels. The <hi>diarrhoea,</hi> indeed, is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint often as difficult to treat as any in the infant ſtate, and is therefore worthy of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular attention. In a general way it may
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:026291_0095_0FCFA98B4FA14438"/>
be ſaid, that a ſufficient doſe or two of rhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barb ſhould be adminiſtered in the beginning, and afterwards abſorbents. If the purging ſhould ſtill continue, an emetic will be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, as purges do not always lie long enough in the ſtomach to carry off the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive matter it contains. After this, it is often neceſſary, the child ſhould be purged again, for it ſhould be always remembered, that many complaints of infants, whether ſeated only in the firſt-paſſages, or attended with fever, will frequently ſeem to be giving way upon procuring ſtools freely, but will ſoon return if the ſame means be not repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, till the whole irritating matter be carried down. Should ſuch repetition fail of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, though the diet has been carefully at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to, the uſe of them at preſent ſhould be laid aſide, and recourſe ſhould again be had to abſorbents, and if there be no fever, to light cordials, and even to opiates, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the latter of which, many bowel com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints will not admit of a laſting cure, ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the great irritability of infants. Such medicines are not indeed very often requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed till children are ſome months old: but when they are found neceſſary, not only may ſyrup of white poppies, but even laudanum be given with the moſt perfect ſafety;<note n="*" place="bottom">From the half of a drop, to two, or three drops, in the courſe of the day, will be a proper quantity for infants from a week old, to the age of ſix months.</note>
                  <pb n="79" facs="unknown:026291_0096_0FCF8B26EAE0A770"/>
though from the time of <hi>Galen,</hi> (who cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againſt giving theriaca to children) till of later years, many phyſicians have been fearful of directing them, (arguing from their abuſe againſt their uſe) and eſpecially <hi>Harris,</hi> who in other reſpects, has written ſo well on their diſeaſes. I remember being called to ſee an infant of only two days old, who, through a miſtake, had taken ſome hours before, four drops of laudanum. The parents were greatly alarmed at the child's lying in a ſtupid, drowſy ſtate, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to take the breaſt or open its eyes, I encouraged them, however, to believe the laudanum would do no kind of harm, if they would frequently get a little breaſt-milk down with a tea-ſpoon. Accordingly, though the child lay ſleeping above ſix and thirty hours, it afterwards awoke perfectly well.—This is mentioned, however, only by way of encouragement to ſuch as may be fearful of adminiſtering opiates even where they are neceſſary. They are, nevertheleſs, very powerful medicines, and ſhould be preſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with due caution for patients of every age, and eſpecially for infants. A like cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be neceſſary in regard to cordials, which are, nevertheleſs, in many caſes equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proper, notwithſtanding a modern preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice againſt them. There is a certain cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and langour in infants when they are ill, eſpecially under ſome bowel complaints;
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:026291_0097_0FCFA989F0EBC9D8"/>
and whenever they may be in that ſtate, that claſs of medicines will have a very hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py effect.</p>
               <p>Purging in children, it is to be obſerved, is not always a diſeaſe. The bowels are the great natural, and critical outlet in infants, as the pores of the ſkin, and the kidneys are in adults. Not the mere diſcharge, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but the cauſe of it is, in the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, to be removed, and the ill effects are to be guarded againſt by keeping the purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within bounds. For this purpoſe, the chalk julep, as it is an aſtringent only by abſorbing the acrid, or changing the acid, and irritating matter, is as ſafe as it is uſeful, becomes an excellent anodyne, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing medicine, and after the bowels have been well cleaſed, will uſually accompliſh the cure.</p>
               <p>Dr. Armſtrong takes occaſion to ſpeak againſt the uſe of abſorbent powders, and prefers wine of antimony, becauſe modern writers appear to depend ſo much on the former, from their known property of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting acidity, previous to the exhibition of purges; and ſays, that in caſes of extreme danger, a phyſician who is called in late, would, according to this practice, often find no opportunity for purging at all. But ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this is ſcarcely an argument to prove the ſuperiority of his method, ſince no writer that I know of, ever deſigned it as a rule
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:026291_0098_0FCF8B255EE4A160"/>
without exception; and <hi>Harris,</hi> who has ſaid as much as any man in commendation of the abſorbent powders, does not deny the expediency of ſometimes beginning with purgative medicines. But had it been otherwiſe, the argument goes no farther than to prove, that in caſes of great danger, the wine of antimony, being both an emetic and a purge, ought to precede the uſe of the teſtaceous powders. Inſtead of this, Dr <hi>Armſtrong</hi> ſlides into a general concluſion from premiſes evidently limited; though he has advanced nothing againſt an eſtabliſhed, and ſucceſsful method of treatment. And I may add, that whilſt he is fearful, that the abſorbent powders, (which nobody pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes without ſome purging medicines) ſhould check the looſeneſs, and thereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the fever; he ventures, after a repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of the antimony, to adminiſter what he calls a gentle paregoric, or opiate, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe the pain, conſiſting of a dram of ſyrup of white poppies, repeated every three or four hours, till that end be obtained. So that if the pain ſhould continue for nine hours, a child will take half an ounce of the ſyrup; and this Dr. <hi>Armſtrong</hi> obſerves is the only medicine he gives, except wine of antimony, which (notwithſtanding the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate) he ſuppoſes to be the efficient remedy.</p>
               <p>It is an improper exhibition of abſorb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, I apprehend, rather than their doſe,
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:026291_0099_0FCF8927680BFBD0"/>
that has made ſome practitioners ſo averſe to them; for they certainly ought, in many caſes, to be given in large quantities; but if adminiſtered too early, and long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the ſtools may become like plaiſter of <hi>Paris,</hi> and be with difficulty excreted. Such an inſtance is mentioned by Boerhaave, who had, nevertheleſs, a very favorable opinion of them, as will be noticed hereafter. There is, however, ſome fallacy in regard to the colour of the ſtools, as this kind is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently obſerved in children who have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver taken any of the teſtacea, if the ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the bile be obſtructed; as in jaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced adults.</p>
               <p>In his ſecond edition, Dr. Armſtrong mentions another method he has fallen upon for curing this diſorder, which, however, appears to be recurring to the ancient method of treating bowel com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, and ſeems, indeed, to overturn the idea he had entertained of the ſuperiority of wine of antimony over every other medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine. This method, he tells us, is by cleanſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the bowels, by means of proper purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, joined with anodynes, or opiates, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixed in ſuch a manner as to correct the griping quality of the medicines, and leſſen the ſtimulus occaſioned by the acrimony of the ſtools.—A plan worthy of imitation, it is apprehended, and though not likely to
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:026291_0100_0FCFA536C1A77640"/>
be proper in all caſes, muſt, as an occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal practice, be ſafe and beneficial.</p>
               <p>To return, it is of ſome conſequence to learn what part of the bowels is particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affected, and the degree of pain children may endure; and ſome indication may be had from undreſſing the child, and careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly examining the belly, and gently preſſing in different parts, as well as from the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent expreſſions of pain the infant may manifeſt, either by a forcible contraction of one or both legs, or of the arms, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the irritating matter may be higher or lower, or on one, or both ſides of the belly; alſo from the coldneſs of the feet. Regard is alſo to be paid to the kind of ſtools that come away, which in a diarr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoea are ſeldom good, and are uſually diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed into the ſour and curdled, ſlimy, green, clayey, watery, and bloody, ſome of which are at times alſo fetid; and in this caſe, ſome powerful purgative, ſuch as ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na-tea, is oftentimes neceſſary, if the child is not very young. True bloody ſtools, however, are leſs common in infants than adult<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, and ſeldom occur but in the laſt ſtage of the diſeaſe; but a few ſtreaks of blood may ſometimes be mixed with the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which ariſing only from the <hi>hemorrhoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal</hi> veins, is of no conſequence. Should purgings return frequently, it will be very uſeful, (eſpecially in the time of teething,
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:026291_0101_0FCFA534B3527168"/>

               <p>When the ſtools appear ſour or curdled, or the child is much diſpoſed to hiccough, the magneſia, and other abſorbent powders are calculated to afford peculiar aſſiſtance, and may be warmed by the addition of a little grated nutmeg. When the ſtools are green, or white and clayey, a drop or two of water of kali may be occaſionally put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the other medicines, or a little ſoap be diſſolved in the clyſters, which are eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally neceſſary when much griping attends this complaint: the child's belly may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be rubbed with a little warm brandy.

medicine in the diſeaſes of infants; and is certainly a good remedy, eſpecially in their bowel complaints:</p>
               <p>Take of <hi>Venice</hi> ſoap two drams; prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed pearls, one dram; prepared crabs claws, one dram and an half; ſyrup of marſhmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, half an ounce; mint-water and fennel-water, of each three ounces; mix them.—A deſert ſpoonful is directed to be taken once in eight hours.</p>
               <p>When purgings have continued a long time without any amendment, a peculiar tightneſs of the ſkin will ſometimes take place in the laſt ſtage of the diſeaſe, afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing always an unfavourable prognoſtic; and of which farther notice will be taken under the article of <hi>Skin-bound.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The true <hi>Watery-gripes,</hi> ſo called, is eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teemed the moſt dangerous of all purgings, and is uſually thought fatal, though perhaps without reaſon; ſince if properly treated, children recover from it as well as from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive purgings of any other kind, unleſs it happen after ſome other illneſs, or to ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſmall and tender infants during the month. It is not the having a few very thin ſtools, however, that is an evidence of the true watery-gripes, for in almoſt every purging of a few days continuance, the ſtools are very thin as well as numerous. But in this caſe, they are thin very early in the diſeaſe; the child looks wretchedly, and every thing
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:026291_0103_0FCFA52F098341C8"/>
it takes runs almoſt immediately through it, with very little change, as in the <hi>lientery</hi> of adults.</p>
               <p>The cure ſhould be begun by adminiſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one or more pukes, eſpecially when the ſtools are of a dark colour and fetid, as they frequently are in the earlier periods of the complaint. And to this end, a pretty ſtrong one ſhould be prepared, which ſhould be given in divided doſes, at about a quarter of an hour's diſtance, till a proper effect is produced; and ſome hours afterwards a warm purge with rhubarb ſhould be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtered, if the diſeaſe be not very far ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced. After the firſt paſſages have been cleared, the eighth part of a grain, or leſs, of ipecacuanha, or a drop or two of wine of antimony, given every three or four hours, with a few grains of the teſtaceous powders, or the aromatic confection, appear to me amongſt the beſt remedies in the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier periods of the complaint. Indeed, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſmall doſes of ipecacuanha, eſpecially if duly guarded by ſome gentle aromatic, is both ſo uſeful and ſafe a remedy, that it ſhould not be haſtily laid aſide, and when perſevered in the uſe of for ſome time, will effect wonders, not only in long purgings, but in other chronical complaints.</p>
               <p>In the more advanced ſtages of the watery-gripes, and where the child is not very young, the following old medicine is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:026291_0104_0FCFA52D513A6298"/>
good one—Of <hi>Locatelli's</hi> balſam, one ounce, and conſerve of red roſes, two ounces: from the quantity of an horſe-bean to that of nutmeg, may be given three or four times a day, according to the age of the child.—The laudanum plaiſter likewiſe, as directed for vomitings, or the following, may be applied to the parts above the navel: Take of Venice treacle, one ounce; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed oil of mace, two drams; and oil of nutmegs, three drops; mix them into a plaiſter, to be ſpread on a piece of ſoft lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Should theſe means fail, I have known the repetition of a vomit give an immediate check to the complaint, eſpecially where the ſtools continue to be remarkably ſour. So long as this is the caſe, it would be both vain and hazardous to exhibit opiates, or powerful reſtringents: the acidity muſt be firſt carried off by warm purges, and be corrected by abſorbents; the latter of which muſt be given in large, and repeated doſes, and frequently their powers be augmented by the addition of water of kali, or tincture of myrrhe. And an excellent remedy ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, as an antiacid, is the <hi>ſpir. ſalis am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. ſuccinat.</hi> of <hi>Bate's</hi> diſpenſatory. The acidity once removed, a ſtarch clyſter may be thrown up, two or three times a day, with or without a few drops of laudanum, according to the number of the ſtools, and
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:026291_0105_0FCFA52BA1EEFB30"/>
weakneſs of the infant. A drop or two of laudanum may now likewiſe be given, once or more in the day, (according to the age of the child) either joined with ſome pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, or in any of the afore-mentioned medicines, or in the chalk-julep, made warm with tincture of cinnamon, or of cardamoms; and in caſes of extremity, in the decoction of log-wood, which agrees very well with young children.</p>
               <p>If infants ill of watery-gripes, are brought up by hand, the ſtricteſt attention muſt be paid to their food, which muſt be changed from one kind to another, and eſpecially trial be made of broths, (and to older chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren white meats) as long as the food ſhall be diſpoſed to turn very acid on the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach. In one caſe, I think I ſaved a child, by <hi>Bates's julepum vitae,</hi> lowered with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when nothing elſe would ſtay on the ſtomach. This ſerved both for food and medicine; for the former of which, it was ſtill farther diluted. When the watery-gripes, or indeed any violent purging, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks young children at the breaſt, no other food ought to be given, but the wet nurſe be changed, if the acidity and purging con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue many days, and medicine does not ſeem to take a proper effect; which it cannot, if any offenſive matter be continually thrown into the ſtomach.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="89" facs="unknown:026291_0106_0FCFA52A1B734C48"/>
It has already been hinted, that when there is no fever, purging medicines for children ought to be made potentially warm, and in no caſe is it more neceſſary, than in long continued complaints of the bowels, which are ſo apt to give riſe to ſpaſmodic affections. I am not very fond of giving preſcriptions, but it may not here be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether amiſs for ſome readers, ſince the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, conſidered as a general medicine, has been found ſo frequently uſeful, and will keep for a great length of time.</p>
               <p>Take of rhubarb from fifteen to twenty grains; two ſcruples of magneſia alba; ſweet fennel, and dill-waters, of each one ounce; half an ounce, or ſix drams of ſyrup of roſes, and fifteen or twenty drops of the compound ſpirit of ammonia. Of this, one, two, or three tea-ſpoonsful may be given two or three times a day, and being very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, infants are never averſe to it.</p>
               <p>Bowel complaints, it was ſaid, are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently owing to improper food, which on this account, ſhould at all times be peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attended to; and when a purging has taken place, ought to be ſuited to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the ſtools. In the ſecond part of this work, ſome farther notice will be taken of the article of children's food; at preſent, I ſhall only obſerve, that cow's milk is often found to diſagree with them, when their bowels are diſpoſed to be too open, at which
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:026291_0107_0FCFA528930C3498"/>
times, a little lean mutton broth, or beef-tea is abundantly preferable. On the ſame account, ruſks,<note n="*" place="bottom">Theſe are preferable to tops and bottoms, as they are called, which have a good deal of butter in them.</note> and biſcuit-powder are more ſuitable than bread; but at other times, I believe, either the common, or the <hi>French</hi> roll, which is already half digeſted by a previous fermentation, is more eaſily diſſolved in the ſtomach, if there be not a predominant acid in the firſt-paſſages. But where there is an habitual diſpoſition to a purging, I know of no diet ſo proper for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants who do not ſuck, or who cannot have enough of the breaſt, as flour baked a long time in the oven, till it breaks into a ſoft, greyiſh-coloured powder,<note n="†" place="bottom">To this end, the flour ſhould be put into a ſmall jar, properly covered, and be taken out of the oven ſeveral times, and ſtirred up from the bottom and ſides of the jar, that it may not form into hard lumps, but the whole be equally baked.</note> and afterwards mixed with boiled cow's milk, the ſcum be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing firſt taken off; the flour and milk ſhould then be boiled a little time together, till the whole appears like a thin cuſtard. This is a very light and ſoft food, and ſufficiently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtringent; and I have often known more good from it, than from all the abſorbent medicines ever deviſed, and have received more thanks for the preſcription, as it proves a permanent remedy. When children who
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:026291_0108_0FCFA52724000C98"/>
are weaned, are attacked with repeated purgings, and even broth is found to run through them, I have obſerved no food ſo generally uſeful as a bit of the white of chicken, not over-boiled, and afterwards lightly bruiſed in a mortar with the chicken liquor, and a very little bread, into a kind of light jelly. But this ſhould not be given oftener than twice, or at moſt, three times a day.</p>
               <p>In all bowel complaints, it has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready remarked, that infants are diſpoſed to eruptions on the ſkin; by which they are ſo frequently benefited, that if any kind of raſh appears during long or ſevere purgings, a recovery may almoſt with certainly be prognoſticated.</p>
               <p>That I may not multiply diſtinct heads of complaint where little need to be ſaid, I ſhall briefly notice in this place, that many children who are accuſtomed at all times to have a very open belly, do not ſeem to have the faculty of properly retaining their ſtools, and need a ſervant continually to attend them, even at two or three years of age; ſo that ſome have been ſuſpected of being culpable in the matter. I know of no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular remedy, indeed, on this occaſion, but, perhaps, the <hi>aqua calcis,</hi> and other abſorbents may have been of ſome uſe; I have, however, obſerved, that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:026291_0109_0FCFA525DFE1D5B0"/>
wears off as ſuch children grow up, though oftentimes not entirely for ſeveral years.</p>

               <head>WORMS.</head>
               <p>THIS being a bowel complaint, I have noticed it in this place, eſpecially as worms have ſometims been voided by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants of only a few weeks old. It is even reported,<note n="*" place="bottom">Philoſoph. Tranſact.</note> that Lille Van Deoverin has diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered them in the ſtill-born fetus.

Some infants continue very healthy, though they are ſeldom free from them, whilſt others are very ill who have apparently very few.</p>
               <p>Worms become hurtful chiefly from their numbers; firſt, when they obſtruct the bowels, or compreſs the adjacent parts by their bulk. Secondly, by ſucking up the chyle deſigned for the nouriſhment of the child. Thirdly, by irritation. Fourthly, by actually deſtroying the parts; though this is certainly a very rare occurrence, and

a far leſs frequent ſource of injury than thoſe beforementioned. Worms have, however, been ſaid to eat their way through the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtines; and Liſter relates,<note n="*" place="bottom">Philoſoph. Trans. See alſo <hi>Heiſter.</hi>

This is the moſt hurtful of all, and moſt difficult of cure, becauſe it will remain long in the bowels even after it is dead, and is then ſeldom brought away but in pieces, and that by very powerful medicines. But as this kind of worm is certainly not common in children, tho' it may ſometimes have been met with, and as it generally occaſions a variety of ſymptoms reſembling other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, for which many different medicines may be required, the bare mention of it here may ſuffice.<note n="‡" place="bottom">This is ſo generally ſolitary, that it has even acquired the name; yet it is ſaid, there are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſeveral of them, but, perhaps, attention enough may not have been given in the examination of them, it being well known, that this worm will live a long time after it has been broken into ſeveral parts.</note>

The Symptoms of worms are various, and many of them are very equivocal: I ſhall name only the more conſtant, and leſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain ones. Such are fetid breath, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the morning; bad gums; itching of the noſe, and of the anus, eſpecially from the <hi>aſcarides;</hi> a very irregular appetite, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in extremes, whether of hunger or of loathing; a large, hard belly; pains at the ſtomach; ſometimes vomiting, oftener coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiveneſs or purging, with ſlimy ſtools; ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular colicks; thirſt; dulneſs; peculiar unhealthy and bloated countenance, with a dark, hollow circle round the eyes; ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in the ſleep, and grinding of the teeth. To theſe ſymptoms are often added, ſlow fever, with a ſmall and irregular pulſe, pale, or whitiſh urine, a ſhort and dry cough, (which is an almoſt conſtant ſymptom where the complaint is of long ſtanding, and has injured the health;) ſometimes even con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions, epilepſies, and partial palſies of the lower extremities. Children, whoſe digeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is weak, are moſt liable to be troubled with theſe vermin, which are ſometimes ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry eaſily removed, and at other times very difficult of cure, and ſubject to return.</p>

The Cauſe of this troubleſome complaint is not perhaps certainly known<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the great moiſture of young perſons is thought to be an occaſion of their being more infeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with them than older people. Since the doctrine of equivocal generation has been juſtly exploded, it has been generally ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, that worms are engendered from the eggs of inſects, which float in the air, or are ſwallowed with ſome part of our food, ſuch as ſummer fruits, vegetables, cheeſe, and ſome kinds of fleſh meats. But perhaps this is not altogether ſo certain as it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear at firſt ſight, unleſs we are to imagine that theſe ſuppoſed eggs produce very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent inſects, from being taken into the ſtomach and bowels, than they would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe do; ſince we do not meet with inſects of this kind, eſpecially the tape-worm, any where elſe.<note n="*" place="bottom">Linnaeus and others have though the Teretes, or Lubrici, to be the ſame with the common earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worm; but Tyſon has, by diſſections, demonſtrated the contrary. <hi>Philoſoph.

The like, however, are ſaid to be met with in running waters, as well as the bodies of different animals. But as the fact is not generally known, it were deſirable to have it eſtabliſhed on the authority of ſeveral wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: I happen to remember none, indeed, but that of Roſeen, whoſe veracity, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I do not, in the leaſt diſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But whatever be the cauſe, the general intention of Cure is obvious enough, which is to bring them away in the moſt eaſy, and expeditious manner, whether alive or dead; the difficulty chiefly conſiſting in diſlodging them from their firm attachment to the ſides of the bowels. To this end, a variety of medicines, pretty much of the ſame kind, has been deviſed, and has ſerved the cauſe of empiriciſm in every age. Moſt of them conſiſt either of the bitter purges, or mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curials, to which are ſometimes joined ſteel, and tin.</p>
               <p>Worms exiſting in the bowels can, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, only be carried away by purging; and very active purges are indicated when the time of life and conſtitution do not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid: on this principle, turn almoſt all the empyrical medicines preſcribed for worms. But when the age and conſtitution are ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, gentle purges given duly for ſome time, by the conſtancy of their operation produce, without harm, an effect equally, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps more beneficial and laſting, that the
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:026291_0114_0FCFA51ABAC7AF08"/>
active purges: hence have ariſen the family receipts, as worm-ſeed, tanſey, and ſuch like, (given in treacle or honey) rhubarb, ſenna, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>If the child therefore be of a delicate ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, or the complaint not of long ſtanding, a little ſenna-tea taken every other morning, may be a proper medicine to begin with; but ſhould this, in any inſtance, prove in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient, a few grains of the powder of ſcammony with calomel may be given the overnight, once or twice a week, according to the age and ſtrength of the child. If purging much ſhould, on any account, be found improper, the following is very ſafe, and often effectual.</p>

               <p>About eight or ten grains of this powder, with three or four grains of rhubarb, and as much unwaſhed calx of antimony, may be taken every morning, in a little honey, for a week together; after which, a clyſter of ſuccotorine aloes, diſſolved in warm milk, ſhould be thrown up over night, and a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per doſe of rhubarb, or ſenna-tea be taken the next morning: which courſe may be repeated, as the obſtinacy of the complaint, or the ſtrength of the child ſhall direct.—Volatile alkalies alſo, in ſome debilitated ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, will prove ſerviceable.</p>

Amongſt other means, eſpecially for ſuch as may be at a diſtance from medical aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, is a mixture of pewter filings and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, of which children of four or five years old, may take ſeveral tea-ſpoonfuls in a day, almoſt at pleaſure; which they will alſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily do, for the ſake of the treacle. At the ſame time, from five to ten grains of jalap, with as much of the <hi>hydrargyrus cum ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phure</hi> ſhould be given twice every week, to carry the worms down, as they die. To anſwer the laſt purpoſe, equal parts of bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock's gall, and powdered aloes; may be mixed up with butter, and the parts below the navel be anointed with it, two or three times a week; or ſuccotorine aloes and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of dried rue, made into a plaiſter with Venice treacle, and applied round the navel, firſt covering that part with a little cotton.—I mention theſe things with a view to the country poor, whom the benevolence of their neighbours may incline them to aſſiſt, and who may, by theſe eaſy means, do it at ſo little expence to themſelves. Amongſt ſuch likewiſe, the decoction of quickſilver, in the proportion of about two ounces to a pint of water, may be made trial of, and and taken as a common drink, of which ſome people have entertained a very high opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. When this ſhall be drank, the like quantity of water may be added, as often as it may be wanted.</p>

                  <pb n="99" facs="unknown:026291_0116_0FCF891D09A7F068"/>
If the complaint, however, has been of long ſtanding, and the child not very young, mercurial purges are a more expeditious, and a ſafe remedy; though the <hi>hydrargyrus cum ſulphure</hi> taken for a length of time, and occaſionally purging with ſenna, has ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſucceeded, even where there have been the ſevereſt convulſions. For which like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, or obſtinate contractions of the limbs, the warm-bath is often eſſentially neceſſary.</p>
               <p>Throughout the cure, and indeed after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, the diet ſhould be ſtrictly attended to, and all fat and greaſy aliments abſtained from. The child ſhould live upon milk, broths, and meats of eaſy digeſtion, with toaſted bread and honey, inſtead of butter, which is exceedingly pernicious.—To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent a return of the complaint in older children, or grown people, chalybeate-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and bitters may be made uſe of.</p>

               <head>CONVULSIONS.</head>
               <p>CONVULSIONS are of two kinds; the <hi>ſymptomatic,</hi> depending upon another diſeaſe, and the <hi>idiopathic,</hi> ſaid to be an original complaint, and ariſing from a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid affection of the brain, though the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction be not, perhaps, perfectly philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical, or accurate. It is for want of ſome ſuch diſcrimination, however, that writers have had occaſion to obſerve, that children
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:026291_0117_0FCFA513BAA00E80"/>
are much oftener ſuppoſed to die of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions than they really do; for though a convulſion frequently cloſes the ſcene, it has generally ariſen from the great irritabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of their nerves, and violence of the diſeaſe under which they have laboured.</p>
               <p>Such original Cauſe may be a raſh impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly repelled; but is much oftener ſeated in the gums, in the time of teething; or in the firſt-paſſages, where ſome undigeſted mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or ſometimes pent-up wind, irritates the coates of the inteſtines, and produces irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular motions throughout the whole nervous ſyſtem. Such a load, whether from too great a quantity, or bad quality of the food, by occaſioning a faulty ſecretion, muſt act like a poiſon; and that the convulſions are ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this cauſe may often be known by the complaints that have preceded them, ſuch as loathings, coſtiveneſs, purging, pale countenance, large belly, and diſturbed ſleep. If the child is two or three years old, any load at the ſtomach may be more readily diſcovered; the tongue will be foul, the ſkin hot, and the pulſe quick and weak. But ſhould it be granted, that the convulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of children are generally ſymptomatic, they may nevertheleſs be ſaid to die of them more frequently than ſome authors have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed; for where a diſeaſe is diſpoſed to produce violent convulſions, the convulſion, though a mere ſymptom, may carry off the
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:026291_0118_0FCFA512515A13E0"/>
patient: but as it may ſometimes be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented or removed, by its peculiar reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, (the diſeaſe which occaſioned it being at the ſame time properly treated) infants may often be recovered, who would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe expire in a convulſion fit.</p>
               <p>Any little matter capable of irritating the nervous ſyſtem, will induce the ſymptoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic convulſions in ſome infants, whilſt others will withſtand a great deal. For ſuch ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits as the former, the cold bath will be found the beſt preſervative. Every young infant is, however, more or leſs, prediſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this complaint; and the diſpoſition continues throughout childhood, in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the age and delicacy of the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit. The younger and more irritable, therefore, an infant may be, it will be ſo much the more liable to the ſymptomatic convulſion, eſpecially from any conſiderable diſturbance in the firſt paſſages, as was men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned before, particularly the bad quality, or over thickneſs of the breaſt-milk, or other food; and from frights of the wet nurſe. Of this I remember a remarkable inſtance in a patient of my own, in whoſe houſe a viſiter dropped down ſuddenly dead. The mother of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> child, which was ſix months old, was exceedingly alarmed, but her at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention being for a moment called off by its crying, ſhe incautiouſly put it to her breaſt. It was not an hour afterwards that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:026291_0119_0FCFA50FF2EFB7F8"/>
was ſeized with a ſit, and lay either convulſed or drowſy, without ſo much as taking the breaſt, for the ſpace of ſix and thirty hours; though it was at length hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily recovered.</p>
               <p>The cure of every convulſion will conſiſt, principally, in removing the exciting cauſes, which muſt, therefore, be inquired into. If from improper food and indigeſtion, a gentle emetic ſhould be given. If the ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritation be in the bowels, whatever will car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry down their acrid contents will cure the convulſions, if adminiſtered in time; and we ought generally to begin with a clyſter. If the ſtools appear very foul after common purges, (in which caſe there will frequently be a difficulty of breathing) a few grains of the powder of ſcammony with calomel may be given with great propriety. But if the diſpoſition to convulſions continues, after the bowels have been properly cleanſed, and no new irritation of them may be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, antiſpaſmodics ſhould be adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,<note n="*" place="bottom">I ſpeak from my own experience of the efficacy of ſuch remedies, and it may not be amiſs to obſerve that Harris, who is extremely cautions of giving heating medicines to infants, ſpeaks favourably of ſome of theſe.—"Uſus horum (ſays he) hand pror<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus improbandus eſt, vel in tenellis: nempe quia aci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum abſorbendi facultate excellunt.

ſpirit of hartſhorn, or drop or two of lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, or, what I have found remarkably ſucceſsful, oil of rue; which though an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolete medicine, I think I have never admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtered, when there was any chance of recovery, where it has not been ſerviceable. Rubbing the back bone, palms of the hands, and ſoles of feet with oil of amber, or wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ammonia, has likewiſe had a good effect. A very common cauſe, however, of recurring convulſions is worms, and where no other probable one may appear, ought to be ſuſpected; the cure will then depend on the proper treatment of that complaint.</p>

ſalt of amber, bid the faireſt for adminiſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing relief. But when the cauſe is unknown, as the approach of ſmall pox, meaſles, or other eruptive complaint, bathing the feet in warm water, and throwing up a clyſter, are the ſafeſt means. If from teething, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter gentle evacuations, and other means di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected under that head, bliſters, oil of rue, laudanum, or the compound ſpirit of vitri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olic aether, and eſpecially lancing the gums, are the grand remedies.</p>
               <p>When repeated convulſions connected with ſome diſorder in the firſt paſſages, and recurring for ſeveral months have withſtood all the above means of cure and been ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to ariſe from ſome fault in the brain, they will ſometimes diſappear of themſelves as the infant gets older. At other times, the appearance of ſome other complaint has put an end to the convulſions, and not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frequently, changing the wet-nurſe; and ſometimes even weaning children, when ſix or eight months old, has ſeemed to remove the complaint. I lately ſaw a remarkable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the concurrence of two of theſe circumſtances; the child being ſeized with the ſmall-pox, and weaned, at, or near the ſame time. The infant previous to this, for ſeveral months together as conſtantly fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to violent convulſions as it chanced to chew a cruſt of bread, eat a bit of plain pudding, or even take bread and milk, and though
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:026291_0122_0FCFA509265F8838"/>
when debarred from theſe, and nouriſhed only at the breaſt of a healthy nurſe, the fits recurred every two or three weeks: but after going through the ſmall-pox in a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable manner, and being taken wholly from the breaſt, the fits ſoon diſappeared, and the child was able to take all the light food uſually given to infants.</p>
               <p>If convulſions come on without any of the preceding ſymptoms, they have gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally been concluded to be a primary diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, and to proceed immediately from the brain. Some derivation is therefore to be made, by bleeding, if the child ſeems able to bear it, or by leeches behind the ears; by bliſters; purging; bathing the feet in warm water; frictions of the legs, and rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing the ſoles of the feet with the water of ammonia. If children of two or three years old are ſubject to ſlight and frequent fits, iſſues or ſetons ſhould be made between the ſhoulders, or in the neck, and be kept open for a length of time: chalybeate wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters may likewiſe be uſeful. But when the <hi>idiopathic</hi> convulſion attacks very young chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, it generally terminates very ſoon, ſometimes in ten minutes, and is, indeed, often fatal before any means can be made uſe of. Though, indeed I have often ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, that we are frequently miſtaken in regard to ſuch haſty deaths, and that when convulſions prove ſo ſuddenly fatal, they are
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:026291_0123_0FCFA507D336D2C0"/>
commonly <hi>ſymptomatic,</hi> and are occaſioned much oftener than is ſuſpected by over-feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.—I have known ſome of the largeſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               <p>From this view of the diſeaſe, a few words more may not be wholly unneceſſary, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially as they will hold out much comfort in regard to this alarming complaint; by which, I am however, aſſured, many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants have periſhed merely from its not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing properly diſtinguiſhed. For though, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, every convulſion fit is to appearance exceedingly ſhocking, yet under proper treatment they are much ſeldomer fatal than is commonly imagined, however often they may recur: neither is the frequency of their returns during infancy, nor the long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of ſuch a diſpoſition an indication of future evils, if the fits themſelves be of the kind here ſuppoſed.<note n="*" place="bottom">The above obſervation is, I believe, ſtrictly true in regard to ſuch kind of fits; and though in ſome others, the intellects have appeared afterwards to be impaired, yet are the inſtances ſo very few, that there is uſually little room for parents to be alarmed in the apprehenſion of ſuch conſequences.</note> But though experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence warrants my ſpeaking with confidence on this head, and I ſhould account myſelf exceedingly happy in preventing any unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary diſtreſs that parents may endure, yet

would I, by no means, put them off their guard; ſince the recovery depends ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely upon an expeditious uſe of the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, that even the time loſt in calling in aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance from abroad may be fatal to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant.</p>
               <p>Fits of this kind are, indeed, pretty ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally known to ariſe from irritating matter confined in the firſt paſſages, as has been already explained, but I believe it is not ſo generally underſtood, how often ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are lodged in the ſtomach, (perhaps the <hi>pylorus</hi> itſelf); or very low down in the <hi>rectum.</hi> Inſtances of the latter are not wanting, wherein the hardened feces have lain ſo low as to dilate the <hi>ſphincter ani,</hi> (or lower opening of the bowels) ſufficiently to expoſe them to view, and yet the infant been dead before a clyſter could be procur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from a neighbouring apothecary's; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as ſuch fits ceaſe immediately after a plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful evacuation from the bowels, artificially induced: and I have ſeen an infant in the month, lying torpid for an hour together, in a kind of fit, and apparently in the very article of death, brought out of it entirely after a large and ſpontaneous diſcharge of thick feces. In like manner ſudden death has taken place when the load has been in the ſtomach; whilſt other children have been ſaved by ſpontaneouſly throwing it up.</p>

After what has has been ſaid it would be ſcarcely neceſſary to point out the remedies in a formal way, but for the ſake of direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the moſt expeditious manner of apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them. In the firſt inſtance, doubtleſs, the obvious means are a ſoap clyſter with two or more tea-ſpoonsful of ſalt (ſuch arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles being always at hand) and afterwards adminiſtering one or other of the purges for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly directed; which it may often be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to repeat for ſome days, perhaps with an interval between. But when an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant falls ſuddenly into a convulſion very ſoon after ſucking, or feeding, whether on any thing actually improper, or not, and the bowels have been for ſome days in an orderly ſtate, it may reaſonably be preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the irritation is in the ſtomach, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially if there be an unuſual paleneſs of the countenance, indicating ſickneſs; or on the contrary, any conſiderable blackneſs, with ſymptoms of ſuffocation; which I think do not come on ſo ſoon when the obſtruction is in the bowels.

food, irritating, and perhaps ſticking in the <hi>pylorus,</hi> or inferior aperture of the ſtomach.</p>
               <p>In the caſe here deſcribed it would be improper to think of a formal emetic, at leaſt without making trial of ſome more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditious means, ſuch as irritating the <hi>Pharynx,</hi> or upper part of the guller, with the finger, or a feather, or forcing in the ſmoke of tobacco, if that be at hand, which often inſtantly produce vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and put an end to the fit. To this end, the child ſhould be ſupported by a hand placed under its ſtomach and belly, whilſt the feather or other means are made uſe of; in which poſture the infant will be made to vomit more readily, and with leſs ſtraining, than in any other poſition.—It is hoped that the importance of the ſubject, as well as the very frequent ſucceſs attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the plans laſt recommended, under the moſt alarming appearances, may be thought an apology for the length of this chapter, as well as the ſort of repetitions made uſe of.</p>
               <p>It is farther to be noted, that ſymptoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic convulſions are ſometimes the effect of a ſalutary effort of nature, to produce a criſis in ſome diſeaſe the child labours under; in which caſe, great caution ſhould be uſed not to be over officious: bathing the feet in warm water, however, as mentioned before,
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:026291_0127_0FCFA501D25D3BA0"/>
will be perfectly ſafe, and perhaps uſeful.—Having ſpoken of opiates, I ſhall juſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that though they are often very ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable, when judiciouſly preſcribed, they become very hurtful if improperly admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered. They will, however, always be ſafe, where convulſions continue after the firſt exciting cauſe has been removed; or where they are ſo violent as to become an obſtacle to adminiſtering proper remedies; or when the originial complaint is of a ſpaſmodic nature.</p>
               <p>When convulſions occur many times in a day, it is of importance to attend to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the paroxyſms, or returns; from which a much better indication may be had of their immediate danger, than from the forcible contraction of the muſcles during the fit. For where the intervals are ſhort, though the fit itſelf be not long, nor vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, the diſeaſe is more dangerous, than where violent fits are attended with long intervals.</p>

               <p>IN the preceding edition, this diſorder was conſidered only in a tranſient way, under the article of <hi>Purging;</hi> both from its being conceived to appear chiefly in the form of a morbid ſymptom attending certain

I could indeed wiſh that this diſorder were yet better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, and that I were able to lay down a more ſucceſsful method of treatment than has yet been made known: it is however in every view worthy of the moſt diſtinct conſideration, as well from the obſervations made in this country, as from the late re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearches by ſeveral phyſicians in <hi>Paris,</hi> as I ſhall have occaſion to notice very ſoon.</p>
               <p>Having met with no account of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order either amongſt the ancients, nor very modern writers when I mentioned it in a former edition, I preſumed I was announc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a diſeaſe, at that time ſcarcely known, or at leaſt was giving the firſt public account of it: and this I believe is no uncommon miſtake of authors. Perhaps, it may be the wiſe intention of Providence, that in ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ages, many things relating to arts and ſciences ſhould be forgotten or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked, in order to emulate poſterity in the purſuit of knowledge; which men would, probably, be leſs inquiſitive after, if things once known were very rarely loſt ſight of. However this may be, I continued to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult the oldeſt writers, after having publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my former edition, and was once more led to conclude, that no account of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order

had ever before been given to the public. At length, however, I met with a ſolitary caſe, which had occurred in the hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital at <hi>Stockholm, Anno</hi> 1718, accurately deſcribed by <hi>Uzenbeſius,</hi> and recorded <hi>in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

It was, indeed, not till a twelve-month af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my ſhort account of it appeared, that this diſorder began to engage the attention of the French phyſicians, in conſequence of Monſieur Andry being called upon to take the charge of the <hi>Hoſpice des Enf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> at <hi>Paris.</hi> The diſeaſe indeed had been for many years noticed both in that hoſpital
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:026291_0130_0FCFA4FAD9A85C00"/>
and the <hi>hôtel Dieu,</hi> but having always prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed fatal, little attention had been for a long time paid to it, till Dr. Andry was elected phyſician to the firſt mentioned charity; ſince which time, no pains ſeem to have been ſpared in the inveſtigation of it.</p>
               <p>That the preſent account of the diſeaſe may therefore be clearly ſtated, I ſhall firſt conſider it as it has appeared in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and in the manner I had long ago in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, and had actually drawn up before I was favoured with ſome farther deſcription of it, by Dr. Andry, of Paris.</p>
               <p>It has, indeed, been much leſs common in this kingdom than on the continent, but is equally an hoſpital diſeaſe, and is ſeldom met with but accompanied with ſome bowel complaint, and ſtill more rarely appearing at the birth. It was firſt ſpoken of in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, I believe, by my friend Dr. Denman (when phyſician to the Middleſex hoſpital, and a teacher in midwifery); as I remarked in the former edition; and it is to him I was indebted for ſome account of it before I had at all noticed the diſorder myſelf.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Britiſh Lying-in</hi> hoſpital has been very little infeſted with it, and, poſſibly, by being ſolely appropriated to the recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of pregnant women, which the <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſex</hi> hoſpital was not. I ſhall therefore firſt of all lay down the ſymptoms exactly as they were noticed in that infirmary, by
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:026291_0131_0FCFA4F9B04B8E50"/>
Dr. Denman, whoſe unwearied attention to it, though not with all the deſired effect, does him more honour, than could have been derived from the moſt ſucceſsful treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a diſeaſe leſs fatal than this has proved wherever it as appeared.</p>
               <p>The following ſymptoms may be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as pathognomonic, or characteriſtic of the diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>1ſt. The ſkin is always of a yellowiſh white colour, giving the idea of ſoft wax.</p>
               <p>2d. The feel of the ſkin and fleſh is hard and reſiſting, but not edematoſe.</p>
               <p>3d. The cellular membrane is fixed in ſuch a manner, that the ſkin will not ſlide over the ſubjacent muſcles; not even on the back of the hands, where it is uſually very looſe and pliable.</p>
               <p>4th. This ſtricture often extends over the whole body; but the ſkin is peculiarly rigid in the parts about the face, and on the extremities.</p>
               <p>5th. The child is always cold.</p>
               <p>6th. The infant makes a peculiar kind of moaning noiſe, which is often very feeble; and never cries like other chirdren.</p>
               <p>7th. Whatever number of days ſuch children may ſurvive, they always have the appearance of being dying.</p>
               <p>This diſeaſe appears at no regular peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ods; but whenever it takes place it attacks ſeveral infants within a ſhort time; and
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:026291_0132_0FCF891524192E30"/>
chiefly thoſe, as I have juſt noticed, who may be in the laſt ſtage of obſtinate bowel complaints, in which the ſtools are of a waxey or clayey conſiſtence. It has been alſo remarked, that it ſometimes makes its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance as an <hi>original</hi> diſeaſe, and even at the birth; in which caſe, the infant has ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſurvived many days.</p>
               <p>I have ſeen the rigidity extending beyond the cellular membrane, ſo as to affect the muſcles, but only thoſe of the lower jaw, which became perfectly rigid: but this <hi>ſpaſm</hi> or <hi>tetanus</hi> is, by no means, a frequent ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, and does not ſeize the extremities as it is found to do in France; nor has the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, in any inſtance that I have heard of, been attended with the <hi>eryſipelatous</hi> affections conſtantly noticed in that country.</p>
               <p>The Cauſe of this dreadful complaint, when congenite, or evidently ſupervenient to diſorders of the firſt-paſſages, ſeems to me to be a ſpaſm depending very much upon a certain morbid ſtate of thoſe parts, and with which the ſkin is well known to have a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar ſympathy. But when, though an original diſeaſe, it does not take place till ſome days after birth, which, I believe, is rarely, if ever the caſe except in large hoſpitals, and other crouded apartments; wherever the irritating cauſe, in ſuch inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, may be ſeated, the diſeaſe ſeems to be an <hi>endemic</hi> of certain ſeaſons, ariſing from
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:026291_0133_0FCFA4F71C75ACD0"/>
that unwholeſome air to which ſuch places are peculiarly liable.</p>
               <p>The means of Cure in this country have been very different from thoſe that have lately been found ſucceſsful in France; but inſtances of recovery have been very few in either. As Dr. Denman did me the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of giving me the firſt intimation of ſuch a diſeaſe, I very naturally adopted his plan of treatment, which conſiſted in a ſtrict at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to the ſtate of the bowels; and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the ſeveral medicines very warm by means of the compound ſpirit of ammonia, which was adminiſtered every four or ſix hours; and was the only plan that he ever <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ound attended with any ſucceſs. Together with this, I after ſome time directed the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent uſe of a warm-bath, and chafing the whole body afterwards with ſoft flannel; and I think myſelf happy in having fallen up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one part of the plan that has ſince ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to have been attended with the firſt inſtances of ſucceſs in France, as will be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed below.</p>
               <p>As the diſeaſe raging ſo much in <hi>France</hi> ſeems to differ in many reſpects from ours, it is very doubtful how far the plan of cure lately adopted there may be applicable in this country, and my own experience has hitherto not gone beyond the means I laſt mentioned: but I would venture to ſuggeſt, that in many caſes, trial might be ſafely and
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:026291_0134_0FCFA4F53AD16750"/>
properly made, not only of carminative clyſters, but alſo of a grain of calomel pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to the infant being put into the warm-bath:<note n="*" place="bottom">To the warm water ſhould be added a good quantity of ſalt, and ſome Caſtile ſoap.</note> and after a ſufficient number of ſtools ſhall have been procured by theſe means, exhibiting other volatile and cordial remedies beſide the ſpirit of ammonia; as well as anti-ſpaſmodics of different kinds.</p>
               <p>It was after I had made up my mind about this complaint, in the manner that has been juſt noticed, that an advertiſement appeared from the Royal Society of Medicine in <hi>Paris,</hi> propoſing this diſeaſe as the ſubject for their next prize-medal. About this time alſo, Mr. TENON publiſhed his <hi>Mèmoires ſur les Hôpitaux de Paris,</hi> in which is a brief ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of this diſeaſe; and very ſoon after this, Dr. Andry did me the honour of ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me his Tract, intitled, <hi>Recherches ſur L'endurciſſement du Tiſſu cellulaire des En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fans noveaux-nès.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Though theſe works contain very accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate accounts of this diſeaſe, and to which Dr. Andry eſpecially has paid an attention that muſt do him great honour, they at firſt ſerved only to perplex my own views of it. This obſcurity aroſe from the diſorder be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing combined, or as I then rather conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:026291_0135_0FCFA4ED51CDB188"/>
intirely confounded with another com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint firſt publickly noticed, I believe, in a former edition of this work, under the term <hi>anomalous inflammation;</hi> and from which Dr. Andry had, on this occaſion, made two or three quotations. I therefore took the liberty of writing to that eminent phyſician, and was ſoon favoured with a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory anſwer, by which I hope the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic as well as myſelf may be obliged; as it muſt prevent any miſtakes ariſing from the accounts which the above mentioned works afford of this melancholy diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>After the deſcription given of this diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der as it appears in <hi>London,</hi> little more will be neceſſary, I apprehend, than to ſelect the circumſtances in which <hi>that</hi> in <hi>France</hi> is found to differ, as related by Dr. Andry in his printed work, as well as the letters with which he was pleaſed to honour me.</p>
               <p>It has already been ſaid, that it is more frequently attended with <hi>tetanus,</hi> and never occurs without thoſe appearances mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under the article, termed in this edition, <hi>Infantile Eryſipelas,</hi> eſpecially the redneſs and hardneſs about the <hi>pubes,</hi> accompanied farther with tumour and redneſs of the ſoles of the feet. But theſe parts, it ſeems, tho' of a purple red, are intenſely cold, very rarely ſuppurate, but ſometimes mortify.<note n="*" place="bottom">This is ſaid to be the caſe in four or five chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren out of twenty, all of whom certainly die in a few hours after the gangrene has taken place; and become ſo putrid, that by the next day, the ſkin ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parates from every part of the body, ſo as to adhere to the hands of thoſe who have occaſion to touch them.</note>
                  <pb n="119" facs="unknown:026291_0136_0FCF890FD75D6E18"/>
In one very late inſtance, however, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant was not cold, but on the contrary, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly hot. The legs, thighs, and ſoles of the feet were red and hard; but no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being made of a <hi>general</hi> tightneſs of the ſkin, it is probable this child was affected only with that infantile eryſipelas which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears amongſt us.</p>
               <p>Beſides the above variations, the infants are ſaid to ſwallow with extreme pain; the extremities, eſpecially the legs, are much enlarged, and attended with a ſerous effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in the cellular membrane, which we have not hitherto noticed: and the diſorder is likewiſe ſaid to rage moſt in the hotter months.—The infants are obſerved to die about the third or fourth day, or at fartheſt, on the ſeventh from the birth. It is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, there is another and very material variation, in reſpect to the degree of ſtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and immobility of the ſkin, which are not clearly expreſſed to be either ſo conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable or extenſive, as in the diſeaſe I have been deſcribing; but are more confined to thoſe parts which become red and tumid.
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:026291_0137_0FCFA4EC85D13260"/>
But in the inſtance recorded by Scuringius it was clearly otherwiſe, the infant being ſaid to feel, from head to foot, like a piece of fleſh dried in the ſmoke. The child ſurviv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a compleat day, during which time it took no ſort of nouriſhment; but never cried, nor made any kind of noiſe.</p>
               <p>Upon examining a great number of dead bodies at the <hi>Enfans Trouvès,</hi> the ſerous extravaſation is conſtantly met with; is of a deep yellow colour and fluid, but coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates with heat; the fat is peculiarly ſolid; the glands and lymphatics, eſpecially thoſe of the meſentery, are found ſtuffed, and the liver uncommonly large, with a great quantity of deep coloured bile in the gall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bladder; and the lungs are ſaid to be load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with blood, as well as to contain an unu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual quantity of air.</p>
               <p>The ſuppoſed Cauſe of this diſeaſe amongſt them, ſeems to me but ill accounted for; being attributed to the improper diet of the mother or her infant, or to cold it has taken at the birth: whereas, the coldneſs and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gidity of the ſkin ſeem to be but mere ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, and not the diſeaſe; eſpecially as their children, like ours, are but rarely attacked from the birth. It ſhould rather ſeem to be a true endemic, ariſing from foul air, eſpecially as it is found only to attack the poor, and particularly to infeſt the two large hoſpitals that are crouded above all others,
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:026291_0138_0FCFA4EA52E46148"/>
and receive the loweſt and moſt wretched part of them; of whoſe new-born children, it is ſuppoſed, one out of twenty is viſited with this diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>It has been hinted, that for a long while, little attention was paid to this complaint, on account of its conſtant fatality, ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred infants ſinking under it every year, in a ſingle hoſpital; four hundred of which are born in the <hi>Hôtel-Dieu.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſince Dr. Andry's election, various means have been attempted both by himſelf and his colleague, Mr. Auvety; and amongſt other means, the warm-bath, which appears to have ſaved the firſt child that was known to recover.<note n="*" place="bottom">Monſieur Souville, ſurgeon to the Military Hoſpital at Calais, has alſo given ſome account of this diſeaſe, in the <hi>Jo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

In ſome inſtances, it has been confined to the jaw only, as in Jamaica; in others, it has been attended with contrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and rigidity of other muſcles of the face, and a peculiar fixedneſs of its features. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, the rigidity has extended to the neck; and in one child I obſerved it to be ſpread ſo completely over the whole body, that the limbs could not be bent ſo as to place it conveniently in the veſſel appropriated to a warm-bath.

that it is ſometimes joined with the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going complaint, but rarely in this country; and even then, the jaw partakes only of that kind of rigidity common to other parts.</p>
               <p>In ſuch inſtances of Tetanus as I have met with, the attack has not been earlier than the ſixth, nor later than the ninth day from the birth; and as far as I could learn, the infants had not been coſtive (as menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by Dr. Evans), nor apparently un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>healthy: one, I remember, was a remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably ſtrong and luſty child.

In ſome, the eyes have been bloated, and the whole countenance much ſwollen.</p>
               <p>The cauſe of this complaint, which does not ſeem to ariſe from conſtipation, or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect of purging off the meconium, may, probably, be a certain ſtate of the air, as hath alſo been ſuſpected in the Weſt Indies; and the more ſo, as the diſeaſe has appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only once in the Britiſh Lying-in Hoſpital
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:026291_0141_0FCF890D283A3F90"/>
during a great number of years and then attacked ſeveral infants in a ſhort time.</p>
               <p>The remedies made uſe of at the hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal were, the warm-bath; fomentations to the rigid parts, frictions with oil and cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phire, and BATES's anodyne balſam; bliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters behind the ears, and to the nape of the neck; and opium, calomel, the bark, and aromatic confection have been given inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally.</p>
               <p>One infant, in whom the complaint was confined to the jaw, and who had leſs rigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity than any of the others; never looked ill, and had no convulſions in its limbs, died rather ſooner than the reſt. Only one ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived the third day: this child was not ſeized till the ninth from its birth, and lived to go out of the hoſpital with its mother, at the end of the third week, and we hoped was then recovering; but it had never been able to take the breaſt after the attack, and died three weeks after it left the hoſpital, though, poſſibly, not altogether from this complaint.</p>

               <p>THIS and the following complaint, as well as the two immediately preceding, which relate, ſome to the more early, and others to the later periods of childhood, are noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:026291_0142_0FCFA4E5E2531C00"/>
together in this place, on account of their falling under the general claſs of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions, and it is preſumed leſs improperly, on the whole, than ranking them according to the different periods of time in which they might take place.</p>
               <p>Very few words, however, on the Epilep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, or falling-ſickneſs, may ſuffice, as it is either pretty eaſily cured, or uſually conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues through life; and is too well known by this popular name to require a particular deſcription: an account of the various pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current ſymptoms would be equally uſeleſs in this work.—It may juſt be noticed, that the patient falls ſuddenly to the ground, and ſometimes without any perceptible warning, or at all ſufficient to ſecure him from injury; and is uſually much convulſed, but frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly retains his ſenſes during the fit.</p>
               <p>I believe it ſometimes takes its riſe merely from foul bowels, and certainly more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly attacks children of a coſtive habit of body: it ſhould then be treated agreeably to the directions already given in ſuch caſes, and eſpecially with active and mercurial purges: after which, the bark, chalybeates, and ſea-bathing may be ſerviceable. In other inſtances, eſpecially in more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced life, and towards the time of puberty, the epilepſy ſeems to be owing rather to a more ſenſible nervous irritation. In ſuch caſes, bliſters to the back of the head may

               <p>In the worſt caſes I ever met with, in which the fits were very long and violent, and to the number of twenty or thirty in a day, electricity has very ſoon rendered them weaker, reduced their number to three or four in a day, and gradually to one in a month; but did not entirely remove them. In ſuch obſtinate caſes it is generally ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that the brain is affected by ſome local and permanent cauſe, and a perfect cure is conſequently deſpaired of.</p>
               <p>When this diſeaſe has attacked children of five or ſix years of age, and where no treatment has been ſerviceable, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint has very frequently diſappeared ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly about the time of puberty, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a year or two ſooner. Where it does not, it will probably continue through life, and now and then prove ſuddenly fatal.</p>
               <p>Upon examining the brain after death, I have found a ſmall point of bone ſtanding out from the internal part of the <hi>os frontis,</hi> as ſharp as a needle (of which Boerhaave

               <head>TEETHING.</head>
               <p>THE complaints ariſing during dentition may next be conſidered, many of the foregoing being blended with it, the firſt-paſſages and the nervous ſyſtem being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways more or leſs affected. The ſtate of dentition is likewiſe not unfrequently an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of many complaints afterwards to be mentioned, ſuch as cough, fever, the rick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets, and even conſumption; under each of which heads therefore, occaſional references will be made to it.</p>
               <p>The time of teething is a moſt important period of the infant ſtate, and ſubjects into manifold complaints and dangers. Some writers, indeed, and particularly Dr. Cado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan<note n="*" place="bottom">See his <hi>Eſſay on Nurſing,</hi> &amp;c.</note>, and Dr. Armſtrong, ſeem to think otherwiſe; and that teething is ſcarcely to be ranked amongſt the diſeaſes of infants. They have imagined that children, if other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe healthy, would cut their teeth with no more danger than adults, who often out their wiſe-teeth, ſo called, at an advanced age, without any difficulty, and always with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hazard. They likewiſe obſerve, that many children get their teeth eaſily. But this argument muſt ſuppoſe the healthieſt,
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:026291_0146_0FCF890968C973B8"/>
and beſt nurtured children, to be, in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, in the ſame circumſtances with adults, which is, by no means the caſe; as they are liable to fever, dangerous purgings, and even convulſions, from cauſes that would in no wiſe, affect the latter: nor can they ſtand under ſome of thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints ſo long as adults, nor endure the neceſſary remedies. For the ſame reaſon, the meaſles and ſmall-pox carry off ſuch numbers of infants, when attacked by them a little more ſeverely than common, whilſt young and healthy people often ſtruggle through the moſt dangerous and complica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted kinds, when properly treated from the beginning. Not to mention, that very few infants, who are unhappily affected with <hi>lues venerea,</hi> recover under any treatment, whilſt adults are cured in the moſt advanced ſtages of the complaint, notwithſtanding ſome parts may be actually mortified. I have, therefore, no doubt, that the time of teething ought to be ranked amongſt the moſt dangerous to infants, and that the greateſt attention ought to be paid to it; though it is probable that Dr. Arburthnot greatly over-rates its fatality, when he ſays that one child in ten may be ſuppoſed to ſink under it.</p>
               <p>Some late writers, and particularly Mr. Le Febure De Villebrune, have conceived this to be a mere diſpute about words; but
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:026291_0147_0FCFA4DFA9491F50"/>
the difference, indeed, extends much far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For though I would, indeed, by no means aſſert dentition itſelf to be a diſeaſe, and have made uſe of any ſuch like expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on merely in a popular way, yet am I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident it induces diſeaſe in very many infants of every habit of body, and more eſpecially, however ſtrange it may ſeem, in the appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently healthy and robuſt. Indeed, weak and even rickety children, more commonly cut their teeth eaſily, tho' often very late; or if they ſhould be harraſted by a purging, and other complaints, they, nevertheleſs, eſcape with their lives oftener than luſty ſtrong children, who are frequently carried off ſuddenly at this period, unleſs the teeth happen to find a very eaſy paſſage through the gums. The ſyſtem, during dentition, being diſpoſed to inflammation, ſuch chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren muſt oftener fall into fever than the tender and delicate; like athletic adults, who are more diſpoſed to inflammatory com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, than thoſe who are of a colder, but leſs healthy temperament: and it is by acute fever, or convulſions, that infants are carried off, who are well known to ſurvive a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand lingering and vexatious complaints, if their <hi>viſcera</hi> be ſound.</p>
               <p>This period uſually commences between the fifth and tenth months, and the proceſs of the firſt teething continues to the eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth at the leaſt, and ſometimes much lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:026291_0148_0FCFA4D9D26FA678"/>
The two front teeth in the lower jaw are uſually cut the firſt, and it is commonly a few weeks longer, before the correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ones in the upper jaw make their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance. After which, it is frequently a conſiderable time before the next under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teeth come out; but ſometimes, though not often, ſix or eight are cut in a haſty ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Children ſometimes cut their teeth ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularly, or croſs, as it is called, both by the teeth appearing firſt in the upper jaw, and alſo at a diſtance, inſtead of being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguous to each other: this is accounted, and with ſome reaſon, indication of difficult, or painful dentition.</p>
               <p>Teething is uſually preceded and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with various ſymptoms: the child drivels, or ſlavers much; the gums ſwell, ſpread, and become hot; there is often a circumſcribed redneſs in the cheeks, and eruptions on the ſkin, eſpecially on the face and ſcalp; a looſeneſs, gripings, green ſtools, watchings, ſtartings in the ſleep, and ſpaſms of particular parts; a diminution, or increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſecretion of the urine, and diſcharge of matter, with pain in making water, (imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting exactly a virulent <hi>gonorrhoea)</hi> which often mitigates the fever. A leſs common ſymptom, appearing only in certain habits, is a ſwelling of the tops of the feet and hands: it ſeems, however, of no impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and goes away upon the appearance
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:026291_0149_0FCF8906A6EAF3A0"/>
of the teeth. I never met with it but in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants who cut them painfully; and being ſeldom accompanied with a purging, it is likely may prevent that fever which is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſo apt to attend. In all caſes, the child ſhrieks often, and thruſts its fingers into its mouth: and theſe ſymptoms are ſometimes followed by a cough, difficult breathing, fits, fever, ſcrofula and maraſmus, or univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal decay.</p>
               <p>Strong and healthy children cut their teeth both earlier and more eaſily than the weak and tender. I have known a weak, and rickety child, without a tooth at twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-two months old,<note n="*" place="bottom">Primeroſe ſpeaks of it being as late as the third, or even fourth year.</note> though it lived to grow up; but at the age of five years became ſcro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulous. Therefore air, exerciſe, wholeſome food, an open belly, and every thing that has a tendency to promote general health, will greatly contribute to the ſafety of den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition.</p>
               <p>Difficult teething is to be treated nearly as other acute diſeaſes with local inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If the body is at all bound, ſome opening medicine ſhould be adminiſtered, and it is to be obſerved, that even a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable degree of looſeneſs is uſeful; few children cutting teeth ſo well as thoſe whoſe bellies are at this time much more than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:026291_0150_0FCFA4D875E77BF8"/>
open. Diluting drinks are alſo very neceſſary, eſpecially if the child does not ſuck; with a light food, in ſmall quantities, and frequently taken. If much fever at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends, the loſs of a little blood, in ſome way, will be neceſſary; though children do not endure bleeding ſo well as they do other evacuations. If the propriety of bleeding with the lancet be doubted, a leech or two, as Harris adviſes, may be applied behind the ears, and is generally ſerviceable. Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters are alſo very uſeful, eſpecially if there be retention of urine, which will likewiſe call for the uſe of the warm-bath. Gentle diaphoretics are alſo ſerviceable, particularly of wine of antimony, or the <hi>antimonium tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tariſatum,</hi> which beſides opening the belly, often operate in this way: a bliſter ſhould likewiſe be applied between the ſhoulders, eſpecially if there is any diſpoſition to fits. And, indeed, if ſtools do not afford ſome conſiderable relief, there ſhould generally be ſome diſcharge from the ſkin; ſince a purging, and eruptions on the ſkin, when ſpontaneous, are the grand means of eaſy dentition. A little diſcharge ſhould there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, be kept up behind the ears, by rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing the parts with <hi>Spaniſh</hi> flies, applying a thread as before directed, or putting on a ſmall bliſter; which may be kept open. A burgundy-pitch plaiſter laid on the back will ſometimes ſuffice, which ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:026291_0151_0FCF8905A721C2E0"/>
every ten days, till the ſymptoms diſappear, or the teeth come into ſight. Even before this period, light ſcarifications of the gums are very uſeful, by taking off the tenſion; or if the teeth are at all to be felt, lancing them, as it is called; the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per method of doing which will be noticed below.</p>
               <p>I ſhall cloſe what I have to offer on the general plan of treatment, by obſerving, that the indications certainly are to aſſiſt the eruption of the teeth, and to moderate the inflammatory and other ſymptoms: which muſt be treated according to their kind: all parts of the body readily conſenting with the gums at the time of teething, but the nerves, the bowels, and the lungs, more particularly and importantly than the reſt. It has been obſerved, that a purging is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial, and it is, indeed, ſurpriſing how conſiderable a diarrhoea children will ſtand on this occaſion, and how very bad the ſtools will often be for many weeks toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and a child happily ſtruggle through; though at another time, an equal degree of purging, with ſuch bad ſtools, and conſtant fever, would prove infallibly fatal. The diarrhoea is therefore not only to be cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly treated according to the directions al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready given under the article of purging, but is oftentimes rather to be encouraged than ſuppreſſed. Very pale ſtools are at
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:026291_0152_0FCFA4D6D7730958"/>
this time not uncommon, and are ſometimes in vaſt quantity: I have known an infant have fifty in one night, at le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> by the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of a careful and diſcreet nurſery maid; and from the quantity of feces that I ſaw the next morning, I had no reaſon to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute her calculation.</p>
               <p>For the fever of dentition, beſides bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the abſorbent powders are eminently uſeful, and are in various reſpects calculated to afford relief. To theſe, ſometimes a grain or two of Dr. James powder may be added at bed-time, which, if there ſhould be any thing amiſs in the ſtomach or bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els will either vomit or purge, but other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe (it has been ſaid) will promote a kindly ſweat, which is always beneficial. Nitre is very often uſeful, joined with the teſtaceous powders, or a little of the compound powder of contrayerva—Sydenham directs three or four drops of the compound ſpirit of ammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſpoonful of water every four hours, for four or five times, and I have thought it very ſerviceable after proper evacuations; but this doſe may be conſiderably increaſed, according to the age of the child. Nor is a drop or two of laudanum to be feared, if the bowels have been previouſly opened, the pain be very great, and the breathing not difficult.</p>
               <p>A principal indication, it has been ſaid, is to aſſiſt the eruption of the teeth. This
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:026291_0153_0FCF89038A5B88F8"/>
is attempted, by cooling, ſedative, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulcent applications made to the gums; by rubbing them with ſome hard, poliſhed body, ſuch as the coral; or by dividing them with the lancet: which laſt is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mean to be depended upon. When it is found neceſſary to lance the gums, (which is ever, at leaſt, a ſafe operation) it ſhould always be done effectually, with a proper gum-lancet, and not with a needle, a thin ſix-pence, or ſuch like inſtrument, which will not ſufficiently divide the gum, or the ſtrong membrane that covers the teeth. The lancet ſhould always be carried quite down to them, and even be drawn acroſs the dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble teeth. It is certain, that this litle ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration gives ſcarcely any pain, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief is at the ſame time often ſo conſiderable that the child appears exceedingly pleaſed with it, and will immediately ſqueeze the jaws and grind them together forcibly, which proves the gums are not very ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>The moſt painful part of dentition, and that in which children are moſt expoſed to convulſions, is uſually from the teeth cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting through the <hi>perioſteum</hi> (or nervous membrane mentioned above) that covers the jaw immediately under the gums. This, I apprehend, in difficult dentition, is often not cut through, but is forced up before the teeth, when they are even in ſight under
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:026291_0154_0FCFA4D567360E30"/>
the thin gum; hence it is, that cutting through the gum is ſo very often uſeful, and takes off fever and convulſions, which ſevere ſymptoms could not ariſe merely from piercing the gum, which, it has been ſaid, is not a very ſenſible part. At other times; the pain and fever ſeem to ariſe from almoſt the very firſt ſhooting of the teeth within the jaw, and then they will very often not appear for ſome weeks after the gums have been properly lanced; and parents are therefore apt to conclude, the lancing has been unneceſſarily done. I am, however, convinced from experience, that this little operation, though not in the general eſteem it <hi>ought</hi> to be (and by the <hi>French</hi> phyſicians even dreaded at this period)<note n="*" place="bottom">See <hi>Lieutaud.</hi>
                  </note> is often inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſibly uſeful, and appears to have ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed many lives, after the moſt dangerous ſymptoms had taken place, and every other mean of cure had been made uſe of. And I cannot here for bear expreſſing my ſurprize, at the fears ſome people entertain of lancing the gums, and their delaying it ſo long, if not altogether rejecting it, though no evil can poſſibly ariſe from the operation. On the other hand, its advantages are ſo great, that whenever convulſions take place about the uſual period of dentition, recourſe ought
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:026291_0155_0FCFA4D396B40EB8"/>
always to be had to it, after an unſucceſsful uſe of other means; though by an exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the gums there may be no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain evidence of the convulſions being ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſuch cauſe; the irritation from teething, it has been remarked, often tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing place in a very early ſtage of the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs. At any rate, it has been ſaid, the operation can do no harm, even at any period, and ſhould the ſhooting of teeth be only an aggravation to the true cauſe of the diſeaſe, lancing the gums muſt be attended with advantage. But ſhould teeth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be the proper and ſole cauſe, it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent how fruitleſs any other mean of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief muſt frequently be: for ſhould convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, for inſtance, take place from a thorn run into the finger, or toe, the proper indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of cure, by an immediate extraction of the thorn, and the probable futility of other means, would be equally obvious.</p>
               <p>The operation may alſo be ſafely repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the ſcars doing no kind of harm. And indeed it will be frequently neceſſary to lance the gums ſeveral times, on account of the extraordinary difficulty with which ſome infants cut their teeth, eſpecially the double ones, which are furniſhed with two or more knobs or points. Fever, purging, and even convulſions will ſometimes ariſe from only one point of a large tooth offending the <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſteum</hi> that covers it, and being nearer the
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:026291_0156_0FCF890205CE09C8"/>
ſurface than the other points, the lancet ſometimes does not completely divide the membrane that lies over the reſt; and this part not being injured by the tooth, the ſymptoms ſubſide on having divided that portion of membrane that was inflamed. But in a little time, another point of the ſame tooth is found to irritate the <hi>perioſteum,</hi> and calls for the like aſſiſtance of the lancet, which again removes all the complaints. This, at leaſt, I have conceived to be the proceſs, when I have found lancing a large tooth immediately remove every terrible ſymptom, though the fever and other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints have returned, and the tooth not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared till the operation has been three or four times repeated. I have ſeen the like good effect from it, when children have been cutting a number of teeth in ſucceſſion, and have bred them all with convulſions. Nothing having relieved or prevented theſe terrible ſymptoms but lancing the gums, which has removed them every time it has been done, one or more teeth appearing a day or two after each operation.—In ſuch caſes, it will often be proper to draw a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet along a great part of one, or even both the jaws, at the ſame operation.</p>

ſuſpects that the inſtrument often injures them, and produces caries, which he thinks will be communicated to the ſucceeding ſet of teeth. But this is a needleſs ſcruple, and I apprehend ariſes for want of duly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to the ſtate of the teeth, which are perfect bone, and covered with a ſtrong enamel, long before they get through the gums. The manner of the ſecond teething of children likewiſe forbids ſuch a fear; for though the firſt ſet, which are deſigned by nature to be only of ſhort duration) ſhould actually be injured by the lancet, the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ones are not at all likely to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by the carious ſtate of the former. For the firſt teeth of infants conſtantly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come carious at the roots, and are looſened and expelled by that means, when left to nature alone; and though the upper parts of the new teeth are in contact with the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious bottoms of the firſt ſet, they never ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from this circumſtance. I have dwelt the longer on this head, becauſe writers are not agreed on the ſubject, and it is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter oftentimes of no ſmall importance. I have, however, written from <hi>experience,</hi> and am <hi>perfectly ſatisfied</hi> of the propriety and ſafety of what I have ventured to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend.<note n="*" place="bottom">See Mr. Hunter's copious and accurate account of the <hi>teeth,</hi> and their <hi>diſeaſes.</hi>

It has been hinted to be a common prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to touch the gums with oils and mucil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, and to rub them with ſome hard and poliſhed body. To anſwer the firſt inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, perhaps a little honey, or ſyrup of white poppys is as proper as any thing, or the honey may be lightly acidulated with ſpirit of vitriol. Beſides the coral, a cruſt of bread, or a piece of liquorice root, may be often carried to the mouth, and may ſometimes be preferable, as they will yield a little to the preſſure of the gums.</p>
               <p>It ſhould be a pretty general rule during the time of teething, to abate a little of the uſual quantity of food, and the encreaſe the quantity of drink; unleſs the child is very weakly, or every thing is going on per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly well: or if the child be at the breaſt, a ſimilar regard ought to be paid to the diet of the nurſe.</p>
               <p>Children will ſometimes have ulcerated gums in teething, and more frequently where they have not been lanced, which are eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cured by keeping the body open, and touching them with aſtringent applications. As much white vitriol, or roch alum as will give a moderate roughneſs to a little honey, is uſually ſufficient for this purpoſe.

               <p>THOUGH ſome writers have ſuppoſed infants to be as liable to fevers as adults, and from the ſame cauſes, I have, by no means, found it ſo, and I wiſh parents to take comfort from the conſideration; hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obſerved for many years, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ell in the hoſpital, as in private practice, that infants do not readily take common fevers, though expoſed for a long time to that contagion which has appeared to affect adults around them. Their fevers are alſo of a ſhort duration if properly treated, unleſs the few that ariſe from ſome more permanent irritating cauſe.</p>
               <p>Young children, however, are diſpoſed to ſome febrile complaints peculiar to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; which, as I have enlarged this edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion conſiderably, with the deſign of taking in all their complaints, I ſhall beſtow ſome pains in ſpecifying, as well as pointing out the treatment moſt adapted to each.</p>
               <p>The more frequent cauſes of fever, are teething, foul bowels, worms, glandular diſeaſes, ſome eruptive and very contagious complaint, or taking cold, and are often attended with ſymptoms peculiar to children. If from the laſt mentioned cauſe, and the cold be ſevere, it will always be attended with a cough, hoarſeneſs, and ſome difficulty
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:026291_0160_0FCFA4C8AF6D28B8"/>
of breathing, and often with running at the noſe or eyes, which will diſtinguiſh the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver from all others, except it be the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſles; which will be attended likewiſe with violent ſneezing, and a peculiar appearance of the eyes not often met with in a common cold.</p>
               <p>If a fever from cold be conſiderable, the cough violent, and the difficulty of breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very great, a bliſter will always be ſafe and expedient, and may be applied at the pit of the ſtomach inſtead of the back, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both leſs painful under any motion of the body, and more readily got at to be dreſſed, or for the application of freſh cloths, where the diſcharge happens to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable. But if the fever and difficulty of breathing ſhould not be very much abated by the bliſter, children though within the twelve-month, will bear and even be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly benefited by the loſs of a little blood,<note n="*" place="bottom">

In the little fevers ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from taking cold, to which ſome chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are very liable, I often join it with a little of Dr. James's powder, (proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the age) and a few grains of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound powder of contrayerva, lowered with teſtacea; which I find to be a medicine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly uſeful, when given in time.

But in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of fever, the breaſt-milk is often as good a balſamic as can be had; or if the child be dry-nurſed, a little ſyrup of balſam is both pleaſant and uſeful.</p>
               <p>If the fever be not owing to taking cold, to worms, teething, or ſome eruptive com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint,
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:026291_0164_0FCFA4BED32A6EE0"/>
it will generally be found to ariſe from ſome foulneſs in the firſt-paſſages, in which caſe, opening the belly, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards giving a puke and the teſtaceous pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, uſually remove it. But if otherwiſe, opening medicines muſt be continued a while longer, eſpecially caſtor-oil; but if the ſtools are very fetid, the baſilic powder, or ſmall doſes of calomel are the fitteſt purge; though they require to be adminiſtered with caution. I have known not only convulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but paralytic affections, attended with great pain and continual fever, induced merely, as I apprehend, by a foul ſtate of the bowels; where, after the complaint has been unſucceſsfully treated as a fever of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother kind, all the ſymptoms have been removed at once by an active purge. Even infants of only three or four months old will often have very conſiderable fever, and fits, with ſo coſtive a ſtate of the bowels as to require ſtrong purgative medicines to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated for ſeveral ſucceſſive days, with clyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and the warm-bath, before the obſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can be removed, or the fever will at all abate. And I doubt not, it may be mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ſurpriſe to thoſe who may not fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently have met with ſuch caſes, to find what a quantity of purging medicines have been taken by a tender infant before one proper ſtool could be procured, and how certainly a relapſe will take place, if the

opening plan be not perſevered in, in the manner recommended. In leſs urgent caſes, and eſpecially in very young ſubjects, much gentler means will uſually ſucceed; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the belly has been once or more well opened, many common fevers will nearly ſubſide; after which it will frequently be proper to return to ſome of the abſorbent powders, in one form or other, and that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended by Boerhaave<note n="*" place="bottom">See the preſcription under the article of Purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, page 85.</note> may be as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per as any; though the union of different teſtacea is of very little importance. Any of them will form an admirable medicine for very young children, as well under little fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, as for almoſt all their complaints not attended with much coſtiveneſs. This, the judicious Harris was ſo ſenſible of, that he thinks them alone ſufficient to effect almoſt every thing during the <hi>infant</hi> ſtate, and has done unſpeakable ſervice by aboliſhing that <hi>indiſcriminate</hi> recourſe to cordials, and other heating and rough medicines, ſuch as mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, <hi>aurum fulminans, theriaca,</hi> &amp;c. to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with various anile and ſuperſtitious remedies, which the ancient writers fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently recommended on occaſions peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly improper. And though abſorbents will not do every thing he has imagined, yet are there very few medicines of ſuch general uſe. But ſhould the fever withſtand
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:026291_0166_0FCFA4BC105AE7A8"/>
theſe common remedies, or be found to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, it will be neceſſary to give ſome of thoſe before recommended, or, what is ſometimes very uſeful, little draughts with lemon juice and ſalt of hartſhorn, in which the latter is left a little predominant; or three or four drops of the compound ſpirit of ammonia, in a little water, four or five times a-day. I have, indeed, lately expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced very good effects from perſevering in the uſe of ſmall doſes of wine of antimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, given in a ſaline draught, in the little obſcure fevers of infants, where the cauſe has not been ſo obvious as it common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is.</p>
               <p>On the decline of ſome fevers, eſpecially thoſe ariſing from fowl bowels, it is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common to ſee an eruption on the ſkin, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling that called the red-gum, in the month, and ſometimes even the thruſh will make its appearance, though the infant may have had that complaint already; which are marks of the great diſturbance the firſt paſſages have ſuffered, and of the conſent they have with the ſkin; the former, it has been ſaid, is always a favourable indication; but the obſervation does not hold good in regard to the thruſh.</p>
               <p>Fevers in children of three or four years old, are ſometimes tedious of cure by any of the above means, and like thoſe of adults, require the bark; which ſhould be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtered

in a light decoction three or four times a day, in ſuch doſes as the ſymptoms may require.</p>
               <p>I have ſometimes met with a fever, more remarkable for its being attended with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed and painful tumors, than for any other ſymptom peculiar to it. Theſe are ſeated chiefly on the legs, and particularly along the ſpine of the <hi>tibiae;</hi> and riſe in a day or two to the ſize of a nutmeg. They are marked with all the appearances of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſceſſes, feeling as if they contained matter, and on this account, they put on a formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable aſpect to ſuch as may not often have ſeen the diſeaſe; but what is remarkable, they never, I believe, come to ſuppuration, but diſappear again in a few days, though the fever ſometimes continues. The like appearances have been met with in adults, and eſpecially females, but perhaps more commonly in children from three to ten years of age; and are not peculiar to ſcro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulous habits. As far as my experience has gone, (for I believe it is not a very common complaint) they are conjoined more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently with that fever which attends a foul ſtate of the bowels, than with any other; which therefore requires repeated purging, eſpecially with calomel; and on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, the <hi>pulvis è ſcammon. cum calomel.</hi> becomes a convenient preparation.

               <head>MESENTERIC-FEVER.</head>
               <p>ANOTHER cauſe of fever has been hinted at, which is obſtructed glands, eſpecially the <hi>meſenteric;</hi> and is often a fore-runner of the true hectic fever, or fatal maraſmus.</p>
               <p>It, indeed, frequently ariſes from ſcrofu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la, which then diſcovers itſelf by other marks; and will require its peculiar treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But there is an early ſtage of glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dular obſtruction in the meſentery, and of the fever here alluded to, that is often falſely attributed to worms; but will not yield to mere purgative medicines. It at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks children from the age of three or four years, the fever remitting, and ſometimes intermitting irregularly; is attended with loſs of appetite, ſwelled belly, and pain in the bowels; the latter more commonly tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing place, more or leſs, every day, or is generally more violent if the child be a day or two free from it. After opening the bowels, half a grain, or a grain of calo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel may be given to advantage, two or three times a week, and on the intermediate days ſmall doſes of the <hi>natron ppt.</hi> either alone, or neutralized with the juice of lemons, or
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:026291_0169_0FCFA4B729AE5190"/>
in ſome inſtances partially ſo. If the belly be very coſtive, as it often is, an infuſion of the burnt ſponge and ſenna is more effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual than any thing; and when ſtrained through filtering paper, make a neat pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, and an excellent remedy for many little fevers, in older children, when the <hi>primae viae,</hi> or firſt paſſages are concerned. When the glandular fever, juſt now men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, has abated, ſome light bitter, as of camomile flowers, is uſeful to brace the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach and bowels; and to prevent a relapſe, it will often be found neceſſary to adminiſter ſome chalybeate, of which the <hi>tinct. flor. martialium</hi> is uſually the moſt proper for chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
               <p>But as this fever, from its great fatality and frequency, has lately very much enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the attention of writers, it may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to conſider it a little more diſtinctly in ſome of its principal ſtages; in each of which its nature and treatment ſometimes materially differ. For before the meſente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ric glands become much enlarged, or the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver continual; whilſt the appetite continues, and the firſt digeſtion is but little impaired, and no purging has taken place; the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mixture of ſponge and ſenna, with a few doſes of calomel, and afterwards bitters and chalybeates, are the only remedies very likely to be called for. In this ſtate, the diſorder may ſtill be conſidered as in its firſt
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:026291_0170_0FCFA4B2108CE870"/>
ſtage, and of which an unuſual coſtiveneſs, the hardneſs and recurring pains in the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and an intermitting fever, are the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal ſymptoms. The limits of this work, however, will not allow of a particular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail of the many others that attend this fever through its various ſtages; and it is preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they are ſo well known to medical peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as to render it unneceſſary. But in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, it may be ſaid, that indigeſtion, coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiveneſs or purging; irregular appetite; fluſhed cheeks, or a total loſs of colour; impaired ſtrength and ſpirits; remitting fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; and a hard and tumid belly, with ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated limbs, are amongſt the more conſtant ſymptoms attending, at one period or other of the diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>Children are liable to it from their infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to ſix or eight years of age, it being often a conſequence of the long continuance of almoſt any of the preceding complaints, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially thoſe of the firſt paſſages and denti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as well as the meaſles, and a few o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; of which that from teething will be ſeparately conſidered. Among the poor, it is too frequently owing to a coarſe and unwholeſome diet; indigeſtion at the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, and a conſequent vitiated chyle, with infarction, or obſtructions in ſome of the internal glands or lymphatics, being among the primary remote cauſes of the diſeaſe.</p>

               <p>As I am conſtrained to paſs over many leſs important ſymptoms occurring in the different ſtages of this long diſeaſe, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſuch as ariſe from ſome peculiarity of habit; ſo will it be neceſſary to confine theſe obſervations to the more general plan of treatment, without particularly noticing a variety of occaſional remedies, which ſuch ſymptoms might at different periods re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.</p>
               <p>In a general way, the principal indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are to remove the obſtructions in the lymphatic ſyſtem, and effect a reſolution of the indurated glands of the meſentery; to

carry off this viſcid matter; and laſtly, to ſtrengthen the ſyſtem, and eſtabliſh a good digeſtion, as well by means of proper diet as by medicine. To accompliſh theſe inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, attenuants and deobſtruents, purges and emetics, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               <p>The laſt means recommended were <hi>tonic,</hi> or <hi>bracing</hi> medicines, which can very rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be diſpenſed with; ſince although the obſtructions ſhould actually be removed, the emaciated ſtate to which the patient is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally reduced, peculiarly calls for bracing remedies, eſpecially with a view to ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſtomach and alimentary canal, and promoting a good digeſtion; the only means of obtaining a bland and nutritious chyle, by which the body may be conſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in good health. To this end, the bark, ſteel, the cold-bath, light bitters and aro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matics, are the principal remedies; to one or more of which, recourſe may be had, as the degree of remaining fever, and the ſtate of the bowels may point out. To theſe may be joined daily frictions, eſpecially of the belly and limbs; or the common ſoap-plaiſter, or one compoſed of ointment of marſh-mallows, gum ammoniac, and oil of chamomile, applied over the whole belly: or the body may be covered all over (as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by Mr. Baumes) with ſea-ſalt, reduced to a very fine powder.</p>

It has been already hinted, that the diet ought to be of the lighteſt and moſt nutriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous kind, and carefully adapted to the age and other circumſtances of the child; who, if at a due age, ought in many inſtances, to partake of light white meats, as well as vegetables, and plain jellies; but always avoiding fat and greaſy aliments, paſtry, and whatever may not be duly, as well as quickly digeſted, or will not form a bland and nutritious chyle, however readily they may get out of the ſtomach.</p>
               <p>Though in ſome inſtances, merely pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging with calomel or rhubarb, for a length of time has been ſaid to ſucceed, and in others, ſome one of the above remedies may be more adapted to the patient than the reſt; yet in general, each of them will be uſeful, at one period or other of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, and ſometimes the union of ſeveral: but above all, purging is always the moſt eſſential to the cure of this dangerous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe. And though it is oftentimes attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with coſtiveneſs and a voracious appetite, it is, at others, accompanied with a loathing of all food, and frequent ſtools, which do not reduce the belly, but too often deter practitioners from the uſe of active, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated purges; without which, however, experience proves there can be no proſpect of ſucceſs, after the belly has once become enlarged.—I ſhall cloſe theſe obſervations

               <head>HECTIC FEVER, and MARASMUS.</head>
               <p>NOT a few, both of the preceding and following complaints, are ſometimes found to induce a confirmed hectic fever, and maraſmus, or a waſting of the whole body, called by ſome writers <hi>Atrophia Lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantium;</hi> though it often comes on too late properly to admit of the name. I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing new, indeed, to offer on this diſeaſe when it ſeems to be far advanced, unleſs it be by way of encouragement to hope for a better iſſue in the hectic fever, under cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain circumſtances than we are wont to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect.</p>
               <p>This fever, as it is apt to ariſe from other
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:026291_0177_0FCFA4AB27C6A1E8"/>
complaints, is very often owing to their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been imprudently treated, or imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly cured, eſpecially by ſuppreſſing ſome eruption or diſcharge from the ſkin, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautiouſly ſtopping a purging during the time of teething. In ſuch caſes, and indeed whenever the hectic fever is of ſome ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the meſenteric glands become indurated, greatly increaſed in ſize, and often ſuppu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, the belly getting large, though the limbs and other parts become emaciated; which ſtate has been treated in the former chapter, and has been ſhewn to be curable, or otherwiſe, according to the degree of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duration, and the length of the time it has exiſted. But there is ſometimes a threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing appearance of hectic fever, where ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs nature effects a ſalutary and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful change, and will reſtore the emacia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted infant as from the very jaws of death. And this, indeed, is often the work only of nature, art doing no more than ſuperin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending it, and preventing her being coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teracted by the uſe of improper medicines, or diet.</p>
               <p>Nature alone will, indeed, oftentimes effect wonders for infants, and far beyond any thing to be expected in adults, if ſhe be not officiouſly counteracted. And the reaſon is obvious, it being well obſerved by

a great man, and a good phyſician,<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. Gregory—<hi>Comparative view of the State and Faculties of Man with thoſe of the animal World.</hi> 1785.</note> lately deceaſed, that "there is, in truth, a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er luxuriancy of life and health in infancy, than in any other period in life. Infants, it is acknowledged, are more delicately ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to injury, than thoſe advanced in life; but, to compenſate this, their fibres and veſſels are more capable of diſtenſion, their whole ſyſtem is more flexible, their fluids are leſs acrid, and leſs diſpoſed to put<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence; they bear all evacuations more eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, except that of blood, and, which is an important circumſtance in their favour, they never ſuffer from the terrors of a diſtracted imagination. Their ſpirits are lively and equal; they quickly forget their paſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, and never anticipate the future. In conſequence of theſe advantages, children recover from diſeaſes, under ſuch unfavor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſymptoms as are never ſurvived by adults. If they waſte more quickly under ſickneſs, their recovery from it is quick in proportion, and generally more compleat than in older people, as diſeaſes ſeldom leave thoſe baneful effects on their conſtitutions, ſo frequent in adults. In ſhort, a phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ought ſcarce ever to diſpair of a child's life, while it continues to breathe."—In
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:026291_0179_0FCFA4A5EE7ECD30"/>
farther ſupport of this ſentiment it may be obſerved, that their complaints are not often attended with acute fever, like thoſe of adults, which is diſpoſed rather to break up the ſyſtem, than to rectify the machine.</p>
               <p>The above mentioned ſalutary turns in the true hectic fever, as far as I have obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, are chiefly in that ſpecies of it ariſing from worms or teething; and in which I have known recoveries after hope had long been given up, and all attempts been laid aſide. There is, indeed, an atrophy, or uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal decay in infants, for want of the breaſt, or from the unſuitableneſs of it, or of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever elſe may be the child's ordinary food, (as I ſhall inſtance in another place:) but this is not uſually attended with fever, and is to be cured merely by making that change, which the nature of the different occaſions points out. Harris recounts ſome remarkable recoveries in what he calls the <hi>Atrophia verminoſa,</hi> (or Worm-hectic) and attributes the cures to the free uſe of the <hi>hydrargyrus cum ſulphure,</hi> carefully prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; but I have ſeen none ſo marvellous as in the <hi>Atrophia Dententium,</hi> or Tooth-atrophy. In this, I have known children after being reduced by purging, and other complaints, lying for three months together in the cradle, ſcarcely fit to be moved, with continual fever, fluſhed cheeks, emaciated countenance and limbs, a large belly, inceſſant cough, and
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:026291_0180_0FCFA4A4052EF338"/>
almoſt without taking any nouriſhment, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover, as it were in a few days, upon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedly cutting half a dozen teeth.</p>
               <p>After what I have ſaid on this fever, it will not be expected I ſhould offer much on the head of medicines; I ſhall therefore only obſerve, that after making trial of the mixture recommended by Boerhaave,<note n="*" place="bottom">Page 85.</note> when acidity may prevail in the bowels, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing opening medicines, as directed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the heads of coſtiveneſs and purging, are the chief indications in this advanced ſtage of the complaint. With this view, Sydenham's rhubarb-beer,<note n="†" place="bottom">Take of choice rhubarb ſliced, two drams; let it be put into a glaſs bottle, well ſtopped, with a quart of ſmall-beer, or any other liquor the child may make uſe of. This medicated beer is to be his ordinary drink. When this quantity is drank, a ſecond, and a third quart of beer may be poured on, as before; after which the rhubarb will commonly have loſt its virtue. Should the beer firſt poured on be too much impregnated with rhubarb, and purge too much, another pint may be added preſently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the firſt is drank up.</note> and purging with mercury, if that has not already been done, ſhould even now be attempted, ſince children in this ſtate will often bear ſtronger doſes of purging medicines, and more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently repeated, than under any other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances.—Some attention, however, ſhould be paid to the diet, which ought
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:026291_0181_0FCFA4A0D8C13C08"/>
chiefly to be of milk, rice, ſemolina, and ſuch like, with light puddings; but above all, plenty of freſh air, and as much exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe as the weak ſtate of the child will bear.</p>
               <p>In Dr. Armſtrong's ſecond edition, is a pretty long chapter on the hectic fever of teething children, wherein ſeveral medicines are preſcribed, which the doctor appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends may be very ſerviceable early in the diſeaſe. He ſpeaks of it as a very common complaint, beginning like other fevers, and gradually becoming remitting; then a ſlow continual fever, and terminating in a fatal hectic.</p>
               <p>It is very probable, that a fever of this deſcription, may be common among pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, relieved at diſpenſaries, and may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve ſuch a name, but, I believe, it will be rarely met with in higher ranks of life; and if ſo, perhaps, that ought to have been intimated in a popular work. It ſeems to me, (and Dr. Armſtrong, indeed, ſays as much) to ariſe from improper food and nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, joined with a coſtive ſtate of the bowels, and is therefore, very much the offspring of neglect. When advice is ſought for in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per time, it, accordingly, appears to be nothing more than the common fever I have deſcribed, ariſing from a foul ſtate of the bowels, and is eaſily cured by ſuch medicines as are beſt calculated to clear the firſt paſſages. Should this, however, be neglected, it may
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:026291_0182_0FCFA49F56F2A240"/>
degenerate into a continual fever; but it is not even then peculiar to the age Dr. Arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrong has ſpecified, nor, by any means, the common hectic fever of dentition.</p>

               <p>There is, however, a ſcarlet-fever that is not atended with any affection of the throat, and was long ago deſcribed by Sydenham,<note n="*" place="bottom">See alſo Withering and Cullen.</note> though not much inſiſted upon by later wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which is attended with a harder pulſe, and other ſymptoms of an inflammatory diſpoſition, but nevertheleſs, in every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance that I have met with, calls for the ſame general treatment, only more cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly adapting the neceſſary cordials and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nics to the degree of fever, eſpecially in the commencement of the complaint.</p>

<pb n="167" facs="unknown:026291_0184_0FCF88F1B3E01338"/>
ſickneſs, a quick pulſe, and pain in the head. The eyes are often inflamed, and where the throat is affected, there is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently a ſtiffneſs of the muſcles of the neck very early in the diſeaſe, which is ſoon fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by ſome difficulty in ſwallowing. The fever generally increaſes in the evening, and is often attended with tranſient fits of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium; but ſome remiſſion takes place tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards morning, with ſweating; and on the ſecond, or third day the effloreſcence ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears on the ſkin, and generally firſt on the face, neck, and breaſt.</p>
               <p>The limits of this work allow me only to obſerve, that the method of cure being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directed to the two indications of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral diatheſis, and the affection of the throat, the nature and extent of theſe muſt ever be kept in view, and the ſyſtem be duly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported. The throat ſhould be often gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled, or rather ſyringed, with mucilaginous infuſions or decoctions, rendered more or leſs ſtimulant; ſuch as the compound decoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of barley with honey of roſes, warmed with the compound ſpirit of ammonia, tinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of myrrhe, or a decoction of ſnake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>root; or other ſuch like preparations.</p>
               <p>This fever, eſpecially when epidemic, being almoſt conſtantly of a low type, the phyſician muſt not truſt to ſaline draughts, or other medicines of that claſs, without the addition of the aromatic confection,
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:026291_0185_0FCFA4989034BA38"/>
ſnake-root, or the bark, in one form or other; and beſide theſe, ſhould direct a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate quantity of wine to be given with the food, according to the age and other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of the patient.</p>
               <p>Should the affection of the throat there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be evidently inflammatory, or ſhould a caſe occur where the fever may ſeem to be of that kind, (which may be better aſcertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the hardneſs of the pulſe than any other ſymptom) it will rarely, if ever, bear bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, even in the beginning of the diſeaſe, as ſymptoms of debility generally attend in ſome period of the ſcarlet-fever, and will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low only of that middle courſe of treatment, hinted above.</p>
               <p>In a general way, a cordial plan is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired throughout the diſeaſe, and where the throat is much affected, either with ſloughs, or total blackneſs, the bark is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſably neceſſary, howeſover thick and florid the raſh, or however hot and dry the ſkin may be; the bark, as it were, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhing the fever above every other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy. Young children take it very well, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially the ſoft extract, diſſolved in a ſtrong decoction. Should it be diſpoſed to purge the child, a little of the ſpirit of cinnamon, or a drop or two of the tincture of opium ſhould be added to it; or if the child, on the other hand, ſhould be two or three days without a ſtool, a laxative clyſter

               <p>THIS is a diſeaſe very ſeldom met with, I believe in this country, but is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in France, as it appears by a paper read lately before the Royal Society of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, in Paris, by Mr. Saillant; and is ſaid to attack children of four or five years of age.</p>
               <p>The <hi>pathognomonic,</hi> or characteriſtic ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of this diſeaſe are, violent pains in the region of the ſtomach, ſometimes recurring every quarter of an hour; violent contor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the child; and the application of a hand to the ſeat of the diſeaſe. Mr. Sail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant in the firſt inſtance, ſuſpected that theſe ſymptoms might be owing to worms, and preſcribed accordingly; but that child dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a few days, the body was afterwards opened, and the preſence of genuine inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the ſtomach, and of a part of the inteſtinal canal was clearly demonſtrated.</p>

The treatment of this dreadful diſeaſe is, however, repreſented as very ſimple, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting only in cooling and laxative remedies, which when adminiſtered in good time, are ſaid to be uſually ſucceſsful. For this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, Mr. Saillant has generally adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the juice of the lettuce, by ſpoonsful, every hour; an idea he took up from Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livi, who directed the juice of the ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiſtle in the <hi>hemitritus,</hi> under ſymptoms analogous to thoſe of the <hi>cardialgia.</hi> The juice of the lettuce was generally was found to relieve the pains in a ſhort time, and ſome infants who had been judged to be in a hopeleſs ſtate, and even at the point of death, were perfectly recovered.</p>
               <p>Mr. Andry has done me the kindneſs of acquainting me, that he has ſometimes met with this complaint, in the <hi>hoſpice des en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fans trouvès,</hi> eſpecially during the ſummer, and at ſuch times as infants have been obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to continue there without the breaſt, for the want of wet nurſes; who are uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally otherwiſe engaged in the harveſt and vintage ſeaſons, as well as during a hard froſt. In the inſtances Mr. Andry has ſeen, the infants were found to vomit up every thing that was given them, which it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, muſt generally be the caſe where the ſtomach is actually inflamed. In ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, perhaps, fomentations to the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, and the uſe of a warm-bath ought to be made trial of.</p>

               <head>SMALL-POX, (INOCULATION) and MEASLES.</head>
               <p>IT were very foreign to the preſent inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to treat diſtinctly of theſe diſeaſes and their ſeveral varieties, being in no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect peculiar to childhood, and are noticed only to point out a few principal indicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to introduce ſome obſervations in regard to the propereſt time for inocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
               <p>Though the SMALL-POX is a complaint ſo incident to the early part of life, that comparatively few children living to the age of eight or ten years, are found to eſcape it, yet it is not ſo readily communicated, in the ſtate of <hi>infancy,</hi> as hath been general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imagined, unleſs by immediate infection.<note n="*" place="bottom">Some evidence of the propriety of this aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be gathered from the conſideration of there always exiſting a far greater number of infants within the month, than of children of any other age; and for the like reaſon, a greater number of thoſe under a year old, than of ſuch as are two or three years of age. For, every infant that dies at the earlier periods, reduces the number to which thoſe of the more advanced ages might otherwiſe have amounted; whereas, all the children who ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive to two or three years of age, having been firſt infants in the month, and of one year old, the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the latter periods is not diminiſhed by the death of thoſe of a more advanced age. Now, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one knows how very few infants he has heard of who have received the ſmall-pox, naturally, in the mouth, or even within the year; though few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of theſe are inoculated than of children above a year old. And this exemption from the natural ſmall-pox does not ſeem to ariſe from their not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing expoſed to the ordinary means of contagion, eſpecially among the middling and lower ranks of people who form the bulk of mankind; ſince the medical men who uſually attend ſuch lying in rooms, are very much in the habit both of viſiting the ſmall-pox, and of inoculating, all the year round: and even in the higher ranks of life, if gentlemen in the general practice of phyſic happen to be conſulted, the chance of their viſiting at the ſame time infected patients, is not ſo ſmall as may be imagined; not to ſpeak of the probability there is, that ſome one of the numerous viſitors, during the month, may by accident or otherwiſe, have been in ſome infected houſe in the courſe of the day in which their viſits may be made.</note>

The poor furniſh frequent inſtances of the truth of this obſervation. I have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended where children born in an air, ſatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated as it were, with the miaſma of this diſeaſe, (as well as of the meaſles) and even lying continually in a cradle in which ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther child has died a few days before, have nevertheleſs eſcaped the diſeaſe, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times when they have ſlept together in the ſame bed with one loaded with it. Hence it appears that highly tainted air, and even perſonal contact, are often inſufficient to communicate the virus. Yet we know that
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:026291_0190_0FCFA48E27A02A40"/>
infants are very eaſily infected, receiving the ſmall-pox by inoculation as readily as adults; though neither are at all times e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually ſuſceptible of it. Perhaps this latter circumſtance may not always be ſufficiently attended to; the mode of inoculation being often blamed, when its failure may be ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the indiſpoſed habit of the child. Poſſibly, on this account, it may not be perfectly ſafe to urge it, at ſuch a time; at leaſt, inſtances are not wanting, where twice introducing the virus having failed, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant has had the diſeaſe very ſeverely, and even fatally, upon its being repeated a third time.</p>
               <p>But in whatever way the ſmall-pox or meaſles may take place, they are to be treated as in adults, with but little other difference than what every practitioner is well acquainted with, that of greater cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and tenderneſs; as infants cannot bear the powerful antiphlogiſtic regimen and eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuations, often proper for the other.<note n="*" place="bottom">Ex toto, non ſic pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In the treatment of the MEASLES, not only ought children's bellies to be kept open throughout the diſeaſe, but unleſs they are very young, they will bear and even require one or more bleedings, at any period of it when the ſymptoms indicate its propriety.
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:026291_0191_0FCFA48BA24FD810"/>
And, indeed, the cure of the ſecondary fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, however long it may continue, will turn upon repeated bleedings, laxatives, and a total abſtinence from wine, and all animal food.</p>
               <p>I have now only to drop a word or two on the ſubject of <hi>Inoculation,</hi> becauſe pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents are very apt to fall into great miſtakes reſpecting the age, and circumſtances moſt proper for this operation.</p>
               <p>It is too common an opinion that a very young infant, ſucking at the breaſt, is the fitteſt ſubject for inoculation, and medical people have ſome difficulty in perſuading parents to the contrary. Children are then ſaid to be clear from humors, their blood mild and balſamic, their food innocent, and they are free from all violent paſſions of the mind. But all theſe advantages may be counter-balanced by the delicacy of their frame, their diſpoſition to ſpaſm, and their inability to ſtruggle with a ſevere attack of the diſeaſe, if it ſhould chance to fall to their ſhare. And ſuch, indeed, are the facts; infants uſually have the ſmall-pox very lightly, whether taken naturally, or from inoculation; though in both there are inſtances of their expiring in a fit at the time of the eruption; and they ſeldom get through the diſeaſe, if they are full, or it proves of the confluent, or malignant kind. And this furniſhes a peculiar objection to
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:026291_0192_0FCF88ECAE395408"/>
inoculating infants at the breaſt, which ariſes from their neceſſarily lying ſo much on the arm of the mother, or the wet-nurſe, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the night; the heat expoſing them to a much more copious eruption, than children who are weaned. This I have ſeen clearly exemplified in the inſtance of a child whoſe mother could ſuckle only with the right breaſt; the conſequence was, that the left ſide of the child was perfectly load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the eruption, (though the pock was of the diſtinct kind) whilſt the other had on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a very moderate ſprinkling. The child, however, ſunk under the ſecondary fever at the end of five or ſix weeks, though turned of two years old; the <hi>only</hi> child I have known to die of inoculation at ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced an age.</p>
               <p>I am aware that many children are inocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated very young, and even in the month, and generally with very good ſucceſs; but the frequency of this practice, among emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent ſurgeons, its owing to the urgent ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citation of parents, and their fear of conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. I cannot therefore avoid ſaying, that however few may die under inoculation, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any circumſtances, the fact is, that the far greater proportion that I happen to have had an account of, is amongſt infants under ſix months old.</p>
               <p>From this view of the matter, it is pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty evident, I think, that this operation
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:026291_0193_0FCFA489A68AE1E0"/>
ought, uſually, to be poſtponed to a later period, which is pointed out by the child having cut all its firſt teeth. To which may be added the obſervation juſt made, that infants are not much diſpoſed to take the ſmall-pox naturally, and that fifty chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren die under the age of two years, of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther complaints, to one that dies of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſmall-pox. Should it, however, be in the ſame houſe, or prevail in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, and the parents find it difficult to remove the child out of the way, it may run a leſs riſk in being immediately inocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, as that operation is now ſo well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, and ſucceſsfully conducted, than by taking the chance of eſcaping the infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or of recovering from the diſeaſe, if it ſhould happen to take place.</p>

               <head>CHICKEN-POX.</head>
               <p>FOR the reaſon given in the former chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I ſhall be very brief on this head. The complaint, nevertheleſs, merits a few words, not only becauſe more incident, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, to children than to adults, but alſo that parents are often at a loſs to diſtinguiſh it from the mild ſmall-pox; which it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times exceeds in violence, and is now and then even attended with danger. This is, indeed, not often the caſe, and the diſeaſe
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:026291_0194_0FCF88E4A46959A0"/>
has therefore been very ſeldom noticed by medical writers; and even Dr. Heberden, who was among the firſt that obliged the public with a diſtinct account of it, ſays he never ſaw any perſon with ſo many as three hundred puſtules over the whole body. Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, indeed, as he obſerves, are not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten called to viſit patients under a complaint uſually ſo trifling, or a gentleman of his long and extenſive practice, would have met with inſtances in which it muſt have appeared of more conſequence, as will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently be noticed.</p>
               <p>It is from this diſparity, I apprehend, that this diſorder is ſometimes denominated the <hi>ſwine-pox,</hi> which is only a ranker ſpecies of the diſeaſe, in which the ſymptoms may run higher, as well as the puſtules become much larger. In this caſe, I have known the head and face as much ſwollen as I have ever ſeen them in any diſtinct ſmall-pox, however full, and the puſtules containing a yellow, and ſeemingly purulent matter, with highly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed baſes, and exceedingly ſore; and theſe have formed a complete maſk on the face, after the turn, as is often ſeen in the ſmall-pox. One ſuch patient whom I was called to viſit, was about ſixteen years of age, of a plethoric habit, but very healthy; and what makes it very certain, that this complaint could not be the ſmall-pox, is, that the young gentleman died of that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:026291_0195_0FCFA488166068A8"/>
a twelvemonth afterwards, and poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly owing to its being neglected in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, from an idea that the former illneſs had really been the ſmall-pox. The latter miſtake aroſe from an improper anſwer hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been then made to my enquiry after the day on which the eruption had firſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (as I was not called in to viſit him till the diſorder was at the height); a miſtake the young gentleman's mother had a perfect recollection of after I was gone, and of which I reminded her upon being called to viſit him in the ſmall-pox, only the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his death.</p>
               <p>This caſe ſtrongly verifies the remark of Dr. Heberden, that this complaint can, in ſome inſtances, be diſtinguiſhed from the ſmall-pox only by its quicker progreſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards maturation, and the ſhorter duration of the puſtules; a watery veſicle always appearing on the ſecond or third day from the eruption; and the turn, at the fartheſt, taking place on the fifth.</p>
               <p>The treatment of it differs nothing from that of the mild, diſtinct ſmall-pox; but it more rarely calls for much attention, and only when a patient may have it very full.</p>

               <head>AGUE.</head>
               <p>THIS is a complaint ſo well known, that it ſeems unneceſſary here to enter mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutely into a deſcription of it. It is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to ſay, that it conſiſts of repeated cold and hot fits regularly ſucceeding each other, with one or more well-days between them; in which interval the ſick paſſes a high-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured urine, that depoſits a red ſediment.</p>
               <p>It, perhaps, partakes more of a nervous affection than other fevers may do, and is known to be endemic in ſome flat marſhy ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuations, but is moſt frequent in the ſpring and fall of the year; in the former of which it is generally eaſily cured, and is even ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſalutary. Autumnal agues, on the other hand, eſpecially in the country, and amongſt the very poor people who feed coarſely, will frequently continue a long time, and return again the next autumn; whereby the conſtitution becomes conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably impaired. In ſuch inſtances the legs are apt to ſwell, and more ſpecially the belly, which becomes h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

This circumſtance is noticed by Sydenham, and like other obſervations of that attentive practitioner, is a very juſt one, and was doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, the reſult of his experience. The hardneſs is probably owing to an infarction of the ſpleen, and uſually ſubſides in the courſe of a few months, eſpecially upon the uſe of moderate exerciſe, and a generous diet. It may be prudent, however, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter ſmall doſes of calomel, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards light bitters, adding likewiſe chaly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beates, if the habit of the patient ſeems to require them, and there are no ſymptoms of morbid affection of the <hi>viſcera.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It were needleſs to enter more largely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſubject, and it is equally foreign from the preſent intention, to be more particular in regard to the cure of this oftentimes very troubleſome complaint, as it would lead me farther than would be compatible with the deſign of this work. Some notice of it, however, is taken becauſe, though no more peculiar to children than the laſt mentioned diſeaſes, yet it may be ſaid, that there are comparatively very few children who have not ſuffered by it during the years uſually paſſed at ſchool.</p>
               <p>The ague, indeed, attacks every age, ſo that infants even under a year old are very liable to it, whenever it rages among adults. It is with a peculiar view to patients of the former claſs that the following directions are
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:026291_0198_0FCFA48525607F28"/>
given, the bark being uſually a ſpecific for older children and grown people; to whom, however, it is generally proper firſt to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter a vomit, and one or more doſes of phyſic.</p>
               <p>In a ſtate of <hi>infancy,</hi> the ague is often ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to, or connected with a foul ſtate of the bowels and obſtruction of the gall-ducts, and is frequently accompanied with worms, or ſuch a ſtate of the alimentary canal as affords a proper nidus for them.</p>
               <p>The <hi>tertian,</hi> or more common ague, at this age generally yields to purges of the baſilic powder, or calomel and rhubarb, given on the days between the fits, and ſmall doſes of Dr. James's powder on the return of the fever. Should this fail, a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſhould be adminiſtered an hour or two before the next cold fit is expected, if the powder ſhould not already have had that effect. In older children, the common ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line draught, taken once in ſix or eight hours, will frequently ſucceed, as will warm bitters, and medicines that promote and keep up perſpiration. A linen waiſtcoat with fine powder of bark quilted within it, may be worn by infants next their ſkin.</p>

Such kind of remedies for this diſeaſe are numberleſs; I ſhall, however, mention another, which, though as anile as any, ſeems to have been very often ſucceſsful; and is nothing more than the ſpider's web, rolled looſely up to the ſize of a child's marble, and waſhed down with a little warm wine and water, or camomile tea, before the cold fit is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected: the child ſhould then be put into a warm bed, and perſpiration be encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</p>
               <p>Crude ſalt ammoniac, in the doſe of ten or twelve grains, for children of five or ſix years of age, has ſometimes cured this trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome complaint; but may not be proper for delicate conſtitutions.

I ſhall cloſe this liſt of remedies with the following from Dr. Kirkpatrick, which is a very good one for patients no otherwiſe averſe from the bark, than that the ſtomach will not bear it in large doſes.</p>
               <p>Take of the freſh ſaſſafras bark, of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia ſnake-root, of roch-allum, of nutmeg, of calcined antimony, and ſalt of wormwood, of each one dram: to theſe, well rubbed together into a fine powder, add the weight of the whole of the beſt Peruvian bark, then add three or four drops of the chemical oil of mint; and with ſyrup of ſaffron make all into the conſiſtence of an electuary. This is to be divided into twenty-four doſes, one of which may be taken by children of eight or ten years of age, every four or ſix hours, while the patient is awake.—To make this or any other preparation of the bark ſit bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter on the ſtomach, the patient ſhould firſt

is, indeed, a milder ſort of hooping-cough, as there is of every diſeaſe, that calls for very little medical aſſiſtance; and it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in ſuch caſes, that matrons and nurſe, acquire their credit. But there is no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of children with which I am at all acquainted, in which medicine is at times more evidently ſerviceable, than a bad hoop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-cough.</p>
               <p>This diſeaſe is certainly highly infectious, and one of thoſe that never appears a ſecond time. It often begins as a common cough, and is attended with the uſual ſymptoms of having taken cold, but in its progreſs ſoon becomes more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>: the longer it may be before it plainly diſcovers itſelf, by the <hi>hoop,</hi> the more favorable it is likely to be. The fits of coughing are attended with a peculiar noiſe, not ill-expreſſed by the term <hi>hoop,</hi> and is ſufficiently known to every parent who has ever had a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſeverely attacked by it, and to whoſe feelings, it proves one of the moſt diſtreſſing complaints their children are liable to. A flux of rheum frequently comes from the mouth, noſe and eyes, and the food is thrown up, together with a viſcid phlegm, (often in great quantities) in the coughing fits; between which the child generally ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be perfectly well, and eats its food very heartily. Theſe are the more common ſymptoms, but when the diſeaſe is violent, and has continued for ſome time, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:026291_0203_0FCFA5F057133230"/>
greatly aggravated, eſpecially in the night, and the child will ſeem almoſt ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled in each fit, and the face and neck be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming perfectly livid, till by a violent effort, attended by a hoop, it recovers its breath; the blood will likewiſe ſometimes ruſh from the noſe and mouth. When taken in time, and properly treated, it is, however, rarely fatal, and ſcarcely ever but to young in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants.</p>
               <p>Dr. Armſtrong has ſtrongly recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wine of antimony as the proper and only remedy<note n="*" place="bottom">In his ſecond edition, many other means are recommended.</note> for this, as well as for almoſt every other complaint of infants, which, however oppoſite, in this caſe, the remedy may be, in a general way, is ſaying no more than that emetics and gentle laxatives are uſeful, which all modern practitioners are agreed in; and in which view, Dr. James had long before recommended his powder. But the fact is, that many other means are equally uſeful, and not unfrequently indiſpenſably neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, unleſs we ſhould ſuffer the patient to be ſtrangled in a fit of coughing, or fall into a decline, from the injury which the lungs muſt endure by a frequent repetition of ſuch violence.</p>
               <p>This muſt be exceedingly apparent from the above hiſtory of the diſeaſe, the various
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:026291_0204_0FCFA5EE995726F0"/>
ſymptoms of which, certainly demand a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable diverſity in the treatment. The more important ones are, the ſtate of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation, ſometimes inducing peripneu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony; the quantity and viſcidity of the phlegm; and the ſpaſmodic affection, and danger of ſuffocation; together with the exhauſted ſtate into which the patient may be reduced by the long continuance of the diſeaſe. If the breathing therefore be difficult, a bliſter is indicated, which if the child is not very young, may be kept open for two or three weeks. If the face ſhould be very livid and ſwollen, during the fits of coughing, if any veſſel give way, or the patient be plethoric, and more than two or three years old, or ſhould be hot between the paroxyſms, a little blood ought to be taken away, (which is ſometimes inexpreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly uſeful) and a ſaline draught be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered, every ſix or eight hours, till the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhall diſappear. Otherwiſe, if none of theſe ſymptoms attend, bleeding does not ſeem, in general, to be indicated, but may rather have a tendency to protract the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, by increaſing the ſpaſmodic diſpoſition, and by weakening the patient.</p>
               <p>If there be an inclination to vomit, it ought to be encouraged, unleſs the phlegm be brought up with great eaſe in almoſt eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fit of coughing, in which caſe, nature ſeems able to accompliſh the buſineſs her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:026291_0205_0FCFA5ED13183EA0"/>
and it will then oftentimes be ſufficient to keep the body open by the mildeſt laxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive medicines. But it very rarely happens, unleſs in infants at the breaſt, that ſome kind of emetic is not neceſſary in the firſt ſtage of the complaint. The diſeaſe, indeed, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry frequently requires no other medicine, for ſuch uſually keep the body open at the ſame time, which it ought always to be, but not to ſuch a degree as to weaken the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient. For this purpoſe, perhaps, wine of antimony may be as proper as any thing, when it anſwers the end, but it is leſs cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain than tartariſated antimony, and is not always, I think, of the ſame ſtrength. The latter is alſo rather taſteleſs, and will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have an advantage over every other medicine, when we are preſcribing for chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Two grains of this in two ounces of water, with the addition of a little ſugar, is a medicine to which children will never make any objection. From one to two tea-ſpoonfuls, given to a child of a year old, (varying the doſe according to the age) will in general, act ſufficiently; and may be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven upon an empty ſtomach, every day, or every other morning, according to the ſtrength of the child, and violence of the diſeaſe. If the cough ſhould happen to be more violent at any particular time, the emetic ſhould be given a little before the paroxyſm is expected. Or perhaps a ſtill
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:026291_0206_0FCFA5EBB1E909E0"/>
better method, at leaſt in ſome caſes, and particularly in very young children, is, to give the tartariſated antimony in ſmaller do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, together with a few grains of magneſia, or prepared oyſter-ſhell powder, (according to the ſtate of the bowels) three or four times a day, ſo as to keep the ſtomach in an irritable ſtate, as ſhall ſecure a gentle pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king every time the fits of coughing come on. But in whatever way this medicine be directed, it will prove of no ſervice if it does not vomit, and muſt therefore be given in a doſe ſuitable to the ſtrength of the ſtomach, which is exceedingly various, not only at different ages, but in children of the ſame age, and of the ſame apparent habit of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. If the tartariſated antimony has any advantage of the wine, it has much more over every other emetic I have made uſe of, the ipecacuanha, and oxymel of ſquills, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exceedingly unpleaſant, and the latter likewiſe uncertain.</p>
               <p>Such a plan is all that will be neceſſary in the common hooping-cough; but it has been ſaid, there are many caſes which will require other means, and demand all the ſkill of the experienced phyſican. The cough, for inſtance, will ſomtimes increaſe not only for days, but for weeks together, and the ſtrangulation be exceedingly alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. In this caſe, the milk of gum ammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niacum, but eſpecially aſa foetida, frequently
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:026291_0207_0FCFA5EA4A1688E8"/>
proves a ſovereign remedy, and though ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly nauſeous, many children will take it tolerably well for the ſhort time it appears to be abſolutely required; and when they will not, it may be adminiſtered by way of clyſter, diſſolved in two or three ſpoonsful of penny-royal, or common water. Theſe medicines, however, will be improper in the very advanced ſtage of the diſeaſe, when attended with hectic heat, hemorrhage, or other phthyſical ſymptoms; a caution equally neceſſary in regard to the bark, which in the abſence of theſe ſymptoms, and after the ſtomach and bowels have been well cleanſed, is frequently very uſeful at the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtage of the diſeaſe, when the patient has been exhauſted by its long continuance. Upon the ſame plan with the afa <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oetida, camphor and caſtor are frequently benefici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and have the advantage of being leſs nauſeous, but I think are proportionably leſs powerful. I take no notice of tincture of cantharides, though ſtrongly recommended by ſome writers, becauſe I have had no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of it myſelf, and indeed have never ſound any neceſſity for trying it.</p>
               <p>It will ſometimes be of no ſmall ſervice, to rub the hands, and the ſoles of the feet, with the compound ſpirit of ammonia, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times in the day; or the ſpine of the back, and the pit of the ſtomach, with oil of mace, (ſo called) or oil of amber; but
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:026291_0208_0FCFA5E932214468"/>
as the ſmell of the latter is very unpleaſant, it may be diſpenſed with where the ſpaſms are not exceedingly urgent. But when they are ſo, this oil is ſometimes very uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, particularly when adminiſtered inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, and children of three or four years will often take a few drops of it very well, mixed in a ſpoon with a little brown ſugar; from which I have ſeen as evident advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, as from any medicine whatever. In a little child of my own, it immediately gave a turn to the complaint in the moſt violent hooping cough I ever met with, and after almoſt every other medicine had been tried to no purpoſe; ſo that from the hour ſhe took it, the complaint was no longer alarming, nor tedious of cure. But frequently, no antiſpaſmodic is equal to opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, in this, as well as in other diſeaſes. With this view, two or three drops of la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danum, and, to younger children a ſmall tea-ſpoonful of ſyrup of white poppies, or to grown people from five to ten grains of the pilula è ſtyrace, taken at bed-time, will not only quiet the cough, and remove the ſtrangulation during its operation, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the patient ſome reſt, by which the ſtrength will be recruited, but in many caſes, ſeems to have a kindly operation on the diſeaſe itſelf. It is in this way, I doubt not, that the cicuta once ſeemed to gain ſome reputation, but I believe, it is no
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:026291_0209_0FCFA5E4F0078458"/>
otherwiſe a remedy for it than an anodyne. From a miſtake, however, in this reſpect, the ſtrong manner in which this medicine has been recommended by Dr. Butter, has certainly done harm; as I have known ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny people depend ſolely upon it in very bad caſes, to the excluſion of other remedies evidently indicated, which would, at leaſt, have ſhortened the diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>If obſtructions in the lungs be ſuſpected, bliſters ſhould be applied, and recourſe had to gently deobſtruent medicines; but at this period, the cure is chiefly to be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed by a vegetable and milk diet, (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially aſſes milk) pure air, and gentle exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe.</p>
               <p>The cough after having diſappeared for a week or more, is ſometimes found to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn with great violence, eſpecially upon taking cold; but a gentle purge or two, a vomit, and abſtaining from heavy food, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral remove it in a very ſhort time. If theſe cautions ſhould be neglected, the cough will often prove extreme tedious.</p>
               <p>The only thing that remains to be ſpoken of, is the proper diet, which for children even of five or ſix years of age, ought to be little more than milk and broths. Theſe are eaſily digeſted, and will afford them much more good nouriſhment than any kind of meats, and will ſit much lighter on the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach than puddings, or paſtry, the latter
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:026291_0210_0FCF895E2AED9BD8"/>
of which is exceedingly injurious. The objection made by old nurſes againſt milk, that it breeds phlegm, is utterly founded in a groſs miſtake that cannot be too frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly controverted. It has, indeed, been ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times mentioned by a certain claſs of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical people, but the objection is ſo unphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical and unlike objections of think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men, that it ſcarcely deſerves a reply. Should the milk, however, be found to curdle remarkably ſoon on the ſtomach, a little common ſalt, Caſtile ſoap, or teſtace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous powder, may be added to it occaſional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; or where it can be afforded, aſſes milk may be ſubſtituted for cow's. Theſe light nouriſhments ſoon paſs out of the ſtomach, or if brought up by coughing fifty times in the day, (as I have known them to be) a child of four, or five years old, will immediately take more of them with avidity, and will be better ſupplied in this way, I mean by taking a tea-cupful at a time, than by making ſet meals, or taking a large quantity at once. If the child ſhould be thirſty, a little apple-water, toaſt and water, and other thin drinks, will be pleaſant and uſeful. Patients treated in this way, will get through the complaint, if not ſevere, in a very ſhort time; and where it proves violent, a child will ſtruggle through this long diſeaſe without any conſiderable loſs of ſtrength, or will be very ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruited by a decoction, or cold infuſion of
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:026291_0211_0FCFA5DD5E0731E0"/>
the bark, together with gentle exerciſe, and a little country air, the beſt reſtoratives af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter every kind of diſeaſe. Such at leaſt has been my own experience in this tireſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, by which I know parents are uſually as much alarmed as by any incident to child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. But unleſs it has been long neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or taken place in the month, I have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver experienced it to be fatal, and then on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in one inſtance, though I have known eight or nine children in a family labouring under it at a time; and I wiſh to mention this as an occaſion of conſolation to thoſe who may have been led to think more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midably of it.</p>

               <p>Remote cauſes of this diſeaſe may poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be the lax fibre of children, the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of moiſt humours natural to them, and the vaſt ſecretion from the bronchial, or air veſſels; and perhaps the change of food from milk, which is eaſily aſſimulated, to one requiring more digeſtion.</p>

The proximate cauſe of this complaint is a morbid ſecretion of a viſcid mucus in the <hi>trachea,</hi> adhering ſo firmly to its ſides as to impede reſpiration. The quantity and viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>y increaſing, gradually leſſens the dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter of the wind-pipe, and if it effect this to a conſiderable degree, the diſeaſe muſt neceſſarily prove fatal.</p>
               <p>The Symptoms of this complaint are ſpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modic, being ſuch as would be produced by any other matter conſtantly irritating the <hi>trachea,</hi> and diminiſhing its diameter. They will therefore very much reſemble thoſe of the nervous aſthma, but the complaint dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers materially from the common ſpaſmodic aſthma of adults, in the peculiar croaking noiſe made in reſpiration, (from whence it has its name) and in the violence of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxyſms; which, however, leave no appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent indiſpoſition, ſave a certain dulneſs, and a ſenſe of fear, in children capable of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing it. The fits frequently terminate by ſneezing, coughing, or vomiting, and return without any regularity. It is attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a quick pulſe, laborious breathing, a ſharp, and ſhrill voice, and a fluſhed countenance, which grows livid during the paroxyſms, or fits.</p>
               <p>The diſorder is probably inflammatory in the beginning; and though this period ſeems to be very ſhort, yet ſhould the phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician be conſulted as ſoon as the diſorder

might be aſcertained, both emetics and bleeding might be uſeful; but after the <hi>croup,</hi> as well as difficult reſpiration have thoroughly taken place, it would be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper to have recourſe to any debilitating means.</p>
               <p>It does not always ſeem to be an original diſeaſe; being ſometimes a conſequence of bad fevers, and of ſome chronical diſorders that have reduced the patient's ſtrength. It frequently appears to ariſe from the ſame cauſes as the malignant ſore throat, only having its ſeat lower down, and is therefore more dangerous. And it has, in ſeveral inſtances, accompanied the malignant ſore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throat, as may be known in the early ſtages of that complaint, by the croaking noiſe pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to the croup; and, I believe, is in ſuch inſtances generally fatal.</p>
               <p>It is divided into two principal ſtages; in the latter of which no method of treatment has appeared to be effectual, but medicine is never more efficacious than in the firſt, if the diſorder be not combined with ſome other, and it be taken in time, though the crouping may be very conſiderable. This I ſaw remarkably exemplified in a little boy of my own, who was nearly cured in two days.</p>
               <p>The ſovereign remedy ſeems to be aſafoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tida, which ought to be adminiſtered both by the mouth and in clyſters, according to
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:026291_0216_0FCFA5D0B3E5A8E8"/>
the exigency of the complaint; and in the firſt inſtance, before any marked inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has taken place, may be given very freely. Antecedently to this, however, it may often be prudent to apply a leech or two to the throat, eſpecially if there be any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible fulneſs of that part, and a bliſter to the nape of the neck. At the cloſe of the complaint, and to prevent a relapſe, the bark proves highly ſerviceable, and will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo reſtore the ſtrength of the patient; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning, however, to the aſafoetida, if there ſhould be any threatening ſymptom of the aſthmatic affection, which is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common. Should a patient ſuffer two or more relapſes, to which a moiſt air will pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly expoſe him, ſome diſcharge, by a bliſter, or iſſue, ought to be procured, and continued at leaſt for ſome months.</p>
               <p>The French writers depend much upon emetics, and afterwards lenient purges; and to prevent a return, adviſe aperitives, ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machics and tonics, particularly prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſteel, and natural chalybeate wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>

<pb n="201" facs="unknown:026291_0218_0FCFA5CDA48DC9C0"/>
ſaid to have taken place upon the increaſe of manufactures, when people left the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages and huſbandry, to ſettle in large ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacturing towns; where they wanted that exerciſe, and pure air, which they had enjoyed in their former ſituation, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments.</p>
               <p>It may therefore frequently ariſe from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>healthy parents, eſpecially from mothers who paſs too ſedentary a life in a bad air, and feed upon a weak and watery diet: from children's food being weak, watery, or too viſcid to be properly digeſted; but above all, perhaps, from bad nurſing, and the child's being left wet, dirty, or expoſed to a cold moiſt air,<note n="*" place="bottom">It is remarkable, that this complaint is ſcarcely known in very hot climates.</note> without ſufficient cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; from want of proper exerciſe, and from cloſe and crouded apartments. Or laſtly, from the habit of body being reduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the long continuance of almoſt any of the complaints hitherto conſidered.</p>
               <p>The uſual ſymptoms of rickets are ſoft fleſh; bloated, or very florid countenance; weakneſs; diſlike to motion; with enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the belly, head, and joints. The wriſts and ankles enlarge firſt, afterwards the back, and breaſt-bones; and indeed all the bones ſwell and become ſoft, eſpecially
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:026291_0219_0FCFA5CCD9196A40"/>
the more ſpongy ones. The pulſe is quick, and feeble, and the appetite and digeſtion uſually bad. Teething is commonly late, though not frequently difficult, but the teeth often rot early, and fall out. Great acuteneſs of mind has been obſerved, in this, and ſome other chronical complaints. It ſeldom attacks children before they are ſix months old, or above two years.</p>
               <p>As it appears to ariſe from a general weakneſs and relaxation, the indications of Cure are to brace and ſtrengthen the ſolids, and to promote digeſtion, and the formation of good chyle. Theſe ends will be promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by wholeſome food, ſuited to the age; good bread, or biſcuit; dry food; and roaſted meats, rather than boiled; with a little red Port wine. Should the child be too young to eat fleſh meats, its diet ought to be chiefly of rice, millet, pearl-barley, ſalep, and ſemolina, with ſpices, if it be not inclined to be feveriſh. It muſt alſo have good nurſing, and eſpecially exerciſe and air, without being kept too hot or too cold: without a very ſtrict attention to theſe, medicine can be of but little ſervice. If the child is of a groſs habit, the eighth part, or a quarter, of a grain, of ipecacuanha pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, taken once or twice a day; gentle pukes, and very briſk purges, eſpecially of the powder of ſcammony with calomel prove of uſe.

If rather delicate, the cold-bath is often of more ſervice than any thing elſe: but this ſhould not be entered upon in win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, nor without previous purging.

               <head>SCROFULA, or KING's EVIL.</head>
               <p>THIS is primarily a glandular diſeaſe, though in its progreſs it attacks the adipoſe membrane, the eyes, the muſcles, tendons, and even the bones themſelves, eſpecially the joints. It ſeldom makes its appearance before two years of age, nor later than ten or twelve, (except it be in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to affections of the eyes) though there are a few exceptions in regard to the latter period, and it then often proves fatal, by falling on the lungs, or other noble part. It is frequently obſerved to follow other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders, particularly the ſmall-pox, whether taken naturally or from inoculation, but more eſpecially the former; alſo the hoop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-cough, meaſles, teething, rickets; and many other diſorders already mentioned. Hence, the nature of this diſeaſe is better underſtood, as it ſo often falls upon weak and tender habits, either originally of a lax fibre, or worn out by previous diſeaſes; or is gradually brought on by a heavy, indigeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible, and bad diet, or a low, wet, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>healthy ſituation. It is, however, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times found to be hereditary, but will very frequently lie dormant for two or three ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, and afterwards appear with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled violence. It is often attended, or
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:026291_0222_0FCF895A90965A68"/>
rather preceded, with a peculiar look about the eyes, which are generally large, and a thickneſs of the upper lip; and ſometimes proves a ſource of ill-health through life, but is not uſually fatal in the firſt inſtance. Long before the external glands become af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, eſpecially in young ſubjects, the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is obſerved to be hard and enlarged, and after death, the meſenteric glands, and even the pancreas have been found diſeaſed.</p>
               <p>Though this is a very unpleaſant com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, and one that does not often admit of much relief, yet it frequently diſappears at the time of puberty (and ſometimes ſooner) eſpecially in females; but whether this be owing to the increaſed ſtrength of the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids, or to other changes in the habit, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally happening at that period, is not an inquiry proper for this place.</p>
               <p>Although I thought it neceſſary to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion this diſeaſe amongſt others to which the ſtate of childhood is liable, I am ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble how difficult it would be to point out any thing like an adequate remedy. At its firſt appearance, however, bitter, or mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curial purges, are ſometimes of uſe, as are alſo antimonial vomits, and ſometimes ſapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naceous medicines. But when the diſeaſe is confirmed, lime-water, and decoctions of the woods, together with crude antimony, bark, and ſteel, with wine, and a generous diet, are, I believe, moſt to be depended
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:026291_0223_0FCFA5C6DAEF1C70"/>
upon as internal remedies; from ſome of which, I have ſeen no inconſiderable cures effected. But in this, as in other chronical complaints, good air and exerciſe are of the greateſt importance. Indeed, the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of exerciſe in this diſeaſe is ſo great, that I wiſh to lay a very great ſtreſs on it. But then it muſt be daily had recourſe to, and, by degrees, be ſo conſiderable, as to render the patient every night ſenſibly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigued. Thus, I have known riding behind a carriage, (as I have noticed in another work), almoſt without the aid of any medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, entirely remove the complaint.</p>
               <p>When there are external tumors, I am ſatisfied that the opinion I have already giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to the public, in a larger tract on this complaint, is both rational and ſafe; and that whenever they are at all diſpoſed to come forward, they ought to be brought to as ſpeedy a ſuppuration as is poſſible, and be treated as I have there recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The ſcrofulous virus when thrown on the ſurface, ſo far reſembles the cancerous, according to the deſcription of the ingenious Mr. Hunter, that it is inclined to ſpread to a conſiderable extent; but as tumors of the former claſs will bear rougher treatment than the latter, I am confident that much benefit may ariſe from the uſe of external ſtimulants, by ſtopping the progreſs of the diſorder in the neighbouring parts, as well
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:026291_0224_0FCFA5C5544AEE58"/>
as by invigorating them, and thereby diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the ulcers to heal. Alſo light fricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with mercury, ſo as to make it paſs free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly through the lymphatics of the diſtemper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed parts, without affecting the ſyſtem, have in a courſe of time been beneficial, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to be brought into a more general practice than they have hitherto been.</p>
               <p>I have lately had farther reaſon to be confirmed in the above opinion reſpecting ſtimuli, from obſervations communicated to me by Mr. Partington, who ſince the hints I threw out in the afore-mentioned work, has made uſe of electricity with very good effects, in theſe, as well as other cold tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors and ulcers I had mentioned; which have all healed very kindly, in conſequence of this ſtimulus to the parts. When ſcro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulous ulcers have been healed, and only ſome ſmall tumors remain, I have experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced very good effects from the external uſe of as ſtrong a ſolution of camphor in oil of almonds as can be made, which has diſperſed them very ſoon; and I have found it the beſt remedy, and a very ſucceſsful one, in the cure of the incipient broncho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cele, though enlarged to the ſize of a tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key's egg; and requires only to be very well rubbed into the parts, three times a-day. The patient ſhould at the ſame time take a dram or two of the <hi>tartariſated na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron</hi> every morning.—I ſhall only add, on
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:026291_0225_0FCFA5C317871240"/>
the head of ſcrofula, what is very well known, that ſea-bathing, alone, ſometimes effects a perfect cure. Should the child therefore have ſeveral ſcrofulous tumors, or the habit be conceived to be much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, trial ſhould be made of the ſea, in whatever manner it may be determined the tumors ſhall be treated, if not diſperſed by ſea-bathing.</p>

               <head>HYDROCEPHALUS, or WATERY-HEAD.</head>
               <p>THIS complaint is diſtinguiſhed into the the <hi>external,</hi> and <hi>internal;</hi> in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, the water lies upon the ſurface of the brain, over the <hi>pia mater,</hi> but in the latter it is ſeated much deeper, within the ventri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. The <hi>external</hi> makes its appearance at, or it is ſaid, in ſome inſtances, ſoon after birth. But children with <hi>hydrocephalus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternus</hi> are more commonly ſtill-born, though I have known one arrive to ten years of age,<note n="*" place="bottom">See <hi>Medical Communications,</hi> vol. I, in which there is mention of one attaining the age of 29, and another, 45 years, who were then both living; the former did not appear to have any enlargement of the head for three weeks after birth.</note> who was then unable to walk, or even to ſit upright in a chair. From a very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent inſtance, however, I have learned, that when no ſymptoms of <hi>hydrocephalus</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:026291_0226_0FCFA5C19E30F160"/>
at the birth, the water is <hi>ſometimes,</hi> at leaſt, contained within the ventricles of the brain: and from the circumſtance of no children living long with an <hi>internal hydro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cephalus,</hi> but ſuch whoſe heads enlarge within a few months after birth, I ſhould ſuſpect the diſorder has, in ſuch inſtances, taken place in the womb. The <hi>foetus,</hi> at this time, enjoying only a kind of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getative life, may arrive to maturity under ſuch a diſeaſe; various inſtances being met with, in which full grown <hi>foetuſes</hi> have had neither head, nor heart, nor lungs. Accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed to the above-mentioned diſeaſe, we may preſume ſuch infants more likely to live for a certain time with water in the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricles, than thoſe in whom the diſeaſe takes place ſuddenly, after birth.</p>
               <p>In the inſtance alluded to, the child's head began to be ſenſibly enlarged when the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant was about four months old, and the child lived to the fifth year, unable to walk, or even to ſupport its head. Upon a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful examination of the parts after death, the water, to the quantity of three pints, as I am informed by the ſurgeon, was evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently contained within the ventricles: which were ſo ſtretched as to compreſs the brain in ſuch a manner, that it appeared on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly like a ſmooth thick membrane within the <hi>dura mater;</hi> and of all the ſolid contents of
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:026291_0227_0FCFA5C0180A57B8"/>
the ſkull, ſcarce any thing but the <hi>cerebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum</hi> remained.</p>
               <p>The <hi>external hydrocephalus,</hi> at whatever period it may commence, has always been eſteemed a fatal, as well as moſt diſtreſſing complaint; but I have been informed, that where the diſorder has not been very mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt at the birth, bliſters on the head have ſenſibly diminiſhed its ſize. Theſe ſhould be applied, ſucceſſively, to different parts, eſpecially along the top of the head, in the courſe of the <hi>longitudinal ſinus,</hi> ſo as to keep up a conſtant diſcharge; which from the good effects in two or three caſes, when had recourſe to in good time, may poſſibly, in ſome inſtances, effect a perfect cure: at leaſt, the advantages already obſerved are ſufficient to juſtify the attempt, in a diſorder hitherto eſteemed incurable.</p>
               <p>Of the <hi>internal</hi> watery-head it may be proper to treat more largely, though I have nothing really new to offer in regard to the cure. It uſually takes place between the age of two and ten years; is a like melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly complaint with the former, and the method of treatment not yet well eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and as it can hardly be aſcertained whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any have recovered from it, (the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of its exiſtence ſcarcely being known but by examination after death,) it is not likely that a very determined, and ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful treatment will ſhortly be ſettled. It may
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:026291_0228_0FCFA5BA10E8EF08"/>
probably ariſe from falls and blows on the head, or from an original laxity of the brain; from chirrhous tumors and excreſcences within the ſkull; a watery ſtate of the blood, or a lingering illneſs. It appears, likewiſe, to be a family complaint in ſome inſtances; for I have known ſix children, born of the ſame parents, die ſucceſſively of it at the age of two years, five of whom were afterwards opened.</p>
               <p>The attack is ſometimes very ſudden; but the complaint more commonly begins with the appearances of ſlow fever, eſpecially in older children, with debility of the arms, and pains in the limbs, eſpecially the upper part of the neck. After a while, the child is ſuddenly ſeized with pain in the fore part of the head, and retches: It becomes heavy and dull; can bear no poſture but that of lying horizontally; the pulſe becomes irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, but uſually very ſlow; in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of the diſeaſe the faculties and ſenſes are impaired, and the eyes are offended by the light; the patient ſees objects double, and becomes delirious. As the diſeaſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, the pulſe grows frequent, the cheeks become fluſhed, the pupils of the eyes are dilated, the ſtools and urine come away in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntarily, and the patient lies ſleeping, or is convulſed.</p>
               <p>In the youngeſt ſubjects, I have known it begin with a cough, quick pulſe, and
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:026291_0229_0FCFA5B898BF0988"/>
difficulty of breathing, attended with cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſcribed fluſhed cheeks as in teething, occurring on every little exertion, with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual fever and coſtiveneſs; and ſometimes a diſcharge from the noſe and eyes.</p>
               <p>Symptoms indicative of the diſeaſe at this age, are, a hand often put to the head, or lifted upwards, and waving about; vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; coſtiveneſs; expreſſion of anxiety, and diſlike to be moved: at other times, an unmeaning look, and marks of inſenſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; the fingers often clinched, and hands tumid; drowſineſs; the eyes in ſome caſes impatient of light, in others, viſion is ſo imperfect, that the child does not regard any object however cloſe to them. The pupils are often not dilated till near the cloſe of the diſeaſe, and patients often hear and comprehend, and take food to the laſt, and die ſuddenly upon the decline of the febrile ſymptoms, when they have been thought to be recovering. Theſe and other ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, however, laid down as indications of water in the brain, are, in ſome degree, common to other diſeaſes of children, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cialy the dilatation of the pupil, and ſleepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in fevers ariſing from fowl bowels.</p>
               <p>For theſe reaſons, it is difficult to ſay if medicines are ſo often ſucceſsful as hath ſometimes been imagined; for when a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient recovers, it may be ſuſpected he has not had the true diſeaſe. Practitioners ſeem
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:026291_0230_0FCFA5B7207042A0"/>
chiefly to have depended upon repeated bleedings; purges with jalap, or calomel; bliſters to the neck or head, and diuretic medicines. A large bleeding early in the diſeaſe I have thought very beneficial, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in children of a robuſt habit. The uſe of ſternutatories, as powder of aſarum, or white hellebore, and electricity, have likewiſe ben recommended by ſome experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced practitioners; to all which I would add the application of a narrow cauſtic, the whole length of the head, in the courſe of the <hi>longitudinal ſinus,</hi> inſtead of truſting to a ſmall bliſter on the crown.</p>
               <p>Though I have made mention of calomel, I cannot ſay I have ſeen any good effects from the uſe of mercury, either as a purge or an alterative; and on that account ſhall not enlarge on the different manner of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting it with either of theſe views It has, however, been ſtrongly recommended by Drs. Dobſon, John Hunter, Haygarth, Moſely, and Dr. Armſtrong; but I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by other phyſicians of eminence, that they have not been ſo ſucceſsful in the uſe of it; and ſome good arguments have lately been advanced againſt an indiſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate recourſe to it, by Dr. John Warren; who adviſes trial to be made of emetics.</p>

An affection of this kind, in which the urine runs away in the ſleep only, is perhaps, more common; and I have known it continue to the age of fifteen or ſixteen years when not properly treated, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards yield to ſea-bathing.

The following ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count is tranſlated from the French of <hi>Mr. Le Febure de Villebrune,</hi> who refers to the Spaniſh work of <hi>D. Ulloa, (Diſc.</hi> XI. §§ 19 and 20) and <hi>Barrère's Voyage to Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 19. The <hi>diſeaſe of ſeven days</hi> of new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born infants is common in both quarters of America, and equally dangerous in the high, as in the low parts. A great number of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants die of it, without any thing preceding that could occaſion it to be ſuſpected. They
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:026291_0233_0FCFA5B16C355E18"/>
are, on the contrary, apparently healthy and robuſt, when the diſorder makes its at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack in the form of epilepſy; and few of thoſe who are viſited with it are found to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover. Though this complaint is not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unknown in Europe, it is neither ſo common, nor ſo dangerous. It is conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the beſt preventative were to guard infants from being expoſed to the wind, till the firſt ſeven days are over.</p>
               <p>§ 20. But infants at Guaneavelica are ſtill liable to another very extraordinary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint. Having eſcaped the ſeven-days-diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, they thrive well until the third or fourth month; they are then ſeized with cough and pulmonic affections, which they call <hi>pecheguera.</hi> The complaint goes on in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing without any ſenſible relief from the medicines made uſe of; and a ſwelling tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing place, they preſently die. The diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der attacks only the white people, or chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Spaniards; the Indians and the mongrels are not ſubject to it. The way to eſcape it, is to remove the infants from the ſpot, before they are two months old, and to carry them to more favourable climates, into one of the Zuebrades, (or the low grounds between the mountains) that are at a little diſtance. It is imagined, that the cold and intemperature of the climate is the occaſion of infants being ſo ſoon ſeized with this complaint. This may be the caſe in
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:026291_0234_0FCFA5AD8A812DB0"/>
ſome degree: but the vitiated habit of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of their parents, and the ſulphureous va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours continually iſſuing from the furnaces for the extraction of mercury, may likewiſe contribute to it. In fact, theſe vapours are ſo abundant, that when reunited by means of the cold, they form ſuch a thick cloud in the atmoſphere, during the ſeaſon there called ſummer, as to cover all the colony. <hi>Notic.

            <p>HAVING already conſidered all the more important Diſeaſes for which the Phyſician will uſually be conſulted, there remain now only ſome leſſer matters in that line. But beſide theſe, there are many complaints which relate rather to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of Surgery, and others that may be ſaid to be of a mixed kind, but have each a reference to the department of Midwifery. Of theſe laſt, more eſpecially, not a few may very well fall under the care of another claſs of readers; their nature and treatment, it has been already noticed, being in this edition rendered more obvious and intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible.

               <head>TINEA, or SCALD-HEAD.</head>
               <p>THE Scald-head is a very troubleſome complaint, and is ſaid to be often a ſcrofulous ſymptom; but I rather think it is uſually communicated by contact, and when lighting on a ſcrofulous habit may be more difficult of cure. I have never met with it in infants, but it being no uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon complaint in the later periods of child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, it may be proper to notice it, as it ſometimes proves a very tedious diſeaſe. I hope, however, to point out a ſucceſsful method of cure, the unpleaſantneſs of which has, improperly I think, prevented its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more generally adopted.</p>
               <p>From ſome conſiderable experience, I may venture <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o ſay, that being uſually a mere complaint of the ſkin, it may be moſt ſucceſsfully <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>reated by outward applications. This diſeaſe is ſeated in the little glands at the roots of the hair, is ſometimes dry, but at others moi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>, and then produces little ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:026291_0238_0FCFA5A15AFB5D28"/>
which being thoroughly cleanſed, and made to digeſt, may be ſafely healed up, as I have found in many other affections of the ſkin.</p>
               <p>It is not uncommon, I know, to admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter a variety of internal remedies, and perhaps they may ſometimes be required, though I think I have ſeldom given any thing more than lime-water, or a decoction of the woods; and a few purges at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline of the diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>If the complaint be taken early, before it has ſpread far over the head, and whilſt the ſcabby patches are ſmall and diſtinct, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> may be frequently cured by the ſulphur ointment, with a ſmall addition of the calx hydrargyri alba. And ſuch a preparation may very ſafely be made uſe of, if the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient be kept within doors, and his body be properly open; as it will be neceſſary to rub in only a ſmall portion, one or twice a day, on the parts immediately affected. But if the diſeaſe ſhould ſpread, or has already extended itſelf over a great part of the head, the hair muſt be ſhaved off, and the head waſhed twice a day with a ſtrong de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of tobacco; repeating this proceſs till the ſcabs diſappear, and the hair grows up from the parts they had occupied. Or, inſtead of the decoction of tobacco, the head may be well waſhed with the lotio ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponacea, with the addition of a ſmall quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:026291_0239_0FCFA59FF6217F88"/>
of the aqua kali puri, and the ſcabs anointed with the unguent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hydrargyri nitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti in the place of the ſulphur ointment and calx of mercury; the former being a very powerful, as well as a ſafe application, and may be uſed in any quantity that may be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.</p>
               <p>But the complaint is ſometimes of long ſtanding before medical aſſiſtance is aſked, and is not only extended over all the head, but the ſcabs are thick, and riſe high above the ſurface, returning as often as they may fall off. I have, however, never failed to cure the common tinea by a method perhaps well known, but too ſeldom complied with in time, on account of its apparent ſeverity. It conſiſts only in well waſhing the head with a piece of flannel, and a ſtrong lather of ſoap-ſuds, after it has been cloſe ſhaved, and then rubbing in very forcibly the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon unguentum picae and a good quantity of the pulvis ellebor. alb. or other ſafe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilatory, for near an hour at a time, always uſing it very warm; and covering the head with a bladder to preſerve the ointment on the part, as well as to keep it from ſticking to the cap, or other covering made uſe of. When this has been done three or four times, not only the ſcabs, but the hairs will alſo looſen, which muſt be pulled out, however unpleaſant the operation may be;
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:026291_0240_0FD0DC88177C8ED8"/>
as it will, indeed, prove a kindneſs in the end: but muſt be repeated till all the hairs be taken out, after which new hair will riſe free from ſcabs, which is a ſufficient indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation that the diſorder is effectually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved.</p>
               <p>There is, however, a ſpurious kind of ſcald-head, that is ſometimes more difficult of cure; but it requires nothing but pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the uſe of one or more of the above remedies, or at moſt, an alterative plan of the flour of ſulphur, or of ſome mild mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curial preparation, with the common decoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the woods, or the Liſbon diet-drink. Or, ſhould the difficulty conſiſt in getting out the hair entirely, or deſtroying the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed glands at its roots, the calx viva may be had recourſe to, in one form or other; and is exceedingly preferable to an adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive pitch-plaiſter. In a few inſtances, the topical uſe of the unguent. hydrargyri miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us has a wonderful efficacy.—In the ſpuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous tinea particularly, it may be proper to open an iſſue, or fix a ſeton in the nape of the neck.</p>

               <head>HERPES MILIARIS, or SHINGLES; (RINGWORM.)</head>
               <p>THE <hi>Herpes miliaris,</hi> and the <hi>Shingles</hi> are diſtinguiſhed by ſome writers, but I can ſee no good reaſon for it; and M.
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:026291_0241_0FCFA59E5072D4A8"/>
Aurelius Severinus and others, have eſteemed them to be the ſame diſorder.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Herpes,</hi> like the foregoing complaint, is a diſeaſe of the ſkin, infeſting ſome chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren almoſt annually, and appearing in dry ſcurfy blotches, on different parts of the body, and uſually of a circular form. It becomes troubleſome chiefly from the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent itching that conſtantly attends it, and would probably get well of itſelf: it even ſometimes has the appearance of being cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, or is, perhaps, rather an indication of ſome favorable change in valetudinarians, eſpecially in adults, who are ſometimes found getting the better of chronical complaints at the time the ſhingles makes its appearance. It is, however, often a blemiſh; as it fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently attacks the hands and face, and eſpecially the forehead. It is amongſt the vulgar errors, I believe, that when it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears on the breaſt or loins, if it ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend round the whole body, it would prove fatal—This form of the diſeaſe is termed <hi>Zona herpetica.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Herpes miliaris</hi> is alſo by many diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed from the <hi>ring-worm,</hi> (but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps needleſsly); the former being always ſuppoſed to ariſe from an affection of the ſyſtem, and to be preceded by ſhivering, or ſickneſs at the ſtomach. They are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly both very eaſily cured, and probably would alike diſappear of themſelves. The
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:026291_0242_0FCFA59D1729D710"/>
                  <hi>Herpes</hi> yields very readily to ſtimulating and aſtringent remedies. Ink, therefore, as (as it contains an infuſion of galls) has been a common, though inelegant application, and may ſerve very well where better forms are not at hand: it is ſometimes made into a paſte with the flower of muſtard. Spirit of wine; ſaturnine lotions, with the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of vinegar, or white vitriol; and oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments containing lead, anſwer very well; or an ointment of calcined zinc and lard: but the ung. hydrarg. nitrati is preferable to moſt others: The uſe of a fleſh-bruſh is a good prophylactic, or preventive, in habits accuſtomed to the complaint.</p>
               <p>Should the ſhingles ſpread and become ſore, it ſhould be treated as directed below.</p>
            </div>

               <p>THIS is a malignant ſpecies of the above complaint, but is generally local. It is mentioned only as having relation to the former, being rather a ſore than an erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not very common in children.</p>
               <p>Suppurative applications may be made uſe of in the early ſtage of the complaint, ſuch as ointments of minium, ſoap, and Venice turpentine, or a ſuppurative poultice, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to liberate the diſeaſed glands on the ſurface, and abſorb the acrid diſcharge.
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:026291_0243_0FCFA59BD19DAC90"/>
After this, the parts ſhould be waſhed with ſaponaceous lotions, and laſtly, with ſtrong ſolutions of vitriol. Should theſe fail, the ung. hydrarg. nitrati will be proper, and as the laſt remedy, cauſtic applications; of which, butter of antimony is the beſt, with which the little ulcers may be touched light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from time to time. The patient may take at the ſame time of a decoction of burdock-roots, or ſarſaparilla.</p>

Such are often had recourſe to in order to avoid the unpleaſant ſmell of the brimſtone ointment; which, however, rarely fails to cure the genuine itch. There is, indeed, a ſpurious kind, as of the ſcald-head, which is far leſs, or often not at all contagious, but is more difficult of cure than the genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine. Should the brimſtone ointment there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fail, ſulphur ſhould be adminiſtered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, and ſometimes mercurials; which may likewiſe be added to the ointment, and in a few weeks, at moſt, will not fail of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving the complaint.

               <head>OPHTHALMIA, or INFLAMMATION of the EYES.</head>
               <p>THE Eyes of new-born infants are very apt to be inflamed during the firſt three or four days after birth, eſpecially in the winter ſeaſon. If it be owing to taking cold, it is probable it has been either im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after the child was born, before it has been given away to the nurſe, or very ſoon afterwards; and on this account, a flannel cap becomes a very neceſſary part of its covering before it can be formally dreſſed.</p>
               <p>This kind of inflammation, however, is uſually of very little conſequence, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally diſappears of itſelf, upon merely keeping the head warm, or by waſhing the eyes with a little roſe-water, to two ounces of which, in ſome caſes, two or three drops of the water of acetated litharge, and a grain or two of white vitriol, may be added. But there is an inflammation to which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants are liable, that ſometimes continues a long while, and therefore calls for attention. I do not allude to that redneſs on the eye, known by the name of ſugillation, or blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot, which will often remain a long time, return, and diſappear again, without the leaſt injury to the child; nor to the watery-eye,
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:026291_0245_0FCFA595AB3F03B0"/>
which will ſometimes continue for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny months, and even for years. But that which I here intend, is accompanied with the true appearances of op<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Previous to this, it is often neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to apply a bliſter to the back, and a leech to one or both temples; to keep the body open, and to make uſe of the cooling eye-water before recommended. If the child be inclined to a frequent return of it for years, as I have known in very healthy children, it will ſometimes degenerate into what is termed the watery-eye; an excellent reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for which is a grain of white vitriol,
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:026291_0246_0FCF89526730C6A0"/>
mixed with as much freſh butter as will form it into a liniment, which ſhould be put into the inner angle of the eye every night, at going to bed. In ſome of theſe caſes, however, the ointment of nitrated quick-ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver has proved a more ſpeedy remedy, and is a leſs painful application.</p>
               <p>But there is a far more formidable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation, which has of late years been called the purulent ophthalmy, diſtinguiſhed from every other, by the vaſt quantity of thick matter diſcharged, and great ſwelling of the lids.</p>
               <p>This is ſo dangerous an inflammation as to require the beſt advice on its very firſt appearance. It frequently ſeizes an infant a few days after birth, without any previous complaint; and ſometimes not only deſtroys the ſight, but diſſolves the eye itſelf, in leſs than a week's time. I have likewiſe ſeen it exceedingly violent in children of four or five years old, but rarely without ſome blow, or other accident.</p>
               <p>In this diſeaſe, every thing that may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move inflammation, and unload the veſſels of the part, ſhould be immediately had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to. The body ſhould, therefore, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, be kept open, and if the child be two or three years of age, leeches ſhould be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the temples: ſcarifications alſo of the <hi>tunica conjunctiva,</hi> (which generally falls out upon the opening of the lids); bliſters
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:026291_0247_0FCFA59404B92EC8"/>
to the back, nape of the neck, and behind the ears, are ſometimes eſſentially neceſſary. The edges of the eye-lids ſhould be kept conſtantly greaſed throughout the day, eſpecially in infants, that the thick matter may find an eaſy eſcape. At night, a little of Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lard's cerate may be ſpread on ſoft linen, and applied to the eye, and over it a very ſoft <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 words">
                     <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, made with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound water of acetated litharge, laid on as lightly as poſſible; that by its conſtant moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, the eye-lids may always be kept ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. But if the diſcharge ſhould ſeem to be confined, or the eye affected, by the weight of the poultice, this application ſhould be changed for ſoft linen rage, which ſhould be frequently wetted with cold bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and water, or ſome yet more aſtringent lotion.</p>
               <p>It ſhould ever be remembered, that in the beginning of the complaint the taking away of blood is often not to be diſpenſed with, (unleſs the child be very young, or otherwiſe weak) nor to be ſparingly done. The application of one leech, therefore, to the temple or neck, will have no good effect, though often repeated. Two, three, or even more, according to the age and ſtrength of the child, ſhould be put on at a time, and a bliſter ſoon afterwards; which will often do more to conquer the inflammation, than
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:026291_0248_0FCFA5926EDC2F70"/>
moſt other means put together, if had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to in time.</p>
               <p>Throughout the complaint, aſtringent and ſtimulating applications are to be made uſe of, being not only far preferable to other means, but ſo neceſſary, that ſhould emolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent poultices, and merely cooling collyria be, at any time, depended upon, the event were likely to be fatal. What may be the very beſt remedy, it may not be very eaſy to determine, having for ſome years ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and in a reaſonable time, by different means. But ever ſince I have ſeen Mr. Ware's excellent publication on diſeaſes of the eyes, I have had ſo frequent recourſe to to the <hi>aqua camphorata,</hi> as recommended by him, in this ſpecies of ophthalmy, and have ſucceeded ſo well with it, that I am not yet certain to which the decided prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſhould be given.</p>
               <p>One dram of the aqua camphorata of Bate's diſpenſatory, to two ounces of water, will be a ſufficient ſtrength to begin with. A few drops ſhould be inſtilled into the eyes, ſeveral times in the day, as well as the lids, be frequently waſhed with it.</p>
               <p>The topical remedies alluded to, in the place of the aqua camphorata, are tinct. opii, and the unguentum hydrargyri nitrati, which ſhould be applied every night at going to reſt; the former being dropped into the eye after the lids have been touched with

               <p>It has been ſaid, that where this inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation has not been properly treated from the beginning, the eye is ſometimes exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly injured by it, ſo that even the eye will burſt. At other times, the <hi>cornea</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes much thickened, and the pupil more or leſs opake by means of one or more ſpecks which the inflammation has occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It ſhould be remarked, however, that we ſometimes meet with an agreeable ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, at the decline of this formidable complaint, and find the eye much leſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured than had been ſuſpected at the time we were firſt able to get a ſight of it. And at others, even where the <hi>cornea</hi> has burſt, the <hi>aqueous</hi> humour has been reſtored, and being confined by the cicatrice, the patient has recovered his ſight. On the other hand, the <hi>cornea</hi> has ſometimes been ſo greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured, or the <hi>iris</hi> contracted, that though the eye has not been ſunk, the ſight could not be reſtored by any means.</p>

Deafneſs, however, is ſometimes owing to the want of a due ſecretion of wax, and is then much more difficult of cure. To promote this ſecretion a few drops of the ſoap-liniment, oil of almonds and aether, and ſuch like warm acouſtics ſhould be tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and continued for ſome time, if they ſhould not occaſion much pain; and in all caſes, bliſters may be applied behind the ears. The juice of onions, or a clove of garlic, raw, or roaſted, put into the ears, has ſometimes reſtored the ſecretion, and removed the deafneſs; and in many caſes it has been effected by electricity. But it not unfrequently happens, that the cauſe of deafneſs lies in the auditory nerve, and in that caſe, if the laſt-mentioned remedy fails, very little is to be expected from art.

               <head>CANKER of the MOUTH.</head>
               <p>THIS is chiefly a complaint of children, being rarely met with in adults, is often talked of by nurſes, and is uſually as trifling
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:026291_0257_0FD0DC8AB5077468"/>
as any. It has, indeed, been ſaid by ſome writers to prevail very much in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and to be often a ſerious complaint. Such a diſorder, if it be canker, may be treated as under the next article; but the common canker is rarely troubleſome to cure, except it be amongſt very poor peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, where a great number of children are crouded together.</p>
               <p>It ſometimes makes its appearance in the month, at others, about the time of teeth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and frequently at the age of ſix or ſeven years, when children are ſhedding their firſt teeth, and the ſecond are making their way through the gums, which are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with little foul ſores, and will ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times extend to the inſide of the lips and the cheeks. It ſeldom requires more attention than was mentioned under the article of den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, any mild aſtringent application, and keeping the body open, uſually effecting a cure; or if it does not, and the complaint makes its appearance at the time of teeth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it will generally go away as ſoon as the teeth are come through.</p>
               <p>The worſt ſpecies of this complaint that I have happened to ſee, has been during the ſecond period of dentition, when a child has been ſhedding a number of teeth together, and the rotten ſtumps have been neglected to be drawn out.

               <p>If the ſtumps of the decayed teeth can, in this caſe, be eaſily got at, they ought to be extracted; after which ſome ſuch appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation as the following will ſoon brace the looſe gums, and heal up the ulcers.</p>

The whole body often feels cold on the approach of the diſeaſe; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which a black ſpot appears on one of the cheeks or lips, and ſpreads faſt; but without any appearance of inflammation. Oftentimes the whole ſide of the face is eaten away, together with the lip, ſo that the bare jaw-bone and inſide of the mouth appear. In the end, the intire lower-jaw falls down on the breaſt, and the whole ſide of the face is diſſolved into a putrid

               <p>In the cure, internal as well as external remedies are required, and only ſuch as cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect putreſcency, and ſupport the ſtrength, appear to be of any uſe. A few drops of the muriatic acid, therefore, taken inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in an infuſion of red roſe leaves, or in the child's drinks; the ſaline draught in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferveſcence; and in the end, the bark, in doſes ſuited to the age, with good broths, jellies and wine, are the proper remedies. The parts ſhould be waſhed, and likewiſe injected with the muriatic acid in cammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mile, or ſage tea, and afterwards dreſſed with the acid mixed with honey of roſes, and over all a carrot-poultice. The child ſhould in the mean time be gently purged with magneſia or rhubarb, to carry down the putrid matters it may have ſwallowed. By this treatment Mr. Deaſe informs us he has recovered every patient except one, ſince he had recourſe to this plan, which the world is much indebted to him for making public; though fortunately this dreadful complaint does not appear to be, by any means, a common one.</p>

               <head>PALSY of the LOWER EXTREMTIES with CURVATURE of the SPINE.</head>
               <p>THIS complaint has been of late years ſo thoroughly announced, that it ſhould ſeem unneceſſary to enter into a minute de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail of it after the accurate deſcription given by Mr. Pott, whoſe early account and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious treatment of this dreadful diſeaſe has added luſtre to the reputation acquired by his former publications.</p>
               <p>It will be proper, however, carefully to diſtinguiſh it from the ſimple curvature of the ſpine, in which a greater number of <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebrae</hi> is concerned, and the legs are not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly affected; as well as from a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint preſently to be noticed, under the name of <hi>debility</hi> of the <hi>lower extremities,</hi> in which there is no manifeſt change of figure in the ſpine.</p>
               <p>The palſy of the lower extremities is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly confined to no age, and being at firſt very frequently miſtaken in young children for the trifling effect of ſome fall or ſtrain, is intitled to notice in this work. I have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver met with it, indeed, where it has not been preceded by ſome fall or violent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertion, though as Mr. Pott has obſerved, ſuch ſuppoſed accidents are ſeldom much noticed previous to the debility taking place:
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:026291_0265_0FCFA56C1072F7D0"/>
but this is not univerſally the caſe; though it is, indeed, probable, there may be ſome prediſpoſing cauſe, without which no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſtrain would induce ſo much miſchief in a part continually diſpoſed to accidents.</p>
               <p>The Curvature is generally in the neck or back, though ſometimes in the upper part of the loins, and varies in extent and degree according to the number of the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebrae that may be affected. The firſt ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom noticed by children of an age capable of expreſſing their feelings, is an increaſed ſenſibility, and irregular twitchings in the muſcles of the the thighs. This is ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a diſlike to motion, eſpecially to mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing briſkly; the patient on ſuch occaſions finding himſelf likely to fall, his legs getting entangled through their weakneſs, and a diſpoſition to croſs each other, in his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to ſtep forward. Soon after this, perceives himſelf unable to ſtand upright long together, and that the legs and thighs have loſt much of their natural ſenſibility. Matters ſeldom continue long in this ſtate, and weakneſs increaſing, patients loſe more and more the uſe of both the lower extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, till ſome are unable to move them at all even in bed; and theſe advances of the diſeaſe are ſaid to be more rapid in adults than in infants. In the latter, I have par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly remarked that rigidity of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles noticed by Mr. Pott, by which the
<pb n="251" facs="unknown:026291_0266_0FCFA56A92E26960"/>
toes are pointed downwards, ſo that the heels cannot be brought to touch the ground.</p>
               <p>As my intention is only briefly to point out the diſeaſe, and the propereſt means of relief, it is not of importance to enter into a farther detail of the progreſs of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, and of other complaints which are induced by it whenever the original diſeaſe has been long neglected.</p>
               <p>The obvious remedy is that firſt happily ſuggeſted by Mr. Pott, and conſiſts only of a large iſſue or ſeton to be made on each ſide the curve, at ſuch a diſtance as may prevent their burſting into one. Where the curva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture comprehends three or more vertebrae, or joints, the ſeton may be preferable to an iſſue, but if the latter be on any account elected, I ſhould adviſe its being made by the knife rather than a cauſtic; not only as being leſs painful, but alſo for the very ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Mr. Pott has diſapproved of, I mean, the conſequent inflammation before there has been time for ſuppuration to take place. It may, indeed, be doubted, whether the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit derived from the iſſue may not ariſe rather from the inflammation and ſtimulus produced on the ſurface, than from the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge, to which, nevertheleſs, Mr. Pott ſolely attributes the cure<note n="*" place="bottom">It has been a common idea, that the diſcharge furniſhed by an ulcerated ſurface is the ſource of all the benefit that may be derived from abſceſſes, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs bliſtered ſurfaces be an exception; in regard to which, phyſicians have uſually conſidered the ſtimulus produced by the cantharides as the chief mean of benefit, eſpecially in caſes of great local pain and inflammation. It is, indeed, matter of ſome ſurprize, that thinking men have not more general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adopted the like idea in regard to other inflamed ſurfaces, whether induced by natural or artificial means. It ſhould ſurely ſeem, that <hi>that</hi> ſtate of the ſyſtem, or of the parts, by which ſuppuration is induced, is more likely to be the occaſion of bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, than the diſcharge of a large portion of the richeſt animal juices, which is but the conſequence of the other. Thus, in moſt critical abſceſſes, the fever is found to abate as ſoon as the external in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation takes place, and the patient inſtead of being afterwards benefited by a copious diſcharge, is not unfrequently hurried by it into a fatal ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſmus, when the abſceſs has been large, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly ſeated. There may be other inſtances, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, in which the ſuppuration, and even the great quantity of the diſcharge, may be beneficial to the ſyſtem; but it is probable, that this is not in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral the caſe, and much leſs in the preſent inſtance, which is attended with ſymptoms of general de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility.</note>. In a recent
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:026291_0267_0FCF893A8777AAB8"/>
caſe, however, and a very unpromiſing one, in an infant about ten months old, a very ſenſible relief was afforded as ſoon as the inflammation took place, and before any ſuppuration appeared; and though the child had been many months a cripple, with loſs of health and appetite, unable to ſupport its head, and the <hi>ſternum</hi> very much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted, the relief was ſo great in one week
<pb n="253" facs="unknown:026291_0268_0FCFA5685D7F54A0"/>
after the inciſions were made, as left no room to doubt of a perfect recovery; which accordingly took place very ſoon, without any deformity remaining. Had Mr. Pott ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced any other reaſons for the preference, given to the cauſtic, or merely affected ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, I ſhould readily have ſubmitted to the great experience he has had in this dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful complaint; but though I may very poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be miſtaken in my reaſoning, it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a duty juſt to ſtate it, as well as to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice this inſtance in point in a diſeaſe of ſo much importance: hoping at the ſame time, that the deſire Mr. Pott has expreſſed of ſerving the public, and the ſatisfaction he has received from the benefit attending the early publication of ſo valuable a remedy, will induce him to apologize for any attempt to extend, or illuſtrate its utility.</p>
               <p>The iſſues ſhould be kept open till the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient perfectly recovers the uſe of his legs, or even a while longer, at leaſt one iſſue, which ought not to be dried up till the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient can walk firmly alone, and ſhall have recovered all the height which he may have loſt in conſequence of that ſtooping which the diſorder had induced.</p>
               <p>In addition to the uſe of theſe means Mr. Pott has ſuggeſted thoſe of cold-bathing, frictions, and the bark, or ſuch like; but I have myſelf never ſeen any benefit from any thing where the iſſues have failed, which I
<pb n="254" facs="unknown:026291_0269_0FCF89359E9F3FA8"/>
have found efficacious where no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy had been made uſe of. After the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, however, if the patient be of a ſcrofulous habit, ſea-bathing is peculiarly indicated.</p>
               <p>The <hi>moxa</hi> has been ſucceſsfully made uſe of in one inſtance, by Mr. Gimès,<note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>THE diſorder intended here is not noticed by any medical writer within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of my reading, or is not ſo deſcribed as to aſcertain the diſeaſe. It is not a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon diſorder, I believe, and ſeems to occur ſeldomer in <hi>London</hi> than in ſome other parts. Nor am I enough acquainted with it to be fully ſatisfied, either in regard to the true cauſe, or ſeat of the diſeaſe, either from my own obſervation, or that of others; and I have myſelf never had opportunity of examining the body of any child who has died of this complaint. I ſhall therefore

               <p>It ſeems to ariſe from debility, and uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally attacks children previouſly reduced by fever; ſeldom thoſe under one, or more than four or five years old. It is a chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal complaint, and not attended with any affection of the urinary bladder, nor with pain, fever, nor any manifeſt diſeaſe; ſo that the firſt thing obſerved is a debility of the lower extremities, which gradually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more infirm, and after a few weeks are unable to ſupport the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>. There are no ſigns of worms, or other foulneſs of the bowels; therefore mercurial purges have not been of any uſe, neither has the bark, nor hot, nor cold-bathing. Bliſters, or cauſtics on the <hi>os ſacrum,</hi> and the great <hi>tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanter,</hi> and volatile and ſtimulating appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations to the legs and thighs, have been chiefly depended upon; though there is no appearance of an enlargement of any of the <hi>vertebrae,</hi> or joints of the back, nor of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puration in the external parts, and therefore no reſemblance to the inflammation of the intervertebral cartilages, the pſoas abſceſs, or the <hi>morbus coxaris</hi> of De Haen.</p>

               <p>The principal inquiry in the treatment of deformities of this kind, reſpects the uſe of irons for the ſupport of the limbs, whene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the diſtortion happens to be conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. The propriety of this aſſiſtance has, indeed, been doubted by ſome practition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, as well as their unpleaſant appearance been objected to by parents; who have therefore been inclined rather to truſt only to cold-bathing. Friend, however, as I am to the latter, I may venture to ſay from experience, that it is likely to be prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial at the time it is often had recourſe to; for by ſtrengthening the ſyſtem, it rather ſerves to confirm the crookedneſs which the bones have already contracted. It is an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, on the other hand, that the bones remain ſoft and yielding as long as the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vature is conſiderable, if ſo be the preſſure of the ſuperior parts be at the ſame time duly counteracted. To ſupport the limbs, therefore, with irons, as long as the ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the bones diſpoſes them to yield un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="258" facs="unknown:026291_0273_0FCFA56011D05168"/>
the weight of the body, is certainly a rational intention, and has been very bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial in numberleſs inſtances. This end ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, the bones being ſtill lengthening as the child grows up, they naturally incline to become ſtraight, and at this time the cold-bath and other tonics are properly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated, and will co-operate to the cure of the complaint. The only care required, is, that the irons be made as light as poſſible, and be properly adapted, and that they be lengthened as often as may be neceſſary.</p>
               <p>When a curvature takes place in the ſpine (without any diſeaſe of the <hi>vertebrae</hi> or car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilages) the like method ſhould be taken. Proper inſtruments to ſupport the head and upper parts of the body have been contrived by different artiſts, but thoſe made by Mr. Jones appear to be the beſt.</p>
               <p>Should the bones of the arm be curved, either by accident or diſeaſe, in this ſoft ſtate, rollers and paſte board ſplints properly applied, will be ſufficient to ſupport, and reſtore them to their natural form.</p>
               <p>But if the injury extend to the hip and contiguous bones, it will not be manifeſt at the time, and can be benefited only by the cold-bath, and other general remedies. If this diſtortion ſhould be conſiderable, it may, indeed, become a ſource of manifold evils in females, as will be noticed in another place.</p>

But I ſpeak chiefly of ſlighter attacks; on the firſt appearance of which, known by the heat, itching, redneſs, and ſwelling of the heels, toes or fingers, country people apply warm wood-aſhes between cloths, or rub the parts with muſtard and brandy, which if done in time will both prevent their breaking into ſores, and entirely remove the complaint.

               <p>Some children are diſpoſed to have chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blains every winter; as a preſervative a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt which, if it be the hands that are lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to affected, warm leather gloves ſhould be worn, (avoiding woollen, which in theſe caſes is unfriendly to the ſkin) and above all, wearing for a few hours in the day or night, and eſpecially when abroad in the cold, oiled ſilk gloves, which is the beſt preventative both of chilblains and of chopped hands, that has been hitherto known. But if the feet are uſually the affected parts, the heels only may be covered by a piece of waſhing-leather, ſecured round the inſteps, and worn day and night during the cold months; and ſhould be taken off only for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of rubbing the parts with the bruſh or liniments, as mentioned above.</p>
               <p>When the ſwellings are broken, it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to dreſs the ſores only with a little ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and to wait for the return of warm weather, when they uſually heal of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; but by this means, they often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main

bad through all the winter, and when large, are ſometimes not well till the ſummer is very far advanced; and I have even ſeen them remain very bad in grown people, at the end of September.</p>
               <p>After having attended great numbers in this complaint, I am ſatisfied that this kind of ſore requires applications ſomewhat more invigorating, being a ſpecies of mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and though it will not always endure very warm digeſtives like many other ulcers, yet when the chilblains are pretty large, a portion of ſome digeſtive joined with the cerate, is very friendly to them. And I have known ſome ſores, though very ſmall, remain long in a very obſtinate and tedious ſtate after the breaking up of a hard froſt, whilſt they have been dreſſed only with ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, or other mild, or drying applications, as they are called, and begin to heal imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately upon adding a ſmall portion of ſome warm digeſtive, and applying a flannel roll<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, without any other alteration in the plan. But if they are ſpread to any conſiderable ſize, nothing contributes ſo much to their healing, as touching the ſores every day with bracing and invigorating lotions, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly diluted ſolutions of ſteel, or tinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of myrrhe; which in a very few days will produce kindly granulations in theſe, and other cold ſores, though of long ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>

When the parts are much ſwollen, and the ſores been long foul, it will be often ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in ſevere weather, to make uſe of poultices, of which, thoſe made of rye-meal and the compound water of acetated litharge are more active, and therefore preferable to mere bread and milk. If theſe are applied over the above dreſſing of cerate and digeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and changed twice a day, the ſores will heal in much leſs time than by any of the common applications I have ſeen uſed; eſpecially if the parts ſurrounding the ſore be well rubbed with camphorated ſpirit. If children are not very young, purging them with a little calomel twice a week, will of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten expedite the healing of the ſores: in the worſt caſes, a decoction of the bark is required.</p>
               <p>Since this work has been in hand, I have learned the good effects of electricity in chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blains, both as a remedy and a prophylactic, or preventative, eſpecially in very old peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to whom they not unfrequently hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen.</p>

               <p>When ſuch an accident happens, the neareſt aſtringent at hand ſhould be made uſe of, ſuch as brandy, or other ſpirit, ink, wine, or even cold water, till ſomething more proper can be procured; into which the injured part ſhould be plunged, or be covered with pieces of cloth dipped in ſuch liquors, which will prevent the bliſtering of the part; carefully avoiding the uſe of olive-oil, too frequently had recourſe to. As ſoon as it is poſſible to ſend to an apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the following ſhould be procured, and uſed in like manner.</p>
               <p>Lime-water, a pint, brandy, two ounces, water of acetated litharge, half an ounce.</p>
               <p>If the injury has been too long received to admit of much relief by theſe means, and deep ſloughs are actually formed, a very proper dreſſing may be made of equal parts of Turner's cerate, and green ointment of elder; diminiſhing the proportion of the latter as the ſloughs are thrown off, and the ſores become diſpoſed to heal. But ſhould the injured ſurface be large, or the pain, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by removing the dreſſings, be very great, it will be ſufficient to cover the parts with pieces of linen dipped in cold-drawn

               <p>A ſtrong ſolution of ſoap in water has long been in uſe with artificers, employed in any buſineſs expoſing workmen to very bad ſcalds; and is a very excellent remedy—About three quarters of an ounce of ſoft ſoap is a proper quantity for a pint of water. But the ſoap takes ſome time in diſſolving, and as it requires a certain proportion of boiling water, the lotion cannot be made cool enough for immediate uſe by the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the proper quantity of cold water. A remedy, therefore, more convenient, and perhaps more efficacious, which if not always in the houſe, may in every large town be ſpeedily procured, may be made of olive-oil, cold water and ley of kali. Six ounces<note n="*" place="bottom">Two table ſpoonsful contain about an ounce.</note> of oil to ten of water, with two drams<note n="†" place="bottom">A tea-ſpoonful contains about a dram.</note> of the ley will make a pint.—This quantity may be ſufficient for a burn on the hand or foot, which is to be immerſed, and kept about half an hour in the liquor, which will remove the injury if had recourſe to imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately; but muſt be repeated, as the pain may require, if the ſcald or burn be of ſome ſtanding.

               <head>LUXATIONS and FRACTURES.</head>
               <p>INFANTS are not only liable to theſe misfortunes by a fall from the lap, but the bones or joints may be ſometimes una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably injured in the birth. There is in this caſe, ſeldom any luxation, I believe, but of the ſhoulders, which is not difficult to be reduced, and requires nothing afterwards, but that the limb be kept perfectly quiet. Fractures, indeed, are not quite ſo eaſily managed, and perhaps happen more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently. The bones are yet but little more than griſtle, and if ſtrained beyond a certain degree, are eaſily bent, or even broken. The former is very readily reſtored, but I ſhall be more particular on the latter, as the ſubject is of ſome importance.</p>
               <p>Fractures in the birth are uſually of the collar-bone, the arm, or the leg, the treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the two former of which, will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all that is neceſſary to be obſerved of ſuch as may happen in other parts.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="268" facs="unknown:026291_0283_0FCFA54E59B6AC10"/>
The firſt, however, requires very little attention, as it will be neceſſary only to draw the ſhoulders back, confining them in that poſture, by two or three pins in the clothes, and to apply a piece of adheſive, or of the ſoap-plaiſter, ſpread on leather, upon the riſing end of the bone, and a larger piece over the firſt.</p>
               <p>A fracture of the arm demands a little more attention, but will always end perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly well. The difficulty conſiſts in keeping the fractured ends of the bones oppoſed to each other, without rolling up the arm ſo tight as to occaſion pain, or much ſwelling of the hand, which in a new-born infant, a very ſmall preſſure will effect. I have found no method ſo well adapted as the following, which allowing of a little tumor about the fractured part, without the neceſſity of looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening the roller, preſerves the ends of the bones in due contact, without drawing the roller ſo tight as to prevent the free return of blood from the inferior parts of the limb.</p>
               <p>To this end, three little ſplints, about half an inch in width, and an inch and a half long, may be made of fine linen cloth, five or ſix times folded together, to the thickneſs of common paſteboard; and being ſoaked in a mixture of flour and white of egg, ſhould be placed in the uſual manner, along the fractured ends of the bone. Being applied
<pb n="269" facs="unknown:026291_0284_0FCFA548DFCEBB10"/>
wet, they will accommodate themſelves ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly to the figure of the limb, and when become dry, will be ſufficiently ſtrong to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the bones. They ſhould be applied im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately on the ſkin, without the interven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a roller, by which means, when the parts ſwell, which they ſhould always do a little, there will be ſpace enough between them to allow of it, notwithſtanding the preſſure from the roller, which ſhould be applied over them. This ought to be of very fine flannel, and ſhould not be drawn near ſo tight as for adults, nor will there be occaſion for it, as the chief dependance ought to be on faſtening the arm down cloſe to the ſide, by ſtrong pins fixed into the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle gown, in the manner the ſurgeon may beſt contrive at the time. The gown, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ought not to be changed, nor the arm moved but in his preſence; and if the hand is not inflamed, nor very much ſwelled, and the child is eaſy, the part will no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> need to be opened under eight or ten days. Till this time, the ſame gown ſhould be worn, and be preſerved clean by ſuch coverings as may eaſily be removed. The ſpeedy union of the bones will depend upon a ſtrict atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to keeping the limb as ſtill as poſſible; and if it be ſo preſerved, the accident will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford very little trouble after the firſt ten or twelve days, and at the month's end, the

child will move that arm nearly as well as the other.</p>
               <p>It is very common for nurſes, eſpecially during the month, to ſupport the lower-jaw of an infant whenever it happens to yawn, in the apprehenſion the jaw might, otherwiſe, be diſlocated. This practice is, at leaſt, an evidence of the nurſes attention, and can do no harm, though I have, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, never known the accident happen. Should it, however, take place, either at this age, or in older children through ſome violence, it will occaſion a very awkward appearance, and prove very diſtreſſing to the child, who will be diſabled from taking any nouriſhment till the luxation be reduced. Nothing more, however, is required to this end, than to place the thumb of each hand in the back part of the mouth, and the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers on the outſide, under the jaw, ſo as to depreſs, and at the ſame time bring it a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle forward, to diſengage the head of the condyle, and then force the jaw ſuddenly back.</p>

complaints ſhould be omitted, than from their real importance. Some of them, indeed, have been entirely overlooked by preceding writers, and though they may ſeldom require much attention, it may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times be of advantage to know what has been ſerviceable in ſimilar caſes.—The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance under conſideration, however, is too trifling a matter to dwell upon.—It will be ſufficient to obſerve that the little opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, performed in order to lengthen the tongue, is very frequently called for where there is no abſolute occaſion for it, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement being ſeldom ſo conſiderable as to make it really neceſſary to divide the <hi>fraenum,</hi> or little bridle, that adheres to the under part of the tongue. The child will ſuffer ſo very little, however, in the operation, that when it is carefully done, it will be attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with no inconvenience; and if it can af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford the mother any ſatisfaction, it will be very proper to comply with her requeſt. It ſeems therefore only neceſſary to add, that ſome little care and ſteadineſs are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, or the ſublingual veins may be wounded, and in conſequence an infant may loſe its life. To avoid this danger, the bridle may be divided by a ſmall curved biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toury, inſtead of ſciſſars. The handle and blade, when open, need not exceed two inches in length; and the point ſhould be a little curved, and the back made broad,
<pb n="272" facs="unknown:026291_0287_0FCF892D7360E888"/>
whereby the point may be eaſily forced through the <hi>fraenum</hi> in the moſt troubleſome caſe, whilſt the back of the inſtrument will ſufficiently preſs down the veins, ſo as to be entirely out of the way of being injured. Theſe cautions have been judged by ſome people to be very trifling; but beſides that infants have actually bled to death, the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing equally fatal accident has ariſen from cutting too deep, which I ſhall therefore no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice in this edition, as well as deſcribe an inſtrument contrived for ſuppreſſing the bleeding.</p>

The former is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times complicated with the ventral hernia near the part, and is occaſioned by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of the <hi>recti</hi> muſcles, the <hi>linea alba</hi> being there deficient; but it ſeldom extends far above or below the navel. The ſimple navel-hernia is a very common complaint, which if immediately attended to, is eaſily cured, perhaps merely by the uſe of the cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath: but if neglected, may prove trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome as the child grows up; eſpecially to females.

Ruptures at the groin are of more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, yet may be ſafely left without a bandage, eſpecially as the cold-bath alone generally cures them when they happen to children before they go alone.

Should a rupture, however, be very large, and the infant uſually fretful and crying, recourſe may be had to a ſteel truſs; to which it will be neceſſary to pay ſome attention, leſt it ſlip out of its place, or the rupture fall down, and be bruiſed by the pad.

               <p>THIS is a diſtenſion of the <hi>ſcrotum</hi> of a nature ſimilar to the hydrocele of adults, and when it falls to the ſhare of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, I believe, it uſually appears at the birth. It is frequently miſtaken by mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wives and nurſes for a common rupture, who therefore adviſe a linen bandage to be applied in the uſual manner. It is, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, eaſily diſtinguiſhed from a rupture, by

the tumour being tranſparent; without pain; and from not retiring upon preſſure, or not being increaſed by the crying of the infant.</p>
               <p>Though I have ſaid it <hi>commonly</hi> makes its appearance at the birth, and that the tumor does not retire upon preſſure, I think I have lately ſeen an inſtance to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Le Febure de Villebrune</hi> met with it in a child of twenty-two months old.</note> In this caſe, I had occaſion to examine the parts very attentively at the birth, on account of a little mal-conformation of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind, and neither then, nor the next morning ſaw any appearance of hydrocele; nor was it diſcovered by the nurſe or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther till ſix weeks afterwards, though the parts, for the reaſon above mentioned, were frequently examined. About this time I was ſent for in haſte, on account of the appearance of a large hydrocele, which, however, by the mother's report, was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I got there, greatly diminiſhed. There was, nevertheleſs, about three tea-ſpoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuls (as I imagine) of water in the <hi>ſcrotum</hi> which from this time was diſtended in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent degrees, as the water happened to retire, more or leſs, through the rings of the muſcles, which I apprehend muſt have been preternaturally open; though no por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the caul, or inteſtine, I believe, ever

deſcended; and the complaint diſappeared in a few weeks, by only daſhing the parts with cold water, three or four times a day.—This infant was a twin; and it is remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable, that the other had likewiſe an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               <p>The hydrocele is a harmleſs complaint, and would probably always diſappear of it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the courſe of a few months; but may much ſooner be diſperſed by ſome aſtringent lotion. The water of acetated ammonia has ſucceeded with me perfectly well, and I have ſometimes made uſe of compreſſes wetted in vinegar and water, with the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a little ſpirit, as the ſkin has been able to bear it. Perhaps the addition of crude <hi>Sal ammoniacus,</hi> as lately adviſed by Mr. Keate, in the treatment of adults, might aſſiſt the abſorption of the water. The ſmoke of burning gum benjamin received upon flannel, and applied to the part, is likewiſe a good remedy. But the ſpeedieſt method is to puncture the bottom of the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor with the point of a lancet; which, as it may be done with perfect ſafety, and with little pain to the child, is often preferred by the mother, as it inſtantly removes a ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh which cannot but be unpleaſant to her, whenever any other perſon may chance to

               <p>I have only to add, (what it is, indeed, a great ſatisfaction to be able to ſay,) that, dreadful as this accident is where the poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon has taken effect, it is evident, that only a very ſmall proportion of thoſe who are bitten by animals actually enraged, receive any injury from it. Fortunately, the clothes ſometimes prove a defence, by wiping off the foam from the animal's teeth; at others, it does not happen to be forced into the wound, or is not yet poſſeſſed of a poiſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous quality; or laſtly, it is not abſorbed, or the ſyſtem may not be in a ſtate to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected. Theſe aſſertions are ſupported by numberleſs facts, though much leſs fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, perhaps, in London, than in ſome other parts, eſpecially on the continent, where ſuch animals are very commonly met
<pb n="294" facs="unknown:026291_0309_0FCFA69FAECA4968"/>
with, and often wound great numbers of people.</p>
               <p>It is, doubtleſs, the uncertainty of the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects attending ſuch injuries, that has ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the credit of many fallacious remedies on this melancholy occaſion. Encouraging, therefore, as the above circumſtances certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are, it would indeed, be madneſs to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide in them, where the proper remedy may be made uſe of in time; and though I ſhould wiſh to conceal rather than ſpread theſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged facts, could I think they would have ſuch an effect, it is on the other hand, no ſmall ſatisfaction, that ſuch encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may be juſtly held out to thoſe who may be under any alarm for themſelves or their friends.</p>

It is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably a ſecretion from the ſebaceous glands, and appears on the arms, legs and back of ſucking children; and is abſurdly enough thought by ſome to be produced by inſects:<note n="*" place="bottom">Aſtruc.

amuſe themſelves by forcing out of the ſkin what they call worms.—In the inſtance of infants ſo affected, rubbing the parts with a coarſe cloth, by the fire-ſide, is all that will uſually be neceſſary in northern cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates.</p>
               <p>Though this kind of affection is general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of little conſequence, whether in infants, or young children, I have, nevertheleſs, known it prove a very troubleſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint in older ſubjects, eſpecially in females about the time of puperty. In ſuch inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the whole neck, back and breaſt will be covered with little black ſpots, which gradually inflame till the parts become tota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly covered with heated pimples. Theſe at firſt itch intolerably, ſo as frequently to keep the patient from ſleep through the greater part of the night; and in conſequence of being continually rubbed, turn to little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed and angry boils. When ſome of theſe have diſcharged the ſebaceous matter, and are healed up, others will ariſe, in ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and at the end of ſeveral months, the ſuperior parts of the body are covered with them.</p>
               <p>After making trial of common purges and alteratives, to no laſting advantage, I have cured the complaint by waſhing the parts morning and evening, for a few days, with the lotio ſaponacea, and afterwards rubbing in a little unguentum hydrargyri ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trati;
<pb n="298" facs="unknown:026291_0313_0FCFA6939BE5BD28"/>
and when the ſoreneſs has gone off, making uſe of a proper fleſh-bruſh, for two or three months. The patient may at the ſame time take a few drops of the aqua kali, two or three times a day, in a cup of ſaſſafras-tea, or milk and water.</p>
               <p>A complaint ſometimes confounded with the former, is that called <hi>Morbum pilare,</hi> and is ſuppoſed to be ſpoken of by Hilda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, as ſadly tormenting one of his children. It is alſo mentioned by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>MANY infants come into the world with ſome parts imperfectly formed, and never more commonly than in the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per part of the ſkull. If the deficiency be very great, and accompanied with a like want of brain, ſuch fetuſes fall under the claſs of Monſters, and being never born a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, are not ſubjects of this work.</p>
               <p>The <hi>hernia</hi> of the brain, on the other hand, is met with in infants otherwiſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely formed, and is generally curable.</p>
               <p>The public is indebted to Mons. Ferrand for an accurate deſcription of this complaint, given in the 5th. volume of the <hi>Memoirs de L'Academie royale de chirurgie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Encephalocele</hi> is a ſoft circumſcribed tumor, uſually of a round form, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent in ſize with the extent of the deficiency of <hi>cranium;</hi> to which the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint is owing. It is without fluctuation,
<pb n="301" facs="unknown:026291_0316_0FCFA6909755E468"/>
or diſcolouration of the ſkin, but is attended with a perceptible pulſation of the brain, which ſynchronizes with the pulſe. The tumor retires and diſappears upon preſſure, and is always ſituate either on one of the fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanelles, or in the courſe of one of the ſutures, and is never larger than a pullet's egg. Where the defect of oſſification is very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, a much larger portion of brain is conſequently protruded, which ſtrictly ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it were leſs proper to call a diſeaſe, than a fatal mal-formation, as it is pertinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remarked by Mons. Ferrand; and no more reſembles the true <hi>encephalocele,</hi> than an <hi>eventration</hi> reſembles the common inteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinal <hi>hernia.</hi> It will be very neceſſary, however, carefully to diſtinguiſh this incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable evil from other ſoft tumors of the ſcalp, preſently to be noted, which it very much reſembles; the latter having frequently the like preciſe feel of a bony margin around the tumor, as is common, indeed, in caſes of extravaſation upon any ſolid ſurface. The tumor is alſo colourleſs, and often as large as in the fatal mal-formation, but has a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable fluctuation, and is farther diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhable by the tumor not retiring upon preſſure, nor being attended with any pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Encephalocele</hi> is, indeed, eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed from them both, by the brief de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription above given of it; and fatal as it
<pb n="302" facs="unknown:026291_0317_0FCFA68FC3603E18"/>
would be were it left to itſelf, it requires on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be properly underſtood, in order to adapt a rational and effectual remedy, which conſiſts only in a careful and due compreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the part. This may be effected by the application of a piece of lead, ſomewhat larger than the tumor, and pierced with holes, that it may be ſewed to the child's cap. The compreſſion ſhould at firſt be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry moderate, and always ſuch as may not give pain to the infant, nor diſturb any or the natural functions; and may gradually be increaſed as the tumor ſhall retire. This is all that is required from art, the cure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the buſineſs of nature, which if the child continue healthy, will proceed in the work of oſſification, and in due time will fill up the vacancy in the ſkull. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſion of the brain was before an obſtacle to this proceſs, whilſt the injury that tender organ muſt ſuſtain by the preſſure from the ſides of the bone, expoſed it to all the evils which compreſſion never fails to produce; and which it were needleſs to enumerate in this place.</p>

               <p>THERE are other tumors on the heads of new-born infants, which it were improper intirely to paſs over. One kind
<pb n="303" facs="unknown:026291_0318_0FCFA68DCDDC4F30"/>
is occaſioned by long compreſſion in the birth, is of different ſizes, and the ſkin is always diſcoloured, but ſeldom requires much attention, as theſe tumors frequently diſappear in a few hours. If large, it is common to bathe, or foment them with red wine, brandy and water, or vinegar, and in general they gradually ſubſide, though ſometimes not perfectly for ſeveral days. Some of them, however, are of more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, and concerning the treatment of which practitioners have differed; the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute impropriety of opening any tumors ariſing from compreſſion having been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of by many. On the other hand, I believe, it may in ſome caſes, be really ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, in order to prevent a troubleſome fungous ſore, and even a <hi>caries</hi> of the ſkull. The diſcrimination, however, is ſufficiently obvious, ſuch aſſiſtance being required only where the above remedies and compreſſion have had no effect, and the tumor is found ſenſibly to increaſe day after day, which in ſome inſtances has been the caſe to the end of the month. Such growth is always ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the extremities of the arteries rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured by long compreſſion, being ſtill open, and pouring out an ichorous fluid into the cellular membrane, and thereby keeping up and increaſing the original tumor.</p>
               <p>Upon opening the integuments, a bloody fluid is led out, and the tumor nearly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
<pb n="304" facs="unknown:026291_0319_0FCFA687AA1ED258"/>
which afterwards requires nothing but moderately aſtringent applications and preſſure, which ſhould be continued for a little time after the aperture is cloſed.</p>
               <p>Another kind of tumor has been hinted, which has a more unfavourable appearance; and of which it may be proper in this place to take a little farther notice. Theſe tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors contain a kind of ſerum, and are often very large, but without that diſcolouration of the ſcalp and bruiſed appearance, that there conſtantly is in thoſe laſt deſcribed, nor do they, indeed, ſeem to ariſe from compreſſion; I have, at leaſt, ſeen them extending over a fourth part of the head, and raiſed a full inch from the ſkull, after the ſhorteſt and moſt eaſy labors. To the deſcription before given of them it may be added, that this kind of tumor, I believe, will always ſubſide very kindly, though ſometimes not completely, for ſeveral weeks. It uſually begins to leſſen, however, in ſix or eight days after birth; and as it ſubſides, more and more of the ſkull may be felt, from day to day, in proportion as the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorption of the fluid takes place. To aſſiſt nature, therefore, in this operation, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brocations of vinegar, crude ſal ammoniac and camphorated ſpirit ſhould be made uſe of; with a gentle compreſſion of the part, as well as keeping the bowels properly open.</p>

               <p>THERE is another kind of tumor ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing ſometimes on the head, and at others, on ſome part of the ſpine, which is not owing to accidents in the birth, but is of a morbid nature. Theſe tumors con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a lymph, and are attended with evident fluctuation, as may be diſcerned by the touch; and unleſs they are exceedingly ſmall, ought in no caſe, I believe, to be punctured, or even removed by ligature, though adhering only by a ſmall pedicle.

part afterwards covered with a ſaturnine ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate; which are likewiſe the propereſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications afterwards, as well as for that which is open from the birth, and will, at leaſt, afford ſome eaſe, as well as tend to prolong the life of the child. Such treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is alſo the more proper, from the hope that the tumor, whilſt occult, may poſſibly be of the more benign kind, now to be noticed.</p>
               <p>Theſe I have termed <hi>parenchymatous</hi> tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors; they appear on different parts of the ſpine, but more commonly near the neck or <hi>os ſacrum,</hi> are accounted <hi>marks,</hi> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, it has been ſaid, reſemble the <hi>ſpin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The firſt is a tumor on ſome of the <hi>verte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brae,</hi> uſually of the neck, or the firſt of the back; it is of a ſublivid hue, unequal, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally ſpongy, and very vaſcular. I ſaw one of this kind ſome years ago, in conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation with the late Sir Caeſar Hawkins, who adviſed to preſerve the ſkin unbroken, as long as it ſhould be poſſible, which he feared was all that could be done for it; and to this end, recommend the free uſe of the compound water of acetated litharge.
<pb n="308" facs="unknown:026291_0323_0FCFA67F85C4F1A8"/>
It was then about the ſize of a crown-piece, and not raiſed very much above the level of the ſurrounding parts. The tumor, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, increaſed, and the ſkin not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards gave way, and the child became ill; in conſequence of which the late Dr. Hunter was deſired to give his opinion, who adviſed the tumor to be taken out, as the only chance for preſerving the child's life: but the father diſapproved of the operation. The part ſoon began to bleed a good deal at times; in order to ſuppreſs which, as well as to leſſen the tumor, which was now conſiderably more prominent, I ſprinkled it with the following powder, R. <hi>Bol. Armen. pulv. Catechu a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> 
                  <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ij. <hi>Allumin. rup.</hi> ℥j. <hi>Miſce.</hi> Over this, compreſſes wetted as above were applied frequently through the day. Theſe would ſometimes adhere for ſeveral days owing to the blood and powder forming a ſort of paſte, till a freſh oozing from the veſſels looſened them; at which time the bleeding returned, and the applications were repeated: by the continuance of which, however, for ſeven or eight weeks, and compreſſion with a piece of thin lead, the veſſels gradually ſhrunk, and the diſcharge being dried up, the part was happily ſkin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned over, and the child recovered its health.</p>
               <p>I have lately ſeen another tumor of this kind, which was treated in a different man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. It was ſeated on the laſt <hi>vertebrae</hi> of
<pb n="309" facs="unknown:026291_0324_0FCFA67ACF8B2FE0"/>
the back, and was apprehended to be the true <hi>Spina byfida:</hi> but as no part of the bone could be felt, nor the tumor by preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, be made to recede, I hoped it might be otherwiſe, and ventured to adviſe taking it off, as the only chance the infant had for its life. This was accordingly done when the child was about eight days old, and though a good deal of blood was loſt in the operation, from a deep ſeated artery, the ſore at the end of the month was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly healed, and the child ſoon after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards became as healthy as any other in the family<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <p>Among ſeveral inſtances of ſuch blemiſhes, in the Britiſh Lying-in Hoſpital, we have had ſome remarkable ones of the <hi>intire ignorance</hi> of any ſuch ſuppoſed cauſe.

In a recent inſtance, the extremeties were uncommonly ill-formed, and not a little reſembled thoſe of different animals; but the mothers of theſe infants had go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> on to their full time, without their having received any fright they could recollect, or ſuſpecting any thing amiſs in their children.</p>
                     <p>I ſhould not, indeed, have ventured, even in a note, to have particularized ſuch deformities, but on account of their aptneſs, and in the hope of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting rather than creating fears and ſuſpicions, in women of peculiar ſenſibility. For theſe chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were really ſo disfigured, that a lively imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, or a mind ſtrongly impreſſed, might not only have conceived in them a great reſemblance to many objects, but it is more than probable, that the parents muſt have actually noticed not a few ſuch, during the period of geſtation—Where any ſuch deformity, therefore, may actually have taken place, I only wiſh ladies to be perſuaded, that ſuch ſights have not been the true cauſe of it, nor can ſuch objects, therefore, contribute to the production of the like appearances another time.—In this view, I cannot help obſerving, that only a few days ago, a lady of rank acquainted me, that ſhe had paſſed almoſt the whole term of geſtation in the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of her infant being born with a <hi>Hare-lip,</hi> on account of her having been daily met by a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer working in her own grounds, who had ſuch a blemiſh. In this inſtance, the imagination ſeemed to have done its utmoſt; as the lady conceived ſhe met this man oftener than any other, and that ſhe could not avoid him walk which ſoever way ſhe might; and in conſequence had his image continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally before her, either in reality or in recollection; and was kept under a continual alarm by it. It is needleſs, poſſibly, to add; that the child was born free from the apprehended blemiſh.</p>
                  </note> And here it ought to be noticed, that where a child has really
<pb n="312" facs="unknown:026291_0327_0FCF898FB962F2D0"/>
been marked, and the mother has inſiſted on her having ſeen, and been frighted by an object which the blemiſh has reſembled, it has, (to the beſt of my knowledge, at leaſt) appeared always to be an after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought, by which the ſuppoſed occaſion of it has been diſcovered; and has not been taken notice of before-hand. It is, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, the fartheſt from my thoughts to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid the ſufferer on this painful occaſion, or to tax any wilful giving way to ſuſpicions, into which, I am perſuaded, their feelings alone inſidiouſly betray them. I wiſh only to obviate the influence of a ſentiment that I take to be without ſufficient foundation, and to which nothing but length of time, and preſcription, could have given a ſanction.</p>

                  <pb n="313" facs="unknown:026291_0328_0FCFA676F2815240"/>
That there are blemiſhes which bear a reſemblance to various objects around us, daily experience has proved; though the true occaſion of them is not, perhaps, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood. The like deviations from the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary courſe is obſerved, not only in other animals, but alſo in the vegetable kingdom, fruits being often joined together, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſtrangely misſhaped, which muſt ariſe from the common laws of nature being ſome-wiſe diverted from their uſual courſe, by ſome accidental cauſe equally unknown to us. But however this may be occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, there is nothing that we know of in a fright or longing, that can produce ſuch a change in organized matter, nor can ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in the manner that has been ſuppoſed, much leſs at ſuch different periods; but there is, on the other hand, every thing againſt ſuch an hypotheſis; which has ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly always given way in enlightened ages.</p>
               <p>The inſtance ſo often adduced from the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred hiſtorian, is by no means in point: for without adverting to the very peculiar na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural circumſtances in that tranſaction, which are wanting in ordinary inſtances, it is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to obſerve, that there was therein an evident divine interpoſition. Should any one doubt of this, he has only to make a ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar experiment, the reſult of which will, probably, have more weight than ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
<pb n="314" facs="unknown:026291_0329_0FCF8984312BE018"/>
arguments. As matter of fact there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as before obſerved, does not at all countenance, but directly contradict the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis, there is the ſtrongeſt reaſon for married women arguing themſelves out of ſuch fears, inſtead of reaſoning themſelves into them, and ſuffering a painful conflict for weeks, and months together. It will give me great pleaſure if any thing I have advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced on the ſubject, ſhould anſwer ſo deſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble an end; whilſt reaſon, philoſophy, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, and every thing on which we ought to depend, conſpire to ſupport ſuch an attempt.</p>
               <p>Amongſt the various <hi>Marks</hi> reſembling ſome of the objects around us, that called the <hi>Hare-lip</hi> is the moſt common; a ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh too well known to require any deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It is ſufficient to obſerve, that it is of two kinds; the ſimple, wherein the upper lip only is divided, either wholly or in part, with ſome loſs of ſubſtance; and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex, in which the fiſſure of the lip is double; and ſometimes the palate of the mouth, and even the <hi>uvula</hi> is divided. It would be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide my purpoſe, in this place, to treat of the manner in which this deformity and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection is to be remedied; I ſhall confine myſelf to ſpeaking only of the time in which it ought to be attempted.</p>
               <p>Various conſiderations contribute to make the diſtreſſed parents ſolicitous to have this
<pb n="315" facs="unknown:026291_0330_0FCFA674DB25D058"/>
blemiſh removed ſoon after the infant is born, or at fartheſt before the month ſhall be expired. On this account I am convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the operation has ſometimes been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maturely performed, contrary to the better judgment of the operator, and not a few children have thereby fallen a ſacrifice; whilſt others have received much leſs bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit than they would have done, had the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration been poſtponed for a reaſonable time. Where the blemiſh is very trifling, indeed, and the operation ſimple, it may be done with reaſonable ſafety in the courſe of the month, or a little after; and if the child be able to ſuck, which is not always the caſe, there are even ſome advantages in perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſooner. For as the child will not be able to take the breaſt for two days at leaſt after the operation, it will with difficulty be kept tolerably quiet by the ſpoon after it has been once put to the breaſt; but as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants need but very little nouriſhment for the firſt days after birth, and generally ſleep a good deal, if the operation be done twenty-four hours after the child is born, it will be in a condition to ſuck by the time it requires much nouriſhment, and the mother's breaſt is prepared to furniſh it. But in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex hare-lip the caſe is exceedingly diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and the longer the operation is poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned, the better it is likely to ſucceed, and
<pb n="316" facs="unknown:026291_0331_0FD0DC9474CA86C0"/>
ſhould at leaſt be deferred till the child ſhall be four or five months old; the good effects of which I have lately ſeen in a child born at the <hi>Lying-in</hi> hoſpital. By this time alſo, the infant will have got over the period in which it is moſt liable to ſome painful and dangerous complaints; will be thoroughly weaned from its hankering after the breaſt, and have learned to feed contentedly with the ſpoon; by which children with this kind of hare-lip are obliged to be ſupported, they being always unable to ſuck. At this period likewiſe, the parts will have acquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a degree of firmneſs neceſſary to retain the needles, as well as ſize that will admit of handling them to greater advantage; for the want of which, though the operation may appear to have been favourably per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, the needles will ſometimes break out, and the deformity be but little remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or perhaps ſometimes be increaſed.</p>
               <p>I have once ſeen another blemiſh of the mouth in a child born at the hoſpital, which required a ſimilar operation. In this infant, the mouth was much wider on one ſide than on the other, and appeared as if that ſide had been divided far into the cheek, which gave it a very awkward appearance; but as it was capable of being remedied in the ſame manner as the hare-lip, I ſhall only obſerve, that when I withdrew the pins on the third
<pb n="317" facs="unknown:026291_0332_0FCFA672953BAF28"/>
day, the parts adhered very firmly, and the child left the hoſpital at the uſual time.</p>
               <p>A different kind of blemiſh conſiſts in ſome ſuperfluous part. Such may ſometimes adhere only by a ſmall baſe, like a thread, and may be removed by only paſſing a tight ligature round them. But ſhould any even adhere more firmly, and be only a ſmall joint, ſuch as a finger or a toe, it were better to have it cut off on the firſt days; as the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels will then bleed but little, and the griſtle by which ſuch joints are uſually connected, are not yet become bony. But ſhould the part be more completely formed, it may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary to delay the operation awhile longer, that by diſcovering which of the duplicates may take the lead, the more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing one may be preſerved; which is not always to be known with certainty, at the birth.</p>
               <p>Beſide theſe, there are blemiſhes of far greater importance, ſome of which demand an operation as the only chance for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the life of the infant. Such are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perforations of the <hi>anus</hi> and <hi>urethra,</hi> or the <hi>vagina</hi> in females.</p>
               <p>The Vagina is ſometimes imperforate on the <hi>external,</hi> at others, only in the more <hi>internal</hi> parts; and is in different degrees. The latter more commonly relates only to the hymen, which requiring an operation to be performed about the age of puberty,
<pb n="318" facs="unknown:026291_0333_0FCFA670E6B66A68"/>
I ſhall do more than barely mention here, eſpecially as it requires only a ſimple, or crucial inciſion. Where the imperforation is in the ſubſtance of the <hi>vagina</hi> itſelf, I have never found an operation to be of any uſe, though I have known it attempted, in the adult, with great addreſs and reſolution.</p>
               <p>I have never met with the <hi>external</hi> parts totally imperforate, but have known the aperture ſo very ſmall as to require a little operation, which is mighty eaſily done with the point of a lancet; there being always a <hi>raphè,</hi> or line, directing the extent nature has ſeemed originally to intend, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through, requires only to be kept apart for a few days, by a bit of fine lint.</p>
               <p>The imperforate ANUS is a melancholy caſe, as it ſeldom allows of an effectual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, the gut often terminating in a <hi>cul de ſac</hi> ſo high up as not to be reached; it is not, however, always to be deſpaired of, though no fluctuation of the inteſtinal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents ſhould be felt for two or three days after the infant is born.</p>
               <p>I remember only one caſe of this kind in the <hi>Lying-in</hi> hoſpital, and in that I hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to ſucceed, contrary, indeed, to all expectation, and after the child had puked up a great quantity of meconium; and not only the belly, but alſo the face was exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly tumid, and the eyes had not been opened for ſome time.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="319" facs="unknown:026291_0334_0FCFA66C8DCD10D8"/>
The manner of doing this operation muſt, in different caſes, depend ſo much on the diſcretion of the operator, that I ſhall do no more than deſcribe that which I made uſe of in the inſtance alluded to.</p>
               <p>The operation was not determined upon till the third day. A longitudinal inciſion was made, of about half an inch, above and below the part where the <hi>anus</hi> ought to have been, which was marked by a little ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creſcence; a ſmall biſtoury was then thruſt up in the uſual direction of the bowel, for more than an inch. No meconium following this puncture, I examined carefully with my finger, and feeling ſomething like the fluctation meconium would make, I intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced a trochar, and withdrawing my finger, I carried up the inſtrument in ſuch a direction as to avoid injuring the bladder, or forcing it againſt the <hi>os coccygis,</hi> for near an inch farther, making allowance, however, for the yielding of the parts, which might be ſomewhat forced up by the trochar. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument having now paſſed forwards, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that reſiſtance it had hitherto met with, gave me the ſenſation of having entered a cavity, when withdrawing the trochar, we had the ſatisfaction of finding the meconium run out at the canula. The child was now put into a warm-bath, up to the waiſt, and in a few minutes having voided a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble quantity of meconium, it opened its
<pb n="320" facs="unknown:026291_0335_0FCF898235798788"/>
eyes, looked cheerfully about it, and fell into a pleaſant ſleep before it was taken out of the bath.</p>
               <p>A piece of bougie was occaſionally intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, and ſometimes left in the part, for a few hours, for the firſt fortnight; after which the child recovered faſt, and at the uſual time was taken from the hoſpital in pretty good health, though it had been much reduced by a bad thruſh, which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately made its appearance ſoon after the operation; but it always voided its ſtools perfectly well.</p>
               <p>The imperforate Penis is not quite ſo common a caſe; but is not unfrequently ſuſpected, when the end of the paſſage is merely ſtopped up by a little mucus; and ſhould therefore be examined in good time. In this caſe, waſhing the part with warm milk and water, or at moſt, a little aſſiſtance with a ſmall probe, or any ſuch blunt pointed inſtrument, will be ſufficient to open the paſſage. But it is evident, if the <hi>urethra</hi> be wanting no operation at all can be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed: it is, however, more commonly found open a certain way, and often as far as the baſis of the <hi>glans,</hi> and ſometimes near to its extremity; in which laſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, it is neceſſary only to make a ſmall aperture with a lancet, or a fine trochar, and to keep the part open by the occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al introduction of a bougie. The more
<pb n="321" facs="unknown:026291_0336_0FCFA66B2EA53920"/>
common complaint of this part however, is that of the urinary paſſage terminating by a ſmall aperture at a little diſtance below the <hi>glans,</hi> and ſometimes on one ſide of it. In theſe caſes, the preciſe circumſtances muſt determine the propriety of any opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which if not carefully managed, may render the caſe worſe than it was. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect two indeed, in which I was able to do conſiderable ſervice, one of which was in the preſence of the late Sir Caeſar Haw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins, and the other of the late Dr. Hunter; in the latter, the urine was diſcharged from one ſide of the <hi>penis,</hi> and pretty low down, which was very happily remedied.</p>
               <p>There are other mal-formations of this part, by which it is drawn downwards, or to one ſide; the peculiar circumſtances of which, muſt point out the nature of the operation moſt likely to afford relief. This will generally conſiſt in a ſimple inciſion of the ſkin, where it may happen to be too tight or ſhort, and keeping the divided ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges at a diſtance from each other, till the little ſore ſhall be healed.</p>
               <p>I have likewiſe known the Ears to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perforate, a caſe that allows of no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy; but the external appearance may ſometimes be aſſiſted, when the <hi>helix,</hi> or outer circle, is turned forwards over the <hi>tragus,</hi> covering that part which ought to lead to the internal ear; but in theſe caſes,
<pb n="322" facs="unknown:026291_0337_0FCFA669A217D820"/>
I have always found the <hi>concha,</hi> and <hi>meatus auditorius,</hi> totally obliterated.</p>
               <p>Another, and a very common blemiſh, is that called Squinting, which is ſometimes contracted by very young infants, and may then frequently be remedied, eſpecially if confined to one eye; but if a child be born with this deformity, it is not ſo likely to be removed. The means I have to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend are, indeed, very ſimple, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt only in applying a piece of ſticking-plaiſter ſpread on ſome bright coloured ſilk, in ſuch a poſition, either on the temple, or the noſe, agreeably to the ſide on which the eye is diſtorted, as may draw it the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary way. In order to keep up this at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, the colour of the ſilk ought to be varied from time to time, as well as its ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, placing it a little higher, or lower, both for the ſake of change, as well as to anſwer any other end, that a due obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on its effects may point out. Beſides this, the child ought always to be placed with that ſide towards the light from which the eye is diſtorted; and for the like reaſon, its parents, nurſe, play-things, and every other object that can attract its notice, ſhould as conſtantly as is poſſible be on the ſame ſide, that the child may have every inducement it, age and circumſtances will allow, to draw the eye the right way, and
<pb n="323" facs="unknown:026291_0338_0FCFA6682634C300"/>
by early habit, counteract a muſcular action that is not yet become permanent.</p>
               <p>Another method more proper for older children, is covering the eyes with ogles, which are glaſſes fixed in a little caſe, ſuch as many people wear when they ride on horſeback. They muſt be ſo placed, that the child can ſee no object but by turning the eyes to the ſides from which they are diſtorted. It is ſcarcely neceſſary to add, that the glaſſes muſt be worn conſtantly, till the bad habit is overcome.</p>
               <p>Infants are liable, indeed, to many other blemiſhes; but as I mean to treat only of ſuch as call for medical attention, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of ſome remedy, I ſhall mention only one or two more, which are very common, and with them cloſe what I have to ſay on their Complaints.</p>

               <p>THESE are diſtortions of the feet, and differ only with reſpect to the ſide to which the foot is turned; in the former, the ſoles of the feet being turned inwards, and in the latter, outwards: the curative intention is therefore alike in both. The complaint is ſometimes very trifling, and ſeems to have been owing only to ſome cram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped poſition of the feet in the womb, and
<pb n="324" facs="unknown:026291_0339_0FCFA666A1ACC5F8"/>
in that caſe, diſappears before the end of the month. In other inſtances, there is evidently a contraction, if not accurtation of the tendons, which calls for conſiderable attention. The remedy, is obvious enough, and conſiſts only in the proper application of a roller and paſte-board ſplints, ſo as gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually to bring the foot towards its natural poſition, and in proportion as it inclines thereto, increaſing the force and tightning the roller, every two or three days.</p>
               <p>There is alſo another very common diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortion, to which no particular name, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, has been given, in which the feet are turned upward towards the inſtep: but the mode of treatment is alike in them all, and the cure will uſually be effected in a reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able time.—The like eaſy means, therefore, will generally be ſufficient to remedy a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of the joints of the fingers, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious awkward poſitions of the toes, with which ſome infants come into the world.</p>
               <p>All theſe complaints may, nevertheleſs, be ſometimes more conſiderable, and in ſuch caſe, eſpecially if neglected for many months, or even years, as they ſometimes are, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the aſſiſtance of ſome ſteel inſtrument, or irons, (as they are called,) which are properly contrived for theſe and other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortions, as of the knees, &amp;c. by Meſſrs.

            <head>GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR THE PROPER MANAGEMENT OF INFANTS FROM THE BIRTH.</head>
            <p>WHATEVER ſplendor the actual treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of diſeaſes may reflect on the ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of medicine, it by no means compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends the whole of its province: for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention being in every caſe preferable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, the medical art would be more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect than other ſciences, were it devoted only to the latter. In the management of infants more eſpecially, ſuch a variety of other articles occurs ſubject to medical di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, that this little work would be peculiarly incomplete if confined merely to the cure of diſorders. In a view, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to ſuch miſcellaneous matters, and certain recurring affections too trifling to be ranked as diſeaſes, this ſecond part is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed; and it is hoped, may contain eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing on which the moſt vigilant parent
<pb n="329" facs="unknown:026291_0343_0FCFA66343893660"/>
can wiſh for information, without tiring her by enlarging upon trifles. In all matters of importance a becoming firmneſs has been adopted, but I have not equally inſiſted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on others, wherein the manners of a refined age cannot comply, nor have urged any pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar modes which the generality may not adopt. Should any opinion be more obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately maintained, it is, probably, in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the nouriſhment moſt adapted to new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born children; and this it may be proper to diſcuſs, previouſly to entering upon their general management, by conſidering the caſe of infants intended to be reared with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the breaſt, or brought up, as it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>by hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it would carry me altogether beyond the limits I have aſſigned to this ſecond part, were I to enter ſo far into the inveſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſubject, as to ſet forth all the improprieties of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 words">
                  <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of training up infants from the birth. And I am glad to find by ſome very recent examples among perſons of rank, that there is ſomewhat leſs occaſion for it, than there appeared to be ſome years ago. It would be unpardonable, however, in a work of this ſort, not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt how inadequate every ſubſtitute for the breaſt has been univerſally found; and therefore how proper it is, that every child ſhould have it, and even be ſuckled by its
<pb n="330" facs="unknown:026291_0344_0FCF897AD4065BA8"/>
own mother, where her health can ſafely admit of it.—Reaſon, inſtinct, experience, all conſpire to ſupport this opinion; and whoever will determine to attend only to matter of fact, may ſoon be convinced of it. Nature herſelf points it out: all the nobler part of the irrational creation is qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified for it, and by inſtinct it obeys—the human race alone, poſſeſſed of nobler pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and rational diſcernment, perverts thoſe faculties to evade its dictates, and to invent excuſes for refuſing its claims. But pue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rile, indeed, are all the common arguments againſt it, in the greater number of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; and herein Dr. Armſtrong ſeems to have egregiouſly erred, for though, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently, an advocate for ſuckling, he has laboured for arguments to apologize for the ſpoon and the boat, in too many inſtances. It were eaſy, perhaps, to produce as ſound arguments againſt eating more than once a-day, becauſe ſo many people become diſeaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from exceſs. But not only is the breaſt-milk the natural,<note n="*" place="bottom">In ſome very northern parts of the world, as thoſe of Greenland, and the neighbouring country of the Eſquimaux, the breaſt appears to be, in the ſtricteſt propriety of ſpeech, the <hi>only</hi> food that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has provided for infants; inſomuch that, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever a ſuckling-mother happens to die, her infant is buried with her. Experience, one would hope, having demonſtrated the inefficacy of the hard and coarſe diet which nature has there ſo ſparingly dealt out, it is eſteeme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="331" facs="unknown:026291_0345_0FCFA65E52143068"/>
for infants, but ſuckling alſo conduces to the eaſy recovery of the mother; though ſhe ſhould not be able wholly to ſupport her child by the breaſt, or to continue ſuckling ſo long as the infant may require it.</p>
            <p>Although from much experience I ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to give this opinion, I do, by no means intend to aſſert that every mother is able to ſuckle her child even for the month, or would do well to attempt it; but I am, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, equally ſatisfied, that many are very well able who do not, and ſeveral who have only through fear been diſcourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from doing it, in two or three lyings-in, having afterwards been prevailed on to make the attempt, have gone on with it for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral months, enjoyed better health when they ſuckled than at any other part of their lives, and their children have thriven per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly well.</p>
            <p>Thus, beſides the advantages derived to infants, there are evidently others reſulting to the mother herſelf, and ſome that deſerve a particular notice. For, by this means, where due care is taken, painful inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and ſuppurations in the breaſt may of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten be prevented, as may be fairly concluded,
<pb n="332" facs="unknown:026291_0346_0FCFA65CCEBAEF60"/>
not only from the rarity of ſuch complaints in the <hi>Britiſh Lying-in Hoſpital,</hi> where almoſt every woman ſuckles her infant, but from the like authority of Dr. Nelſon, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, that out of 4,400 women who ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led their children, only four had milk-ſores, and that "theſe had either no nipples, or former ſore breaſts." Theſe advantages, if duly credited, one ſhould hope, might tend to induce ladies of rank to ſet the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, by performing this kindeſt and moſt pleaſant office, at leaſt during the mouth. But it would be unjuſt not to add, that whenever they may purpoſe to aſſume it for a much longer time, they ſhould determine to do it effectually, or they will but injure their children, as well as forfeit many of the advantages and comforts, which in a due execution of it, they would have a right to expect. It is poſſible, I may not be thanked for urging ſome parts of the above advice; but I am certain, I am do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my duty in giving it.</p>
            <p>Hitherto, however, notwithſtanding the the many encouragements often brought to the ears, and urged upon parents, that ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, Faſhion, has prevailed over the good ſenſe and natural feelings of many, whoſe maternal affection can be, in no other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, ſuſpected. Againſt ſome, moreover, another complaint may be brought, who not only refuſe to give nouriſhment to their
<pb n="333" facs="unknown:026291_0347_0FCFA65B62010848"/>
tender and helpleſs offspring, but whilſt they, unneceſſarily, commit this charge to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ſtranger, give up every other charge with it; and ſeldom viſit the nurſery, or ſuperin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend thoſe they ſet over it. It is from hence, that ſo many errors in the point of diet, air, clothing, &amp;c. &amp;c. have inſenſibly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> into the houſes even of ſome, whoſe rank in the world would otherwiſe have ſecured to their children every advantage that a due atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to nature, or to art could point out.</p>
            <p>Another important, and affecting conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration might be brought forward on this head, which I ſhall, indeed, only touch up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as it calls rather for the pen of the phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher than of a phyſician, I mean, the ſacrifice that poor women make in going out to ſuckle other people's children, the ſad conſequences of which are often ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely felt by their own, through neglect or miſmanagement, and eſpecially for want of the breaſt. Indeed no attention of the nurſe can duly compenſate this loſs; and only the moſt common ſubſtitutes for it can, in their forlorn circumſtances, be allowed them. This becomes a ſource of evil, that, I fear, is not uſually thought of, and proves eventually the ſacrifice of many infants eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry year: a matter of much importance, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, to the public, as well as to the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies immediately concerned. It is true, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, ladies of rank frequently do all in
<pb n="334" facs="unknown:026291_0348_0FCFA659D0A44100"/>
their power to counteract this too natural, and fatal conſequence, by a careful atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the forſaken infant; not only inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon a breaſt being provided for it, but regarding it as a kind of foſter-child: ſo that, after generouſly preſerving it through infancy by their charity and attention, they frequently follow it with their protection and kindneſs through life. Such charity, indeed, adds a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 words">
                  <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>
               </gap> elevated rank; tho' perhaps, much leſs than this, from ſome people, would be ſhort of their duty. But it is not every family that is in a ſituation to adopt this conduct; though I am ſorry to add, that too many who are not, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, greedily adopt the faſhions, and mimick the manners of the great, by more criminal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and needleſsly refuſing to ſuckle, and abandoning that tender charge with which nature herſelf has entruſted them.</p>
            <p>It gives me real concern to find occaſion for ſuch unpleaſant reflections upon any part of the ſex I ſo much honour, and upon any of my fair and ſenſible country women, in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.

Tacitus, the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man hiſtorian, complains of the degeneracy of Rome in his days, (though by no means its moſt degenerate aera,) lamenting that in former times, grave matrons attended to their children, as their firſt family concern, but now, ſays he, they are intruſted to the care of ſome Grecian girl, or other inferior domeſtic.—It is no ſmall ſatisfaction to me, however, to declare, that in this country there is no ground for a general complaint on this head; there are examples of the firſt magnitude of a nobler conduct, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>It may not be amiſs, at the opening of the enſueing obſervations to remark, that the demand for the multifarious directions here offered, as well as all thoſe given by other writers on the management of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, ariſes from the falſe reaſoning of thoſe to whoſe care the infant ſtate is frequently intruſted; who inſtead of being guided by the ſober dictates of nature, have adopted the rules of art, falſely ſo called, or have followed the wild fancies of anile ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, the various tribes of the irrational ſpecies act in a thouſand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances more prudently than we do, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uniformly guided by inſtinct, are led im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly and ſafely through all their opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Many quadrupeds, fiſh, and even reptiles ſeem to know what is proper for them as ſoon as they come into exiſtence, and have ſtrength ſufficient to reach after it. In other inſtances they are guided by the parent, who ſeems to adjoin ſome degree of
<pb n="337" facs="unknown:026291_0351_0FCFA6529BEA5108"/>
knowledge acquired by experience, to the inſtinct with which it is naturally endowed. Man, on the contrary, deſigned to be the pupil of obſervation, has ſcarce any innate diſcernment; and conſequently his infant race paſs through a long period utterly help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, alike diveſted of ideas to guide, and of ſtrength to manage for themſelves. But to the parent is imparted both; whoſe province it is to judge for them, and actually to put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their hands or mouths, whatſoever they may ſtand in need of. When the parent, therefore, forſakes the paths of ſimplicity, and lays down arbitrary rules, the reſult of falſe ſcience, inſtead of patient experience, or miſtakes the clamor of faſhion for the voice of nature, confuſion and diſeaſe muſt be the unavoidable conſequence.—Awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by theſe, man is loudly called upon to return to the ſimplicity of nature, and the reſult of diſpaſſionate obſervation. It is this will be ouraim in the work before us, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever danger and deviation are connected; aſſured, that the experience of the moſt ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious and ſucceſsful among parents and practitioners, will applaud the deſign, and confirm the generality of our obſervations.</p>

And this has ſo often ſucceeded, that I have been tempted to think its importance may poſſibly, not have been ſufficiently attended to by every practitioner. I reſt this preſumption, not only upon ſome fortunate events where I have had little or no previous ground for hope, but where others had, in ſome inſtances, abandoned it. A certain ſteady perſeverance in our attempts to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve life, is, indeed, not only a duty practitioners owe to the public, ſo long as the leaſt hope may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, but one ſucceſsful attempt is an abundant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence for many failures; eſpecially, as I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine we ſhall rarely fail when there may be the leaſt poſitive ground for hope of a favourable iſſue.</p>
                  <p>As to the means they conſiſt only of warmth, clyſters, ſtimulants, and eſpecially blowing forcibly into the <hi>trachaea,</hi> or wind-pipe.</p>
                  <p>The ordinary ſtimulants are the ſmoke of lighted brown paper, or tobacco; juice of onions; Scotch ſnuff; frictions with hot cloths, and brandy; ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>nates,</hi> and the ſoles of the feet: ſtimulating the noſe, and upper parts of the throat with a fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; with every other ſimilar mean calculated to excite a ſtrong effort, eſpecially that of crying; to which our attempts muſt principally, and ultimately <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>. On this account, I believe; no great benefit is to be expected from ſtroking the blood along the chord, or immerſing the after-birth in warm wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; the fetal life being extinct, the recovery of the child will depend on the blood paſſing freely through the lungs, which it cannot do till the child is brought to breathe freely and forcibly; the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of which alſo is never ſecure, till it begins to <hi>cry.</hi> To theſe ends, I have depended above all upon blowing into the mouth, which I am ſatisfied may be more effectually done by the mouth of the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant being placed immediately upon the child's, than by means of a blow-pipe; at the ſame time, prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a premature return of the air, by the fingers of one hand placed at the corners of the mouth, and thoſe of the other on each ſide of the noſe. But I have ſometimes imagined, that I might attribute much of my ſucceſs not only to the <hi>continuance</hi> of this, but to the <hi>manner</hi> of doing it, by attempting to imitate natural reſpiration, by forcing out the air I had thrown in, by a ſtrong preſſure againſt the diaphragm and breaſt: thus blowing in, and alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately preſſing out the air, for a long time together, omitting it only now and then, to make uſe of ſome of the abovementioned means: which latter, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, can do very little till the child begins not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to gaſp, and that with ſhorter intervals, but alſo to breathe in a pretty uniform manner. At this time, ſhould the child not be diſpoſed to <hi>cry,</hi> which is frequently the caſe, the <hi>nates</hi> and ſoles of the feet ſhould be ſtricken forcibly and repeatedly; and this failing, as well as the application of ordinary ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulants to the noſe, and irritating the wind-pipe, I think nothing is ſo likely to ſucceed as a tobacco, or other ſtimulating clyſter, and putting a little Scotch ſnuff up to the noſe, which latter if it induce ſneezing, will ſoon be followed by a ſtrong cry, and the child be with certainty reſtored.</p>
                  <p>Amongſt other means, that of warmth was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended; to which end, the infant ſhould be entirely covered with hot clothes, which ſhould be renewed as faſt as they become cool; or the body may be immerſed in a tepid bath, and be well rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed all over: the chord may likewiſe be ſuffered to bleed a little, eſpecially if the face or body do not ſoon acquire the natural colour—but this ought ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to be done, nor the chord be divided as long as any pulſation is to be felt in it.</p>
                  <p>To theſe means may be added the cautious uſe of electricity, which appears, <hi>a priori,</hi> as likely to be ſucceſsful in theſe, as in any other caſes to which it has been applied: but I have never been in a ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation to make trial of it, or I certainly ſhould, as I once knew a child happily recovered by it, after being laid out for dead, for near two hours, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of a fall from a two-pair of ſtairs win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow.</p>
                  <p>But ſhould theſe ſeveral means fail, as a laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſource, a very different kind of ſtimulant may be tried, and inſtead of laying the infant aſide in a warm flannel, it ſhould be expoſed to ſudden and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere cold, which I remember once to have ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after the life of the child had been deſpaired of.</p>
                  <p>It will be preſumed, I dare ſay, that ſuch a ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous attention is not deſigned to be inculcated in every inſtance of apparently ſtill-born, infants, but principally where the death of the child may not only not be certainly aſcertained, but there has previouſly been reaſon to expect it would be brought alive into the world.—The great importance, however, of the ſubject, it is hoped, will be a ſufficient apology for the length of this note; and as the attempt to reſtore infants to life has always been a moſt pleaſing employment, to myſelf, the deſire of being an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of inducing others to a <hi>perſeverance</hi> in the uſe of the like means, emboldens me to riſk the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of any who may deem it prolix or ſuperfluous.—I ſhall juſt add, that amongſt other ſymptoms of ſome irrecoverable injury a child may have ſuſtained in the birth, is that of a diſcoloured and often fetid, or bloody water forcing out of the noſe, after the lungs have been two or three times artificially in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flated. Under theſe circumſtances, I have very rarely ſeen an infant at all revived; but I have twice lately ſo far ſucceeded as to animate a child ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently both to breath and to cry; but they afterwards lay in a moaning ſtate for four or ſix hours, and then expired.</p>

<pb n="338" facs="unknown:026291_0352_0FCFA6511430A7C8"/>
calls for our beſt attention. And firſt, it may be obſerved, that it ought not to be expoſed to any thing that may violently, or too ſuddenly affect the ſenſes. On which
<pb n="339" facs="unknown:026291_0353_0FCFA64EAAB6B528"/>
account, Moſchion and Albinus have well adviſed, that it ſhould not be expoſed either to great heat or cold, nor a ſtrong light, nor odours of any kind, however grateful to adults; the unpleaſant effect of which

are ſufficiently manifeſted by the infant it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p>The attention will next be called to waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and dreſſing it, together with other lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle

offices ſuited to the occaſion. And this firſt waſhing is of more importance than is uſually imagined, being amongſt the <hi>little</hi> things which are often overlooked by wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and others, (and by ſome thought of no

               </note> but it is not every little thing that may ſafely be neglected, or ill-done. In regard to poor people, eſpecially, and infants born in hoſpitals, and other crouded apartments, the importance of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per waſhing is greatly increaſed, the foulneſs left upon the ſkin being a remote cauſe of ſome dangerous endemic complaints;<note n="*" place="bottom">See <hi>Mons.

               </note> as a preventative whereof, the waſhing ought to be repeated for ſeveral days, with light fric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the ſkin. Some infants alſo are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered much more than others with a thick, viſcid matter, which cleaves ſo faſt to the ſkin, that it is not eaſily waſhed off, which there is, however, another reaſon for doing, as it would obſtruct perſpiration, which can never be duly performed, where the ſkin is left any wiſe foul. On this account, the nurſe ſhould be very attentive to this firſt concern of her infant charge, and whatever waſh ſhe may make uſe of, it ſhould always have ſoap in it, and the child be well rubbed, eſpecially under the arms, in the hams, and groins, where this mucus is apt to adhere: and to this end, it would be better ſhe made uſe of no kind of greaſe, which tends to ſtop up the pores, and ſo prevent perſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; or that ſhe be, at leaſt, very careful
<pb n="343" facs="unknown:026291_0357_0FCFA645C7660B00"/>
the greaſe be afterwards well wiped off. In the ſame view, it were well if the waſhing were repeated for two or three days, which it is not improbable might tend to prevent the red-gum and other ſimilar affections of the ſkin, with ſuch other complaints as may ariſe from the ſuppreſſion of inſenſible per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration.</p>
            <p>After a while, and ſometimes the next day, moſt nurſes waſh the child with cold water; a practice highly extolled by Dr. Armſtrong, as well as many other prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners. But though no one can be a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er advocate for every thing that is bracing than I am, I cannot approve of this ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute for cold-bathing, as it is called; at leaſt, as an indiſcriminate practice. The cold-bath acts on a quite different principle, and I could wiſh almoſt every child, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally thoſe born in London, were bathed at three or four months old, (if the ſeaſon of the year and other circumſtances ſhould ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of it)<note n="*" place="bottom">To this end, particularly, a child ſhould not be coſtive, feveriſh, nor have any internal obſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.—<hi>Mons.

We have, in like manner, only to point to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of children and young men, who from very weakly infants, have been rendered ſtrong and healthy, merely from a prudent uſe of the cold-bath; and may defy any man to produce the like inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of its oppoſite effects when made uſe of with the cautions which every powerful remedy requires. The Spartan women, likewiſe, afford us ſufficient evidence of the ſalutary effects of cold-bathing, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the comments made upon the women themſelves, by Ariſtotle.</note> which I am certain would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent,

                  <p>From the ſurpriſing good effects that ſometimes follow the uſe of cold-baths, I do not wonder that Prieſts, in times of ignorance, have been known to account them holy, and dedicate them to ſome Saint; to whoſe influence certain cures were attributed.</p>
                  <p>The ſalutary operations of the cold-bath are, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, eaſily accounted for, from its promoting inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible perſpiration, and rendering that ſecretion leſs readily affected by the impreſſion of the external air.</p>
                  <p>It may be known to agree with children, when they come out of it warm, lively, and their ſtrength increaſes on the uſe of it. On the other hand, if they come out cold, diſpirited, and ſeem rather to loſe ſtrength, it may be as often prejudicial.</p>
                  <p>But I muſt obſerve, that theſe unpleaſant effects are frequently owing to an improper uſe of bathing, and for want of making a very obvious diſcrimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the habits of body of different children.—For the tender and delicate, not only ſhould a good quantity of ſalt be put into the bath, but the water ſhould alſo at firſt be a little warmed, and children be brought only by degrees to endure it quite cold, which they will not by this means be the leſs likely to do: or ſhould the water never be perfectly ſo, the advantages of cold-bathing will, nevertheleſs, be conſiderable;<note n="*" place="bottom">

                        </p>
                     </note> though Dr. Hunter and others have thought differently. It is not, I apprehend, merely from its coldneſs that the benefit of bathing ariſes, but is rather from the ſubject being ſuddenly immerſed into a very different medium, (if ſo be, that medium be not actually warm) in which the contact of the external air is taken off during the immerſion, and is as ſuddenly reſtored on his being taken out. By this means, the blood is alternately puſhed forward into the extreme veſſels, and ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly repelled to the heart (in proportion to the coldneſs of the water) and ſuffers an advantageous attrition againſt the ſides of the veſſels. The ſmall paſſages are rendered previous, and the contractile power of the heart is increaſed, as well as the muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular fibres proportionally ſtrengthened. The ſalt added to the water pretty certainly prevents taking cold, whilſt it adds to the ſtimulus on the ſkin, and has a more ſalutary operation on the pores.</p>
                  <p>For the ſake of ſome readers it is neceſſary to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that a child is to be put only once under the water at each time of bathing, and to be taken out as ſoon as it is poſſible. It ſhould be received in a blanket, and be wiped dry with a cloth in the moſt expeditious manner; and as ſoon as it can be dreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſhould partake of ſuch exerciſe as may be beſt ſuited to its age: but by no means put into bed. There will need no great attention to its being wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped perfectly dry, as a child will be leſs liable to take cold from a few drops of ſalt-water being left upon it, than by being long uncovered in ſome parts of its body, in an over-caution to wiping it dry.</p>

more inclined to diſeaſe than thoſe born in ſummer), itſelf in one continued ſcream, and the fond mother covering her ears un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the bed-clothes that ſhe may not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſed by its cries; has ever ſtruck me as a piece of unneceſſary ſeverity, and favors as little of kindneſs, as plunging an infant a ſecond or third time, into a tub of water, with its mouth open, and gaſping for breath, in the old faſhioned mode of cold-bathing: both of which often induce cramps and pains in the bowels, and weakneſs of the lower extremities, but rarely an increaſe of ſtrength. It ſurely cannot be amiſs, in winter time at leaſt, to take the cold off the water for the few firſt days, which it has been obſerved, will be uſeful in other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects; and whenever cold water is made uſe of, it will be quite ſufficient to waſh the child as far as a regard to cleanlineſs may

require, which will always be the parts ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the worſt kinds of galling and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coriation: on which account cold water is certainly uſeful. With this view, beſide the groins, and contiguous parts, the arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits, folds of the neck, and parts behind the ears, being alſo diſpoſed to ſlight chaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fings, may be occaſionally waſhed in like manner, and if the diſcharge be not check<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by it, they ſhould be duſted with a little hair-powder, or powder of ceruſe, or a little white vitriol may be added to the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; which if the excoriations are not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry conſiderable, will generally heal them very ſoon: ſhould theſe fail, they may be dreſſed with the red drying ointment.<note n="*" place="bottom">This is an excellent remedy in a thouſand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and has very undeſervedly fallen into diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſteem.</note> In a very acid ſtate of the ſtomach however during the month, particularly where there is a purging with very green ſtools, the parts covered by the cloths are often infeſted with a troubleſome excoriation, (called <hi>intertrigo</hi>) and whilſt that ſtate continues, will not be healed by any drying applications. I have found nothing ſo pleaſant, and uſeful in this caſe, as covering the parts with a thin ſkin found upon the veal kidney, which ſoftens, and cools them, till the cauſe of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint may be removed by the uſe of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

abſorbents. There is a mixed affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this kind, however, in which theſe parts are not actually excoriated, but are very hard and ſwollen, as well as painful and inflamed; and the affection ſeems to be kept up by the acrid nature of the excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, though not originally cauſed by it. In this caſe, inſtead of waſhing the parts with wetted fuller's earth, gruel, or greaſy mixtures, an embrocation of elder-flower-water, with as much boiling milk as will render it moderately warm, has been imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately efficacious. But one grand mean of keeping children from chafing is to preſerve them very dry and clean;<note n="*" place="bottom">To this end, poor people need to be admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, that all the cloths ſhould be properly <hi>boiled</hi> every time they are <hi>waſhed;</hi> a circumſtance ſuch people are apt to neglect.—Another error worthy of remark in this place, is, that of wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a pilch (as it is called); an old faſhion ſtill too much in uſe, and contributes not a little to make children weak: it being originally deſigned to be worn only for the few firſt weeks after birth, but is often continued for as many months. It can anſwer no poſſible end but that of ſaving a little trouble, ſince inſtead of keeping children dry and clean, it does directly the contrary; for if it has received any wet through the uſual cloth laid under it, it ought itſelf to be changed as often as the other, or muſt certainly be damp and unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; whilſt by heating the loins, and lower limbs, it has a manifeſt tendency to relax, and diſpoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants to become rickety.</note> articles of ſo much importance, that I ſhould have inſiſted
<pb n="349" facs="unknown:026291_0363_0FCFA63C8CFC4F70"/>
much longer upon them, if I had not already far exceeded the bounds I had intended. Suffice it therefore to ſay, that it is next to impoſſible a child ſhould thrive or be healthy, if theſe laſt articles are not ſtrictly attended to, which, together with thoſe of proper food and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, are, perhaps, the principal ones in which the children of poor people are at a great diſadvantage, and which become the conſtant ſource of rickets and diſtortions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them. Let not theſe ill effects fall on the children of thoſe whom miſconduct alone can expoſe to them.</p>
            <p>I ſhall juſt mention here another uſeleſs operation practiſed by nurſes, that of forcing out the milk from the little breaſts of new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born infants. Some children a-day or two after they are born, will have the breaſts exceedingly tumid, hard, and painful, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining ſomething like milk; and nurſes ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine it to be a great kindneſs to milk it out as it is called. But I have often been griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to ſee a nurſe rudely rubbing, and even ſqueezing the breaſts, already in a ſtate of inflammation, and continuing it even for ſome minutes, though the child's cries might convince her ſhe is putting it to pain. In the caſe of inflammation, a bit of bread and milk poultice is the propereſt application, but if the part be not inflamed, it can want nothing at all; though if it be thought
<pb n="350" facs="unknown:026291_0364_0FCFA6375382A8D0"/>
ſomething ought to be done, a little oil with a drop or two of brandy may be gently rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in, or ſmall pieces of the litharge-plaiſter may be applied, and lie on the parts till they fall off of themſelves.</p>
            <p>Having conſidered theſe neceſſary prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, I proceed to offer a few remarks on the prevailing errors in their <hi>dreſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the firſt ſight of a new-born infant, every one is ſtruck with the idea of its weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and helpleſſneſs; and we often take very improper methods of ſtrengthening it. It is <hi>deſigned</hi> to be weak and tender in this infant-ſtate, as is every other object around us.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>Nons naiſſons foibles, nous avons beſoin de forces; nous naiſſons dépourvous de tout, nous avons beſoin d'aſſiſtance, nous naiſſons ſtupides, nous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vons beſoin de jugement; tout ce que nous n'avons pas á notre naiſſance, et dont nous avons beſoin etant grauds, nous eſt donnè par l'education.</p>
                  <p>ROUSSEAU.</p>
               </note>—Take a ſurvey of nature, from the firſt opening leaves of the vernal flower, or the tender foilage of the ſenſitive plant, to the young lion, or the elephant; they are all in their ſeveral orders, proportionally weak, and cannot exiſt without ſome exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior ſupport. But they ſtand in need of nothing but what nature has prepared for them. If ſeed be caſt into a proper ſoil, it wants only the ſurrounding elements to enſure vigour and maturity. So if the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="351" facs="unknown:026291_0365_0FCFA6361BA01908"/>
infant be born of healthy parents, and at its full time, it is uſually ſufficiently ſtrong; proper food and nurſing are the elements whoſe foſtering influence it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires:—if it have theſe, it will need no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more.</p>
            <p>It is true, it is very weak, but is it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be tight rolled, under the idea of ſupporting it, and giving it ſtrength? It is a bundle of tender veſſels, through which a fluid is to paſs, undiſturbed, to be equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtributed through the body, and which are therefore ſurrounded by a ſoft medium, capable of yielding to the impetus of their contents. Hence we cannot but conceive, how injurious any great preſſure muſt be to ſo delicate a frame, which before birth ſwam in a ſoft fluid. But beſides this, the infant requires freedom and liberty on other accounts. The ſtate of infancy and child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood (as Dr. Gregory obſerves) is impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of reſtraint in this reſpect, through "the reſtleſs activity incident to youth, which makes it delight to be in perpetual motion, and to ſee every thing in motion around it."</p>
            <p>Let us again advert to the irrational ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, whoſe more ſagacious conduct ſo often diſgraces our own. There is no occaſion on which they do not ſeem to conſult pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety; and having a right end in view, they as certainly accompliſh it, and always
<pb n="352" facs="unknown:026291_0366_0FCFA633B23F72F8"/>
in proper time—Doth a little bird deſign to prepare a lodging for her young; it is ſure to make choice of the fitteſt ſituation, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to defend them from dangers, or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the moſt convenient ſupply of their wants; if to this end it be neceſſary to conſtruct the neſt of rough and ſtrong clay, it is ſtill lined with down: the young lie warm and ſecure, but they lie at their eaſe.</p>
            <p>I am not ignorant, indeed, that for many years paſt, the very ancient tight mode of dreſſing infants has been diſcontinued, for which we are probably greatly indebted to Dr. Cadogan. It is certain alſo, that for the laſt twenty years, the faſhion recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by him has been improving; but there is yet room to go forward, and were every tender parent in this country tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly ſenſible of its advantages, it would ſoon become faſhionable to ſee children as much at their eaſe on a chriſtening-day, as they are when laid at night in their beds. And I may be permitted to add here, what every modern practitioner has adverted to, that were ſtrings, in almoſt every inſtance, ſuſtituted for pins, phyſicians would ſeldom be at a loſs to account for the ſudden cries and complaints of infants, which are too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="353" facs="unknown:026291_0367_0FCFA63216A681F8"/>
produced by this needleſs part of their dreſs.<note n="*" place="bottom">A gentlewoman lately informed me, that one of her children, after long and inceſſant crying, fell into ſtrong convulſions, which her phyſician was at a loſs to account for, nor was the cauſe diſcovered till after death; when on the cap being taken off (which had not been changed on account of its ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) a ſmall pin was diſcovered ſticking up to the head, in the large <hi>fontanelle,</hi> or mould.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Nature knows no other uſe of clothing but to defend from the cold,—all that is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary therefore for this purpoſe, is to wrap the child up in a ſoft looſe covering, and not too great a weight of it; to which orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments enough may be added without doing miſchief. And had this matter been always wholly left to the judgment of parents, this is, probably all that would have been done, but the buſineſs of dreſſing an infant is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a ſecret, which none but adepts muſt pretend to underſtand. The child itſelf, however, diſcovers to us the propriety of ſuch clothing, by the happineſs and delight it expreſſes every time it is undreſſed, and rubbed with a ſoft hand. Whereas <hi>the art of dreſſing</hi> has laid the foundation of many a bad ſhape, and what is worſe, of very bad health, through the greateſt part of life.—It is ſcarce neceſſary in this day, to add any thing in this place in commendation of clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, unleſs it be to counteract a vulgar
<pb n="354" facs="unknown:026291_0368_0FCF89729ED5FF48"/>
notion, familiar only to common people, that a frequent change of linen has a tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to weaken new-born children; an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd idea, that has not the ſmalleſt founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in reaſon or fact.</p>
            <p>The tender infant being dreſſed, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving undergone ſuch other little diſcipline as has been mentioned, is uſually ſo far fati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued by it, as ſoon afterwards to fall into a ſound ſleep. We ſhall therefore leave it a while to be refreſhed, whilſt I endeavor to conduct the fond mother through the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous other duties it calls for from day to day, till it happily arrives at an age free from the peculiar dangers of infancy.</p>
            <p>In the purſuit of ſuch a plan, we meet with a variety of miſcellaneous articles, and though many of them are not of apparent magnitude in themſelves, are in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences highly worthy of notice; which that they may be thrown into ſome kind of order, may all be very well claſſed under the ſeveral heads of the <hi>Non-naturals,</hi> as they are called. Such are air, meat, and drink; ſleep and watching; motion and reſt; retention and ſecretion, and the paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the mind; a due attention to which, may prevent many of the evils incident to this tender age.—The firſt of theſe was ſaid to be Air.</p>
            <p>The great importance of this has been ſet forth when ſpeaking of the diſeaſes of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants;
<pb n="355" facs="unknown:026291_0369_0FCFA62FE0EF4A28"/>
I ſhall here in a more particular way obſerve, that the age, conſtitution, and other circumſtances of the child, and the ſeaſon of the year, ought always to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken into conſideration, <hi>that</hi> being highly proper on one occaſion, which would be very detrimental at another. In general it may be ſaid, that warmth is friendly to very young infants, but they ſhould, nevertheleſs, be inured gradually to endure the cold air, which is abſolutely eſſential to their health. I cannot therefore agree with Dr. Arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrong, who thinks the rich loſe fewer chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren than the poor, becauſe they are kept warmer. On the other hand, it was well ſaid by one, that "a warm nurſery fills a cold church-yard." Much caution, indeed, is neceſſary on this head, in this unſettled climate, and evinces the neceſſity of parents ſuperintending thoſe to whoſe care they in-truſt infant-children, ſince nurſes are often indiſcreet in keeping them too long in the air at a time, which is a frequent occaſion of their taking cold, and deters many parents from ſending them abroad ſo often as they ſhould. Another, and a worſe, as well as common fault, of nurſes and ſervants, is, that of ſtanding ſtill with children in their arms in a current of air, or even ſitting down with other ſervants, and ſuffering chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren who can run about, to play at a little diſtance by themſelves, ſit down on the
<pb n="356" facs="unknown:026291_0370_0FCFA629CF56D588"/>
graſs, and ſuch like; the conſequences of which are often a long confinement to a warm room, and either a prohibition againſt going out ſo much as they ought, or a freſh cold owing to ſome of the like irregulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. And I may here obſerve, the lighteſt ſymptom of cold (which is alſo often taken in the lying-in room during the month,) is that called the <hi>ſnuffles,</hi> or ſtoppage of the noſe, and in general requires nothing more than a little pomatum, or <hi>pomade divine,</hi> to be put to the noſtrils when the child is laid in the cradle; or if this fail, a little white vitriol may be diſſolved in roſe-water, and the bridge of the noſe often wetted with it.</p>
            <p>It will be adviſeable, in order to inure in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants to the air, that they be ſhort-coated as early as the ſeaſon of the year will permit; their dreſs ſhould be ſtill looſe and eaſy, and they may continue without ſtockings even for two or three years, and boys till they are breeched. As to this change, I think, it had always better be made in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the winter, than in ſummer, as the dreſs upon the whole is warmer, eſpecially about the cheſt, which from having been open for three or four years, it ſeems rather ſtrange to cover, all at once, at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of hot weather.</p>
            <p>But though I have ſaid children would be as well without ſtockings, for a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble time, I muſt remark, that circumſtances
<pb n="357" facs="unknown:026291_0371_0FCFA628E082AD78"/>
are always to be taken into conſideration. <hi>Mutatis mutandis</hi>

               </note> ſhould not only be the motto of phyſicians, but of common life, and we ſhould be guided by it in regard to all general rules. For want of this caution in the preſent inſtance, tender children ſuffer exceedingly in ſevere winters, and are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſed with chilblains merely for want of proper covering to their tender limbs. I have ſeen a child of four or five years old, the daughter of people of faſhion, (who I know will pardon my mentioning it) whoſe legs were covered with chilblains quite up to the knee, and yet the lady could not be prevailed upon in time, to ſuffer ſtockings to be put on, becauſe ſtrong and healthy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are thought to be better without them.</p>
            <p>The ſecond article under the head of <hi>Non-naturals</hi> refer to meat and drink, and is worthy of ample diſcuſſion, having as yet been conſidered only in relation to the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diency of <hi>breaſt-milk,</hi> where that may any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be procured.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place it may be remarked, that although an infant be ſuckled by its own mother, it can certainly have no real need of any other food, till the time nature will bring milk into her breaſt, ſuppoſing the child be laid to it in proper time; which,
<pb n="358" facs="unknown:026291_0372_0FCFA626726AF3B0"/>
doubtleſs, ought to be as ſoon as ſhe may, by ſleep or otherwiſe, be ſufficiently refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to undergo the little fatigue that an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to ſuckle may occaſion. This method, however unuſual with ſome, is the moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to nature, and to obſervations on the irrational ſpecies, who in many things are the very beſt guides we can follow.<note n="*" place="bottom">This ſubject is largely and elegantly treated by Dr. Gregory, in his <hi>Comparative View,</hi> before quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> By means of putting the child early to the breaſt, eſpecially the firſt time of ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, the nipple will be formed, and the milk be gradually brought on. Hence much pain, and its conſequences will be prevented, as well as the frequency of ſore nipples, which in the firſt lying-in, have been wont to occaſion no inconſiderable trouble. But ſhould this, or even an abſceſs take place, they are far leſs diſtreſſing under pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per management than has been uſually ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined<note n="†" place="bottom">See a Treatiſe upon ulcers beforementioned; in which the <hi>milk-abſceſs,</hi> and <hi>ſore nipples</hi> are fully conſidered, and a ſucceſsful, and eaſy method of treatment pointed out.</note>. However, ſhould the mother be unable to ſuckle, and a wet-nurſe be engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, there can be no harm in putting the child to the breaſt, after it has taken a doſe or two of the opening medicine; or ſhould
<pb n="359" facs="unknown:026291_0373_0FCFA625030DEBE0"/>
it be brought up by the hand, and not eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kept quiet, a ſpoonful or two of water-gruel, with a little Liſbon ſugar, may be given for this purpoſe, which will uſually ſet it aſleep; after which it will be ready for whatever culinary food ſhall be found pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for it.</p>
            <p>And on this article, a vaſt croud of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities open upon us at once; and many of them with the ſanction of cuſtom and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. I ſhall firſt advert to thickneſs of the food: and it has, indeed, been matter of wonder, how the cuſtom of ſtuffing new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born infants with bread could become ſo univerſal, or the idea firſt enter the mind of a parent, that ſuch heavy food could be fit for its nouriſhment. It were well if the fond mother, and all well inclined nurſes had more juſt ideas of the manner in which we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> nouriſhed; and eſpecially, that it is not from the great quantity, nor from the quality of the food, ſimply conſidered. They may ſurely be led to conceive, that our nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment ariſes from the uſe the ſtomach makes of the food the body receives, which is to paſs through ſuch a change, called di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, as renders it balſamic, and fit to renew the maſs of blood, which is daily waſting and conſumed. An improper kind, or too great a quantity taken at a time, or too haſtily, before the ſtomach has duly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of its former contents, prevents this
<pb n="360" facs="unknown:026291_0374_0FCFA620CC606948"/>
work of digeſtion, and by making bad juices, weakens inſtead of ſtrengthens the habit; and in the end produces Worms, Convulſions, Rickets, King's evil, ſlow Fevers, and <hi>Maraſmus,</hi> or general Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.</p>
            <p>Nature, it ſhould be conſidered, has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided only milk, for every animal adapted to draw it from the breaſt, and that of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men is certainly the thinneſt of them all; but at the ſame time, far more nutritive than bread. It is true, bread, as it requires more digeſtion, will lie longer on the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach both of infants and adults, and hence, probably, becauſe it ſatisfies the preſent cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings, it has been conceived to afford a greater proportion of nouriſhment; though mixed up only with water, as it too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently is, it is far leſs nutritive than milk. Children ought to be frequently hungry, and as often ſupplied with light food, of which milk is really the moſt nutritive that we are acquainted with. This could never be doubted of, but from its paſſing ſo quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of the ſtomach; on which account, indeed, though not the propereſt food for adults, employed at hard labour, and many hours from home, it is the fitteſt of all for the more ſedentary life of a tender infant, who cannot get that nouriſhment from bread or other ſolid food, of which the ſtomachs
<pb n="361" facs="unknown:026291_0375_0FCFA61F5D8042E8"/>
of adults are capable. It muſt have been for want of attending to this conſideration, that Dr. Armſtrong has ſaid ſo much in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of bread and other thick victuals; which, by the bye, he began to make uſe of for his own children (from its ſucceſs in whom he has ventured to recommend it,) only at the age of ſix or ſeven months; a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter very different from ſtuffing an infant with it almoſt as ſoon as it is born. For every thing the ſtomach cannot digeſt, it has been ſaid, may be juſtly conſidered as a poiſon, which if not puked up, or very ſoon voided by ſtool, may occaſion ſickneſs, gripes, what are called inward fits, and all the train of bowel complaints, which may terminate in one or other of the evils juſt mentioned.</p>
            <p>Milk itſelf is produced from food taken in by the mother, and is the richeſt part of it. It is in her ſtomach that the aliment is diſſolved, or digeſted, which by a combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of powers in the <hi>chylopoetic viſcera,</hi> or parts preparing the chyle, is ſo far animalized as to be converted into a kind of white blood; from whence it has been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, every animal body is daily recruited. Hence it is very apparent, that previous to an infant having acquired ſtrength enough to convert ſolid food into this wholeſome chyle, or white blood, the parent, by this wiſe ſubſtitution in nature, has previouſly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed
<pb n="362" facs="unknown:026291_0376_0FCFA61D19157A70"/>
this work for the infant ſhe is to nouriſh.<note n="*" place="bottom">Whether the parent be able to ſuckle her own child, or that office be performed by a wet-nurſe, is not here particularly conſidered. The deſign is only to prove that milk is in general the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per food for an infant. Whether that be prepared by its own mother, a nurſe, or even by animals, as the cow, or the aſs, is equally to the purpoſe; where the former cannot be had, the beſt, and moſt natural ſubſtitute, ſhould be provided.</note>
            </p>
            <p>It can ſcarcely be improper before I quit the article of ſuckling, to relate a recent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and a remarkable one out of many, as a proof of the great degree to which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants may pine for the breaſt, even to the great hazard of periſhing for the want of it, where the real cauſe of the diſeaſe is not ſuſpected.</p>
            <p>This infant was very healthy when it was three months old, and was then weaned on account of the illneſs of the wet nurſe; but ſoon afterwards ceaſed to thrive, and had continual bowel complaints. At the age of nine months I was deſired to viſit it, and was informed that it ſlept very little, was almoſt inceſſantly crying, and had for many days brought up almoſt all its food; was become very rickety, and had all the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of an infant almoſt ſtarved. It had made trial of almoſt every kind of food, except the breaſt, and had been many weeks
<pb n="363" facs="unknown:026291_0377_0FCFA61BB41EC218"/>
under the care of an experienced apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary; was conſtantly in a ſtate of purging, and ſeemed to have been juſt kept alive by art.</p>
            <p>On the firſt ſight of the child, and upon the very face of this account, it was very evident, that the infant was not nouriſhed by the food it received, and that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint lay wholly in the firſt paſſages. But reduced as it was, I had little expectation from medicines, and therefore gave as my opinion that either the child ſtill pined for the breaſt, in which caſe, I doubted not, it would take it, though it had now been weaned ſix months; or that it ought to be carried immediately into the country, and be ſupported for ſome time only upon aſſes milk, or perhaps be fed, now and then, with a little good broth.</p>
            <p>My advice being taken, a good breaſt was procured, which the infant ſeized the moment it was put to it, and after ſucking ſufficiently, ſoon fell aſleep for ſeveral hours; waked without ſcreaming, and took the breaſt again. It is ſufficient to add, that the child ceaſed to puke or be purged, and recovered from that hour; and after ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eight or nine months longer, became in the end a fine healthy child.</p>
            <p>To return; I am free then to lay it down as an axiom, that milk ought to be the chief part of the diet of Infants for a certain time,
<pb n="364" facs="unknown:026291_0378_0FCFA61A2FF1AA98"/>
whether it be breaſt-milk or any other; I might perhaps ſay ninety-nine out of a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred. Exceptions, I believe, there may be, but much fewer children would periſh if no exception were to be made, than by abſurdly ruſhing into the contrary extreme. But ſuppoſing a very ſtrong child, at the end of the month, really not ſatisfied with milk only, and always craving the moment it has been thus fed, it, doubtleſs, may have a little boiled bread added to it, two or three times in the day; but I ſhould be very cautious how I extended it farther.<note n="*" place="bottom">"In Italy, Holland, Turkey, and through the whole Levant, children are rarely allowed any other food than the breaſt-milk, during the firſt year." BUF<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ON.—In ſome extreme northern climates we know they can have no other food, for a much longer time, and yet, there, the death of an infant is as rare an event as that of a ſuckling mother.</note> In the caſe, however, of an infant at the <hi>breaſt,</hi> if it be always craving as ſoon as it is taken from it, previous to allowing a more ſolid food, the quality of the nurſe's milk, as well as the ſtate of her health ſhould be inquired into, and the milk be changed if its goodneſs be ſuſpected. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps where bread and milk is allowed, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at a very early or a later period, it would be an advantage to boil a piece of roll, together with the upper cruſt, in a
<pb n="365" facs="unknown:026291_0379_0FCF896DB006D0A8"/>
good deal of water, till it is very ſoft; by which means the bread will part with ſome of its aceſcent quality: the water ſhould then be ſtrained off, and the bread mixed up with ſome milk, which ought to be boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed if the child is very young, or inclined to a purging.</p>
            <p>It would, I perceive, lead me beyond all bounds to enter farther into this matter; and I ſhould not, indeed, have ſaid ſo much on the ſubject, had I not had it much at heart to perſuade thoſe whoſe affections would ever lead them right, were their judgments not previouſly perverted.—I ſhall only add, that infants certainly ought not to be fed lying on their backs, but ſitting upright; as they will in this poſition ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their food more eaſily, as well as more readily diſcover when they ſhall have had enough.</p>
            <p>If Milk be the proper food for infants brought up by hand, the next inquiry will naturally be, what milk is the beſt? and what is the fitteſt inſtrument for feeding with? And herein it is with great pleaſure I acknowledge my obligations to Dr. Hugh Smith, for his ingenious contrivance, ſet forth ſome years ago in his judicious trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe on the Management of Children, in a ſeries of letters addreſſed to married women. The milk he likewiſe adviſes, is cow's milk in preference to all others; and I wiſh to
<pb n="366" facs="unknown:026291_0380_0FCFA61898D08618"/>
refer the inquiſitive reader to the reaſons the Doctor has given, to which I can add nothing but my own experience of their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity. To the milk, either from the birth or a few weeks afterwards, (but I think in general the ſooner the better) ſhould be added a ſmall quantity of a light jelly made from hartſhorn ſhavings, boiled in water to the conſiſtence that veal broth acquires when it has ſtood to be cold.<note n="*" place="bottom">There is ſometimes a difficulty in making this jelly, on account of the hartſhorn being bad; thoſe who ſhave it, often mixing with it the ſhavings of trotters, which may, however, be diſtinguiſhed by their brittleneſs. If the ſhavings are good, two ounces of them boiled very ſlowly in a quart of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to a pint, will make the jelly of a proper con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence.</note> The deſign of the jelly is obvious, and rational, at once calculated to render the food more nutritive, as well as to correct, in ſome meaſure, the aceſcency of the milk; this quality being thought to abound in the milk of different animals, in proportion to the quantity of vegetables on which they feed.<note n="†" place="bottom">See Dr. Young, <hi>De Natura et Uſu Lactis, in diverſis Animalibus.</hi>
               </note> And the milk of quadrupeds, we know, is produced from vegetable juices only, whilſt breaſt-milk is formed by a mixture of animal and vegetable food. A little Liſbon ſugar may
<pb n="367" facs="unknown:026291_0381_0FCFA6162CFE72A8"/>
be added to this compound of jelly and milk, if the child be not inclined to a purging, or in that caſe a little loaf ſugar; but the leſs of either the better. It will be proper to have the milk and jelly warmed ſeparately, and no more at a time than may be wanted; when it ſhould be put into the ſmall pot Dr. Smith has contrived for the purpoſe, which muſt be very carefully cleanſed and ſcaled, at leaſt once every day, and the ſpout be thoroughly rinſed, leſt any four curds ſhould ſtick about it; and to this end, it may be convenient to be provided with two.<note n="*" place="bottom">The objection to this mode of feeding, made by a late writer at Dover, that the pot may often be left foul, and therefore the food become four, appears to me to be very far fetched: ſince if nurſes are not to be depended upon in matters of cleanlineſs, and the ſweetneſs of the food they are to adminiſter, we can truſt them in nothing, and infants muſt be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſuffering; there being a hundred particulars eſſential to children's health, in which ſervants can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be always ſuperintended, but muſt be intirely conſided in.</note> At firſt the milk ought to be boiled, to render it leſs opening, but when the child is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral months old, or may chance to be coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, the milk need only be warmed. If it be freſh from the cow, and very rich, a portion of water may be added to it, whilſt the infant is very young.</p>
            <p>The boat, the ſpoon, and the horn, are in no wiſe comparable to the pot; which is
<pb n="368" facs="unknown:026291_0382_0FCFA610506FD708"/>
ſo contrived, not only as to pleaſe the child by its reſemblance to the nipple, and the milk coming ſlowly into its mouth, but alſo to afford the infant ſome little degree of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, in order to acquire the quantity it needs, (which the horn does not); by which means the food is alſo duly mixed with <hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liva.</hi> The like little fatigue takes place in children nouriſhed at the breaſt, and by this mean it is, that infants, eſpecially when very young, are not ſo apt to over-ſuck, as they are to be overfed by the boat or the ſpoon, the food of which being ſweet and pleaſant, and requiring on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the trouble, or rather the pleaſure of ſwallowing, the child is tempted to take too much at a time; whilſt the nurſe often forces down a ſecond or third boat full, in order to put a ſtop to the cries, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digeſtion from the firſt or ſecond may have occaſioned.</p>
            <p>The writer juſt now alluded to, as well as Mr. Le Febure de Villebrune, detracts from the advantages of this mode of feeding, by obſerving, that infants may be fed as ſlowly and cautiouſly by the ſpoon: but the fact is, that a ſervant <hi>will</hi> not ſo feed them, whilſt there are ſo many temptations to the contrary, (at leaſt I have never met with ſuch an one), nor will children, indeed, oftentimes ſuffer it, if they can anywiſe prevent it, but will be ſcreaming all the while, inſtead of being kept quiet by
<pb n="369" facs="unknown:026291_0383_0FCFA60EE5A91148"/>
their food; though the hope of quieting them, it has been obſerved, is frequently the nurſe's ſole motive for giving it. But when an infant <hi>can</hi> get it only ſlowly from the pot, and yet is itſelf all the while em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the buſineſs, it will be agreeably diverted while it is acquiring its nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in the ſame manner that it is amuſed at the breaſt.</p>
            <p>The pot is formed in the ſhape of an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyle, or gravy-pot, with a long ſpout, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from the bottom, and pierced only with a few ſmall holes at the end, which is to be covered with a piece of vellum, or parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; which being left looſe a little way over the ſpout, is ſoft and pleaſant to the infant's mouth, and it has been ſaid, is nearly as acceptable to many children as the breaſt, as I have often been a witneſs.</p>
            <p>This manner of feeding is not only plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to the child but very convenient to the nurſe, and the food equally at hand in the night-as the day, being eaſily kept warm by a lamp, or even in the bed. The only objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I have ever known made to it by thoſe who have made trial of it, is that which I eſteem one of its higheſt recommendations, which is, that children thus fed are frequently hungry, that is, they are what nature de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned them to be; this food ſitting light on the ſtomach, and being eaſily digeſted, like
<pb n="370" facs="unknown:026291_0384_0FCFA60D66C72F60"/>
the breaſt milk, children often need a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of it.</p>
            <p>It is a common direction in works of this kind, to point out the propereſt times for feeding an infant brought up by hand, and to direct how often it may ſafely be fed. I ſhall juſt obſerve therefore, that no adequate rules can be laid down on the occaſion, and on that account none ought to be attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſince none can be ſufficiently compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive; and I am happy in not being at all at a loſs in this inſtance, wherein writers have differed ſo widely. For infants not uſually taking too much at a time in this manner of feeding, on account of the little fatigue which, it was obſerved, they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go in acquiring their nouriſhment, may ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally be permitted to partake of it as often as they might of the breaſt.<note n="*" place="bottom">Optimum vero medicamentum eſt, opportune cibus datus.

            <p>I ſhall only mention one popular objection to the plan here recommended. This is taken from the many fine children we meet with, who have been brought up by hand
<pb n="371" facs="unknown:026291_0385_0FCF89686D6064E0"/>
from the birth, and fed with thick bread victuals all the day long, whilſt we every now and then ſee ſome of thoſe who have been debarred that ſort of diet, weak and tender till they become a year or two old. Not to ſtop here to obſerve, that this objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on militates equally againſt children living on the breaſt, though that is the food nature has deſigned for them, it will be ſufficient to ſay, that it is only ſtrong children who may be bred up almoſt any how, that can at all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt thick victuals, and that weakly infants, who are ſcarcely preſerved by the moſt care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful attention to their food, would ſoon be hurried out of the world if that were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held. And this reminds me of an obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a very judicious friend in the north of England, which greatly ſurprized me at the time, as I had never met with any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation from him before, the propriety of which was not exceedingly obvious and convincing. Upon ſeeing a number of fine children one day in London, he with ſome ſhrewdneſs obſerved, that we did not ſeem to have ſo many weakly half-ſtarved chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren as he met with in the country, and that he had often before made the like ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation in his journies to town. It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to me that my friend muſt lie under ſome miſtake, and I accordingly mentioned my ſurprize at ſuch a remark coming from him; when he removed my aſtoniſhment
<pb n="372" facs="unknown:026291_0386_0FCFA60BDD96B8E8"/>
by inſiſting on the fact, with the following obvious ſolution of it. There are, ſays he, ſcarcely any but fine and ſtrong children in London, I apprehend, that live to be two or three years old, the weaker ones, for want of good air, and exerciſe, ſinking un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their infirmities; whilſt the tendereſt children in the country by being turned out to crawl in the wholeſome open air, or by ſitting at the door almoſt all the day, eſcape the fatality of your groſs air and warm nurſeries, and ſurvive the trying periods of infancy, though ſome of them remain weak and rickety till they become old enough to endure ſevere exerciſe, which is alone able to ſtrengthen them effectually.</p>
            <p>I have no doubt of there being certain exceptions to this mode of feeding, although very few have actually come to my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and though I am perſuaded, that as a <hi>general</hi> plan, it is both a natural and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutary one. Inſtances may be met with, however, of ſome very athletic children who may require a more nouriſhing, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſomewhat more ſolid diet; and the ſtate of bowels in others, will call for a greater variety of food, and of a kind not calculated to be adminiſtered in the mode here recommended, as hath been already no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed under the head of <hi>purging.</hi> On theſe accounts, I would offer another obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or two, in regard to thick victuals; and
<pb n="373" facs="unknown:026291_0387_0FCF896565FE1AD0"/>
firſt, that in families accuſtomed to bring up their children by the ſpoon, I think I have found a greater number of infants well nouriſhed by the <hi>french</hi> roll boiled in water to a jelly, and afterwards diluted with milk, than on any other kind of pap. From ſuch families I have likewiſe learned, that ſome <hi>change</hi> in the food is, however, frequently neceſſary, and will be indicated by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of reliſh which the infant may diſcover towards different kinds of food, as well as by their effects on the bowels; though the child be not ſuppoſed to be at ſuch times really unwell. Such changes principally reſpect the <hi>different kinds</hi> of bread, or other farinaceous ſubſtance uſually mixed with milk, and ſometimes the ſubſtitution of broth, for a few days, in the place of the latter.</p>
            <p>When children brought up by hand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come four or five months old, eſpecially if ſtrong and healthy, they may, doubtleſs, be allowed a thicker kind of victuals, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their digeſtive powers being by this time become ſtronger, they are able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract good nouriſhment from it; though this change is not equally neceſſary for chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren brought up at the breaſt, at leaſt, ſuch do not require it ſo early; breaſt milk be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more nouriſhing than any other. The firſt addition of this kind however, whene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it becomes neceſſary, I am perſuaded,
<pb n="374" facs="unknown:026291_0388_0FCFA60AB0D0FE78"/>
ought to be broth<note n="*" place="bottom">"I cannot help remarking here, that the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy of beef or mutton, not over roaſted, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fat, properly diluted with water, is the whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomeſt and moſt natural, as well as nouriſhing broth that can be made." See the above-mentioned Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Dr. Hugh Smith.</note>, which with a little bread beat up in it in the form of panada, will be at once an agreeable and wholſome change, and prepare them for farther ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances in this way.

And when they can go alone, not only is a little light meat and certain vegetables to be allowed them once a day, with puddings, or blamange, white-pot, cuſtards, and ſuch like kitchen preparations of milk,<note n="†" place="bottom">"Infancy and childhood demand thin, copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous nouriſhing aliment."

So that almoſt two thirds of the children born in London and its environs, become loſt to ſociety, and more than three-fourths of theſe die under <hi>two</hi> years of age. This proves how ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous a period that of infancy is in this country; and I am ſorry there is ſo much reaſon to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, that the want of air, exerciſe, and a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per diet, has added, unneceſſarily, to its dangers; there being no ſuch mortality in barbarous nations, whoſe inhabitants live in a ſtate of nature, or in any part of the known world, amongſt other young ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals. Although theſe, and other calculations I have ſeen, ſhould be found ever ſo accurate, it is a pleaſant reflection, (to whatſoever the circumſtance may be owing) that ſince the time they were taken, the proportion of deaths at the early period above alluded to, has been very conſiderably decreaſing; and the writer has noticed that for the laſt three years the average of deaths according to theſe bills has not been more than <hi>ſix</hi> in <hi>ſixteen.</hi>

Before I cloſe this head of the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of children, perhaps the moſt import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant of all, I ſhall point out the moſt ſuitable diet under the different complaints to which they are moſt liable. And after the hints that have been thrown out through the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part of this work, I need only obſerve, for the ſake of thoſe who are unacquainted with diſeaſes, that as light a diet as is poſſible is uſually called for when a child is unwell, let the diſorder be almoſt whatever it may. If a fever ſhould accompany it, the child will require ſtill leſs food than in any other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, but plenty of drinks; which may alſo be ſo calculated as to furniſh nearly as much nouriſhment as the infant will require, and may in ſummer-time be given cold. Such are barley-water, water in which a cruſt of bread has been boiled, or if a purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing attends, rice-water, and a drink made of hartſhorn ſhavings, with a little baked flour in it. In this complaint, wherein more nouriſhment is required to ſupport the child under it, baked flour mixed up with boiled milk, (as mentioned under the article of purging) is admirably calculated both as a proper diet and medicine; and if kept in a dry place, may be preſerved fit for uſe for a
<pb n="378" facs="unknown:026291_0392_0FCFA6009840CD20"/>
conſiderable time. For the like complaint, the food directed by Dr. Smith is very well adapted, and will afford a little variety. He orders a table-ſpoonful of ground rice to be boiled with a little cinnamon, in half a pint of water, till the water is nearly conſumed; a pint of milk is then to be added to it, and the whole to ſummer for five minutes: it is afterwards to be ſtrained through a lawn ſieve, and made palatable with a little ſugar. In this way, or joined with baked flour, as mentioned above, milk may gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally be made to agree perfectly well even when the bowels are purged; and when it does ſo, proves exceedingly nouriſhing. Should it chance to diſagree, owing to an acidity in the firſt paſſages, good beef-broth ought to be made trial of, which may be thickened with baked flour, inſtead of bread, and makes a very pleaſant, as well as anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aceſcent diet.</p>
            <p>Perhaps much more has been ſaid on the ſubject of acidity, by ſome writers, then real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ought to have been, or it may at leaſt be ſuſpected, that a proper attention has not been paid to the peculiar circumſtances of infants, who are all much diſpoſed to it. Acidity is probably rather an effect, than the firſt cauſe of the diſorders of infants; though there is no doubt, that their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints are afterwards aggravated by an abounding acid; or rather, probably, from
<pb n="379" facs="unknown:026291_0393_0FCFA5FF15CB3940"/>
this natural acid becoming morbidly acrid, through its being accidentally confined in the firſt-paſſages. Nature, however, deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the food of infants to be aceſcent, and and till the body be diſordered, and digeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hurt from one cauſe or other,<note n="*" place="bottom">Such cauſe, it has been obſerved, is very gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally an over quantity of food, of heavy and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtible diet; which, indeed, prove a more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent occaſion of acidity, than any thing elſe.</note> this qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of their food is not likely to be very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious to them. It is true, indeed, that as any ſimilar complaints in adults, who feed on different diets, will, <hi>caeteris parihus,</hi> have their varieties, and each have ſome relation to the different qualities of their food; ſo it is not to be wondered at, that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of infants ſhould be attended with wind and other marks of acidity, which in adults are the leaſt hurtful of all; and are, indeed, pretty eaſily corrected in children. When they are much troubled with wind, therefore, it cannot be wrong to mix ſome carminative ſeeds, or the waters diſtilled from them, now and then, with their food,<note n="†" place="bottom">Though ſuch an occaſional addition to their food is often exceedingly uſeful, I cannot help ſpeaking againſt its being made a conſtant practice, by which children not only ſuffer when by accident, or abſence from home, it has been neglected, but it deſtroys the very deſign with which it was uſed, by the ſtomach becoming accuſtomed to it.</note> ſuch as ſweet fennel, or cardamon ſeeds,
<pb n="380" facs="unknown:026291_0394_0FCFA5FCDFD0BEB0"/>
bruiſed very fine; but dill-water is that I have uſually recommended, and being a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid, is always ready to be added to the food, without loſs of time.</p>
            <p>Children, however, become leſs ſubject to wind and hurtful acidities as they grow older, and the ſtomach gets ſtronger, as it is called. But ſhould theſe complaints, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, continue obſtinate, a little fine powder of camomile flowers, mixed in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and warmed with a little ginger, will prove exceedingly bracing to the ſtomach and bowels, and render them leſs diſpoſed to acidity. Exerciſe alſo, according to the age and ſtrength, is a grand preſervative and remedy, and eſpecially making infants break wind after ſucking or feeding. And this may generally be effected, as every nurſe knows, by raiſing the infant up, and gently tapping it on the back, or rubbing its ſtomach, before it be lain down in the cradle to ſleep.</p>
            <p>I ſhall only add farther, that when milk is frequently thrown up curdled, a little pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared oyſter-ſhell powder may be added to it, or a very ſmall quantity of almond-ſoap, or of common ſalt,<note n="*" place="bottom">It is a very great miſtake, though a common one, to imagine that ſalt will diſpoſe to the ſcurvy. This miſtake is founded upon the bad effects of the long uſe of ſalted meats; but ſalt taken with freſh meats is quite a different thing. And I ſhall juſt remark, that ſalt and water is one of the beſt lotions for the mouth, and preſervative from the tooth-ach, and alſo makes an excellent waſh for the face; which will remove ſome kind of pimples without any riſk of injury to the conſtitution.</note> which will not at all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure
<pb n="381" facs="unknown:026291_0395_0FCFA5FAF20C83E8"/>
the flavor, and will prevent this change happening too ſoon in the ſtomach.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now cloſe this head, with ſome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations relating to wet-nurſes and to weaning.</p>
            <p>The firſt and eſſential point in a wet-nurſe is doubtleſs, that her milk be good, to which end it is neceſſary ſhe be healthy and young, her bowels rather coſtive than other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; and not of weak nerves, nor diſpoſed to menſtruate whilſt ſhe gives ſuck. The chief marks of good milk, are, its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thin, of a bluiſh colour, rather ſweet, and in great quantity; and if under ſix months old, it is, doubtleſs, an advantage. Her nipple ought to be ſmall, but not ſhort, and the breaſt round and prominent. She ought to have good teeth, at leaſt, her gums ſhould be ſound, and of a florid co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. She muſt be perfectly ſober, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther averſe from ſtrong liquors; which young and healthy people ſeldom need in order to their having plenty of milk. She ſhould be cleanly in her perſon, good-tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered, careful, fond of children, and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the night, or at leaſt, not liable to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<pb n="382" facs="unknown:026291_0396_0FCFA6DC4E3AB728"/>
in her health from being robbed of her ſleep. And I cannot help adding here, that ſhe ought not to be diſpoſed to preſcribe medicines; otherwiſe ſomething improper can ſcarcely fail at one time or other to be adminiſtered, and perhaps to the no ſmall injury of the child.</p>
            <p>Previous to the obſervations I have to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer on the head of weaning infants, it may not be amiſs to drop a few words on the proper diet for wet-nurſes. And here, an invariable attention ſhould be paid to natural conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and habit. Due allowance being made for theſe, it may be ſaid, that milk, broth, and white ſoups, plain puddings, fleſh meats of eaſy digeſtion, and a due mixture of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables, with plenty of diluting drinks, and ſuch proportion of more generous liquors, (ſpirits excepted) as the variety of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances ſhall direct, will be a proper diet for ſuckling women. Reſpecting vegetables par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, the ſtricteſt regard ſhould be had to conſtitution and habit. Wherever vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables, or even acids, uniformly agree with the ſuckling parent or nurſe, I believe a healthy child will never ſuffer by their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of them, but on the contrary, the milk being thereby rendered thin and cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, will prove more nouriſhing and ſalutary, in conſequence of being eaſier of digeſtion.</p>
            <p>The proper age for weaning a child is to be gathered from the particular circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="383" facs="unknown:026291_0397_0FCFA6D964443DA0"/>
attending it. The child ought to be in good health, eſpecially in regard to its bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, and doubtleſs, ought firſt to have cut, at leaſt four of its teeth. This ſeldom takes place till it is about a twelve-month old; and it may be obſerved, that healthy women who ſuckle their own children, and take proper exerciſe, do not uſually become preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant again in leſs time. We ſhall not be very wide of the matter, therefore, if we ſay that children in general ought not to be weaned much earlier than this; making proper allowances, however, for all juſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions to general rules.<note n="*" place="bottom">Aſtr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>c adviſes children to be ſuckled till they are two years old; but, I think, without giving any ſufficient reaſons.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Any preparation for weaning is general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly needleſs, and eſpecially that of feeding children before-hand, though made a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon excuſe for ſtuffing them whilſt at the breaſt, with indigeſtible food. I have ſeen many mothers needleſsly torturing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the fear of their children being weaned with difficulty, becauſe they could not get them to feed when eight or ten months old, and ſtill at the breaſt; but I have always found ſuch children wean, and feed juſt as well as others, when once taken wholly from it. I, therefore, never have any fear in that reſpect, and ſhould be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
<pb n="384" facs="unknown:026291_0398_0FCFA6D800C2A808"/>
if any thing I can ſay from experience, may be the means of leſſening the trouble of parents on this occaſion, as well as coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teracting, if poſſible, a ſentiment encouraged by ſeveral writers, which has, I believe, no real foundation in fact, but has too often been productive both of much inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and miſchief. But I do not by this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to ſay, that a child of eight or ten months old would be injured, or often-times not benefited, by a little food once a day of a more ſolid nature than the breaſt-milk, as indeed I have intimated before; but when children happen to be weaned much earlier, and are fed almoſt from the birth merely with that view, (which is often the caſe) they may be eſſentially injured by it.</p>
            <p>When the weaning is once entered upon, a great part of their food ought ſtill to be of milk, with puddings, broths, and but little meat; and they ſhould never be fed, or even ſuffered to drink in the night, from the firſt; ſuppoſing them to be weaned at a proper age. The mere giving them drink, even only a few nights, creates the pain and trouble of two weanings inſtead of one, and if it be continued much longer, it not only breaks the reſt, but the child will acquire a habit of being fond of drinking; the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of which very often is a large belly, weak bowels, general debility, lax joints, and all the ſymptoms of rickets. The
<pb n="385" facs="unknown:026291_0399_0FCFA6D65261FA78"/>
child need only to be fed the laſt thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the nurſe goes to bed, which may be generally done without waking it: and whilſt the child ſeems to enjoy this ſleepy meal, it becomes a moſt pleaſant employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the nurſe, and much more to a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, from obſerving <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>AFTER what has been already advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on this article, under the head of their complaints, it will be neceſſary only to obſerve, that healthy children ſleep a great deal for the firſt three or four days after they are born, probably from having been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly accuſtomed to it. They ought not, however, to be ſuffered to continue this ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit in the day time, but ſhould be gradually broken of it, and indeed if not indulged, they will not be ſo much diſpoſed to ſleep as is generally imagined, and will therefore take more reſt in the night, which is mutually beneficial to the child and the mother; who, eſpecially if ſhe ſuckles, will be the leſs diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed, at a time when ſhe herſelf particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly requires this refreſhment.</p>
               <p>Therefore, when infants are ſleepleſs in the night, they ſhould be kept more awake,
<pb n="386" facs="unknown:026291_0400_0FCF89A5586F95B0"/>
and have as much exerciſe as poſſible in the day time, which though they be ever ſo young may be pretty conſiderable, (as will be directed more at large in its place,) by playing with them, or dandling on the knee, and otherwiſe amuſing them; and when older by every kind of exerciſe they can bear. The child, if healthy, will ſoon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract a habit of being very much awake while it is light, through that lively and reſtleſs ſpirit peculiar to infancy, and by this means, another evil will be much avoided, that of often laying a child down to ſleep in the day time, for hours together, loaded with a thick dreſs, and covered beſides with heavy clothes in a ſoft bed, or the cradle.</p>
               <p>But though I am confident theſe cautions will have their uſe, I am equally ſatisfied that many children have much leſs ſleep than they require, as I ſhall have occaſion pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to notice; but then this deficiency is chiefly in the night, and is often the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of ſome complaints which the child labours under. Upon theſe, however, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient has already been ſaid in the former part of this work, to which therefore the reader is referred.</p>
               <p>Before I quit this article, it may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked, that the cuſtom of conſtantly plac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing infants on their backs, whether in the cradle or bed, is very improper: for by

this means, the ſuperfluous humour ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the mouth, which, in the time of teeth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eſpecially, is very conſiderable, cannot be freely diſcharged, and muſt fall down into the ſtomach, where its abundance occaſions various diſorders. Infants ſhould there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be frequently laid on their ſides, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly the right, as favourable to the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach getting eaſily rid of its contents; to which ſide alſo children, when ſtrong enough, will inſtinctively turn, if not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by the weight or confinement of their own clothes, or thoſe of the cradle or bed. The chief apology, for all which, is a fear of the infant's falling, or turning on its face; but this is rather an apology for the neglect of that neceſſary attention to chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, which whenever, it can be command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhould never be ſpared them.</p>
               <p>It only remains, under this article, to ſay ſomething of the Cradle, which moſt wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters have ſpoken againſt. I believe, there is no doubt but the cuſtom of laying chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren down awake, and rocking them in a cradle in the day time, or at ſeven or eight o'clock in the evening, when they are to go into their night's ſleep, as it is called, may be an occaſion of making them more wakeful in the night, or at leaſt may may cauſe them to expect that kind of motion whenever they awake. But yet I cannot help thinking, there is ſomething ſo
<pb n="388" facs="unknown:026291_0402_0FCFA6D36CFE95D0"/>
truly natural, as well as pleaſant, in the wavy motion of a cradle, (when made uſe of at proper times) and ſo like that children have been uſed to before they are born, being then ſuſpended and accuſtomed to ride, as it were, or be gently ſwung in a ſoft fluid, upon every motion of the mother, and even during her ſleep, from the effects of reſpiration; that always wiſhing to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low nature as I do, I cannot, on the whole, but give an opinion rather in favour of the cradle.<note n="*" place="bottom">the objections made by ſome late writers to this ſentiment militate only againſt the abuſe of it, from any violent rocking; as though infants muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily be jumbled in a cradle like travellers in a mail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coach.</note> It is, at leaſt, among the little things in which we may harmleſsly err, and in which every mother may therefore be ſafely guided by her own opinion, or even by her feelings. And if the child in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of being ſometimes rocked to ſleep in the day time, ſhall expect it when it awakes in the night, it will not be very difficult to find a ſubſtitute for it; and indeed parents ſeem, as it were by inſtinct, to pat and gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly move a child, whether lying on the lap or the arm, whenever it appears to awake prematurely.—I ſhall only add on this head, what cannot be too often urged, that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever wakeful a child may be in the night, it cannot receive a greater unkindneſs than from the exhibition of Godfrey's cordial,
<pb n="389" facs="unknown:026291_0403_0FCF89BE2B0FC208"/>
ſyrup of poppies, or any other opiate, and given as they uſually are, to procure ſleep, not becauſe it is neceſſary, or proper for the child, but becauſe it is convenient to the nurſe. It were, therefore, a good rule in a nurſery, to forbid adminiſtering <hi>any</hi> kind of medicine without particular permiſſion. And in regard to watchfulneſs, as was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in another place, it is uſually a mere ſymptom, and ſhould be treated according to its cauſe; but in a general way it may be ſaid, that nothing can ſo ſafely and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally contribute to procure natural reſt as that exerciſe to be farther conſidered under the next head.</p>

               <head>MOTION and REST.</head>
               <p>IT is only the former of theſe that will claim much of our attention, as infants ought ſcarcely ever to be in a quieſcent poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but when they are aſleep; and happy for them, that active principle with which nature hath endowed them, is ſo vigorous and overflowing, that they will hardly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to it. Exerciſe, like air, is indeed of ſo much importance to children, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly be truly healthy without it; care only ſhould be taken that it be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſuited to their age.</p>
               <p>The firſt kind of exerciſe, it has been ſaid, conſiſts in dandling, as it is called, patting the back after feeding, and gently
<pb n="390" facs="unknown:026291_0404_0FCF89A106892C08"/>
raiſing the child up and down in the arms; taking care at firſt not to toſs it very high, infants being very early ſuſceptible of fear, and even capable of being thrown into fits by it. Another exerciſe adapted to this tender age, and of the utmoſt advantage, is rubbing them with the hand. This ſhould be done <hi>all over,</hi> at leaſt twice a day, when they are dreſſed and undreſſed, and ought to be continued for ſome time, being pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly agreeable to the child, as it conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly teſtifies by ſtretching out its little limbs, and puſhing them againſt the hand, with a ſmile expreſſive of the ſatisfaction it receives from it. Such gentle exerciſe may be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially repeated every time the child's cloths are changed, by rubbing the lower limbs, and every other part within reach.</p>
               <p>When children are older, their exerciſe ſhould be proportionally increaſed, and as has been obſerved, they ought never to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in a quieſcent poſture, but the arm that ſupports them ſhould be continually in ſuch motion as the nurſe is able to continue. For children, it has been noticed, delight to be in conſtant motion; and this exuberant ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity is given them for the wiſeſt purpoſes, and ought by no means to be connteracted. And I notice the mode of carrying them, becauſe I have ſeen children flung careleſsly over the arm in ſuch a manner, as neither affords a child any exerciſe, nor allows it to give any motion to itſelf; which a lively
<pb n="391" facs="unknown:026291_0405_0FCFA6D1F0517608"/>
child will always endeavour to do. And, indeed, the manner of carrying an infant, is of more importance than is generally ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, for from it, the child will contract a habit, good or bad, that it will not readily give up, and may be as much diſpoſed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come rickety by improper management in the arms, as if it were lying wet in the cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle; the ill effects of which have been point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out already.</p>
               <p>Much as there has been ſaid on this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, I cannot ſuffer it to be cloſed without dropping a hint or two with a peculiar re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to <hi>females;</hi> upon whom beſide every infirmity common to the other ſex, is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the painful taſk of child-bearing. It is the benefit of the lower claſs of people, indeed, that I have here principally in view; though the caution is not utterly unneceſſary elſewhere.—The many diſtreſſing, and ſometimes fatal labours I have been witneſs to, have led me to regard with a kind of horror a rickety, diſtorted female infant, whoſe parents or nurſe's neglect, or igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, is heaping up for it additional ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and dangers, to thoſe which are great enough under every advantage that art, and good health contribute.</p>
               <p>From the age of two years therefore, or rather earlier, this care is eſpecially called for, and beſide every caution already point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, lays a ſtrict prohibition on girls be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuffered to <hi>ſit,</hi> for hours together, on a

low ſeat, whereby that aſſemblage of bones, called the <hi>pelvis,</hi> or baſin, is preſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the lower extremities and the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior part of the back bone, and is made to grow out of its natural form. The conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of this change of figure, if it be any wiſe conſiderable, cannot fail to be produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of increaſed pain and dangers in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turition, frequently equally fatal both to the parent and her offspring.</p>
               <p>I am aware, that many poor people are not in a ſituation to give their children all the exerciſe they require; they may, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſuffer them to afford as much as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to themſelves, by allowing them to <hi>crawl</hi> about on the floor, near an open window or door, inſtead of compelling them to lie on their back, or to ſit upright, pinned in a chair; the ill-conſequences of which are ſo exceedingly evident.</p>
               <p>It is hoped no apology may be thought neceſſary for theſe obvious remarks, ſince no pains ſhould be thought too great if they may prevent the evils here pointed out, nor can too much be ſaid to inculcate good nurſing (and eſpecially exerciſe) which is alone adequate thereto.<note n="*" place="bottom">A proper attention to theſe articles has been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to be of ſo much importance, that the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent Governors of the Britiſh Lying-in hoſpital, have lately given orders, that ſome brief Directions on theſe heads ſhould be drawn up, and given to every mother, on her leaving that Charity.</note>

It may be a proper inquiry in this place, at what age children ſhould be put on their feet, a point on which people have differed conſiderably; but I apprehend nothing more is required than to follow nature, whoſe progreſs is always gradual, as our imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of her ſhould be, and we ſhall then ſeldom run very wide of her intention. If we take notice of a healthy child, it is, as has been ſaid, always in motion, and as ſoon as it gets ſtrength, it will ſupport itſelf by the help of its hands and feet, and will crawl about wherever it is permitted. From this exerciſe, it will ſoon acquire an increaſe of ſtrength, and whenever it is upheld by the arms, and diſentangled from the weight of its clothes at the time of dreſſing and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing, it will naturally walk up the waiſt of its mother, or nurſe,<note n="*" place="bottom">I cannot help taking notice here of an impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence on this occaſion, which it is well if it has not been prejudicial oftener than has been ſuſpected; I mean, that of ſuffering a child to crawl ſo high up the neck, as renders the mother, or nurſe, incapable of raiſing the arms high enough to ſupport it. For not only may a child be ſuffered to ſlip out of the hands, but the mother may be injured. I have felt much on this occaſion, from ſeeing tender and delicate ladies with their arms on a ſtretch, ſuffering a heavy child, perhaps with its ſhoes on, to crawl over the breaſts, diſtended with milk, and ſqueezing them ſo forcibly againſt the edge of the ſtays, that they have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times cried out from the pain, and yet not been able, at the moment, to bring the infant down into the lap.</note> and by its man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="394" facs="unknown:026291_0408_0FCFA6C9E82CED68"/>
of moving its limbs, and its bearing more or leſs on the arms, will ſhew what advances it has made. Whenever it is ſtrong enough, however, it will have attained ſufficient knowledge to walk by itſelf, and will never attempt it till it is fully equal to the taſk. It will then be perfectly ſafe to permit it to follow its inclination, at leaſt as far as the ſtraitneſs of its limbs is concerned; and I think I may defy any one to produce a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle inſtance of a child getting crooked legs, from being ſuffered to walk as ſoon as it has been diſpoſed to make the attempt. The miſchief is, we lead on children prematurely to the trial, by leading-ſtrings, goe-carts, and other contrivances, calculated only to ſpare idle nurſes,<note n="*" place="bottom">I cannot avoid once more riſking giving offence, that I may do every thing in my power to induce pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents to give the utmoſt attention in regard to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, for the want of which I have with much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern beheld ſome children of people of large fortune turn out as rickety as thoſe of the labouring poor. In ſome inſtances, I have been ſo ſatisfied this has been owing merely to a want of exerciſe, that I have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed ladies, that from the appearance and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the nurſery-maid, I was certain their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were not exerciſed ſufficiently; and have point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out the bad conſequences that muſt enſue. And where the advice has not been taken, I have as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly been conſulted ſome months afterwards, about the cold-bath, for children a year and half, or two years old, who have only been able to waddle acroſs the room, with their knees knocking together, and reeling at every ſtep, ſo as not to be truſted alone.</note> or what is really pitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="395" facs="unknown:026291_0409_0FCFA6C813489D70"/>
to allow poor people time to attend to other concerns, who are obliged to work for their bread. But where this is not the caſe, ſuch contrivances are unpardonable, and are the conſequence of ignorance, or idleneſs, which are productive of great evils; and then by way of excuſe it is aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, at what age a child may be put on its feet—A queſtion, I apprehend, that ought to be anſwered only in the manner I have done—<note n="*" place="bottom">I have ſeen a child walking alone before it has been nine months old, and ten months, carrying a heavy play-thing in his hands; whilſt other chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, rendered weak and rickety by miſmanagement, have been unable to go alone at two years of age.</note> Leave children to themſelves, and they will afford a ſatisfactory anſwer in time.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid, however, by a ſenſible writer<note n="†" place="bottom">Dr. Hugh Smith's Letters to married women.</note>, that children's legs do not become crooked by putting them too early on their feet, and aſks if any other animal has crooked legs, though they ſtand on them almoſt as ſoon as they are born. But the caſes, I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, are widely different; quadrupeds and fowls are deſigned by nature to be ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="396" facs="unknown:026291_0410_0FCFA6C691BBF678"/>
on their legs, and it is neceſſary they ſhould be ſo. They are accordingly calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated for it, their bones being ſtrongly oſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied from the birth; but this is, by no means, the caſe with the human ſpecies, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no argument can be founded upon it without conſiderable latitude, and making ſuch allowances for the different circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of children as have been pointed out. But if it is meant only to ſuffer children <hi>to feel their way,</hi> if I may ſo ſpeak, for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they will never deceive us, nor do I think their limbs ever become crooked, but by urging them to it by contrivances of our own, for which poverty is the only apology that can poſſibly be offered.</p>
               <p>A Note of Dr. Buchan on the ſubject of giving exerciſe to children, which ſome people from their poverty cannot ſpare time to afford them, charmed me exceedingly. The good ſenſe and philanthropy manifeſted in it, as well as a deſire of extending its uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful contents, will I hope be apology ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for tranſcribing it, eſpecially as it is at preſent ſo appoſite to my purpoſe. And though I cannot flatter myſelf that govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, however benevolently diſpoſed, will, or perhaps can, at this time, adopt ſuch a plan, either from his recommendation or mine, it is, nevertheleſs, in the power of people of large fortunes, both in town and country, to give it very conſiderable influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<pb n="397" facs="unknown:026291_0411_0FCF899E8E6D86F8"/>
eſpecially if the premium were made double for ſuch children as ſhould be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in good health. The Doctor's words are,</p>
               <p>"If it were made the intereſt of the poor to keep their children alive, we ſhould loſe very few of them. A ſmall preimum given every year to each poor family, for every child they have alive at the year's end, would ſave more infants lives than if the whole revenue of the crown were expended on hoſpitals for that purpoſe. This would make the poor eſteem fertility a bleſſing, whereas many of them think it the greateſt curſe that can befal them;" and I may add, I have known them expreſs great thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs when their children were dead.</p>
               <p>A very few words may ſuffice on the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of Reſt, the irregularities therein be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing far leſs numerous and important than in the former. It will be ſufficient to notice them in regard to the improper inducement of young children to continue in action after they feel themſelves wearied, and in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them out of their beds beyond a proper hour. Children in health never wiſh to ſit ſtill when they do not actually feel it to be neceſſary, much leſs to go to bed unſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably ſoon. But it is to remembered, that young people require more ſleep, and to be longer in a horizontal poſture than adults; for though they uſually riſe very early, they
<pb n="398" facs="unknown:026291_0412_0FCFA6C5518CDBE0"/>
get to reſt more than proprtionally ſoon, being diſpoſed to fall aſleep almoſt the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they are ſtill; and this is natural to them, and is one demonſtration of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of exerciſe.</p>
               <p>If I had not already far exceeded the bounds I had intended, I ſhould be induced to ſay ſomething on the Manner in which Exerciſe becomes ſo beneficial to children—I ſhall, however, juſt obſerve, that it tends to puſh forward the blood through the ſmall veſſels, and to unfold them in the manner nature has deſigned them to be extended, in order to promote the growth of the infant, whilſt it preſerves the blood in a proper ſtate of fluidity, and promotes both the Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and excretions; which are the next things it was propoſed to conſider.</p>

               <p>EVERY medical reader will be ſenſible, how greatly health depends upon a due proportion between the daily ſupplies, and the various diſcharges of the body: the latter will vary according to the diet, age, and particular mode of life of each in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual. The excretions of infants, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, inſenſible perſpiration excepted, are chiefly from the bowels and bladder; but the latter is not very liable to diſorders. It
<pb n="399" facs="unknown:026291_0413_0FCFA6C39BE4D6B0"/>
will be ſufficient therefore to ſay, that the retention of urine is chiefly ſoon after birth, and is uſually removed by applying a blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of hot water to the belly, and gentle rubbing with a little warm brandy, or an onion, and throwing up a clyſter; or ſhould theſe fail, the infant may be put up to the breaſt in a pan of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

This, if there be no mal-formation of parts, will generally produce the deſired effect in the courſe of a few hours; though caſes have occurred in which infants have voided no urine for the ſpace of four days, and have ſuffered very little inconvenience. Some of the old writers have ſpoken alſo of inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence of urine, ariſing from weakneſs of the ſphincter of the bladder, but I have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver met with it in the infant-ſtate. They preſcribe agrimony and myrrhe, and direct aſtringent fomentations of red wine to the belly, the <hi>perinaeum,</hi> or feat, and the loins.</p>
               <p>The preſent obſervations are therefore chiefly confined to the Bowels, which would call for a ſcrupulous attention in this place, if ſo many things relative to them had not been diſcuſſed in the former part of this treatiſe.

The ſtools likewiſe ought to be looſe, of a yellow colour, free from lumps, or curdly matter, and ſhould come away without griping. On the other hand, if an infant is brought up by hand, the danger generally lies in the other extreme, ſuch children being diſpoſed to be purged, and to have griping and ſour ſtools, from the aceſcent, and often indigeſtible nature of their food, eſpecially if fed by the ſpoon; and therefore require an early attention when their bowels are diſpoſed to be open, and their food to be changed, in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner directed under the article of Purging.</p>

The firſt Cries it makes we know to be ſo, and that children recover from the paroxyſms of ſome complaints (as was men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in regard to the Croup) by an effort of this kind.
