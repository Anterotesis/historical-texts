            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>Epiſtle to the GALATIANS, Chap. iv. Ver. 18.</bibl>
               <q>It is good to be zealouſly affected al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in a good Thing.—</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HERE is no Duty more needful to be ſtrenuouſly and univerſally inculcated, than what any Text conciſely, but em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatically, recommends; nor any Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, wherein I may hope to do it with more Advantage, than what now ſolemnly offers itſelf.—</p>
            <p>In diſcourſing on theſe memorable Words, I ſhall, <hi>Firſt,</hi> explain the true Purport of them; ſhowing under what Limitations the glorious Virtue, here en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join'd, is to be underſtood; and at the ſame Time proving that the Practice of it, as it ſprings from laudable Principles, and is manag'd by a right Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, is truly a religious, as well as civil Duty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ſhall demonſtrate from ſome Inſtances, of <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Hiſtory chiefly, that in Proportion as this Queen of Virtues was more or leſs aſſerted, cheriſh'd, and epidemically diffus'd, the Riſe and Progreſs, or the Fall and Declenſion, of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> State, and indeed
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:007574_0007_102D7BDF1914BEF0"/>of the moſt potent Empires and Common-Wealths, and conſequently of Arts and Sciences, may be trac'd and aſcertain'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I ſhall, as cogently as I can, enfore the Doctrine of this divine Precept, with a particular Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to my reſpectable Auditors, not only to each In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual, intereſted as a Member of the Society in the Welfare and Preſervation of his Country; but, with all Humility and Deference, to the <hi>Three Branches</hi> of it's Legiſlature; moſt of whom, I was, at a ſhort Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, inform'd, wou'd previouſly convene at this ſacred Place, to implore the Bleſſing of Almighty GOD on their Conſultations, for taking the moſt ſpeedy, effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, and ſalutary Meaſures to ſecure the public Peace, Honour, and Emolument, in this critical Juncture: And this I ſhall dutifully and conſcientiouſly endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to perform, by urging to you ſome of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Motives, that ought to influence a Chriſtian, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigate a Commonwealthſman, and animate a true <hi>Briton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> I am to ſet forth the true Purport of the Words of my Text; ſhowing what the glorious Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is, and under what Circumſcriptions it is here en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join'd; and proving, as it ſprings from laudable Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and is manag'd by a well-temper'd Conduct, that the Practice of it is truly a religious, as well as civil Duty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is good to be zealouſly affected always in a good Thing.</hi>—Which is as much as to ſay in Paraphraſe, —It is an indiſpenſable Duty, univerſally, and, in
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:007574_0008_102D7BE0E7041D08"/>courſe, obligatory on Chriſtian Converts under the Light of the Goſpel, as it was before on all Nations under the mere moral Guidance of Nature, (ſince it is abſurd and impious to maintain, that the Laws of the Former cou'd ever ſuperſede or contradict the genuine Dictates of the Latter, which they were intended to ſtrengthen, and give a higher Sanction to) on all, without Exception, obligatory; and that too, at all Times,—<q>To be cordially affected with a good Thing, in Proportion to the Object exciting this Affection, or the Exigence requiring it.</q>—Or, in other Words,—<q>To apply the Faculties of our Minds, and the Powers of our Bodies, with the prudential Influence of our reſpective Stations and Fortunes, for the Advancement of a good Cauſe, for obtaining, by honeſt Means, honeſt Ends, whether they regard a local and leſs general Welfare in an inferior De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, or the Utility of the whole Community in the <hi>higheſt.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>So, you ſee, Zeal, in general, is the grand Virtue here recommended by the eminent Apoſtle, not only to the Churches of <hi>Galatia,</hi> to whom he particularly addreſſes this Epiſtle, but to all Diſciples of CHRIST, whereſoever diſperſt, to whom he deſign'd his ſacred Writings ſhou'd be duly and impartially communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, in order to be tranſcrib'd, and publicly read in their Aſſemblies of Worſhip, for the Benefit of all Ranks of People. Nor did the mighty <hi>Saint Paul</hi> think it ſufficient barely to act as the Scribe of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> but he moſt remarkably diſtinguiſh'd himſelf in being on all proper Occaſions the practical and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:007574_0009_102D7BE2AC86BA38"/>Example of the noble Precept he delivers. No Difficulties diſcourag'd; no Dangers deterr'd; no pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Avocations diverted him (as with a generous Conſcionſneſs, but modeſt Declaration, he informs us), from the arduous Work of his Miniſtry; from ſerving the Cauſe of his GOD, his Countrymen, and Mankind. Hence it is, that he ſo ſtrenuouſly inſiſts on the full Exertion of all the adequate Ardour, which a good Cauſe calls for in Execution: All the Heroiſm, which Virtue glowingly ſuggeſts, or Chriſtianity inſpires. As the Practice of his Maſter's Diſpenſation was very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſtil'd a Warfare; what forceful Images, what bold Figures, does he borrow from the military Art and <hi>Roman</hi> Diſcipline, to train up his Pupils by the holy Exerciſe for glorious Exploits in the Combats they were deſtin'd to; for the various Lists they were to wreſtle in; <q>for fighting againſt Principalities and Powers; and the Rulers of the Darkneſs of this World; againſt ſpiritual Wickedneſs in high Places? They are commanded to put on the whole Armour of GOD: To gird their Loins with Truth: To aſſume the Breaſt-plate of Righteouſneſs: To ſtand firm in the Poſt of Honour: To inveſt their Heads with the Helmet of Salvation: To wield the Sword of the Spirit: And, above all, to defend themſelves with the Shield of Faith, whereby they might quench, or repel, all the fiery Darts of the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</q>—</p>
            <p>Again, in being obliged to propoſe himſelf, as a Pattern to them of Patience and Fortitude, while he induſtriouſly guards againſt Imputations of Vanity,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:007574_0010_102D7BE497D9C620"/>with what perſuaſive, what reſiſtleſs Eloquence, does this conſummate Orator (ſcarce leſs humanly learned, than divinely inſpir'd) inſinuate himſelf into the Hearts of his Readers, and captivate their Paſſions, while he convinces their Underſtandings? Such was this Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Providence for accompliſhing the moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Enterprizes; this <hi>Elect of GOD:</hi>—Not ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrarily ſo, but becoming his <hi>choſen Veſſel</hi> from the previous Diſpoſition of a good Heart to engage in a good Cauſe at all Adventures: And that he vitally and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately felt, what he wou'd proſelyte others to, we cannot doubt, when he thus expreſſes himſelf to his Countrymen, proverbially proud of the Origin of their Nation! "Are you <hi>Hebrews?</hi> So am I!—(And, by anticipating the Application of the ſubſequent Part of this Sermon, let me too ſomewhat abruptly ſay,—Are you <hi>Engliſhmen?</hi> Are you, my Hearers, <hi>Britons?</hi>—You are: All are: So am I!— And therefore, independent of my ſacred Function, I have a natural Claim to your Attention.) But, to proceed, <q>Are you <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> or of the Seed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bam?</hi> So am I! In Labours more abundant: In Stripes above Meaſure: In Priſons frequent: In Deaths oft: Of the <hi>Jews</hi> five Times receiv'd I forty Stripes, ſave one: Thrice was I beaten with Rods: Once was I ſton'd: Thrice I ſuffer'd Shipwreck: A Night and a Day have I been in the Deep: In Journeying often: In Perils of Water: In Perils of Robbers: In Perils of mine own Countrymen: In Perils by the Heathen: In Perils in the City: In Perils in the Wilderneſs: In Perils in the Sea: In Perils among falſe Brethren: In Wearineſs and
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:007574_0011_102D7BE6A8BAAA90"/>Painfulneſs: In Watchings often: In Hunger and Thirſt: In Faſtings often: In Cold and Nakedneſs: And (beſides thoſe numberleſs Things, that are without) that, which cometh upon me daily, the Care of all the Churches.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus equally from the Doctrine and Example of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> (without inſiſting on many other Scriptural Inſtances, no leſs pertinent) we may be ſufficiently aſſur'd, that Zeal, rightly underſtood and well-regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, is truly a Chriſtian and Social Virtue; not only ſpeculatively to be aſſented to by Reaſon, but incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent on the Votaries of CHRIST, to be carry'd into Act with Alacrity and Aſſiduity, as beſt may ſerve the meritorious Purpoſes, which are only attainable by its Aſſiſtance.—The Phraſe indeed, <hi>to be zealouſly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected,</hi> however obvious to all candid and ordinary Underſtandings, is often liable to be abus'd, and groſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miſapply'd by raſh and precipitate Men. It means no more than an intenſe Bent of Mind and vigorous Attachment to whatever we are engag'd in, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd about; and, like all other Paſſions, ſuch as Love, Anger, and the like, may be laudable or culpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; equally productive of the nobleſt Ends, or moſt ruinous Conſequences, according as it is kept within due Bounds, or permitted to ſwell to Exceſs; and its intrinſic Goodneſs or Badneſs muſt be determin'd by its Motive, Object, and Degree. Thus the Violence of this very <hi>Saint Paul</hi> for perſecuting the Church of CHRIST, before his Converſion, is call'd Zeal: The ſame Word which he uſes, for the Virtue he ſo highly commends in my Text; where he takes Care (as the
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:007574_0012_102D7BE876DE91E0"/>Mark and Criterion of Diſtinction) to direct the Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of our Zeal, by confining it to be employ'd always in a good Thing; for then only itſelf can be always good. It nearly behoves us then, that our Zeal be occupy'd rightly; otherwiſe it degenerates into wild Folly, Madneſs and Sin; and the more we are tranſported by it, the more Guilt we ſhall contract. To be zealous for the Honour of GOD, for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and Propagation of our holy Religion; for the Benefit of our Species, or the Proſperity of our Country, is no Doubt, of all other Things, moſt praiſe-worthy; though even in theſe Caſes our Zeal may be miſguided and ſadly perverted, and ſo loſe all its Value and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.—But, on the other Hand, Luke-warmneſs and Indifference therein, is certainly moſt baſe and unmanly in the Senſe of Nature, and, from various Authorities in the Word of GOD, moſt degrading and ſinful. <q>Thou ſhalt love the Lord, thy GOD, with thine Heart, with all thy Mind, with all thy Soul, and with all thy Strength: And thy Neighbour (in which general Word our Country is mainly included) as thy ſelf,</q> is declar'd by our Saviour to be the Eſſence and Sum of Religion, and to comprehend the whole of the Law and the Prophets.—That is,—All divine, ſocial, and moral Duties, perfective of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and preparative to our Happineſs. And here it is remarkable, how emphatically, and with what repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious Enforcements our Lord urges a well-grounded Zeal; excluding from it, leſt his Meaning ſhould be convey'd in too feeble a manner, all Coldneſs, Liſtleſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and vile Mediocrity. Indeed in all his Actions, in all his private Documents, and public Sermons, in
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:007574_0013_102D7BEA978F24A8"/>his Life, and in his Death, he diſplays, with an Ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy becoming the Captain of our Salvation, his Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, beyond all others, of this Virtue, ſoaring to all the warrantable and rational Degrees, to which it may be exalted. Nay, he exhibits it as the Teſt and Characteriſtic of his faithful Militants, his noble Army of veteran Martyrs and Confeſſors; and, we know, a Diffuſion of this generous Principle among them, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd them more than Conquerers in the midſt of Flames; till, triumphant over ten bloody Perſecutions of mercileſs Tyrants, they ſubdu'd all the Rage and Fury of Fiends and Men; of ſpiritual and incarnate Demons, aſſociated againſt them.</p>
            <p>Again, ſays our Redeemer, deterring us from an Abatement of true Zeal: <q>He, that loves Father or Mother, Brother or Siſter, Wife or Children, more than me, is not worthy to be my Diſciple:</q> And we may eaſily conceive, by attending to the true Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of theſe Words, that he means not hereby to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Ties of theſe ſacred Relationſhips, or in the leaſt to relax, or weaken them, when he elſewhere takes all Occaſions tenderly to ſtrengthen them, both as natural and poſitive Duties; but that, when any Concernments of an inferior Kind happen to come in Competition with thoſe of a ſuperior Importance, ſo as that an abſolute Adherence to the former cannot be maintain'd, without Renouncing the latter, then the higher Obligation muſt take Place, and indiſpenſably claims our Preſerence. Thus a well-regulated Zeal, without more ado, will dictate to us, that the Glory of our univerſal Father, <hi>who is in Heaven,</hi> muſt be
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:007574_0014_102D7BECCB03D300"/>nearer our Hearts, than our Affections to our earthly Parents, who are but his Inſtruments, and ſecondary Agents for our Being. Thus all, who enjoy the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Benefits and Protection of the Laws of a Society are ſtrictly and fundamentally bound to a primary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard for its Health and Safety beyond leſſer Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, perſonal Views, ſmaller Alliances, and the like: And if we wou'd deſerve for our Zeal to be ſtil'd, like <hi>David,</hi> Men after GOD's own Heart, our Love to the Community muſt ſurmount theſe, even as much as the Whole is greater than a ſmall Quantity of its Parts, or a Species of People more numerous than a few of its Individuals.</p>
            <p>Thus then the Flame of our Incenſe is never pure and acceptable, or ſends forth a ſweet Savour, but when it burns brightly, and unadulterated with ſmouldering Smoke; which a faint Heat, or Lukewarmneſs, chiefly Occaſions. Its Fewel too muſt be laſting and perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent; not apt to blaze out too fiercely, and after a tranſient Violence expire, <hi>like Thorns under a Pot,</hi> as the Pſalmiſt expreſſes it. In ſhort, we muſt uſe the moſt prudential Caution to ſteer in the golden Medium between the Extremes of intemperate Fury, in a good Cauſe, and an almoſt creeping, grovelling, and ſordid Inſenſibility, on the other. While a Bigot in every light is odious; a meer moderate Lover of his Country (eſpecially when Danger threatens it ever ſo remotely, and much more when it nearly approaches), is a moſt deteſtable and ridiculous Monſter. If we wou'd eſcape the Imputation of the former, we ſhou'd meditate on the Words of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans:
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:007574_0015_102D7BEE9AFF31A0"/>I hear them Record, that they have a Zeal for GOD, but not according to Knowlege.</hi> Or if we wou'd not be ſtigmatiz'd for being as deſpicable as the latter, let us animadvert on what the Angel in the Revelations commands <hi>St. John</hi> to write to the Churches of <hi>Laodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cea.—I know thy Works, that thou art neither cold, nor hot: I wou'd that thou wert either cold, or hot: So then becauſe thou art lakewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will ſpue thee out of my Mouth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We live, alas! in an Age, when true public Spirit (by which I underſtand the moſt elevated Species of the Zeal here prov'd a Chriſtian Duty), is very languid and defective; where too often, a Spirit of Faction, the very Reverſe of it, uſurps its Place, and arrogates with loud and awkward Inſolence its ſacred Form; but the ſpecious Mask may be eaſily ſtripp'd off, and its native Deformity detected by a little more than ordinary In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection into its bluſtering Pretences and Ends of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; which will be all found in a little Time to ſpring from, or center in, ſome low, mercenary, and contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed View. We too frequently obſerve it invidiouſly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing the Wheels of Government, and embroiling a State, where it is not admitted to an immediate Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of Power: Induſtriouſly watchful to detect and aggravate little Errors in an Adminiſtration, for the Gratification of private Spleen and Revenge; employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its clamourous Rhetoric to render itſelf of Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; and pertinaciouſly maintaining its Importance, by inſtilling Jealouſies, ſomenting Diſcontents, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting popular Applauſe from the giddy <hi>Vulgar,</hi> great and ſmall, with ſtrong Paſſions and weak Brains. But
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:007574_0016_102D7BF06A37ADA0"/>all this argues a Diſingenuity, and Infirmity of Mind, and is no more to be compar'd to public Spirit, than the unnatural Tumours in a dropſical Perſon, to the juſt Proportions of a ſound and healthful Body.</p>
            <p>In fine, while I really think there is more Danger to be apprehended from a ſhameful Deficiency in this all-animating Principle, than from its Excels and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dundancy, I won'd have every true Patriot fix its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Boundaries in Reaſon and Conſcience, and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the ſierce, unbridled, bloody, and enthuſiaſtical Zeal of a thorough-pac'd Republican and deſperate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicide; of an <hi>Ireton</hi> and a <hi>Bradſhaw,</hi> from the inflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly honeſt, wiſe, and diſciplin'd Ardour of a <hi>Hamden;</hi> equally employing his Tongue in the Senate, and his Sword in the Field, in Defence of his Country's unalien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Rights: Of Liberty invaded:—Social Liberty! Mankind's original and univerſal Charter from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven!—<hi>Hamden,</hi>—I ſay; almoſt ſingly at firſt ſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the Torrent of Royal Incroachments and Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Oppreſſion; who, living, ſtood the Bulwark of the State; and, dying, fell the Emulation of Heroes! An Example, alone ſufficient to rouſe undegenerated <hi>Britons</hi> in any Time of public Diſtreſs (whether foreign or civil) into ſomewhat <hi>more</hi> than ancient <hi>Romans;</hi> as much <hi>more,</hi> as our Conſtitution in State is preferable in all Reſpects to their boaſted Republic; and our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Chriſtianity to the (almoſt-ſimilar) Idolatry of old, or modern <hi>Rome!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though much remains to be ſtill ſpoken to on this Head, yet left an intelligent Audience might think
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:007574_0017_102D7BF2E5650368"/>a farther Enlargement too great an Invaſion of their Time, I ſhall proceed to the next:</p>
            <p>And ſhow, in the <hi>ſecond Place,</hi> from ſome glaring Inſtances of ancient <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Hiſtory chiefly, that in Proportion, as this Sovereign of ſocial Virtues, public Spirit, or in other Words, the Love of our Country, was more or leſs aſſerted, cheriſh'd, and epidemically diffus'd, the Riſe and Progreſs, or the Fall and Declen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> State, and indeed of the moſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Commonwealths and Empires, <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman,</hi> and conſequently of Arts and Sciences, may be trac'd and aſcertain'd.</p>
            <p>After the Expulſion of the impious and idolatrous Nations, and the Settlement of the <hi>Jews</hi> in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd Land, purchas'd by a memorable Series of glorious Victories under their mighty Leader <hi>Joſhua;</hi> how ſoon did they ſink into torpid Indolence, and were lull'd into a baſe Security and falſe Confidence, by the bewitching Charms of the <hi>Syrens,</hi> Peace and Plenty; ſupporting themſelves rather by the Terror of their Name, than by any intrinſic Principle of national Stength, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Preparation? How ſoon did they forget the laſt, the dying, Inſtructions of their great Lawgiver under GOD, <hi>Moſes,</hi> manfully to defend the Country, which they ow'd to the Indulgence of Providence; that goodly Country, <hi>flowing with Milk and Honey;</hi> yet, take Notice, inferior in Situation and Fertility, (and, all Things conſider'd, in Climate too), to that, which we, of this delightful Province, from the ſame all bountiful Hand, now poſſeſs? How were they prepar'd to be
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:007574_0018_102D7BF4D3731870"/>ſent back to their <hi>Egyptian</hi> Taskmaſters; to ſervile Drudgery; to be <hi>Hewers of Wood, and Drawers of Water,</hi> to groan out their beaſtial Lives under the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of a <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> (the true Antitype of the <hi>moſt Chriſtian</hi> King, the moſt deſpotical, perſecuting <hi>French Grand Monarch)</hi> to be driven, by their Overſeers, like our reſtive Negro-Slaves, <hi>to make Brick without Straw,</hi> to erect a Pyramid, or a <hi>Verſailles,</hi> an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Monument of their own Subjection, and their Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant's Vain-Glory?—How quickly did their brutal Appetites yearn after their precarious Meals of ſodden Fleſhpots; for the edible Gods of their Maſters; and the Gods of their own Bellies; even Lentils, Leeks and Onions; which deſpicably and ingratefully they murmur'd for, in Preference to Manna or Quails; to Liberty and <hi>the Bread of Heaven!</hi> How ſoon by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viating from the Maxims, on which only their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Eſtabliſhment was to be confirm'd, did they fall under the galling and alternate Yoke of every neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Heathen Nation, adopting the Manners, and in Part the Religion of their corrupted and corrupting Conquerors; as we read in the <hi>Book of Judges;</hi> all the Chapters of which are only brief Annals of their Infatuation and Subjection; or of their Repentance and miraculous Deliverance under Heaven-rais'd Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, or occaſionally-ſelected Chieftains, according to their ſeveral Emergencies and Diſtreſſes.—Every now and then, ſuch a Leader was indeed requiſite! <hi>Such,</hi> as the Inhabitants of this Province have Reaſon to felicitate themſelves upon, in his gracious Majeſty's paternal Choice, or Approbation of our Governor, to conduct, either ſingly, or in Conjunction with other
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:007574_0019_102D7BF6A1678F38"/>Commanders, our <hi>own,</hi> and the Forces of the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous Colonies, in Aſſociation, on a concerted Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in our preſent Exigency, againſt the enterpriſing Foes of <hi>Europe's, America's,</hi> and the World's Repoſe; if he be enabled by the preſent (I hope and believe Patriot) <hi>Aſſembly</hi> to proſecute the Royal Orders, and his own generous Purpoſe.—A Gentleman, who (without a vain Compliment in the awful Houſe of GOD) has a real Right to a high Eſteem from you, both on Account of his Station and perſonal Merit; and whom it is the Duty of us all to regard, as not deriving his Preferments from Court-Intereſt, but as thus diſtinguiſh'd for known Loyalty, and military Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, which we cannot doubt, but he will now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ert to the utmoſt, if an ill-tim'd Parſimony does not ſtarve his Cauſe, and petty Diſſentions and Avocations from the grand Concernment, do not interpoſe to check his Deſigns, and prevent what his cool Deliberation, and natural Ardour, give us moſt rational Hopes he will have a main Hand in accompliſhing: The principal Merit and Glory of which, will redound to this Province, and more and more recommend its important Intereſts to the Mother-Nation, ſo intimately blended with her own; if our Contributions for the common Service be more chearfully given, or more ſpeedily rais'd, than thoſe of our Neighbouring Governments.—</p>
            <p>But, again, if we conſider the <hi>Iſraelitiſh</hi> Nation under their Kings, (whoſe Government they perverſely preſer'd to an Hierarchy under the <hi>King</hi> of Kings) to what can we impute the Train and Viciſſitude of Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, they by Intervals groan'd under, but to a
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:007574_0020_102D7BF8B30E8A98"/>ſtupid Dormancy, or Decay of this virtuous Zeal in themſelves, or their Monarchs? To this dire Source their Prophets unanimouſly aſcribe the Decadence of their State, and the various Judgments of GOD. Whenever any Degree of public Spirit reviv'd, as in the Reigns of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> moſt remarkably, and afterwards in thoſe of <hi>Aſa, Hezekiah, Joſiah,</hi> and a few Others; how did they attract the divine Favour, to the Confuſion of their haughty Enemies? How did the Almighty Arm interpoſe to ſave them in the Criſis of complicated Perils? The Almighty Arm, indeed; though not without their own Efforts! (For, they have a wrong Notion of the uſual Conduct of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence in ſublunary Affairs, who abſurdly ſuppoſe, that it never uſes, or concurs with human Abilities, Diſpoſitions, and Improvements, as Inſtruments to work it's Purpoſes!) How prodigiouſly did uſeful Arts then flouriſh: Witneſs that ſtupendous Structure, their glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Temple, ſo magnificent, ſo richly ornamented, as wou'd tire Deſcription? How muſt ſmiling Commerce have been extended, not only by the numerous Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vans that paſs'd by them to <hi>Egypt, Meſopotamia, Aſſyria, Perſia,</hi> and the fartheſt <hi>Arabia,</hi> but by Means of the much envy'd Ports of <hi>Eloth</hi> and <hi>Eziongeber</hi> on the Red Sea, the great Marts for the Treaſures of <hi>Ophir,</hi> and all the rich Commodities of the <hi>Eaſt-Indies;</hi> which drew ſuch a Maſs of Wealth on this People, while induſtrious and ancorrupted, (that is, while in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenc'd by public Spirit) that Silver once abounded ſo as to be accounted but <hi>as the Stones of the Street for it's Plenty;</hi> and Gold, Jewels, Spices, Balſams, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes, and invaluable medical Druggs, were tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:007574_0021_102D7BFA45AEB258"/>either by themſelves from their principal Sea-Town <hi>Joppa,</hi> or more probably in the Bottomry of <hi>Pheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> Merchants, through all the Coaſt of the <hi>Mediter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean,</hi> to the Straits of <hi>Gades,</hi> and the Weſtern Ocean; and we have good Grounds to conjecture that this ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally open'd, or vaſtly aſſiſted that immenſe Trade, by which the <hi>Sidonians</hi> and <hi>Tyrians</hi> were ſo early en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich'd and renown'd; and by which their ever-famous Colony of <hi>Carthage</hi> roſe from the meaneſt Beginnings to the ſublimeſt Pitch of earthly Grandeur, ſo as to contend for a long Time, and in the moſt bloody and conſumptive Wars, with the <hi>Romans</hi> themſelves, their only Rivals for the Empire of the then known World. By liſtening to the noble Dictates of this vitally active Principle, how did all temporal Bleſſings, as it were in courſe, accrue to <hi>Judea;</hi> and how did that minute Spot of the Globe, not half ſo large as <hi>Maryland,</hi> nor attended, as I hinted, with ſo many natural Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, raiſe and ſupport ſuch countleſs Myriads of People, as ſcarce any Hiſtory, without the Sanction of Inſpiration, cou'd perſuade our Belief of? Wonderful as this ſeems, it is to be accounted for from what I have laid down, as it's Foundation; even, from ſelfiſh Attachments to public Intereſts; (for <hi>ſelf</hi> and <hi>ſocial,</hi> if juſtly ſtated, will be found to be but the ſame Thing in the End, or concentering in one Point) by ſtrictly adhering to their Laws; by loving their civil and ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Polity; by a firm Union among themſelves; by a due Submiſſion to executive Authority; by an honeſt and vigilant Jealouſy of the ambitious Deſigns of turbulent Neighbours to diſturb their Property, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs their Trade; by a firm Reſolution to repel violent
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:007574_0022_102D7BFC19B9FBB8"/>Invaſions, and retaliate national Injuries; by manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and cultivating every Inch of their narrow Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, even the moſt barren Parts, Hills, ſtoney Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies and ſandy Plains, to the laſt Poſſibility of Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca; (the apparent Veſtigies of which Induſtry cannot eſcape a curious Traveller, as Doctor <hi>Maundrel</hi> aſſures us at this Day, in it's deſolate and miſerable Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) by judicionſly conſidering the Genius of each particular Soil; and by planting, or ſowing therein, whatever was moſt adapted to it's natural, or reclaim'd State; by encouraging Artificers of all Sorts, and employing their laborious Poor in various Manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and by opening their Hearts and Purſes libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, and by lending their Hands readily and without murmuring, to aid the Community on all Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to chaſtiſe the incurſive Heathen, and fight the <hi>Battles of the Lard.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>A free and mercantile People, who hear all this, muſt be cover'd with Bluſhes, or glow with Emulation at the firſt Recital!</p>
            <p>On the other Hand, what caus'd the general Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, frequent Captivities, and almoſt utter Exciſion of this devoted People, the <hi>Jews,</hi> but being deaf to the reiterated Advice, Threats, and Warnings of their ſeveral Prophets: In ſtupidly dividing the incommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicable Honours and Worſhip of <hi>Jebovah</hi> with the Calves of <hi>Jeroboam</hi> (who ſeduc'd ten whole Tribes to a final Revolt at once;) in bowing the Knee alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately to <hi>Baal,</hi> or <hi>Rimnon,</hi> or <hi>Dagon,</hi> or <hi>Aſhtoroth,</hi> or <hi>Iſis;</hi> and the Rabble of Gods and Goddeſſes of their Ethnic Neighbours; perhaps as numerous, and as much ador'd, as thoſe we find Sainted, and more than Half-Deiſy'd, in the long Muſter-Roll of a Popiſh Calendar; in letting Zeal ſtagnate by Inaction; or ſink into enervate Languer by relaxing the only Sinews of Power and Greatneſs; by a total Depravation of Manners: And in adopting Schemes diametrically oppoſite to general Felicity; while they ridiculouſly imagin'd, that the particular Proſperity of Families, or a narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-divided and partial Happineſs might continue in a weak and tottering Kingdom.</p>
            <p>'Tis true that after the Return of a Remnant of them from their Seventy-Year's Thraldom in <hi>Babylon,</hi> they cannot be juſtly chargeable with a ſimilar ill Conduct;

How ſoon did they relapſe, though not into the ſame, yet into the other equally deſtructive extreme of popular Folly? Read but their own <hi>Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> well-converſant with thoſe Times, and you will be abundantly confirm'd by what ſwift Gradations, they pav'd the Way for Extirpation, or total Diſperſion when they began to change a true Zeal into a falſe; when, by admitting Cabals and Faction, into their <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> and Councils, they ſplit into various Sects, and exaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated the divided Rabble into fanatical Phrenſy by the magical Nicknames (Sounds, without Ideas) of <hi>Phariſee, Sadducee, Herodian,</hi> and the like: For, as to the Meaning and Diſtinction of the Terms, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority knew no more of them, than many of our Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Subjects lately did what <hi>Whig</hi> and <hi>Jory, High-Church</hi> and <hi>Low-Church</hi> ſigniſy'd. Their crafty De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogogues and Ringleaders blew the Coals: The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flam'd Populace were ſet together by the Ears with a Jargon of hard words: The <hi>Church</hi> forſooth was in Jeopardy: The Court and Country were alternately in
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:007574_0025_102D7C01943E6F20"/>Fault, as the Tide ebb'd or flow'd: All Men were alarm'd, (Few knew why,) at inteſtine Danger, and laugh'd at foreign; being too eagerly occupy'd in domeſtic Diſcords to be ſufficiently watchful againſt formidable and ſurrounding Enemies, who were too wiſe to neglect the Opportunity theſe Diſſentions gave them of properly availing themſelves thereby.</p>
            <p>Thus either by Defect and Omiſſion, or by Abuſe and Tranſgreſſion in Degree of their Zeal or public Spirit, this Heaven-abandon'd People fill'd up the Meaſare of their Iniquity; and were permitted in their laſt atrocious Act to crucify their <hi>Meſſiah.</hi> And thus, in the Nature of Things, and without any abſolute Decree of GOD, they were ſelf-doom'd to all the Horrors of civil Butchery, and <hi>Roman</hi> Vengeance, with ſuch terrible, and accumulated Circumſtances of Fire, Sword, Peſtilence and Famine, as never before afflicted any other Nation, and does too much Violence on Humanity to hear, or relate.—This Good however may be educ'd from their Ill, that a vagabond Reſidue of them are ſtill preſerv'd in all Parts of the World to warn thoſe, they live among, if they wou'd eſcape their Fate, to avoid thoſe Stages of different Guilt, into which they deſperately plung'd themſelves at par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Seaſons.</p>

Let me therefore only curſorily glance at what the greateſt Sages of the two wiſeſt and moſt renown'd Nations, that ever aw'd and enlighten'd Mankind, have deliver'd as to theſe Points, <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> and <hi>Cicero; Thucidides</hi> and <hi>Tacitus, Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Pliny:</hi> In ſhort, the moſt famous Orators, Hiſtorians, Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers and Patriots have evinc'd that the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> ow'd all their Glory in Arts and Arms, not ſo much to other ſalutary Inſtitutions of their original Lawgivers, <hi>Lycurgus, Solos,</hi> or <hi>Numa,</hi> as to this one ſimple Principle of Public Spirit, or a virtuous and well-temper'd Zeal for the Honour and Welfare of their Country, being infus'd into and propagated among, all Ranks of their Subjects, with the utmoſt Care even from their earlieſt Inſancy.—This (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſome temporary Commotions, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily and frequent, will ariſe in free States, as the Excreſcencies of Liberty, or from the Want of abſolute Perfection in human Societies) I ſay,—Notwithſtanding theſe,—This ſole Principle render'd them invincible, conſer'd on them the two laſt of the four great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies foretold by <hi>Daniel,</hi> and immortaliz'd their Name.—Hence the liberal Sciences triumph'd, and the <hi>Muſes</hi> exultingly ſung: Hence <hi>Apelies</hi> touch'd the Canvas into mimic Life, and Marble ſeem'd to breathe from the forming Hand of <hi>Praxiteles.</hi> Hence the Works of <hi>Homer,</hi> by exquiſitely celebrating the Heroes of Antiquity, in Effect daily created new Ones, while a Transfuſion of their Virtues was felt in the Breaſt of every Reader, capable of being warm'd by his Sentiments and Numbers.

Hence too,— Laſtly,—the venerable <hi>Elders</hi> of a former Senate, but of another Stamp, diſplay'd an Example of truly <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Fortitude, that ſhou'd engage the Attention of the <hi>Repreſentatives</hi> of a brave <hi>Britiſh</hi> People, I mean, that of thoſe <hi>Conſcript Fathers;</hi> who, when their

            <p>But how did theſe <hi>ſovereign Republics</hi> ſuffer the Enſigns of Dominion to be ſnatch'd from their Hands, and all their Laurels to be wither'd?

Why, their own beſt Authors will unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly acknowlege, it was by ſtarting from the Principle, on which they were founded, and grew into Greatneſs. 'Twas this pav'd the Way for <hi>Philip</hi>'s dangerous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues, and <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Ambition. <hi>Athenians, Spartans, Thebans</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> were gradually prepar'd for Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, and by abandoning public Spirit, they became an eaſy Prey to the neareſt Invader at Hand, who had Power and Addreſs enough to ſnatch at, and ſeramble for it.

               <hi>Is it not now and always, good to be zealonſly affected in a good Thing, or Cauſe?</hi>—And what Cauſe can ſo ſenſibly affect us, as that of our Country? And to whom ſhall we have Recourſe for Relief, when it is menac'd by hoſtile Attempts, as at preſent, but to the <hi>Delegates</hi> of the Community and the <hi>Executive Power,</hi> with whom the Means of raiſing the Support, and the Methods of carrying it into Action are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted?</p>
            <p>I now addreſs myſelf with a faithful Boldneſs, but with duteous Humility and Reſpect, to each <hi>Brauch</hi> of our Provincial <hi>Legiſlature;</hi> whom in a private Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, as Gentlemen, Friends, <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> and Fellow-Subjects

            <p>An important Cauſe indeed renders the convening of the <hi>new Aſſembly,</hi> even at this rigorous Seaſon of the Year neceſſary; and its firſt Seſſion is open'd by a Speech, worthy of his <hi>Excellency</hi> (whom we are here to conſider as the immediate Subſtitute of the <hi>Throne)</hi> for a legal and competent Supply from them adequate to the urgent Occaſion, and the Abilities of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituents; in Order that he may immediately fulfil the expected Purpoſes (as I ſaid) of the late Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Commiſſion from his Majeſty; and uniting our proportion'd <hi>Quota</hi> of brave Volunteers with thoſe of other Colonies, propitiouſly begin his March to repel Force by Force; to puniſh a flagrant Infringement of the Law of Nations; to ſecure the exterior Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as a firm Barrier behind us; and to vindicate the juſt and ample Claims of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Empire; now, on all Parts, Northward and Weſtward in our Continent, as well as in our Southern Iſlands, nay, in <hi>Africa,</hi> and in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> too, manifeſtly inſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or audaciouſly invaded.</p>
            <p>It were a Preſumption deſerving your Indignation and Cenſure, to dare to point out to your Wiſdoms the Ways and Means, or any expedient needful to be us'd for raiſing the Supply in this preſſing Extremity.

            <p>Let me then conjure von to weigh the high Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of theſe noble Colonies, for your own Sakes, as well as on Account of your Mother Country; who, having been the powerful Protectreſs, and careful Nurſe of your Inſancy, has not remitted her parental Care, even when you are grown to a State of juvenile Vigour; and it would be equally ingrateful and ſhameful not to act in Conjunction with her other Offspring in your common Defence, but ſtill with childiſh Cries call upon her for further Aid, when you are at an Age, more than qualify'd to defend yourſelves; eſpecially as ſhe is loaded with an Eighty Million Debt, (beſides the vaſt annual Expences ſhe is at in maintaining, for <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty</hi> at Sea, a naval Force; and in ſupporting her other military and civil Liſts) a Debt, contracted for the Protection of her Laws, Liberties, and Religion, againſt a Succeſſion of <hi>Popiſh Pretenders</hi> to our Crown; and againſt their chief Patrons; thoſe very Foes, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable and inveterate, who now menace yourſelves; and who are purſuing her with their Malice in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moteſt Parts of her Dominions; never letting the Sun
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:007574_0032_102D7C0EE74A1B00"/>ſet on their Depredations; and wounding her moſt ſenſibly through your Sides.</p>
            <p>The firſt Principle of Nature calls on you, on the one Part, and Gratitude and Juſtice on the other, to diſtinguiſh yourſelves on this Occaſion, and rather to ſet an Example than to wait for one from your Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, by paying back chearfully, in a Mutuality of good Offices, and a generous Retribution, a ſmall Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a Pittance, of what you owe her for your preſent Subſiſtence, as well as your original Exiſtence. Let me tell you, my worthy Countrymen, the Eyes of your Conſtituents are now upon you, who as far as my Sphere of Obſervation extends, will ſearce applaud you at your Return to your ſeveral Counties for being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonably frugal, or too indulgent to their Pockets againſt their Inclinations.

The Eyes of your Siſter-Colonies are upon you, who will be agitated by Shame or Rivalſhip to take their Meaſures from your Pattern. Aſſume then, the Glory of making your Pattern the Maſter-Spring of their Motion!—The Eyes of your venerable Mother-Nation will be upon you, who requires and expects, that in Proportion, as her own inviolable Products, and your Staples of Trade and Intercourſe are recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally lucrative, you wou'd imitate her Parliaments in a ſuitable Conduct, when <hi>French</hi> Invaſions are threaten'd; and no longer be amus'd, like our Commiſſaries in <hi>Paris,</hi> by the futile, and time-ſpinning Wrangles, or

You ſhou'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, How well acquainted they are with the defence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Condition of our various Colonies, and that they are hence embolden'd to undertake theſe deſtructive Projects; that, while they are carrying on a Chain of Forts of incredible Length behind us, almoſt from the <hi>Tropic</hi> to the Polar Circle, from new <hi>Orleans</hi> and the Bay of <hi>Mexico</hi> to beyond that of <hi>St. Laurence</hi> North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and within a trifling Diſtance of our chief Places for the Fur-Trade at the Bottom of <hi>James</hi>'s Bay; that while they are ever and anon edging on us from the Weſt, and ſtriving to confine us to a comparatively<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narrow Slip of Land by hemming us in between the <hi>Apalachean</hi> Hills and the Ocean; that while they are laying the Foundations of a Monarchy, greater than the four ancient Ones together, and extend their enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Louiſiana</hi> in their impudent Maps and hot Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations to the very South-Seas, and perhaps to <hi>Japan;</hi> that while they are doing, or contriving to do all this, we lie expos'd to their Inſults and Depredations, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Fortifications, Magazines, and warlike Stores, or even a diſciplin'd <hi>Militia</hi> to defend us againſt any ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Hoſtility; ſo that if they were to take it into their Heads (which they are very capable of doing, even
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:007574_0034_102D7C12C49D2AE8"/>without waiting for a Proclamation of Was) to make a quick March upon this, or either of the two bordering Colonies, with but Two Thouſand Men of the regular Troops of <hi>France,</hi> attended with as many of their Woodrangers and <hi>Indian</hi> Allies, they wou'd find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to obſtruct their Courſe till the <hi>Atlantic</hi> Ocean ſtopp'd them; but won'd over run us at once, and with the ſame Rapidity and Violence that the back Foreſts ſometimes ſuffer, when at a general Hunting the Woods are ſet on Fire by the Natives. You ſhou'd conſider, that though <hi>the Zeal of their Houſe may often eat them up;</hi>—That though their Zeal, I ſay, may be too volatile frequently, yet our's for that very Reaſon ought never to be too Phlegmatic; that though they now and then overſhoot the Mark by too ſanguine Hopes and haſty Aims, yet generally their Projects are the Reſult of long and deep Thinking, and laid far in Futurity, whereas many of us ſcarce conſider even the preſent Time; in ſhort, that they firſt deliberate cooly, and then execute ſpeedily.—You ſhou'd conſider how much it is your Duty to have a watchful Eye on all known, and ſuſpected Enemies of the Government; to prevent the Poiſon of their ſalfe Rumours and ſecret Caballing from ſpreading among his Majeſty's good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; and to obſtruct as much as poſſible, by empower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Magiſtrates to act with Vigilance and Vigor, that Intelligence, which the Enemy hourly have of our Deſigns, and We rarely of theirs:—For it is melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly to think of what I am well-affur'd, as I am of all other Facts here ſet down, that they have a high Way of Information, often travell'd through from <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bany,</hi> and other Places of ours, to <hi>Montreal</hi> and
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:007574_0035_102D7C1494C012A0"/>the Parts adjacent. Every one of our Governments ſhou'd therefore offer Rewards for intercepting and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting through all their Shapes and Diſguiſes, thoſe <hi>Pretenſes</hi> that annually ſtroll down among us from <hi>Georges</hi> to <hi>Neca-Scotia;</hi> for, (to uſe <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Words to his Brethren in <hi>Egypt) Theſe Men are ſurely Spies; and by the Life of</hi> Pharoah, <hi>to pry into the Nakedneſs of the Land de they come.</hi>—You ſhou'd maturely conſider, what Advantages, by your omitting this Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity they will have over you next Summer, when they unite their Forces to oppoſe you and maintain their Uſurpations; that it is high Time to raiſe a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Force to give an immediate and deciſive Blow; and that to receive another Defeat, or feebly to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and fail again, wou'd be more fatal, than to ſit ſtill and make no Effort at all. You ſhou'd conſider indeed what their grand Schemes really are; no leſs, than to unite, by ſeizing on the vaſt interjacent Regions, their Northern with their Southern Colonies, their <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada</hi> with their <hi>Miſſiſippi;</hi> to ſix Garriſons on all the navigable Straits of the mighty Expanſe of Mediterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean freſh-water Seas, <hi>Ontario, Erie, Huron, Illinois,</hi> and the <hi>Superieur</hi> Lake; behind which there are others, that probably communicate both with <hi>Hudſon</hi>'s Bay and the Pacific Ocean; as theſe do with one another. You ſhou'd conſider that the great Object of their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Ambition is, to obtain a commodious Port on the <hi>Atlantic</hi> Main; (which their Engineers wou'd ſoon take Care to render ſtronger, as more important, than <hi>Louisburg</hi> is now by additional Works, and new Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries) that, cou'd this be done, it wou'd be the firſt ſtep to compleat their unbounded Hopes, and that the
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:007574_0036_102D7C16D2D4B978"/>Places, which preſent themſelves principally to their Ambition are the River of <hi>Hudſon,</hi> and the Bay of <hi>Cheſapeak;</hi> that their Deſigns were only providenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally fruſtrated on the former by the Diſſipation of their formidable Fleet under Duke <hi>D'Anville;</hi> by which they intended to have taken and fortify'd for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, our defenceleſs Town of <hi>New-York,</hi> at the Mouth of it; while at the ſame Time a Land-Army, rendevouzing then near <hi>Montreal,</hi> was ready to move down by the Lake of <hi>Champlain</hi> to ſurprize our naked <hi>Albany</hi> towards the Forks of it; and thus all Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication had been cut off between our Southern and Nothern Colonies for mutual Defence, and an Aſylum open'd for Swarms of Papiſts, Jacobites, Deſperadoes, Convicts, and fugitive Negroes, to have join'd them, at the very Time, when an unnatural Rebellion at home, promoted chiefly by the <hi>French,</hi> was gnawing our Vitals, and an expenſive War abroad was externally waſting us.—Had this Hell-concerted and Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſappointed Armament ſucceeded, and a <hi>Popiſh Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tender</hi> been proclaim'd as our King, you may better conceive, than I deſcribe, what direful Scenes of Blood and Horror, Proteſtants and loyal <hi>Britons</hi> had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volv'd in; nor wou'd any of our Settlements have eſcap'd ſome Part of the Storm, though they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in Length for full Fifteen Hundred Miles on the Coaſt, and contain, by the beſt Information I can receive, at leaſt One Million of Inhabitants: I Which, by the Bye, however, doubles the Number of the <hi>French</hi> on this Continent, even from their own exag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerating Accounts, though we reckon in all the <hi>Indians</hi> nationally blended with them, and their promiſcuous

Nor does it conſiſt in Numbers of Men, or Courage; in neither of which, we know, they are yet comparable to us: But in dextrons Cunning, Ambuſcading, poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Intriguing, ready Obedience to civil or military Command, and in a natural Vivacity and Alertneſs in Action, they certainly excel us; as they fatally do in a Knewlege of the Uſe of Arms; being all from their Boyhood train'd up to it, muſter'd and diſciplin'd by Veteran and <hi>European</hi> Officers; and, above all, in a Conſolidation of Intereſts and Councils, being firmly united, though ſo widely ſcatter'd, under one Chief in ſupreme Command, the <hi>Governor-General</hi> in <hi>Canada:</hi> Whereas our Provinces, though ſo happily located, are diſſeminated in Mind; and ſeldom can be brought to act with Unanimity.—You are therefore to ſupply this Defect, by which only deſpotic Governments have the Advantage of free States, with all poſſible Prudence, in your Negociations and Conjunctions with contiguous Colonies, that we may firmly aſſociate, without tedious Adjuſtments of trifling Punctilios, for common Preſervation: But moſt eſpecially it is now neceſſary, that a mutual Confidence be ſettled with
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:007574_0038_102D7C1A68063740"/>the Cement of fraternal Affection between the Legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative Powers of this Province; for where this Corner-Stone is wanting, we build in vain; and a manifeſt Tendency to Anarchy and Confuſion enſues.—If this is preſerv'd in your Debates, and thoſe of your neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Aſſemblies, no reaſonable Man (humanly ſpeaking) can any more doubt of a happy Iſſue to our glorious Undertaking, than of its Expediency and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity:—We are not only invited, but compell'd into it: The Enemy are at our Doors: They are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenching, and fortreſſing in our Borders: They have ſlaughter'd our <hi>Virginian</hi> Forces; and driven from their Habitations great Numbers of diſtreſt, outlying Families, and induſtrious Adventurers, who might o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, by rapid Progreſs, advance the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers and the Chriſtian Religion. They have intercept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our beneficial Southern Fur-Trade, and by the vileſt Artifices render'd us cheap and ſuſpectable in the Eyes of our ally'd <hi>Indians;</hi> particularly the <hi>Five Nations,</hi> ſome Tribes of whom have ſeceded from their League, and migrated to themſelves; as, if not more powerful Protectors; yet to be rely'd on, as more ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt Friends. They have perverted Multitudes of honeſt heathen Clans into <hi>chriſten'd</hi> Demons. Their <hi>Rome-imp'd</hi> Prieſts have refin'd ſimple Savages into human Tygers, and to enlarge their Creed have totally corrupted whatever they knew of Morals before.— They wou'd now by Preoccupation, in Order to ground a Right to future, and ſtill-growing Claims, engroſs that charming Country, from the Sources of the <hi>Ohio</hi> to its Conflux with the <hi>Ouabach,</hi> which is truly worth fighting for in a righteous Cauſe, and is compar'd for

            </p>
            <p>Gentlemen of both <hi>Houſes,</hi> As you are Guardians of the preſent Race, and Truſtees of Poſterity, ſtop in Time their Progreſs, ſince none know where it will otherwiſe End. O ſtop it in Time! Secure thoſe bliſsful Regions, as a Jewel of the greateſt Magnitude and Splendor in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Crown, to be worn for ever by <hi>illuſtrious Deſcendants</hi> from King <hi>George;</hi> and to be exhauſtleſs Reſervations for your own Children, when theſe multiplying Provinces are overſtock'd with People, as they will ſoon be from their natural Increaſe only. Remember the brave Atchievements of your Brethren of <hi>New-England</hi> in the late War: Think, how an Handful of undiſciplin'd Farmers, freſh from the Plow, took the Bull by the Horns, poſſeſs'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of their <hi>impregnable Cape-Breton,</hi> and, in its Rendition, as an Equivalent for all <hi>Flanders,</hi> purchas'd a Peace for <hi>Europe.</hi> Think on the native Bravery of your own Inmates; who, among the other <hi>Americans</hi> eminently and lately diſtinguiſh'd themſelves at <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagesa;</hi> and convinc'd the World, that <hi>Maryland</hi> produc'd a Race of Heroes from her Foreſts, whoſe Lion-like Fierceneſs, in the Front of Fire and Death,
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:007574_0040_102D7C1DCC0ABBB0"/>was only cenſurable for its generous Exceſs.—Think, that your Troops (if a <hi>General</hi> of Seniority is not ſent hither from <hi>Europe)</hi> will have a <hi>Chief</hi> of their own to lead them to Conqueſt; a <hi>Father,</hi> by his Employment and Inclination; who, by the previous Meaſures he has taken, the unwonted Intelligence he has obtain'd of the Country and Enemy, and his unweary'd Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to the Grand-Concernment in every Particular, has given us encouraging Omens of Succeſs, and that in his intended March and Attacks, he will obviate all former Difficulties, prevent future Miſcarriages, and revenge the Blood of our Countrymen, unprofitably ſhed!—O think of all this, and think (I repeat it again) that much Frugality may be ſometimes a Crime, as, in a good Cauſe, Lukewarmneſs is always one. Think, that a moderate Taxation now will be moſt certainly the greateſt Oeconomy, and the Means of ſaving very heavy future Expences, if the Foe by our Neglect ſhou'd grow too potent in our Frontiers to be ſoon or eaſily ejected!—I remember the Time (not many Years ago) when, in this Town, thoſe few Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, (among whom, it is known, I was one) who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd their Apprehenſions of <hi>French</hi> Attempts to make Settlements, where they ſince have done it to our Coſt, found their Predictions receiv'd with but ſlender Impreſſions by many Men in popular Eſteem for Sagacity. An Increaſe of Arms and Ammunition were then thought burthenſome and uſeleſs and Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions from <hi>Utopia,</hi> or the Moon, wou'd have been as ſoon dreaded; as from the Quarters, whence we are now moleſted! But let us avoid all Retroſpections in a Matter, that requires univerſal Amity and Concord.
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:007574_0041_102D7C21F5011F50"/>Let us acquaint ourſelves better with <hi>French</hi> Politics and <hi>French</hi> Ambition. The Hiſtory of every Nation in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> will ſhow ye, that their Monarchy has been graſping at ſupream Dominion there for near two Centuries; even at all, their <hi>Charlemagne</hi> once poſſeſs'd. <hi>Papery,</hi> too groſs, too affrontive to common Senſe, to be believ'd by their wiſe Men, is ſubmitted to as their main Engine of State; and ſo wou'd <hi>Mabometiſm,</hi> if equally and eſſentially ſubſervient to their grand Scheme; as we may well conjecture from their cloſe Connexions with their beſt Allies, the <hi>Turks;</hi> having enter'd into an Agreement, as it ſhon'd ſeem, to keep the <hi>Grand Saignor</hi> on the Throne of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> in Order to ſhare with him, ſome Time or other, the beſt Part of <hi>Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendom.</hi> Their Perfidy in ſolemn Treaties is a trite Proverb; and among themſelves they laugh at all thoſe, as incorrigible Dupes, who ſtill continue to truſt or believe them. Their Arrogance carries them ſo far as to boaſt that they can eaſily make up any Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune in War by their skill in the Cabinet, or at a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs. The <hi>Reaſon of their Kings</hi> is publiſh'd from the Mouths of their Cannons; and where their Clergy ſail, Dragoons more powerfully convert. What they are capable of doing this Way, let the terrible Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre of <hi>Paris;</hi> and, if poſſible, the more horrid Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Edict of <hi>Nantz,</hi> inform ye: Not to dwell on what you know from every Gazette, their preſent Barbarities to their own Countrymen and Fellow-Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in <hi>Languedoc;</hi> nor on their helliſh <hi>Cruſadoes</hi> of Yore againſt the miſerable <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> chiefly for not believing, that a Bit of Bread, to be chew'd, devour'd, and digeſted by a Rat or a Mouſe, as well as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves

Theſe, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, are the Foes you are to engage with; the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant Succeſſors of thoſe, whom your heroic Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors ſo often vanquiſh'd, plucking the Plume of Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph from their Creſts; and whoſe Capital Kingdom they more than once over run from <hi>Dan</hi> to <hi>Beerſheba!</hi> Turn over the Pages of your ſhining Annals, and while you read of what has been done in the Fields of <hi>Creſſy, Poictiers, Agencourt</hi> and <hi>Blenheim,</hi> tell your bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Hearts the ſame Blood enriches your own Veins, and enſures approaching Victory!

            <p>Under the public Provocations, which ſome virulent <hi>Papiſts,</hi> perhaps encourag'd by the Proximity of the <hi>French,</hi> have lately given, though condemn'd by their leſs ſanguine, and more diſcreet Partizans, I do not wonder that we are <hi>generally,</hi> becauſe <hi>juſtly</hi> alarm'd: But I cou'd wiſh, that the ſole Object of the preſent ſhort Seſſion ſhou'd be the neceſſary Supply for haſtening the Expedition, which ought not to be retarded by any other Avocation; for what is truly expedient may be ſometimes unſeaſonable, if it may be ſafely poſtpon'd to a ſucceeding Opportunity of more deliberate Enquiry. Then without Cruelty to their Perſons, or overſtraining the Laws, let us muzzle the <hi>Bear,</hi> or out off the <hi>Tyger</hi>'s Fangs, and take all ſpeedy, Parliamentary, and Chriſtian Methods for Self-Security. I am ſatisfy'd there are ſome <hi>Roman</hi> Catholic Gentlemen of Fortune and Family, both here and in <hi>England,</hi> who do not ſwallow implicitly all the Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of that Church, though they hold external Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with it; and the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> with whom the Miſſion of theſe Parts is ſolely entruſted, are too wiſely indulgent not to come to a Sort of Compoſition with
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:007574_0044_102D7C2727054200"/>Men of Senſe in thoſe Points, which they know how to ſlur over; and are aſham'd to defend, what they cannot believe themſelves, except to the Vulgar. Such Perſons, though they might in general reliſh an eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd <hi>French</hi> Religion, are not ſo far gone in Madneſs as to wiſh to live under a <hi>French</hi> Government.— However this be, it is an Article of my Creed as firmly believ'd as any other, that all Men have a natural Right to remain unmoleſted for Opinions, meerly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious, however abſurd in themſelves, or diſcordant with mine; but when theſe apparently tend to the Deſtruction of the State, and their Toleration becomes incompatible with it's Safety; then it is incumbent on the civil Eſtabliſhment, by the ſame Sanction of Nature, either totally to ſuppreſs them, or keep them under ſuch Reſtrictions of penal or preventive Statutes, as may be judg'd ſufficient for our preſent and ſuture Security.</p>
            <p>But leſt I exhauſt that Patience, I have, I ſear, too long try'd, I ſhall conclude all, with once more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploring you moſt pathetically to reflect, that you are <hi>Britons!</hi> A Term, that ſhou'd comprehend, in it's true Deſinition, every Social, every Chriſtian Virtue; and exclude from it's Idea all narrow Notions, meerly local Views, and mean-ſpirited Images.—All, who live under the Umbrage of old <hi>England</hi>'s Laws: All, who are ready to the laſt Gaſp, and to the laſt Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to defend the Acquiſitions of their Anceſtors In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry and Virtue in the <hi>European</hi> and <hi>American</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires of our common King; with their Lives and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, I ſay: Theſe, all theſe, give the only intallible Proof of their Right of Denizenſhip, and are true Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:007574_0045_102D7C28DB9101C0"/>and the legal Sons and Coheirs of their General Mother; while all they, who wou'd unhinge her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Appointments in Church or State, betray her Rights, or even ſupinely behold her Dangers, are not only Parricides, but <hi>Aliens</hi> too, though born in the Midſt of her great Metropolis.</p>
            <p>O then, as you wou'd deſerve that glorious Appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; as you are intimately concern'd in the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of the momentous Event, that has ſummon'd you now extraordinarily; as you are under the more peculiar Obligations of Honour, Truſt, and Conſcience, to promote the Happineſs of the Community; of which you are not bare Members, but Rulers and Patrons: As you will anſwer it to your GOD; your King; your Young and Noble Proprietary; and your own Conſtituents: O permit not the Zeal of a true Public Spirit to cool in your Breaſts; but on this, and all other, worthy Occaſions, improve it in yourſelves; kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, encreaſe it in others; and tranſmit the hallow'd Principle to your Children's Children; to lateſt Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; till only the Day of Judgment and the Kingdom of CHRIST put a Period to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Dominion in our <hi>New World;</hi> or till Time ſhall be loſt in Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity! And, For this you will be attended with public Prayers and Bleſſings upon Earth, as Univerſal Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors; and ſhine in diſtinguiſhable Glory hereafter, even as <hi>the Stars of Light in the Firmament of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, for ever and ever!</hi>—Amen!—</p>
