            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOUR piece which was printed laſt fall, at <hi>New-London,</hi> entitled <q>The New-Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment interpretation of the Old, relative to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant baptiſm,—written letter-wiſe to Mr. <hi>Iſaac Backus,</hi> occaſioned by his late anſwer to Mr. F—'s<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Mr.</hi> Eheuezer Frothingham, <hi>of</hi> Middletown <hi>in</hi> Connecticut.</note> letter,</q> has further confirmed me in a ſentiment which I adopted many years ago, viz. That a very great part of the controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, among good men, are cauſed by their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking each others ideas. But there are ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things in our dark world ſtill to keep them in theſe miſtakes, that nature is ready to ſay, 'tis in vain to make any further attempts to rectify them. Yet other conſiderations have induced me to make another ſhort trial, to ſhew you wherein you have miſtaken the ſcriptures, as well as the ideas of your friend, concerning bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,</p>
            <p>You tell me, that the thing which moved you to write againſt me, was my holding forth, <q>That in order to maintain infant baptiſm, you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrue and interpret the New-Teſtament by the Old, and not the Old by the New,</q> p. 4. Which you think is contrary to fact with regard to your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:012317_0003_0F8A206BF199E810"/>and you ſuppoſe that if we were willing to receive the New-Teſtament interpretation of the Old, we alſo ſhould ſee warrant for that practice; and you cloſe with giving public notice to me and others, that if we ſhould pretend to anſwer you and not attend directly to your <hi>ground-work,</hi> you ſhould probably look upon it ſo impertinent as not to be worthy of a reply, P. 71. I rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily join iſſue with you here, and deſire that all impertinences may be diſmiſſed from this diſpute.</p>
            <p>Let then the New-Teſtament interpretation of the Old be the ground-work of all our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings; and how do you take that? Why, in general you ſay, <q>There was a ſpiritual glory then in being, although veiled with a type. there was then the ſame ſpiritual good under the type, that there is now without the type. And all who did not ſtick in the letter, ſaw that ſpiritual glory, and embraced that ſpiritual good,</q> P. 7, 8. I ſay the ſame with all my heart. You obſerve that the covenant of legal ſervices and ceremonies, conſidered in themſelves, were weak and inſufficient to juſtify and ſave thoſe who attended them, unleſs they by faith looked to the end of thoſe things which were to be aboliſhed; and that the carnal Jews, who had no true faith to apprehend Chriſt in Abraham's Covenant, nor Chriſt as the ſubſtance of thoſe ſhadows, they terminated in the ſhadow inſtead of the ſubſtance, to their own deſtruction, P. 23.
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:012317_0004_0F8A206C752FB130"/>And you illuſtrate the difference between the right uſe of thoſe things, and the Jews abuſe of them, by Paul's familiar <hi>allegory</hi> of the <hi>bond-woman</hi> and the <hi>free,</hi> P. 31,—34, This was the ſubject of my ſermon, which, in its ſecond edition, ſtands pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed to what I wrote to Mr. F. and which I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly refer to, as what I deſigned ſhould be part of my anſwer to him, P. 80. And how came you, Sir, to write above ſeventy pages in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, and never take any notice of that ſermon, nor let the reader know that I agree with you in all theſe ſentiments? Indeed I am as far as you are from ſuppoſing that a man, who writes againſt another, is obliged to take notice of every thing the other hath ſaid; yet for him to commence a diſpute, and then recite a great number of truths, which his opponent holds as much as he does, without letting the reader know but that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies them all; this you and all men muſt know is not fair dealing.</p>
            <p>And now to come to the point in hand, you obſerve that in Gen. 17. <q>Circumciſion was inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted, and directions given for forming Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham's family into a church-ſtate.—Certain du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and privileges were annexed,—which were thankfully to be acknowleged and punctually complied with, until God ſhould pleaſe to add thereto more rites and ceremonies, or take them all away, which were meerly poſitive, and appoint new ones at his pleaſure,</q> P. 9.10.
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:012317_0005_0F8A206CFA4FF698"/>Theſe have long been the ſentiments of my heart.</p>
            <p>And you allow that if the words in Heb. 8.9. 10. had run in oppoſition to Abraham's cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, you would freely give up the point to me, P. 21. Why then do you ſtand ſtill to diſpute? Becauſe you ſay, <q>The words of inſpiration run quite another way, even to Egypt and Mount Sinai, therefore take notice of them again. I will make a new covenant, <hi>not according to the covenant I made with</hi> their fathers. But when? <hi>In the</hi> DAY <hi>I took them by the band to lead them out of the land of Egypt,</hi>
               </q> p. 22.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> I have often taken notice of this, and I deſire you to do it once more. That was the DAY in which God added <hi>more</hi> rites and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies to Abraham's covenant. He inſtituted the paſſover, with its various rules, and ſaid <hi>every man ſervant that is bought for money,</hi> WHEN <hi>thou baſt circumciſed him,</hi> THEN <hi>ſhall be cat thereof. All the Congregation of Iſrael ſhall keep it.</hi> Alſo on <hi>that day,</hi> and not till then, he gave orders for bringing <hi>ſtrangers,</hi> and <hi>all their males,</hi> both to circumciſion and the paſſover, <hi>Exod.</hi> xii, 43—48. And when the whole ſyſtem of ordinances and ceremonies were completed for that church in the wilderneſs, and the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant was renewed with the whole nation, (many of whom had not <hi>eyes to ſee, nor ears to hear</hi>) juſt before they entered <hi>Canaan,</hi> it was to eſtabliſh them for a people unto himſelf, and that he might
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:012317_0006_0F8A206DB51FAF88"/>be unto them a God, AS he had ſworn unto their <hi>father Abraham,</hi> Deut. xxix, 4—13. So that what was done when they came out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> at <hi>Sinai,</hi> and in the plains of <hi>Moah,</hi> was but the completing of that conſtitution which firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan in <hi>Gen.</hi> xvii; and a literal fulfilment of that promiſe to Abraham, <hi>I will be a God to thee, and to thy ſeed after thee.</hi> And ſince the Holy Ghoſt ſays, the new covenant is <hi>not according</hi> to that covenant made with their fathers, how do you dare to ſay, <q>The gentile church is grafted into the <hi>ſame</hi> covenant—as the Jewiſh church once ſtood in!</q> p. 50.</p>
            <p>I am ſenſible that this is the root of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy, and you obſerve truly, that one blow at the root of a tree of vile fruit, would do as much good as many againſt the branches, p. 52. But if inſtead of a vile root you ſhould be found ſtriking againſt the rock, you will find it much worſe than loſt labour. You know that infant baptiſm is not expreſſed in the Bible, but you ſuppoſe that when the head of a family believed, and was baptized, that he afterwards brought his houſhold upon his faith, and this is the root your cauſe ſtands upon; but the plaineſt precept for a new profeſſor of religion, to bring his houſhold into the church upon his faith, that we have in all the ſacred oracles, was given on <hi>the day</hi> that <hi>Iſrael</hi> came out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> and ſince the Lord ſays, his new covenant is <hi>not according</hi> to that
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:012317_0007_0F8A206E8E6BA680"/>covenant, and the main point of difference which he deſcribes is, that <hi>all</hi> who are in the new co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant ſhall <hi>know him,</hi> from the <hi>leaſt to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt,</hi> is it not ſurpriſing that you ſtand where you do?</p>
            <p>However, ſince you are ſo kind as to tell us what you think cauſes our miſtake, I have a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of making a little attempt to requite my friend in the ſame way.</p>
            <p n="1">1. You ſuppoſe that we had taken our prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples upon <hi>tradition,</hi> and when we came ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſearch the ſcriptures, we never took the <hi>ideas</hi> belonging to the <hi>words</hi> there uſed, p. 5. I return the compliment; for, as the <hi>philoſophy</hi> and <hi>vain deceit,</hi> after the <hi>traditions of men,</hi> which the Coloſſians were warned againſt, were attempts to ſubject them to <hi>ordinances,</hi> which by thoſe means were drawn from the <hi>handwriting</hi> which Chriſt had <hi>blotted out,</hi> and <hi>taken out of the way:</hi> Col. 2, 8, 14—22. So I think it is evident that you have not got ſo clear of thoſe traditions as you imagine you have. My attempt to explain thoſe ambiguous terms, which that deceitful philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy invented, and which tradition and not ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has handed down to us, viz. of Abraham's covenant being the covenant of Grace, and that believers now are in the ſame covenant, has car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried your mind away into ſuch treatment of your brethren, as would ſhock you in other affairs. Mr. F. had laid thoſe ambiguous terms as the
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:012317_0008_0F8A206F3B889DA8"/>foundation of his diſcourſe; and I obſerved, that in order to ſettle this matter it was needful to <hi>explain</hi> what we meant by them, and ſaid, <q>I fully concur with Mr. <hi>F.</hi>
               </q> that <q>ſince <hi>Adam,</hi> our firſt natural head fell from the covenant which he was placed in, the tenor of which was, <hi>do and live; tranſgreſs and die;</hi> the Moſt High has never come to commune with any of the race of <hi>Adam,</hi> nor to offer good to them, but only in the ſecond head, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</q> 
               <q>And if by covenant of grace, we mean the glorious plan of ſalvation, which was laid in the divine mind from eternity, and was diſcovered at <hi>ſundry times,</hi> and in <hi>divers manners</hi> to the <hi>fathers</hi> in the Old-Teſtament, and is brought in clear light in the New; and that one of thoſe <hi>divers manners</hi> was by <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s covenant: In this we have no difference. But if by covenant of grace, he means the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution</hi> and limits of the Jewiſh church, which deſcended in the line of <hi>natural generation,</hi> tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in with the parents all their natural off-ſpring, which is evidently his meaning; in this I cannot concur with him for theſe reaſons.</q> One of which is, becauſe, <q>The tenor of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s covenant enjoined conditions, and works to be performed by men; the neglect of which expoſed them to be <hi>cut off from their people,</hi> becauſe they had <hi>broken</hi> that <hi>covenant,</hi> Gen. 17.14.</q> therefore the <hi>letter</hi> of it was, <q>
                  <hi>do
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:012317_0009_0F8A207055AD58D0"/>and live;</hi> and the reaſon here given for ſetting of it aſide is, <hi>becauſe they continued not in it, and I regarded them not, ſaith the Lord.</hi> But the tenor of the new covenant is, <hi>I will be to them a God, and they ſhall be to me a people,</hi> Heb. 8.9.10."

You agree with me that circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion was a type of Chriſt's death, and of an inward change, p. 38.39. Well, <hi>Abraham</hi> had experienced the internal efficacy of theſe things before circumciſion was appointed; therefore it was a <hi>ſeal</hi> to him of <hi>the faith which he bad, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uncircumciſed,</hi> that he might be the <hi>father of all them that believe,</hi> whether circumciſed or not: From whence the apoſtle argues againſt the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of thoſe types, now the antitype is come. But what a poor figure does his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment make, in the dreſs men would now put it into? To ſay, <q>The covenant of which circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion was a <hi>ſign,</hi> is the <hi>ſame</hi> to all <hi>Abraham</hi>'s <hi>ſpiritual</hi> ſeed, as it was to his <hi>natural</hi> poſterity:</q> What argument could be ſtronger to prove that all his ſpiritual ſeed ought to circumciſe their children!

            <p>Circumciſion was a <hi>ſign</hi> or <hi>token</hi> of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant which conſtituted the Jewiſh church, and it is never called a <hi>ſeal</hi> to them in all the bible; but it was a ſeal to <hi>Abraham</hi> of the faith, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">

But thou that teacheſt others, teacheſt thou not thyſelf?

This is the <hi>goſpel</hi> which was preached unto Abraham, <hi>before</hi> cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion or other rites of the law were inſtitut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and was now freely preached both to Jews and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> after thoſe rites were aboliſhed; and I find not a word of any of them being bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, till they proſeſſed faith in that promiſe: Yet you muſt needs go back to the jewiſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and from thence frame a plea for bringing your houſhold upon your faith. You, Sir, go back to the "federal holineſs" of the Old-Teſtament, to interpret the word <hi>holy</hi> by, in 1 Cor. 7.14, p. 50. Though that Old-Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament holineſs is expreſſly given as a reaſon why they ſhould make <hi>no marriages</hi> with other nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Deut. 7.3.6. And the ſame reaſon is given againſt eating <hi>unclean meats,</hi> Deut. 14.3—21; neither is there a whit more of conſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency or of juſtice, in going back to that church, for the meaning of the word <hi>holy</hi> in this text, than there is for the meaning of the word <hi>ſanctified</hi> in this, and alſo in 1 Tim. 4.3.—5. which both prove that ſort of holineſs to be out of date. And by the way, I would not have you forget, that the reaſon why Abraham's ſeed might not be circumciſed till eight days old, was becauſe their mothers were <hi>unclean</hi> ſeven days, Levit. 12.2.3. And as all their males were to be circumciſed as
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:012317_0015_0F8A207B5758BAF8"/>ſoon as they were clean; ſo, if any man of them was <hi>clean</hi> and not in a journey at the appointed ſeaſon of the paſſover, and <hi>forbore</hi> to keep it, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the ſame ſoul ſhould be cut off from his people, Numb. 9.10.13. So that though natural birth or purchaſe for money brought per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons into that church, yet it is your miſtake in ſuppoſing they were circumciſed only upon a <hi>relative</hi> right, p. 54. Perſonal qualifications were required for both ordinances; and a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect of either of them expoſed them to be cut off from that church; but to have circumciſed a child before he was eight days old would have been a tranſgreſſion; and ſo it would to have offered a calf, lamb or kid, before that age, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God would have no <hi>unclean</hi> thing offered to him, Exod. 22.30. Levit. 22.27. As to the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual things which theſe were types of, in them I ſuppoſe we agree: And ſo we do about the manner of eating the paſſover; but for you to blend type and antitype together as you do, p. 56. is not juſt. Neither is it ſo for you to ſay, we ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly take it for granted, that it is not a perſon's ſin to remain in unbelief, p. 58. I hold as ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as you do, that it was a damning ſin in every jew, if he did not truly believe in the Meſſiah to come, who is the ſubſtance of thoſe types; and then it muſt ſurely be an aggravated ſin not to believe in him that is come. But how ſhort-ſighted are we! While you attempt to diſcover
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:012317_0016_0F8A207C2B96AD18"/>my ſecret miſtake, you beg the whole queſtion between us. You ſay, <q>The baptized child of a true believer is, <hi>by God's appointment</hi> and the parent's act, brought under the bond and ſeal of the covenant,</q> p. 61. This is all the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between us; only prove that it is <hi>God's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment,</hi> and I will give up the diſpute in a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute. Here the point turns.</p>
            <p>I fully agree with you, that there is an eſſential difference between moral duties and poſitive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions. Morality in all ages is in its nature as immutable as the perfections of the deity; but inſtitutions of worſhip depend intirely upon his ſovereign will, and poſitive appointment; and I like well your deſcription of God's firſt forming <hi>Abraham</hi>'s family into church-ſtate, with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain duties and privileges annexed, which were to be thankfully received, and punctually ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, <q>until God ſhould pleaſe to add there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to more rites and ceremonies, or take them all away,—and appoint new ones at pleaſure.</q> Now the ſingle point between us is, whether he has <hi>taken away</hi> that <hi>covenant</hi> which conſtituted that church, and appointed a <hi>better covenant, which is eſtabliſhed upon better promiſes;</hi> or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the covenant is the <hi>ſame,</hi> and only changed into different hands, with the appointment of different ordinances. The apoſtle obſerves that the <hi>firſt covenant had ordinances of divine ſervice;</hi> but he does not confound ordinances and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:012317_0017_0F8A207CB62AC688"/>together as you ſeem to do, p. 23. No, he keeps them diſtinct; and ſince he ſo often diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſheth the covenants as well as ordinances, by calling one <hi>Old,</hi> the other <hi>New;</hi> the one <hi>firſt,</hi> the other <hi>ſecond,</hi> and ſays Chriſt <hi>taketh away the firſt, that he may eſtabliſh the ſecond,</hi> Heb. 9.1. and 10.9. I ſhould think your evidence was hardly ſufficient to prove that a man <q>
                  <hi>boaſts</hi> as being by way of <hi>eminence</hi> in the cauſe of God,</q> if he did uſe ſome "peremptory airs," p. 67. in aſſerting that, <hi>old</hi> and <hi>new, firſt</hi> and <hi>ſecond</hi> are not the <hi>ſame!</hi> Eſpecially when the <hi>firſt</hi> muſt be <hi>taken away</hi> in order to <hi>eſtabliſh the ſecond!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You allow ſome of the babtiſts to be <q>very judicious Chriſtians in other reſpects, yet think that in this particular (about children's being in covenant) one and all of them may juſtly be termed near-ſighted people,</q> p. 67. If ſo, then I am ſorry that you happened to be ſo much troubled with the ſame calamity, as not to ſee, that though I ſuppoſed the principle of hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing children to be born in the covenant of grace tended to a crying <hi>peace, peace, when there was no peace;</hi> yet that I expreſsly ſaid in my 66. page, that I was ſatisfied Mr. <hi>F.</hi> did not commonly teach perſons in ſuch a way: Had you but ſeen that, it might have prevented your complaining of me, as though I charged ſuch language upon <hi>all</hi> parents, who practiſe infant baptiſm without <hi>diſtinction,</hi> p. 64. But it ſeems a little remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:012317_0018_0F8A207DB9E87680"/>that, while you are trying to clear the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of that language, by ſaying, <q>When we act up to our principles, we are ſo far from crying peace, peace, to our baptized children, that we cry, wrath! wrath!—if they go on in ſin,</q> p. 65. Yet you can't get but three pages forward before you call them <q>the little children of God's <hi>gracious</hi> covenant.</q> And how near was your ſight when you ſaid, <q>although there is <hi>no mention</hi> made of <hi>infants,</hi> yet houſholds include infants, and that is <hi>ſufficient</hi> for our purpoſe?</q> p. 51. What! did you never ſee a houſhold without an infant in it? If you have, your argument is like that of the miniſter of <hi>Harwinton,</hi> which you juſtly obſerve in your let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to him, p. 23. was no more concluſive, than to argue, that if a man has got <hi>money,</hi> he has cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly got <hi>gold,</hi> tho' it is well known that the word includes <hi>copper</hi> as really as gold; and you truly tell him that he "was not over-ſharp," if he did not ſee this to be the nature of his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>And, my friend, how ſharp was you, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe you could read infants in <hi>Lydia</hi>'s houſe? When by the book ſhe appears to be the head of the family, and there is not the leaſt mention of her over having either huſband or child. Again how near was your ſight, that you could not ſee that there is juſt the fame proof that <hi>all</hi> the gaol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers houſe were taught and believed, as there is
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:012317_0019_0F8A207F8C78E2E8"/>that <hi>all</hi> were baptized? <hi>Acts</hi> 16.15.32—34, 40. And how ſharp was you at reckoning <hi>figures,</hi> when you concluded that the 8 ſouls in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21. amounted to a proof for a <q>houſholder to <hi>bring</hi> his children to baptiſmal <hi>ſprinkling?</hi>
               </q> p. 51. as if <hi>Noah</hi> had <hi>brought</hi> his wife, and his ſons and their wives, in his <hi>arms</hi> to be ſprinkled with rain! Whereas the ſacred record informs us, that they all <hi>went into the ark, as God had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded</hi> Noah, <hi>and the Lord ſhut him in;</hi> where they were <hi>covered</hi> from the rain, and <hi>ſaved</hi> thro' the <hi>flood,</hi> Gen. 7.7—16.</p>
            <p>Once more, how careful was you to ſee that your words and ideas went together, in your at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to pull down my pride? As I had wrote three or four times on this controverſy without being anſwered, you repreſent me as conceiting I <q>had ſtruck all with ſuch intimidating fear, that there was no one ſtripling left who dare en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter with this great <hi>Goliah,</hi> that has been theſe ſeveral times defying one branch of the army of the living God, viz. the little child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren of his gracious covenant,</q> p. 68. I have been deeply ſenſible theſe many years that pride is as bad an enemy as any I have to conflict with and would gladly improve your help as well as others to keep him down; but have I been defy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing infants! I had no ſuch thought. The firſt piece I wrote on this ſubject was the ſermo which you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

And as to pride, I can freely leave the impartial public to judge between this ſuppoſed <hi>Goliah,</hi> and the <hi>ſtripling</hi> who has ventured out againſt him, but has failed ſo much as to the ſkill he <hi>conceited</hi> he had, that inſtead of a real perſon, all his artillery is diſcharged at a man of ſtraw of his own making. For I ſolemnly declare, I know of no man on earth who holds, <q>That the jewiſh church was formed by God upon the covenant of works.</q> Yet your whole book is directed againſt ſuch an one, which therefore muſt be only a creature of your own brain.</p>
            <p>But, my friend, it is too late in the day to make a jeſt of theſe matters. I muſt come to deal yet more ſeriouſly with you.

               </q> becauſe I hold that Chriſt has not only appointed the ordinance of baptiſm; but alſo the <hi>manner</hi> of its admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:012317_0022_0F8A2081335A02E8"/>ſo that when men have done ſomething elſe under that name, it is not the thing which he commanded; yet I am fully ſenſible that I never enjoyed ſo much freedom from a narrow rigid temper, as I have ſince my preſent eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhment; and never was more fully perſuaded than I am now, of the real piety and eminent uſefulneſs of many pedobaptiſts, both in former and latter times; whom therefore I would ever reſpect and honor; but I hope never to give up the truth for any man.</p>
            <p>One thing more I muſt beg your attention to, and I ſhall conclude, which is this; we are none of us willing to be thought fond of controverſy;
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:012317_0023_0F8A2081F1FEE3A0"/>you ſay, 'I am far from deſiring to continue it? But how ſhall we prevent its continuance? You own you have not <q>attended directly to my plan, and the ground-work thereof,</q> yet tell me that if I don't <hi>attend directly</hi> to yours, you ſhall look upon it impertinent, p. 71. and who diſcovers moſt pride here? The want of attending to my plan has cauſed you to abuſe your brethren as you have done; and if I write again, I ſhall, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to your notion, give another proof of being a proud, contentious perſon; yet if I do not, even honeſt people, who have no better means of information than your writings, will be apt to think the people called baptiſts are ſuch abſurd creatures as to hold, that there was only the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of a church in the Old-Teſtament, and that 'the true church never had exiſtence till the goſpel day.' I ſay, they will be apt to think ſo of the whole denomination; for your reproach, as <hi>Eſther</hi> ſaid of <hi>Haman</hi>'s decree, is laid againſt <hi>all my people;</hi> to which you add an inſinuation of 'deſigned ambiguity,' in my defence of this cauſe: Than which, what could you have ſaid worſe of an honeſt man? And which a due <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention</hi> to what I have wrote would doubtleſs have prevented. And muſt this ſword devour for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever? It will ſurely be bitterneſs in the latter end.</p>
            <p>One method however occurs to my mind, which I think to take, to try to draw you out of your entrenchment under the language of tradition,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:012317_0024_0F8A2082B4B32660"/>and to prevent any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">

               </hi> that the <hi>law could not diſannul,</hi> Gal. 3.8.16.17. But I declare boldly, that neither his firſt nor his ſecond birth gave him any right to circumciſe either himſelf or his ſeed. All the right he had to do that, was by a poſitive inſtitution many years after, by a covenant which formed his <hi>houſhold</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a church, with circumciſion for the token of their memberſhip, from whence the Holy Ghoſt calls it <hi>The Covenant of Circumciſion,</hi> Act. 7.8. but never the covenant of grace. I believe that the choice of that nation, for God's only viſible church in the world, was a type of the <hi>holy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Pet. 2.9.</note> of his elect among all who were, either by birth or purchaſe, incorporated into that church, was a type of Chriſt's ſhedding his blood to purchaſe his choſen, and of their regeneration, by his grace.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Rom. 2.29.

               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:012317_0025_0F8A208491218F20"/>He did not <hi>caſt away his people which he foreknew;</hi> no, they were before in his covenant, but now he made a <hi>new covenant</hi> with them, which <hi>broke off</hi> all Abraham's unbelieving poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and <hi>grafted</hi> in the believing gentiles among the elect Jews.<note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. 11.2.5.17.</note> Thus he inſtituted a new church-ſtate of the <hi>houſhold of God,</hi>

Therefore I challenge you and all men upon earth, to ſhew, if you can, any evidence from the divine oracles, to entitle the natural offspring of believers to baptiſm, before they perſonally profeſs faith in Chirſt, any more than
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:012317_0026_0F8A20851E8C1568"/>there is to confine the goſpel miniſtry to the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of miniſters.<note n="‖" place="bottom">I find the apoſtle makes uſe of this very argument, to prove to the Hebrews, that Jeſus has <hi>diſannulled</hi> the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial law, of which circumciſion was a part, and has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced a <hi>better teſtament, a better covenant</hi> than that which the Jewiſh church ſtood in, Heb. 7.18.22. and 8.6.</note>.</p>
            <p>This is the plan I am upon, and this is my teſtimony, and if you or any other can ſhew any part of it to be contrary to truth, do it by all means; but if any accuſe me of knowingly hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing contrary hereto, they in that reſpect join with the old accuſer of the brethren, let them otherwiſe be ever ſo pious: And (though moſt unworthily) I hope to overcome them by the blood of the lamb, and by a cloſe adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the teſtimony of truth, even unto the death. If you call this boaſting, you have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled me; and it is only a hope of putting ſome ſtop to the fire of contention, which abounds more in your part of the country than ours, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the covenant and a right to ordinances; or at leaſt a ſtop to my concern therein, that has brought me to this length.</p>
            <p>Some would lay the blame of theſe contentions to thoſe called new-lights, ſome to the ſeparates, and others to baptiſts; but my opinion is, that the power of the goſpel was the firſt means of breaking up the carnal peace which our land was ſettled into, by which great members were
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:012317_0027_0F8A2085C39F6228"/>cut off from nature's ſtock, and grafted into Chriſt. Yet many of them flocked into church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es which were very much blenced with the world. And thoſe who knew what they were doing in the ſeparation, came out to have the church a diſtinct body from the world, and I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they all, to a man, teſtified againſt what is called the half way covenant; though moſt of them did not ſee that they only ſtruck at the branches, and not at the root of that evil, while they ſtill applied the token of the goſpel cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to intants, which had no other birth than that which brings us all into this world. And when ſome of us were convinced of this, and act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed accordingly, Mr. F's letter, and yours, will ſhew how we have been treated by our brethren: And lately this controverly has appeared, and is carried to a great height, among thoſe called ſtanding miniſters.</p>
            <p>Dr. Bellamy has written a number of times againſt the half-way covenant, and has taken much pains to ſhew that the covenant which is publicly owned, implies a profeſſion of ſaving grace; and therefore, that if the perſon who makes the profeſſion has no grace, his profeſſion is a lie. But many have tried to avoid this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence. At length Mr. Moſes Mather pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed a pamphlet, to prove that the viſible church is in covenant with God, according to Abraham's convenant, and conſequently that all
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:012317_0028_0F8A2086756D0080"/>who are in covenant ought to be in the uſe of all the means and ordinances of it, in order to obtain grace and ſalvation. Againſt this the Dr. wrote 80 pages, and becauſe Mr. M. left the word <hi>grace</hi> out of his deſcription of the external co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, he charges him with <q>giving up the grounds,</q> on which Meſſieurs <hi>Dickinſon, Clark</hi> and <hi>Boſtwick,</hi> vindicated infant baptiſm.<note n="§" place="bottom">Dr. Bellamy's firſt piece againſt Mr. Mather, page. 9.</note> And the Dr. repreſents Mr. M's covenant to be ſo void of any privilege that he ſays,<note n="*" place="bottom">Page 75.</note> 
               <q>He has no right, upon his ſcheme, to the apoſtles anſwer in Rom. 3.1.2. For, as to <hi>the oracles of God,</hi> which he claims for one of the chief privileges of his external covenant, he will grant, that they are common to the unbap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, i. e. the unbaptized have as good a right to read and hear the word of God, as the baptized have; and as good a right to believe and embrace the goſpel. For, by Chriſt's laſt commiſſion, <hi>the goſpel is to be preached to all nations;</hi> yea, to <hi>every creature:</hi> And that, previous to, and in order to prepare men for baptiſm, Mar. 16.15.16. So that, there is not the leaſt need of being in his external co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, in order to have as good a right to hear and believe, and be juſtified by the goſpel, as any man on earth has: <hi>For there is no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,</hi>
                  <pb n="30" facs="unknown:012317_0029_0F8A20876DFDF0E8"/>Rom. 3.22. compare Mat. 10.5, 6. and 28.19.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Well done doctor! here you talk reaſon and ſcripture too. But if a ſtranger might be ſo bold as to aſk, whether natural generation conveys grace to your child or not? 'Tis likely the anſwer would be, no, by no means: And if it might be farther aſked, whether you hold to the popiſh doctrine, of the ſacraments, conferring grace by the <hi>operation of work done?</hi> Would you not reſent the ſuggeſtion with abhorrence?— If neither natural generation, nor what parents and miniſters have <hi>done,</hi> in baptizing children, confer grace upon them, where are they before God gives it to them but in Mr. Mather's <hi>external</hi> covenant? And to imagine that they have a better claim to the ſpirit's influence to make the means of grace effectual, than other ſinners; this the Dr. truly obſerves is inconſiſtent with God's <hi>having mercy on whom he will have mercy.</hi>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 76. As to your ſaying, <q>The queſtion is not whether baptiſm ſecures the ſalvation of the child of a believer, nor whether it enables the child to believe; but whether the child is not hereby brought under an additional obligation to believe and repent?</q> Which you aſſert he is, p. 61. I anſwer, that all God's appointments add to our obligation; but the queſtion between us is, whether infant baptiſm be his appointment or not? And to beg the queſtion and then argue from it is poor buſineſs. As to God's precious promiſes to his ſaints, of the out-pouring of his ſpirit on their children, I truſt I prize them as much as you do: But obſerve their order, particularly that you mention, p. 26. Firſt the ſpirit is poured on their offspring, which gives life and cauſes them to <hi>ſpring up,</hi> and then they profeſs his name, and <hi>ſubſcribe with their hand unto the Lord,</hi> Iſa. 44.3—5. The Dr. knows, by the two laſt texts he quotes, that the apoſtles were limited in their firſt commiſſion, to preach to none but ſuch as were in Abraham's covenant; but by their laſt, they were commanded to teach all nations; and how great a difference between the covenants does this diſcover!</note>

Mr. M. has publiſhed a reply, in which he ſays, <q>It is evident, that it is not from the covenant of grace, ſtrictly taken, but from a <hi>particular poſitive inſtitution,</hi> that the viſible churh derives its being. It is the covenant of grace that compoſeth, and unites the ſeveral members of Chriſt's ſpiritual body, but the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibe body of Chriſt is compoſed, and united by a particular inſtitution.</q> And he charges the doctor with "uſing the argument of the <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi>" becauſe he does not regard this diſtinction.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Mr. Mather's ſecond piece on the covenant, printed at New-Haven, 1770, p. 77. 78.</note> Thus a frightful name that ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition has impoſed upon us, ſerves each party in their turn, in the room of argument, though of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to the injury of truth: For it is not truth to ſay, we do not obſerve this diſtinction. And while they both try to ſupport their ſentiments by Abraham's covenant, yet neither of them dare act up to it. For Mr. M. who goes the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt,

What this profeſſion is, he leaves in the dark, and dwells chiefly on the negative, that it cannot be a profeſſion of ſaving grace; and aſſerts that the <hi>only poſſible method</hi> of erecting a viſible church in that way, muſt be by covenanting upon an <hi>abſolute certainty,</hi> p. 82. This is a plea they dwell much upon; though you truly obſerve to the miniſter of Harwinton, that 'tis full as much againſt them as us; for 'tis as much the divine preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to know certainly that a man has moral ſincerity, and ſpeculative faith, when he profeſſes it, as it is to know one has gracious ſincerity, and ſaving faith when he profeſſes that. And as to a certainty of our own ſtate, Mr. Edwards againſt Mr. Williams, goes much further; for he proves it to be a maxim with Mr. Stoddard, and with proteſtants in general, that <hi>abſolute certainty</hi> of the ſcriptures being true, is attained only by their ſaving power on our hearts. And if ſo, then 'tis ſelf-evident that <hi>abſolute certainty</hi> of our hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a right to a ſcripture-ordinance, cannot be had, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſaving faith.

               </q> Thus he appears to know, that the covenant now is not the ſame that the Jewiſh church ſtood in, and yet you all will plead that 'tis the ſame. We know as well as that gentleman, that the

               </q> is directly againſt the other text that he brings, which ſays, Chriſt has <hi>aboliſhed</hi> thoſe Jewiſh laws and ordinances, for to make <hi>in himſelf</hi> of twain one <hi>new man.</hi> Eph. 2.13—15. and 3.6. The body is the ſame that exiſted under the types; but a <hi>new covenant,</hi> a new poſitive inſtitution of a church-ſtate, is made with them <hi>not according</hi> to that made with their fathers. And I have no hope of their ever bringing this controverſy to an end, till they will come to allow, that the apoſtles knew as well how to expreſs their own meaning, as any now do how to expreſs it for them.</p>
            <p>And as I have already proved, that both the houſe of Abraham, and of Aaron, were types of the <hi>houſhold of God,</hi> whereof the goſpel-church is conſtituted; and as none might miniſter at, or partake with the altar, but Aaron's poſterity, and the apoſtle ſays of goſpel-believers, we have an altar whereof they have <hi>no right to eat,</hi> who ſerve the tabernacle, Heb. 13.10.
