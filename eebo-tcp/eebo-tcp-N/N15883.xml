            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>Thoughts concerning <hi>THE BANK OF NORTH AMERICA,</hi> with ſome facts relating to ſuch eſtabliſhments in other countries, reſpectfully ſubmitted to the honorable <hi>THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF PENNSYLVANIA,</hi> by one of their Conſtituents.</head>
            <p>THE debates and publications, concerning the Bank of North Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, have already been ſo numerous and extended, that, were the ſubject of leſs importance further inveſtigation would be an inexcuſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble treſpaſs on the public time. But as theſe inſtitutions were generally unknown among us before the revolution, and as they are univerſally admitted to be objects of the firſt conſequence, it is confided, that a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent endeavour to bring before the government and people of Pennſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania ſome matters connected with the ſubject, which are not yet ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently known and underſtood, will be favored with an indulgent recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. As it will be ſeen that the writer of theſe reflexions has departed from the line, which thoſe who are charged with party friendſhip or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity have choſen to purſue, he truſts it will be believed that it is only intended reſpectfully to attempt to contribute as far as may be in his power to that information, which will be neceſſary to enable the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to place the bank upon ſo prudent and juſt a footing as to preclude hereafter all reaſonable diſcontentment,</p>
            <p>The exiſtence of public banks in moſt trading countries and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in two of the moſt commercial and opulent nations of Europe, whoſe conſtitutions are as favorable to liberty as any but thoſe of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica; the great majority of wiſe and honeſt ſtateſmen, who have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of them from experience, and the benefits, which it has been proved, may be reaſonably expected from one here, with many other reaſons not neceſſary to be repealed at this time, appear to have convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the greater part of the community, that a bank, wiſely and juſtly conſtituted, would be a public good. How much ſoever, therefore, it might be argued, from the practice of legiſlatures, and the nature of free governments, that the Aſſembly of Pennſylvania did poſſeſs the power to reſtrain and terminate the bank, it appears, that it would have been moſt adviſeable to regulate rather than to deſtroy it. The minds of many in the two parties were manifeſtly heated, and to ſtrongly impreſſed with certain ideas, to which they were reſpectively attached, and thus we ſee one ſide determined to annul, and the other not to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dify. A repetition of theſe contentions is much to be deprecated. They are the bane of happineſs at home, and credit abroad. The precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, reſtrictions and regulations, which may be preſcribed by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent legiſlature in the charter about to be granted, will prevent them, it is believed, in a great degree hereafter.</p>
            <p>Though a part of the oppoſition to the bank of North America may have ariſen from party ſpirit, "a conſequential ill which freedom draws," yet an examination into the foundations of other inſtitutions of the ſame kind, and a candid and diſpaſſionate conſideration of the conſtitution of that bank will convince us, that the neceſſities and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the times and the perfect novelty of the buſineſs occaſioned ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral extreme dangers to be overlooked in its formation.</p>
            <p>BANKS had their origin in the Italian ſtates, whoſe people have long been diſtinguiſhed for their ſcience in political oeconomy. They
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:020307_0002_0FAE99F372239A10"/>
appear, in moſt of the great caſes, to have ariſen out of national di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs. The funding of the public debts has generally given them birth, and we find their exiſtence has often been originally reſtricted to the period when the public debt ſhould be diſcharged. One of the oldeſt of theſe eſtabliſhments was that of Genoa. Being too little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained in regard to the emiſſion of paper<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and incautiouſly taking a part in the politics of Europe, this bank ſoon involved itſelf in ruin. The injuries to public credit, and the melancholy interruptions of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate happineſs reſulting from ſo lamentable a cataſtrophe need not be repeated. From ſuch confuſion and diſtreſs it behoves the guardians of the people carefully to ſecure them.</p>
            <p>The bank of Venice, which aroſe ſome time after, was placed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately in the hands of the ſtate, and the republic was ſecurity for its conduct. It were to be wiſhed that public credit were ſo far reſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed amongſt us as to render it prudent to put our bank on ſuch a foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing The great litigated queſtion concerning the want of checks in our ſtate conſtitution, makes it adviſeable at leaſt at preſent rather to purſue ſome other mode: and were our public credit as perfect, at it is preſumed it will be in a few years, it might not be proper to place the bank immediately in the hands of a government, whoſe form itſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares it to be only a ſeven years experiment</p>
            <p>The bank of Hamburg preſents its citizens and the government of the city, which is imperial, as ſecurities to all who deal with it. The directors are choſen, like other officers of their government, by a majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the freemens' votes, out of the number of their moſt reſpectable citizens. <hi>Foreigners are not permitted to be intereſted in it, leaſt the wealth, power, or ambition of their neighbours might interrupt their repoſe, or ſap the foundations of their government.</hi> Though the uſe of the money of foreigners appears to be a ſufficient reaſon for permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them to be intereſted in our banks in this young country, yet a moſt important queſtion is naturally ſuggeſted by the prudence of the Hamburgers, <hi>whether they ought to have a ſhare in the government of thoſe inſtitutions.</hi> For, however reſpectable Pennſylvania finds herſelf in the American union, it is an inconſiderable ſtate, as to numbers or wealth, compared with ſeveral of the nations of Europe; and the faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of commerce bring Philadelphia as near to Paris, London, or Amſterdam, as Hamburg to Vienna or Berlin.</p>
            <p>The banks of Holland, that is thoſe of Amſterdam and Rotterdam, are immediately in the hands and under the direction of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency of their reſpective cities, who are ſecurities for their faithful and prudent adminiſtration, by which foreigners are of courſe, excluded from the management They do not iſſue any notes; and the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in general of theſe banks, are not of a nature to be very uſeful in ſuch a country as this. Their caution as to foreigners however will deſerve our attention, for the reaſons ſtated under the foregoing head.</p>
            <p>The bank of England is better worth our attention, than any which has ever exiſted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whether we conſider it with regard to the prodigious aids it has afforded to the government, or its uſefulneſs to the commer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial and manufacturing intereſts and, through theſe, to the cultivators of the ſoil. In the reign of William III. that inſtitution was produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the apprehenſions of the nation for their public credit. It was a moment of as great danger and neceſſity as that wherein the bank of North America was eſtabliſhed. The celebrated Bolingbroke declares,
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:020307_0003_0FAE99F666232730"/>
that the revenues of the nation, which could be applied to carry on the war, (which was at once civil and foreign,) were at that time inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to pay a common guard. At this period too, when their affairs were in that miſerable ſituation, James II. ſupported by great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the people of Britain and aſſiſted by the moſt powerful na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Europe, with a ſagacious and enterpriſing prince at their head, was aſſerting his claim to the crown. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>t that awful criſis when ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity would have palliated almoſt any overſights, it is as pleaſing as it is curious, to obſerve the deliberation caution and wiſdom of the parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in making their firſt experiment of a national bank. A ſhort detail will inſtruct and ſerve us in our preſent ſituation, when we are about to organize a ſimilar inſtitution, under no circumſtance of imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate danger, or momentuous difficulty.</p>
            <p>They previouſly reſtrained the king, who could grant any charter, not a monopoly, from making this corporation, of an unlimited or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive duration, by confining him to eleven years This omiſſion in our Aſſembly having been very judiciouſly and candidly pointed out by the committee of the preſent Houſe, the contentions which have ariſen from it will ſubſide of courſe.</p>
            <p>They alſo reſtrained the king from granting a charter, which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted too powerful a capital. Though the revenues of the kingdom were two millions of pounds ſterling, excluſively of the land tax in that highly improved country, it was limited to twelve hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds. If we make an accurate compariſon of wealth, numbers, and trade, between the two countries, we ſhall concur again with the committee of the preſent houſe, in thinking that the capital permitted by the charter was in effect unlimited. The feeds of danger contained in this article are not yet ripened. Had the matter continued as at firſt, it would have been difficult to remove the evil, when it ſhould have been felt. It is not eaſy to overcome the influence of ſuch mighty wealth.</p>
            <p>They reſtrained the bank from contracting debts as a corporation, for more than the amount of their capital; an honeſt and judicious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction; and they enacted, that the private fortunes of the ſtockhold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſhould be liable to make good all ſuch debts as were beyond the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount of their capital, or in other words, beyond the amount of what they were worth as a corporation. It has been truly affirmed, that it is highly dangerous in any government to iſſue bills of credit, but upon certain and ſubſtantial funds. The wiſdom of the legiſlature will find the ſame danger in conſtituting a corporation with power to iſſue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out controul, notes (or bills of credit) for ſums beyond what they are able to pay, in caſe of the ruin of the inſtitution. The banks of Paris, Genoa, and other places afford melancholy inſtances of the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of theſe fatal events. The public happineſs and common juſtice, which require that no man ſhould be empowered to ruin his neighbour while he is ſafe, will recommend this article to the particular attention of government.</p>
            <p>They guarded againſt unlimited votes being in the hands of one man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or ſet of men, by giving each proprietor of five hundred pounds a vote, and by not permitting any man to have more. How incautious was our charter, when it allowed every man to have as many votes as he holds ſhares. Let us examine this important article. It is urged that every perſon ſhould have an influence, according to what he has at
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:020307_0004_0FAE99F7E942D9D8"/>
ſtake. But mere property is not the meaſure of fitneſs in theſe caſes. The free but wary ſpirit of that time rejected that idea, and, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, that it is equally diſapproved now. It does not agree with the nature of any government, wherein there is a principle of liberty. It is abſolutely oppoſed to the ſpirit of every conſtitution in the union. The great corporations in England, ſuch as the bank, whoſe ſtock is now above eleven millions ſterling, the Eaſt-India Company, which is immenſely rich, and powerful in ſeveral ways, and indeed all others that we know of, are founded in oppoſite principles. We alone, the members of a free and equal government, have endowed a wealthy cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration with powers and privileges oppoſed to freedom and equality, and to all examples among ourſelves and in other nations. The bank of Paris, eſtabliſhed under an abſolute monarchy, was founded in a ſmall degree in the ſame miſtake, but it went to ruin, miſerably diſtracted the nation, and annihilated the public credit. Our habits in private buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the utmoſt conſequence, oppoſe this regulation. It muſt have crept in from want of attention in the founders of the inſtitution, and it is confided, that they will not on conſideration urge its continuance. When mercantile houſes are eſtabliſhed, many of which in Europe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue longer than the limitation of the bank of North America will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably be extended, and ſome of which are more wealthy than our bank, no article of this nature is ever entered into Young men, with little property, are often joined to perſons of great eſtates and extenſive con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nections, and have the entire management of the buſineſs. In caſes where three are connected, we find no ſtipulation, that the richeſt partner ſhall govern. Since then it is, and has been an almoſt invari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able fact, that corporations inſtituted for purpoſes of religion, policy or gain, have been founded in principles of equality, let us be careful how we depart from a practice out of which no evil has reſulted, and adopt another from which dangers are apprehended and indeed are evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, diſcontents have ariſen, and which is oppoſed by the experience of all former times and the prudence of the wiſeſt nations.</p>
            <p>We ſee that the regencies of Venice, Hamburg, Rotterdam and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam, have not permitted the influences ariſing from theſe inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to be in the hands even of their private citizens. They have conſidered them as branches of political oeconomy, ſo interwoven with the ſafety and adminiſtration of government, that they have kept them in their own hands. Theſe ſuggeſtions are not novelties. They have occurred before. The friends of the bank of England brought them forward in the infancy of that corporation, and admitting the poſſibility of influence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they urged that their inſtitution could not be dangerous to the people on account of the equality of its conſtitution. A publication, written by Michael Godfrey<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> eſquire, one of the founders of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh bank, to remove the fears of the people about the commercial and political advantages, which the gentlemen who ruled it might derive in conſequence, tells the nation, that "though it cannot be imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but that thoſe, who eſtabliſhed the bank, intended to be largely concerned, yet it is ſo ſettled, that thoſe who have but five hundred pounds, have one vote, and thoſe who have never ſo much can have no more; and any nine members having each five hundred pounds ſtock, may call a general court, (or meeting) and turn out the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernor and deputy governor and all or any of the directors, (but by a majority of the ſtock holders votes in courſe) and chooſe others in their
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:020307_0005_0FAE99F7FAEE6D00"/>
places; which are proviſions ſo wiſe and effectual to prevent fraud in ſome to the prejudice of the reſt, that it hardly leaves room for any doubt of that nature." It appears however that the parliament was ſtill apprehenſive of ſome diſadvantages from ſo momentous and untri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a buſineſs, and therefore, a few years after, and before the expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the eleven years grant, reſtrained one third of the twenty-four directors of every year from ſerving for the next, though the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernor and deputy governor might always be re-elected, for the ſake of keeping up the train of information neceſſary in ſo important and extenſive a ſcene of buſineſs, both public and private. Though the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion and candour of the members of our bank led them to reduce the unlimited right of voting for directors to twenty, ſo that ſtill ſome have one and ſome have twenty votes in the buſineſs of elections, this is very different from the footing on which the precedents of all other nations and corporations, appear to recommend its being placed. By the original conſtitution of the bank of North-America, the right of voting for all purpoſes, but the election of directors, was equal in all the members, notwithſtanding any inequality in the numbers of their reſpective ſhares. This regulation was done away by general conſent, apparently without due conſideration, and has made a very material al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration in the inſtitution, rendering it ſtill more unlike all other banks, ſtill more unſafe than it was at firſt. Great miſtakes have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſen on this ſubject from conſidering the bank as a mere trading com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. Though it is in a great degree of that nature, it is moſt an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of legiſlative attention as a branch of the political oeconomy, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant in its magnitude and in its operations and effects. All writers have viewed the ſubject in that light, and facts ſhew their ideas to be juſt. Incorporated banks, as before obſerved, aroſe from the public occaſions, and have been inſtituted to anſwer public ends. Private men and private property have been uſed as the means, as muſt of neceſſity be the caſe in all the arrangements of civil ſociety. The bank of North-America is itſelf an happy example. It was eſtabliſhed to ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble government to proſecute the war againſt Britain, and had a great ſhare in the merit of completing the revolution. It has been propoſed ſince the peace to centre in it the funds of the ſtate; and its capital is worth more than the amount of all the annual impoſts exciſe, land tax, and other revenues of Pennſylvania ſummed up together It is a mighty machine, and by its preſent conſtitution all its powers are veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a few hands. Were it not for great public purpoſes, a number of private banks with moderate capitals, would perhaps be as uſeful. There are no leſs than fifty-one of them in the city of London, the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount of whoſe capitals muſt be greater than that of the bank of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland. Theſe form an excellent and powerful check, which, from the ſituation of this country, we may be long without. The Engliſh legiſlature have given an unequivocal proof of their viewing the direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the bank in the light of a public employment, for they required by their act that the directors ſhould be regularly ſworn into office, and permitted them to ſerve in parliament by a ſpecial diſpenſation, which on account of the ſtatute againſt placemen, it was thought they could not otherwiſe have done.</p>
            <p>We moreover ſee, that the parliament of England reſtrained any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon from ſubſcribing more than twenty thouſand pounds, that is, the ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth part of the allowed capital, and for a certain time did not permit
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:020307_0006_0FAE99F8DD6B8A38"/>
more than ten thouſand pounds, or the one hundred and twentieth part, to be ſubſcribed. The entire ſum being taken before that period the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction operated to prevent any perſon from holding more than the one hundred and twentieth part of the whole ſtock. Our bank ſtock is 870,000 dollars, and there are ſeveral ſtockholders that hold from 100 to 130 ſhares; ſo that ſome individuals hold a twenty-ſecond part, and ſome even a ſeventeenth part of its capital</p>
            <p>The bank of England was likewiſe reſtrained from trading in any thing, but bills of exchange or bullion, but the ch<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ter from the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of Pennſylvania did not prohibit a trade in any thing whatever.</p>
            <p>The ſubſcriptions to the bank of England were to be taken by no perſons whatever, but certain commiſſioners appointed by the crown under the authority of the parliament, to whom a return was to be made of all perſons, whether natives or foreigners, and of all bodies politic and corporate, which ſhould ſubſcribe any part of the ſtock, that the government might know all things, which the ſecrecy or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacy, neceſſary in regard to private affairs, did not make it proper to reſerve This was very uſeful, in order to be forewarned in due time of the dangers, which might ariſe from too large ſubſcriptions of the wealthy corporations and of foreigners, or from any other cauſe.</p>
            <p>The parliament of England granted its charter for eleven years: ours, as above obſerved, was in effect unlimited. The laſt regulation which will be mentioned is very important—It is that whereby the parliament provided that all future elections of governors, deputy go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors and directors ſhould be made by a majority of the members actually aſſembled. By the operation of this rule, the management of the bank was completely and not indelicately kept out of the hands of foreigners, who would ſeldom be there, but who might be if they choſe. The moſt reſpectable natural born ſubject and the foreigner, in caſe of abſence, were equally prevented from voting by proxy. The dangers ariſing from foreigners having a ſhare in the direction of ſo important a part of the internal oeconomy of the ſtate are too obvious to require any arguments. As they confide to us the largeſt ſums by way of conſignment, and employ us otherwiſe in the moſt important agen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, ſo it is not to be doubted that they will acquieſce in a regulation from us, which they meet every where in Europe. The government of England alone gives them opportunity of voting, if they chuſe to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, but thoſe of Amſterdam Rotterdam, Hamburg, Venice and of all other places and countries, of which we know, either prevent their even holding a ſhare of the ſtock, or reſtrain them from voting for thoſe who are to govern an inſtitution, which may be conſidered as the reſervoir of the vital blood of their civil conſtitutions.</p>
            <p>This paper has already been extended to a greater length than it was originally propoſed. Wherefore, though a few more obſervations oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur, which appear of ſome weight, they will be at preſent omitted. What has been ſaid, is ſubmitted with the moſt reſpectful deference, to the wiſdom and virtue of our repreſentatives, in full confidence, that from their hands we ſhall receive nothing which can give occaſion to diſturb the public tranquility, or abridge the rights of the people.</p>

            <head>Further Thoughts concerning the <hi>BANK,</hi> reſpectfully ſubmitted to the Honorable <hi>THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF PENNSYLVANIA,</hi> by one of their Conſtituents.</head>
            <p>IN the cloſe of the former publication, it was mentioned, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though a few more obſervations, apparently of ſome weight, had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred at that time, it ſeemed beſt to defer them. It is intended to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them in this paper, with ſome other things, which have preſented ſince.</p>
            <p>The approbation of the principles contained in that eſſay, which ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral judicious and worthy men have expreſſed, have a tendency to ſtrengthen the opinions, that a bank, wiſely and juſtly conſtituted, would be a public good—that it would have been beneficial to Pennſylvania, if the late honorable Houſe had determined to regulate rather than de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the inſtitution—and that good men of all deſcriptions and parties will think <hi>themſelves and their property</hi> perfectly ſecure, if the wiſdom of the preſent Houſe ſhould adopt a plan for our bank ſubſtantially the ſame as that of the bank of England It will however be proper to mention, that there are two more regulations of the bank of England, hitherto unnoticed, which are of conſequence to the prudent and fair adminiſtration of its affairs. The firſt requires, that a director ſhall be poſſeſſed of four ſhares of ſtock, and the governor and deputy gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of more The other prevents any perſon from voting as a ſtock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder, if he has not held his ſhares ſix months.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who approve theſe general ideas on this intereſting ſubject, muſt feel an earneſt deſire to remove any improper opinions and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, which may prevent a harmony of meaſures. One great cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, which has embittered this conteſt, is an idea prevailing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong many, that the interference of the legiſlature in the buſineſs of exiſting corporations is totally unprecedented, and unwarrantable. I acknowledge myſelf to have formerly entertained this idea, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore think it the more my duty to ſay ſomething to remove an error which I have aſſiſted, in whatever degree, to promote. If we can ſhew that this opinion, however ſincerely entertained by many ſenſible and honeſt men, is <hi>really erroneous,</hi> it muſt produce the happieſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects in every candid and diſpaſſionate mind. Let us remember how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that although it ſhould be proved from legiſlative practice and the nature of free governments, that the aſſembly did poſſeſs the power to reſtrain and terminate the bank, we ſhall continue at liberty to believe, that it might have been moſt adviſeable to regulate rather than to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy it.</p>
            <p>As the origin of corporations in Great-Britain has been already ſhewn in the debates and publications concerning the bank, we may paſs on from that point after a ſingle obſervation, which may keep in our minds, the principles and cauſes from which they took their riſe. <hi>They were actually deviſed to reſtore to thoſe, who were, and thoſe who ſhould become members, their equal natural rights, and not to deſtroy them.</hi> We cannot therefore apprehend, that the guardians of our equal rights forgetting the generous and wiſe deſign of theſe inſtitutions, and the practice of all other nations, will repeat the deviation from a fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal principle of our free government, by reviving the charter of the bank in its original form.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:020307_0008_0FAE99FA58B247E8"/>An inſpection into the hiſtory of bodies corporate in Britain, will ſhew us the powers actually exerciſed by parliament to extinguiſh and reſtrain them.</p>
            <p>In the reign of James I. we find that the people of England had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come extremely diſſatisfied with the very numerous charters and letters patent, which had been granted to particular men and bodies of men, from time to time. The parliament, judging that the public good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired their interference, and that it was within their conſtitutional powers and duties to interpoſe, paſſed an act, (21 James I. ch. 3,) the firſt ſection of which takes away from all bodies politic or corporate whatſoever, the various monopolies to which they were entitled by their reſpective charters. It then proceeds to ſave to certain corporations, a continuance of the rights and privileges, which they had before the paſſing of that act, and of which ſuch corporations would have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived, if the ſaving clauſe had been omitted. This ſtatute appears to have originated with the Houſe of Commons.</p>
            <p>On the reſtoration of Charles II. to the throne of England, it was again thought, though for a different reaſon (the confuſion of thoſe times) that the interference of parliament in theſe matters was proper and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. We therefore ſee that they paſſed an act (13 Charles II. ſt. 2 c. 1.) entitled <hi>an act for the well governing and regulating of corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> By this ſtatute, officers of all corporations, who ſhould omit or refuſe to qualify themſelves by a day therein mentioned, were to be removed from their offices by commiſſioners to be appointed under the authority of the legiſlature, and their places were to be filled by ſuch perſons as the commiſſioners ſhould chuſe, although they might have been duly elected in the firſt inſtance, and the charters generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired that all officers ſhould be elected by the members of the reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive corporations: and further, the commiſſioners were empowered to remove from offices, places and truſts in corporations, all ſuch as in their opinions, the public ſafety ſhould require to be removed, although ſuch perſons were intereſted in the ſtock, and had duly qualified them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or ſhould offer ſo to do.</p>
            <p>In the 4th or 5th year of William and Mary, a new charter was granted to the Eaſt-India Company, with the excluſive privilege of trading in and to thoſe countries, which they had enjoyed for a very long time. It was to continue for twenty years, that is till the year 1715. We find however, that the parliament again judged themſelves authorized to interfere in the buſineſs of corporations, for by an act paſſed in 1698, ſeventeen years before the excluſive privilege expired, they erected another Eaſt-India Company, and prohibited that which was chartered for the excluſive trade in 1694, from trading at all in 1701.</p>
            <p>The caſe of the South Sea Company affords us a remarkable inſtance of the interference of the parliament in the regulation of corporations. That great national bubble called for the attention of every honeſt and humane member of the legiſlature, and gave riſe to many ſtatutes. One of the acts (7th George I. c. 2) reſtrained the three corporations (the bank, the Eaſt-India Company and the South Sea Company) from re-electing the ſub and deputy governors and directors of the South Sea Company of that time into any office, place or employment in thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, although by their reſpective charters it might have been done before. It alſo reſtrained the ſame perſons from exerciſing their right
<pb n="13"
                   facs="unknown:020307_0009_0FAE99FAF8AEE8F8"
                   rendition="simple:additions"/>
of voting at the elections of the South Sea Company, although they were of courſe ſtock-holders and members of the corporation. Some time after, the South Sea company differed among themſelves about the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a part of their funds. Then again the parliament exerciſed their right to interfere and by their act (7 George I. ſt. 2) made the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary diſtribution. There are ſeveral other inſtances of parliamentary interpoſition, but a further detail might be tedious, and theſe may be ſufficient to remove the miſconceptions that have taken place. Though we muſt be ſenſible of the delicate nature of this power of the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and though we muſt exceedingly condemn a wanton or even an inconſiderate exerciſe of it, yet it is neceſſary to make great allowances for thoſe, who tranſported by the jealous but honeſt ſpirit of republic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and alarmed by the extreme dangers exiſting on its conſtitution, thought there was no ſafety, but in withdrawing the charter of the bank So far, however, as the meaſure proceeded from the mere ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of party, all good men will join to reprobate it. Perhaps, in order to form a juſt opinion on the ſubject, it may be neceſſary to compare the conduct of the houſe that granted this unprecedented charter, with that of the houſe, who took it away. The various errors of human nature are a ſort of apology for each other.</p>
            <p>In eſtimating the injury, or rather the injuſtice done to the bank, by withdrawing the charter, it ſeems neceſſary to be very careful; for the abolition of its franchiſes, ſo far as they interfered with the peace, liberty or ſafety of the community, was ſurely a duty and not a crime. The happineſs of the people being the end of all ſociety, any thing that interferes with it ſhould be reſtrained or prohibited. The <hi>ſanctity</hi> of charters can therefore mean only, that it is dangerous and wicked to trifle with them, not that they are to remain in their original form in all events, at the expence of the more ſacred natural rights of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, which, we have ſeen, they were invented to promote. The continual duration of bodies corporate, was to enable them to receive property, and exerciſe their reſpective functions, as long as the public good might require, or permit</p>
            <p>Let us for a moment ſuppoſe a charter in exiſt, in which there were extreme <hi>acknowledged</hi> evils. The courts of law could not afford any remedy, becauſe they can only take cognizance of tranſgreſſions of charters. The legiſlature, it is affirmed by ſome cannot interfere, and their conſtituents, if that doctrine be admitted, muſt foreſee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending ruin and meet it without the hope of relief. Can then the temporary repreſentatives of a free people erect a corporation within the body of a ſtate to continue an irremediable evil through all future ages? No: thoſe, who have been called for their wiſdom and virtue, to diſpenſe through a ſingle year the bleſſings of government, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have a right to miſapply their tranſitory powers to deſtroy it for ever. Such a doctrine would render our frequent elections vain, and goes to inveſt the aſſembly with powers to legiſlate in every matter, that can be wrought into a corporation, for all times to come, contrary to the letter and ſpirit of our conſtitution, and the peace and dignity of the commonwealth.</p>
            <p>In the preceding part of this paper, it was obſerved that the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority of the late houſe ſhould be judged of, with allowance for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:020307_0010_0FAE99FBB92DAE18"/>
which, it is thought by many, they were led into by the jealous but honeſt ſpirit of republicans. The ſerious part of the community muſt have recourſe to ſome ſuch extraordinary cauſe to account for their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures in regard to the penal law relating to the bank. It is the peculiar duty of government to guard the morals of the people from temptations to vices and crimes, eſpecially ſuch as are extenſively injurious to ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. In the warmth of the moment, matters were left on ſuch a footing, that the dangerous crimes of forgery, and counterfeiting, to which the wicked are allured by extraordinary profit, may be committed almoſt without puniſhment.</p>
            <p>And now, having before us the examples of other nations, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken a free, though it is hoped a reſpectful view of the conduct of our own governors, let us collect into a narrower compaſs the reſult of the whole. It appears then, that a former aſſembly, influenced by wiſe and patriotic conſiderations, did, from the nature and neceſſity of the times and the novelty of the ſubject, grant a charter to the bank of North America, differing from all precedents—that it contained many extreme dangers—that however, the inſtitution ſo conſtituted, retained its monopoly, (with all its other privileges) during the time for which the Aſſembly had granted it—that another Aſſembly, diſcovering the dangers it contained, determined to deſtroy it when the public good would, perhaps, have been better conſulted in reſtraining it;—that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever clear it may be that they had a lawful power ſo to do, it is equally true, that meaſures taken for the public happineſs, ſhould not be carried ſo far as to produce oppoſite effects:—that a part of the ſame houſe which annulled the charter of the bank, promoted the evil by declining any modification:—that on a preſumption, that the public intereſts will be ſerved by a bank, an equality of votes, an excluſion of foreign proxies, an actual limitation of capital, and of duration, and greater circumſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as to the foundation on which notes (or bank bills of credit) ſhall be hereafter emitted, ſeem to be indiſpenſibly neceſſary:—that all the benefits which have been derived from the moſt flouriſhing and uſeful inſtitutions of this nature in other countries having been attended with theſe cautions regulations, a charter on different principles cannot be deſired from any views of public good, and laſtly, that a prudent, wiſe and faithful legiſlature cannot expect to give ſatisfaction to a free and intelligent people by an unneceſſary departure from all precedent, and from the eſſential principles of our republican conſtitutions.</p>
