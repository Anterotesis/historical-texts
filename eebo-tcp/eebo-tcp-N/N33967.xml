            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
            <p>THE following letter was written in the year <hi>1776,</hi> at the requeſt of an American gentleman, who deſired to know my ſentiments upon the ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the Negroes, and profeſſed an intention of reſtoring all his own to liberty, could he be convinced that duty required the ſacrifice. I therefore ſent him the following eſſay, the imperfections of which may perhaps be ſomething extenuated by the precipitation with which it was written. It has lain by me many years in obſcurity; nor did I chooſe to produce it during the progreſs of the American conteſt. Since the happy termination of that diſaſtrous war, I have ſhewn it to ſome of my particular friends, who have honored me ſo far as to deſire copies, and to ſuggeſt that its publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation might not be unattended with utility. After reflecting upon the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, I have choſen to comply with their wiſhes, and preſent this fragment to the public; becauſe, whatever diſcredit it brings upon my head, it may contribute to eſtabliſh the ſincerity of my heart: And if a ſingle human being ſhould by my means be reſtored to happineſs, it is an ample recompence for all the dangers I may incur as an author. Should this eſſay ever reach America, it may perhaps diſpleaſe thoſe who have not learned to diſcern friends from flatterers, and to diſtinguiſh between the language of truth and calumny. Thoſe, on the contrary, who are enlightened by a more extenſive knowledge of human nature, may perhaps reſpect an Engliſhman, who, after daring to aſſert their cauſe through all the varied events of the late revolution, dares now with equal intrepidity aſſert the cauſe of truth and juſtice, and of that part of the human ſpecies whoſe wrongs are yet unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed, and almoſt unpitied. Should it be aſked why I rather publiſh a fragment than a complete eſſay, I can only anſwer, that I reſpect truth ſo much, that I am not inclined to violate it even as an author; and that this letter having been really written in the year <hi>1776,</hi> and being ſtill in the poſſeſſion of the gentleman to whom it was ſent, I do not chooſe to piece it with additions in the year <hi>1784</hi>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Was extremely ſurpriſed at receiving a letter, in an unknown hand, which deſired me to give my ſentiments relative to the ſlavery of the Negroes; till reading to the end, I recollected the name of a gentleman, whom I had the pleaſure of ſeeing with Mr. Laurens<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>Colonel John Laurens, ſon of Henry Laurens, <abbr>Eſq.</abbr> formerly preſident of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs. This young gentleman was ſent over to England for his education, where he endeared himſelf to all who knew him, by his abilities and affectionate temper. In the beginning of the year 1777, he joined the American army, and from that time was foremoſt is every danger. He was preſent and diſtinguiſhed himſelf in every action of the army under general Waſhington, and was among the foremoſt that entered the Britiſh lines at York-Town. He fell Auguſt 27, 1782, one of the laſt victims to this diſaſtrous war, in an obſcure ſkirmiſh with a foraging party. For ſeveral days pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding the action, he had been confined to his bed by a raging fever, but left it at the call of duty, and met his death.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe who were intimately acquainted with this young man, will rank his martial qualities, by which he was chiefly known, as loweſt in the catalogue of his virtues. They will lament the untimely loſs of a clear diſcerning mind that united the ſolid powers of the underſtanding with inflexible integrity. In him, his country has loſt one of its nobleſt and moſt uſeful citizens; his father the kindeſt and moſt affectionate friend; and all the wretched a generous and diſintereſted patron.—O my unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate country! muſt I add, that when I conſider all the leaders of thy factions, all thy hereditary magiſtrates, all that are deſtined to engroſs thy dignities or share thy ſpoils, I ſeek in vain a colonel John Laurens?</p>
               </note>. Much as I am flattered by finding my opinion of any conſequence with a gentleman of whom I have heard ſo advantageous a character, I am ſtill more ſurpriſed, that he can aſk it on ſuch a queſtion; a queſtion which I am ſure his own humanity and good ſenſe will be ſufficient to decide, if he attends, for a moment, to their dictates. I reſpect you, ſir, too much to doubt the ſincerity of the declaration you make, when you profeſs to be guided by reaſon and morality upon this queſtion; for this is the only arbitration which any man can have to conſult upon a ſubject like this: Where they are ſilent, the voice of the whole world ought to be diſregarded, and where they approve, the diſſent of all mankind can have no influence upon a mind like yours.—But as you expreſsly deſire to know my ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, I muſt wave both preface and ceremony, and addreſs you with the modeſt freedom that becomes one man when he is ſpeaking to another upon the moſt important queſtion in the univerſe. As a member of that ſociety which has now made a ſolemn appeal to Heaven, and taken up arms againſt the nation to which it owes its eſtabliſhment, you muſt admit that there are ſuch things as right and juſtice, to which the whole human ſpecies have an indefeaſible claim. Indeed, unleſs there be ſuch a thing as juſtice, it is in vain we enquire about its precepts, or refer to its arbitration. He that admits no right but force, no juſtice but ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior violence, arms every man againſt himſelf, and juſtifies all exceſſes. If it be lawful to injure becauſe we can; if we may ſeize the property of another, inſult his perſon, or force him to labour for our luxury or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>price, merely becauſe he is weaker; this principle will be equally fatal to ourſelves, when fortune ſhall ſtrip us of that power which is our only prerogative, and ſhift the plea of ſuperiority. You are to remember that, upon this ſuppoſition, your ſlaves, the inſtant they ſhall become the ſtrongeſt, will have a right to the ſervices of yourſelf and every other gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of the ſouthern colonies; will have a right to force you to labour naked in the ſun to the muſic of whips and chains; to rob you of every thing which is now dear to your indolence, or neceſſary to your pleaſures; to goad you to every ſpecies of ſervile drudgery, and puniſh you for their amuſement and caprice; will have a right to exhauſt your youth in ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and to abandon your age to wretchedneſs and diſeaſes: In one word, ſir, they will have a right to uſe <hi>you,</hi> as you do <hi>them.</hi> Let us, therefore, leave principles which can be maintained by no one but a profeſſed ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to mankind; who would at one ſtroke extirpate every thing which alleviates the evils of life, and arm every man in an eternal war againſt his fellow creatures, to enquire what are the real dictates of that juſtice,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:044524_0004_101EB1F708C14D70"/>
whoſe exiſtence, I am perſuaded, we both allow. You, therefore, admit there are certain claims, which, for want of a better name, we call rights, to which the human ſpecies has an indiſputable title. To expreſs myſelf in other words, "There is a method of purſuing our own happineſs in ſuch a manner, that we may promote the general good at the ſame time; or, at leaſt, not interfere with it." This, our reaſon aſſures us, is the privilege of every created being; and while he confines himſelf within theſe bounds, we feel the moſt cordial approbation of his conduct. We love, and eſteem, and ſympathize with him, from the very conſtitution of our nature. On the contrary, whenever any one diſturbs or injures a being acting in this manner, or prevents him from attaining the good to which he is impelled, we feel our hatred and indignation moſt forcibly excited againſt the aggreſſor. We conſider ſuch a character as armed againſt the welfare of the world, and as one who is endeavouring to make the common good ſubſervient to his own ſelfiſhneſs. I appeal to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity of your own nature, for the exiſtence of theſe principles. Have they not, a thouſand times, animated you to acts of virtue and humanity, as well as inſpired you with an involuntary reverence for all who acted from their impulſe? Have they not often pleaded the cauſe of the wretch that lay trembling and defenceleſs at your feet, and, in ſpite of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices of your country and education, whiſpered to your mind that one human being ought not to hold his exiſtence by the tenure of another's will? Do not theſe principles now inſpire you, and frequently impel you beyond the bounds of prudence and ſafety, while what you call your country's cauſe animates you to exertion? But this cauſe is only the united cauſe and intereſt of every particular man; thoſe rights which the Great Creator taught him to diſcover when he gave him reaſon, which he urges him to defend by paſſion, and which a mind like yours prizes beyond all the gratifications of ſenſe, and dares to graſp at even while it is periſhing. This appears to me to be a plain and conciſe deduction of morality, which means nothing more than that method or rule of conduct by which the whole human ſpecies may attain the greateſt poſſible degree of happineſs. And I rather chooſe to expreſs myſelf ſo, becauſe I thus comprehend all ſects and opinions. The religious man allows that the happineſs of the ſpecies is the great end of the Deity, which he promotes by the rewards and puniſhments of a future ſtate: The diſciple of Shaftſbury underſtands this, when he talks of the beauty of virtue and the love of order; and even the gloomy pupil of Hobbes, who reſolves every thing into ſelf intereſt, muſt allow the exiſtence of moral diſtinctions, ſo far as they influence the welfare of the ſpecies. This univerſal morality appears to me to be the only rational and legal foundation of all human government; which ought to be nothing more than the application of this general rule to particular ſocieties, and the enforcing it by civil eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhments. If, therefore, it be granted, that the rights of a nation are nothing more than the rights of every man in it, and that all juſt and legal authority ſuppoſes a delegated power entruſted ſolely for the purpoſe of promoting the general good; it will appear evident that every indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual in the univerſe poſſeſſes certain rights, which no man can diveſt him of without injuſtice, unleſs he be guilty of ſome crime againſt ſociety which expoſes him to its vengeance. Hence it follows, that whenever any nation attacks the rights and happineſs of another nation, it deſerves to find its own deſtruction in the attempt; and whenever any individual preſumes to exerciſe this ſpecies of authority over his fellow creatures, he muſt be a tyrant and an oppreſſor whom it is permitted to deſtroy by eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry poſſible method. Whoever would deny this, muſt either deny the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence of right and juſtice entirely, and then it is in vain to argue; or muſt ſhew ſome natural diſtinction by which one part of the ſpecies is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to privileges from which the other is excluded. The firſt ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I have already conſidered, and the ſecond is altogether abſurd; for all
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:044524_0005_101EB21C8059EF70"/>
alterations and diſtinctions among mankind ſolely ariſe from civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which has no other juſt foundation than natural right; and natural right, for that reaſon, muſt be a principle of higher authority than civil government. Whenever, therefore, civil government tends to deſtroy and confound the rights of nature, it ceaſes to have any claim to our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; it becomes tyranny, corruption, and deſpotiſm, a peſt inſtead of a bleſſing, and ſubverſive of every purpoſe for which it was inſtituted, or ought to be continued.</p>
            <p>I am extremely fearful of expreſſing myſelf obſcurely upon ſo abſtract a ſubject, and muſt, therefore, though with the hazard of prolixity, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to place it in a different light.—If you imagine any number of the human ſpecies aſſembled in ſome particular part of the globe, without any form of government eſtabliſhed among them; it is evident, that theſe individuals may either live together in ſuch a manner as to produce mutual comfort and aſſiſtance, or may be the cauſe of continual miſery to each other. No propoſition in the mathematics can be inveſtigated with more preciſion than the methods of conduct which have theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary tendencies. Every diſpoſition which inclines one man to aſſiſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or to avoid giving him offence and doing him injury, muſt neceſſarily contribute to the common welfare; which would be perfect, were theſe diſpoſitions cultivated in the greateſt poſſible degree. On the contrary, every diſpoſition, which, either by fraud or violence, tends to interrupt the perſonal ſecurity of individuals, or to deprive them of thoſe things which they have acquired by their induſtry, is detrimental to the ſum of happineſs, and would, if carried to the greateſt poſſible degree, entirely deſtroy that part of the ſpecies.—In this view of things, morality ariſes from neceſſity, and comprehends "certain rules of conduct founded upon the relations which beings endowed with particular faculties bear to each other; which rules, when properly obſerved, produce happineſs to ſociety; but when violated or neglected, as neceſſarily occaſion miſery as fire or pointed ſubſtances excite pain, when they act too forcibly upon the nerves."</p>
            <p>I hardly think that the greateſt ſceptic will deny theſe diſtinctions, founded upon facts as certain as the impreſſion of any material ſubſtance upon our ſenſes. If we, now, proceed a little farther, we ſhall find that the diſpoſitions which produce theſe different kinds of conduct are by the moraliſts expreſſed by different names, and enforced by different motives, according to their ſeveral ſyſtems; while natural religion adds its ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and inclines us to believe that the Deity himſelf, who has diſplayed ſo great an attention to the happineſs and preſervation of his creatures here, may extend his benevolence to another ſtage of exiſtence, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſate the evils ſometimes unmeritedly ſuffered below. But if we admit the evidence of revealed religion, the ſcheme of human things is perfect as it is auguſt; the clouds which overſhadowed our horizon are diſſipat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the gradual progreſs of triumphant virtue, through dangers and difficulties, to eternal happineſs, is diſplayed and aſcertained.</p>
            <p>Having laid down theſe principles, it is eaſy to apply them to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular caſe in queſtion. Slavery is the abſolute dependence of one man upon another; and is, therefore, as inconſiſtent with all ideas of juſtice as deſpotiſm is with the rights of nature. It is a crime ſo monſtrous againſt the human ſpecies, that all thoſe who practiſe it deſerve to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpated from the earth. It is no little, indirect attack upon the ſafety and happineſs of our fellow creatures, but one that boldly ſtrikes at the foundations of all humanity and juſtice. Robbers invade the property, and murderers the life of human beings; but he that holds another man in bondage, ſubjects the whole ſum of his exiſtence to oppreſſion, bereaves him of every hope, and is, therefore, more deteſtable than robber and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſſin combined. But if no one who has common feeling will commit the outrage, no one who has common ſenſe will attempt to juſtify it by ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument;

ſince it would involve him in the groſſeſt and moſt inextricable contradictions. He muſt allow that every man has, by nature, a right to life, yet that every other man has a right to rob him of it; that every man has an equal right to ſubſiſtence, yet that every other may deprive him of all the means; and that while every individual is juſtified by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and the Deity in purſuing his own happineſs by all innocent methods, every other individual is equally juſtified in making him miſerable. In ſhort, it is reducing every thing to the ſtate before deſcribed, a ſtate of conteſt and deſolation from which right and juſtice are equally excluded.</p>
            <p>Of you, ſir, who ſay you have ſeveral ſlaves, I beg leave to aſk what are the rights you claim over them? Have you a right to torture them when they are guilty of no faults? Have you a right to kill them for your diverſion? Is your power circumſcribed by no bounds, and are there particular beings who bring into the world all the rights which you yourſelf can pretend to, but have ſo entirely loſt them by being tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into another country, as to be beyond the protection both of nature and of nature's God?</p>
            <p>Surely, ſir, unleſs I am deceived in you, you are a man both of honor and humanity. You ſtart at the idea of wanton and unprovoked bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barity. You would not murther a ſlave to ſhew your dexterity, nor maim him to prove your ſtrength; you would not daſh an infant upon the ground to feed your dogs, even tho' he was black; nor would you rip up the belly of his mother while ſhe was ſuckling him, to improve your ſkill in anatomy. You neither would, nor <hi>dare</hi> you commit actions like theſe; you feel that you have no right to do them; or, if you have, that every other man has an equal and ſuperior right to deſtroy you like a beaſt of prey. What then are your rights? I anticipate your anſwer: You will feed and cloath your Negroes, you will treat them with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity and tenderneſs, and then you have a right to moderate advantage from their labors. All this, ſir, is well; and could I conceive you ever had acted in another manner, I ſhould never have troubled you with this tedious letter. While your Negroes chooſe to ſtay with you upon theſe terms, this is a fair and equitable compact. But what if they ſhould chooſe to leave you, will you let them go? If you do, you are a man of honor, ſenſe, and humanity; but I fear no Weſt Indian.</p>
            <p>Are there no whips, no gibbets, no puniſhments more dreadful than death itſelf for contumacious ſlaves? And what is this but claiming the deteſtable power I have mentioned above, that of making other beings miſerable, for your intereſt or amuſement? Who, ſir, gave you a title to their labours, or a right to confine them to loathſome drudgery? And if you have no right to this, what are the puniſhments you pretend to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict but ſo many additional outrages? Has a robber a claim upon your life becauſe you withhold your property; or a raviſher a right to a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's blood becauſe ſhe defends her chaſtity? Either then prove your right to their labours, or acknowledge that the puniſhments inflicted upon fugitive ſlaves are a flagitious inſult upon juſtice, humanity and common ſenſe.</p>
            <p>Permit me, here, to examine for a moment the nature of the title by which you claim an irredeemable property in the labours of your fellow creatures.—A wretch, devoid of compaſſion and underſtanding, who calls himſelf a king of ſome part of Africa which ſuffers the calamity of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing frequented by the Europeans, ſeizes his innocent ſubjects, or engages in an unneceſſary war to furniſh himſelf with priſoners; theſe are loaded with chains, torn from all their comforts and connections, and driven (like beaſts to the ſlaughter houſe) down to the ſea ſhore, where the mild ſubjects of a Chriſtian government and a religious king are waiting to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree for the purchaſe, and to tranſport them to America. They are then thruſt by hundreds into the infectious hold of a ſhip, in which the greateſt part frequently periſhes by diſeaſe, while the reſt are reſerved to experience
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:044524_0007_101EB220EDF4E098"/>
the candor and humanity of American patriots—If you have never yet conſidered it, pauſe here for a moment, and endeavour to impreſs upon your mind the feelings of a being full as ſenſible, and perhaps more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent than you or I, which is thus torn in an inſtant from every thing that makes life agreeable; from country, friends and parents; from the intercourſe of mutual affection with miſtreſs, lover, or child; which, poſſeſt of feelings more exquiſite than European hearts can conceive, is ſeparated for ever from all it loves; that, reduced to a depth of miſery, which, even in the midſt of freedom and affluence, would be ſufficient to overwhelm the moſt hardened diſpoſition, inſtead of friends and comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and obſequious attendants, ſees itſelf ſurrounded with unrelenting per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors and unpitying enemies; wretches who, by long intercourſe with miſery, are grown callous to its agonies; who anſwer tears with taunts, and complaints with torture! I ſhudder at the horrors which I deſcribe, and bluſh to be a human creature! Yet theſe are not the colours of deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription, but a recital of facts leſs ſtrong than the reality. Can any man reflect upon theſe things, without unutterable remorſe? Can he know that, perhaps, while he is wallowing in luxury and ſenſuality, there are beings whoſe exiſtence he has embittered, mothers ſhrieking for their children, and children periſhing for want of their mothers care; wretches who are frantic with rage, ſhame and deſperation, or pining in all the agonies of ſlow and painful death, who might have been at peace if he had never exiſted? Can any man know this and hope for mercy, either from his fellow creatures or his God?—After the arrival of the ſurviving wretches in America, you well know in what manner they are tranſferred to their conſcientious maſters—how they are brought to the market, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, weeping, and in chains—how one man dares to examine his fellow creatures as he would do beaſts, and bargain for their perſons—how all the moſt ſacred duties, affections, and feelings of the human heart, are violated and inſulted; and thus you dare to call yourſelves the maſters of wretches whom you have acquired by fraud, and retain by violence!—While I am tracing this practice, which you and every man who has been in the iſlands or the ſouthern colonies of America, knows to be true, my aſtoniſhment exceeds even my horror, to find it poſſible that any one ſhould ſeriouſly doubt whether an equitable title to hold human beings in bondage can be thus acquired.</p>
            <p>With what face, ſir, can he who has never reſpected the rights of nature in another, pretend to claim them in his own favour? How dare the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the ſouthern colonies ſpeak of privileges and juſtice? Is money of ſo much more importance than life? Or have the Americans ſhared the diſpenſing power of St. Peter's ſucceſſors, to excuſe their own obſervance of thoſe rules which they impoſe on others? If there be an object truly ridiculous in nature, it is an American patriot, ſigning reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of independency with the one hand, and with the other brandiſhing a whip over his affrighted ſlaves.</p>
            <p>If men would be conſiſtent, they muſt admit all the conſequences of their own principles; and you and your countrymen are reduced to the dilemma of either acknowledging the rights of your Negroes, or of ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendering your own.—If there be certain natural and univerſal rights, as the declarations of your Congreſs ſo repeatedly affirm, I wonder how the unfortunate Africans have incurred their forfeiture.—Is it the antiquity, or the virtues, or the great qualities of the Engliſh Americans, which conſtitutes the difference, and entities them to rights from which they to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally exclude more than a fourth part of the ſpecies?—Or do you chooſe to make uſe of that argument, which the great Monteſquieu has thrown out as the ſevereſt ridicule, that they are black and you white; that you have lank, long hair, while theirs is ſhort and woolly?</p>
            <p>The more attentively you conſider this ſubject, the more clearly you will percieve, that every plea, which can be advanced upon it, is the plea of

intereſt and tyranny combating humanity and truth. You cannot hide from yourſelf, that every title you can alledge muſt be a title founded upon fraud or violence, and ſupported by open and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> from one to another, or from one to a thouſand maſters, any more than whether a nation be enſlaved by a firſt, or by an hundredth tyrant. There can be no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription pleaded againſt truth and juſtice; and the continuance of the evil is ſo far from juſtifying, that it is an exaggeration of the crime. What would you ſay to a man, in private life, who ſhould pretend to be no thief, becauſe he only bought ſtolen goods; or that he was no villain, becauſe he did not forge a deed himſelf, but only paid another to do it, and enjoyed the eſtate by that honorable ſecurity? Yet this is literally the title which the Americans plead to the unfortunate inhabitants of Africa. You do not go to Africa to buy or ſteal your Negroes; perhaps, becauſe you are too lazy and luxurious: but you encourage an infamous, pitileſs race of men to do it for you, and conſcientiouſly receive the fruits of their crimes. You do not, merciful men, reduce your fellow creatures to ſervitude! No, men of your independent ſpirits, that have taken up arms againſt the government that had protected and eſtabliſhed them, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than pay a tax of three pence<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> that have laid the axe to the root of all human authority, and inſtead of drinking the bitter waters of civil abuſes and preſcriptive obedience, have aſcended to the living fountains of truth, juſtice and nature, would never make flagitious attempts upon the liberties and happineſs of their brethren! Yes, gentlemen, men of liberal minds like yours, acknowledge all mankind to be their equals. Leave hereditary tyrants and their flatterers to make diſtinctions un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to nature, and to degrade one part of the ſpecies to brutes, while they equal the other with gods!—You know that this is the greateſt of all corruptions, and as ſuch you deteſt it.—What! are not all men naturally equal? And are not all civil diſtinctions, when legitimate the permiſſion of the people, and conſequently ſubordinate to their power and controul? Did you not carry the rights of men into the uncultivated deſart and the howling wilderneſs? Not of Frenchmen, nor of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, nor of Engliſhmen, but of men;—men, the firſt and ſupreme diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, who, created for freedom and happineſs, tranſport to every ſoil the inherent prerogatives of their nature.</p>
            <p>"Rome n'eſt plus dans Rome, elle eſt par tout où je ſuis."</p>
            <p>Yes, gentlemen, as you are no longer Engliſhmen, I hope you will pleaſe to be men; and, as ſuch, admit the whole human ſpecies to a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of your unalienable rights. You will not, therefore, drag a trembling wretch from his cottage and his family; you will not tear the child from the arms of his frantic mother, that they may drag on a loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome exiſtence in miſery and chains; you will not make depredations up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your unoffending neighbours, and, after having ſpread deſolation over a fertile country, reduce the innocent inhabitants to ſervitude. To do this, you muſt be monſters, worſe, I fear, than the majority of the Houſe of Commons and the Engliſh Miniſtry<note n="*" place="bottom">Should this doubt appear abſurd, the reader is deſired to remember it was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the year 1776.</note>. But you are men tremblingly alive to all the rights and feelings of the kind, and I believe ſome of you at leaſt are Chriſtians. Your worſt actions, therefore, the greateſt crimes which even your enemies can object, are only that you are the voluntary cauſes of all theſe miſchiefs?—You, you encourage the Engliſh pirate to violate the laws of faith and hoſpitality, and ſtimulate him to new ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes by purchaſing the fruits of his rapine. Your avarice is the torch of treachery and civil war, which deſolates the ſhores of Africa, and ſhakes deſtruction on half the majestic ſpecies of man! . . . . . . .</p>
