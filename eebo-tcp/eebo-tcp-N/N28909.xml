            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>AT the foot of the mountains which ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate Savoy from Switzerland, there lived, at the end of the laſt century, in a humble village, and a yet more humble cottage, a poor Savoyard. In his youth he had travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through Germany with a marmot, and, by the exhibition of this animal's tricks and gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bols, had not only gained a livelihood, but had alſo, by his extraordinary frugality, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a tolerable capital. With this he return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed homewards, reſolving to build himſelf a little cottage in his native country, to take a wife, and to ſpend the remainder of his days in quiet. As he paſſed through Swabia in his way home, he became acquainted with a poor but lively young maiden, who pleaſed him extremely. He made known his ſentiments
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:038544_0003_10125323856A2390"/>
to her, his ſuit was crowned with ſucceſs, and ſhe accompanied him as his wife into Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy.</p>
               <p>After an union of thirty years uninterrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed happineſs, ſhe died, and left him ſix ſons, the three elder of whom were ſettled in France in the buſineſs of cleaning ſhoes; the two next worked in the mines of their own country; and the youngeſt, as his mother's favourite, was ſtill at home. He was a ſtout comely youth of ſeventeen, and would, if bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter dreſſed have excelled in appearance ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Barons and Counts, and have engaged the attention of many fair ladies. "It muſt not go on thus any longer," ſaid his old father to him one day; "here, if you work like a beaſt of burden, you can ſcarcely earn dry bread; follow the example of your brothers, and go into ſome other country. They have ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by this means and ſo did I, and there is no fear of your not doing the ſame. The ſooner you go, the better; I give you my bleſſing, and for your mother's ſake, a dollar for your journey, and thus furniſhed you are ſecured from want."</p>
               <p>The young Wolfgang, for ſuch was the name which his mother had given him, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted the bleſſing and the money, and ſat out the next morning. The charming deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criptions
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:038544_0004_10125325F06B4768"/>
this tender parent had often given him of her native country, had long excited his curioſity, and he now determined to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify it by going thither. Before he arrived there, he laid out his whole capital in mouſe-traps and hatchels, which he underſtood how to make himſelf, and which his father told him were a welcome commodity in every German village. The truth of this he ſoon experienced. He perfectly underſtood the German language, and with the innate elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of all Savoyards, knew ſo well how to recommend his ware to the old mothers and the young maidens, that his capital was often returned in a week with reaſonable profit; beſides which, he had generally a bit of bread given him, ſometimes a dinner or ſupper, and always a night's lodging. By all theſe means he was enabled, as early as from Nuremberg, to remit two dollars to his father by a fellow countryman, who was returning home.</p>
               <p>From Nuremberg he went into Baireuth, and wandered accidentally into the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of the celebrated Fichtelberg, Here, as he came one evening, quite fatigued; into a village, he knocked in vain at ſeveral doors for admiſſion, being every where, to his great ſurpriſe, turned away contumeliouſly, and was thus obliged to do what had ſeldom happened to him, ſeek his night's lodging at
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:038544_0005_101253278FF480D0"/>
the public-houſe. Scarcely had he entered the door when the hoſt came towards him cap in hand, and expreſſed the higheſt ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction at having the happineſs and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of entertaining ſo illuſtrious a gueſt. With a profuſion of theſe compliments, he compelled the Savoyard to go into a little parlour, and, without paying any regard to his remonſtrances againſt this, he called to his wife, who was in the kitchen preparing ſupper for her ſervants—"Kate, give up whatever you are about! kill the fineſt chick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en! mull ſome wine! cook the beſt of every thing that you have in the houſe! the long expected gueſt is arrived! make haſte, and let nothing be wanting!" The hoſteſs wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comed this news with loud acclamations of joy, and prepared to execute theſe orders with the greateſt expedition.</p>
               <p>Wolfgang, who could only imagine that they were in ſome error reſpecting him, now ſeized the hand of the buſy hoſt. "Sir," he ſaid, "you muſt be miſtaken about me; I am only a poor Savoyard who ſells mouſe-traps and hatchels, and how can I, therefore, deſerve ſuch a reception?"</p>

               <p>The hoſt ran up and down, rinſed the glaſſes, brought a clean table-cloth, and clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the tin ſpoons with chalk, while Wolfgang ſat, not knowing what to think of theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations. He was often tempted to doubt whether the hoſt was in his right ſenſes; but all the reſt of his actions, and particularly the accuracy with which he heard him in the next room, noting down to every gueſt his mug of beer, convinced him to the contrary, and increaſed his ſurpriſe.</p>

                  <pb n="12" facs="unknown:038544_0011_101253376BEB87C0"/>The ſupper was ſerved up, with an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred apologies from the hoſt for not being able in ſuch a hurry, to get any thing better. The hoſteſs added herſelf to the company; but, notwithſtanding Wolfgang's moſt ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt ſolicitations, he could not prevail on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther her, or her huſband, to ſit down with him to table; both ſtood behind his chair, and waited his commands. He, who had never been ſo handſomely entertained in his life before, forgot all his ſcruples at the ſight of the ſmoking diſhes; and to the great joy of the hoſteſs, he ate heartily, and drank ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral glaſſes of the light wine of the country to her health.</p>
               <p>After riſing from table, he was, with a thouſand compliments, conducted to the bed-chamber, where the hoſt and hoſteſs intreated him to put up with their mean accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and to conſider, that they had not ſo ſoon expected ſo welcome a gueſt.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II.</head>
               <p>WOLFGANG, as ſoon as he was alone, began to reflect on his unexpected good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. He could not imagine how theſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple came to diſtinguiſh a poor Savoyard by ſuch kind behaviour, unleſs from ſome miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, and only compoſed himſelf by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection of his not having by any means contributed to this. The ſoft bed ſoon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented all farther reflection, for he fell into a ſound ſleep, out of which he was firſt awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened, late the next morning, by a gentle knock at his door. He aroſe, and dreſſing himſelf haſtily, opened it to ſee who was there, when the hoſteſs ſtepped in with coffee, and every thing proper for breakfaſt; hoped her gueſt had ſlept well, and aſked if he would permit a gentleman out of the neighborhood to breakfaſt with him. Wolfgang replied, that he had nothing to command here, and conſequently as little to permit; that a break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt, as well as ſuch a viſit, was to him an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſerved and unexpected compliment, and muſt entirely depend on the gentleman's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to do him this honor.</p>
               <p>The hoſteſs went out, and returned in a few minutes with a rather elderly looking
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:038544_0013_1012533C4DBBE268"/>
gentleman, dreſſed in a ſuit of green clothes laced with gold. Wolfgang's embarraſſment at the ſight of him was very great; he had never been uſed to viſits of this kind, and knew not what to underſtand by it. The only conjecture that ſeemed plauſible to him was, that this gentleman was come with the view of ſetting the hoſt right reſpecting the incomprehenſible error that he had fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to with regard to him. It was therefore no wonder that he ſtood quite confounded, and began to tremble, and, but from the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs that he had in no way contributed to this error, he would not have been able to ſupport himſelf; but confuſed as he was, he ſoon ſaw, to his great aſtoniſhment, that his viſiter was not in a better ſituation: for after making many ſilent bows, and then a profu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of compliments, begging pardon for the liberty which he had taken, and ſpeaking of unexpected happineſs and honor, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained quite at a loſs; and endeavoured, by coughing frequently, to conceal his confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p>Little as Wolfgang knew of the world, he ſoon perceived that this gentleman was not come to threaten, or injure him in any way; and he waited quietly for what was to follow this extraordinary behaviour. He entreated the ſtranger to ſit down, who, in return, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:038544_0014_1012533ECED31EC8"/>
him that he could not on any account obey his commands, till he did the ſame him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. They then ſat down together, and the buſy hoſteſs began to pour out the coffee.</p>
               <p>Wolfgang now learned from her converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that his viſiter was a perſon of rank, and Lord of the Manor of this village; and that he had a fine caſtle about a mile and a half from thence, where it was his pleaſure to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain all foreigners.</p>
               <p>The noble Baron, who<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as I ſhall conceal his real name, will be called the Baron von Tiefenthal, confirmed every thing that the hoſteſs ſaid, and added, that he would eſteem it a real happineſs and honor if Wolfgang would viſit him, and ſpend ſome time at his caſtle. Much ſurpriſed as he had already been with the Baron's viſit, he was now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely more ſo at his invitation; his amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was indeed ſo great, that he had not power to make him any anſwer.</p>

"A charming, beautiful, moſt lovely, delicious creature our noble Lady Louiſa; ſhe is now only ſixteen, but has the underſtanding of a woman of eighty; ſhe reads continually, plays on the harpſichord—in ſhort, far and near you will not find her equal.

               <p>She withdrew, with a deep courteſy, and left Wolfgang to look into the box at his pleaſure; it ſtood there for ſome time un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locked, but at laſt he opened it, and broke out into new wonder and tranſports at the ſight of the ſplendid clothes which it contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I ſhould be too diffuſe if I were to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe all the awkward, comical proceſs of his dreſſing; he was more than an hour about it, but was at laſt equipped like one of the firſt beaux. He had on a ſuit of blue laced clothes; his long black hair, which he uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:038544_0020_1012534DD8C53B78"/>
wore twiſted in a hard queue, was untied, and careleſsly put up with a comb, the reſt of it fell in ringlets about his face, better than any hair dreſſer could have done it, as it curl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed naturally; a large hat, which, after the cuſtom of that time, was alſo laced and orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with a feather, gave him completely the look of a cavalier; at leaſt, ſo the hoſteſs aſſerted, who had been for ſome time at the door; this was confirmed afterwards by the hoſt, and, at laſt, by the Baron von Tiefen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thal himſelf, who embraced him, called him his newly-found, his ſecond ſon; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting him to the carriage, drove away with him with the greateſt delight.</p>
               <p>Wolfgang permitted all this in ſilence; he really believed himſelf dreaming, and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed awakening too ſoon from ſo agreeable an illuſion. He was continually examining his fine clothes, or ſtroking down the ruffles of his ſhirt, and felt the greateſt impatience to have an opportunity of viewing himſelf in a looking-glaſs. The Baron was very talka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and often entreated him quite to forget his former rank. Wolfgang anſwered merely in monoſyllables, and firſt remarked, almoſt at the end of their ride, that he had been ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ungrateful to the hoſt and hoſteſs, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thanked them for the generous reception which they had given him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="unknown:038544_0021_1012534F738D8E38"/>"If you are ſo conſcientious," anſwered Tiefenthal, "you may do this to-day, but perhaps you will be able to reward theſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in another manner." As he ended this ſpeech, they ſtopped at the caſtle. A ſervant aſſiſted them both out of the carriage; and Wolfgang going up the ſteps to the houſe, by the ſide of his new hoſt, was carried by him into a room, where they found his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter palying upon the harpſichord. "There, Louiſa," ſaid the Baron, "I bring you a gueſt who has promiſed to walk, and ſing, and read pretty books with you, to paſs away your time when I am hunting."</p>
               <p>After this introduction Wolfgang made ſome awkward bows, and would have ſaid ſomething of the favor and honor of being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with her; but he could not arrange his ideas properly, and was obliged to leave it to her imagination to fill up what he had murmured in broken ſentences. Louiſa, who had been already apprized of his arrival, paid her compliments to him, and congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated herſelf on having the happineſs of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming acquainted with a man who was ſo much of a traveller. "Italy," ſhe ſaid," has always been deſcribed to me as a Paradiſe, and I hope to hear from you a more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar account of that charming country." Wolf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gang, whom Nature had endowed with a
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:038544_0022_1012535222DF3B18"/>
good portion of wit and underſtanding, now ſummoned all his powers in order to make ſome reply to the fair lady. He aſſured her, ſomewhat diffuſely indeed, but yet with a great deal of <hi>naivete,</hi> that it was impoſſible Italy ſhould deſerve to be called a Paradiſe, becauſe it wanted the principal requiſite, a fair Eve; but that Germany juſtly deſerved that appellation, becauſe he now enjoyed in it the happineſs of paying his reſpects to the faireſt Eve in the world.</p>
               <p>Father and daughter united in admiring, and laughing at this ſally, and Wolfgang got time to examine himſelf in a large looking glaſs, to which he ſtood oppoſite. He found that, dreſſed in his fine clothes, he was really handſome, and might very well perform the part of cavalier: this conviction made him vain, and leſſened his baſhfulneſs; he look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about more unreſervedly, and fixed his eyes full on Louiſa's; ſhe was not able to bear this rather free look, and caſt her's mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly to the ground. Wolfgang was a very fine man, and Louiſa one of the moſt delicate of woman; but there was a ſtriking contraſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, as will appear from the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſcriptions.</p>
               <p>Wolfgang was in perſon tall, ſtrong, and well-made; his complexion was ſun-burnt,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:038544_0023_10125355BADD2B08"/>
he had a high colour in his cheeks, and large black eyes, with altogether a handſome face, and long ſhining black hair.</p>
               <p>Louiſa was rather little, her form remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably fine, if any thing rather too ſlender, her hair very light, her complexion delicately fair, the colour in her cheeks pale, and her eyes of the cleareſt blue.</p>
               <p>A ſummons to table put an end to their converſation. Louiſa preſented her hand to Wolfgang; but he, inſtead of accepting it, made a ſilent bow, and went out of the room before her, and ſhe followed, in the full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction that this muſt be the cuſtom in Italy. His ruſtic behaviour at table was viewed by her in the ſame light; and informing her opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of him, ſhe determined that when he was better acquainted with German manners, and had acquired a little French politeneſs, he would be a very agreeable man, and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſerving her eſteem.</p>

               <p>THE company at table had juſt emptied their laſt glaſs of wine, in which the Baron and his daughter had once more drank the

               <p>All his former confuſion was now renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for he knew not how he ought to behave to this lady, and yet ſincerely wiſhed not to put his kind hoſt to the bluſh for him. Tief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enthal had in the meantime conducted the Counteſs to the ſofa, and turning to Wolf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gang, ſaid, "Her Excellency the Counteſs von M—." Then turning towards her, and preſenting him to her, "This," he ſaid, "is a very good friend of mine from abroad, who will do me the honor of ſpending ſome time at my caſtle." Wolfgang bowed very profoundly to her, and to his aſtoniſhment ſhe continued ſtanding, and returned his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutation in the moſt courteous manner.</p>

honour, this happineſs very ſtrongly. I am ſo moved, ſo—ſo—I ſhould not be able to reſtrain my tears, if I had not once heard that illuſtrious ladies think tears a diſgrace."</p>

               <p>AS Wolfgang and the Counteſs got out of the carriage, ſhe preſented her hand to him, and he, by this time, underſtood that he ought to accept a hand ſo offered. They went arm in arm, through the dark avenue, and the Counteſs diſplayed all her ſenſibility in admiring the beauties of nature, on which
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:038544_0036_101253760428F8D0"/>
Wolfgang let her expatiate without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, for he was occupied with feelings of a different kind. His companion's arm lay negligently in his, and the novelty of this ſituation to him, excited emotions which he had never felt before. He now firſt ſaw, as his eyes wandered inſenſibly towards her, that the Counteſs was a young and beautiful woman. Her large eyes, her full cheeks, and fine perſon, pleaſed him extremely, and fully employed his imagination. Might I, thought he, but once call ſuch a woman mine, ſuch a woman muſt be heaven upon earth! I would willingly part with my laced coat again, willingly work for my bread theſe ſix years, if I might but one day have ſuch a woman; willingly—But it would be tireſome, if I were to relate all the projects which came into his head. Thoſe, who have been in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar circumſtances, will be very well able to fill up the chaſm which I leave here; and thoſe, who have never felt any thing of the kind, will thank me for dropping the ſubject.</p>
               <p>Seldom, very ſeldom, and that only in phlegmatic mortals, is love accuſtomed to come on ſlowly, ſtep by ſtep: it comes on, if I may ſo expreſs myſelf, in full gallop, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes the ſecure unawares, and generally wounds him mortally. Like the water-ſpout no rain, not even a ſingle drop of moiſture
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:038544_0037_101253779E8314B8"/>
previouſly falling, announces its approach; the cloud burſts ſuddenly, and the unprepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed traveller, finds himſelf up to the neck in water, and carried forward by the potent ſtream, before he knows whence the power came which hurries him irreſiſtibly down in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the valley. Any body is welcome to laugh at this ſimile; it appears laughable even to me, and, nevertheleſs, I ſhall let it remain; becauſe a water-ſpout and impetuous love have often very ſimilar effects, both being deſtructive, but paſſing away again rapidly. The black cloud promiſes refreſhment to the thirſty land, and always lays it deſolate. The lover hopes to enjoy the moſt perfect felicity in the arms of his beloved, and ſinks under the too abundant poſſeſſion of the happineſs for which he ſighed.</p>
               <p>But to return to Wolfgang, whom my readers left, like the unſuſpecting traveller up to the neck in water, or to lay aſide my ſimile, falling deſperately in love. The Counteſs, at laſt, quite tired of talking with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having any anſwer—for it is very hard to find oneſelf not attended to—was ſilent for ſome time, and then aſked him, rather with a tone of reproof, why he ſpoke ſo little, and paid no attention to what ſhe ſaid? Wolf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gang took no more notice of this queſtion, than he had done of what had paſſed before.
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:038544_0038_1012537A12540058"/>
He looked towards heaven, and offered up a ſilent prayer that he might one day be bleſſed with the object of his wiſhes, forgetting that ſhe was now by his ſide. His perſevering ſilence made the Counteſs obſerve him atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, and, not unacquainted with love and its ſymptoms, ſhe ſoon decided that he was under the influence of that paſſion; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectured that his imagination now carried him back to the beloved of his heart, with whom he was perhaps wiſhing to enjoy this glorious evening. As nothing is more tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting than a curioſity to learn the truth of ſuch, an idea, ſhe reſolved to gratify it; and her ſpeaking only being of no effect, ſhe took more forcible means of rouſing him. "Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor," ſhe cried, and ſhook him by the arm, "where are you? What is come to you?"</p>

               <p>IN the certain conviction that this was a meſſenger from the Baron von Tiefenthal, ſent to bring him back to his caſtle, Wolf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gang followed him, and without obſerving the way which they went, gave himſelf up to his own thoughts. Theſe, as is natural to ſuppoſe, dwelt entirely on the beautiful Counteſs. She had made ſo forcible an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion on his heart, it was ſo full of her charms, that he beheld nothing but her image. He was even thinking ſeriouſly, for impetuous love is very bold, how he might declare his paſſion the next day; as his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductor, by ſaying, "Here we are; pleaſe to walk in," awakened him from his agreeable dream. To his utter aſtoniſhment he now firſt ſaw that they were arrived at a poor cottage, the door of which the man in the

great coat opened, and again deſired him to go in. Already too far advanced to return, and ſtill believing that he might perhaps find the Baron von Tiefenthal waiting for him here, he ſtepped into the room. It had been growing duſk for ſome time, and the one little window of this place being very dirty, both together occaſioned an almoſt Egyptian darkneſs.

James came in at laſt with the ſo much wiſhed for candle, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded indeed only a ſcanty, but yet ſufficient light for the diſplay of the bare black walls of this room, and a tall haggard-looking man, who ſat upon a decayed bench in one corner of it, reſting his arm upon a ſtill more decayed table, and looking earneſtly at Wolfgang. His white hair teſtified his being old, and his clothes, which betrayed indigence, that he had been a ſoldier, as there might yet be diſcriminated upon them the facing of an uniform.</p>

He put them, with great coolneſs, under his arm, took the light with the other hand, and going up to Wolfgang, "Sir, he ſaid, "we have never ſeen each other before; and woe to me, woe to you, that we are obliged to ſee one another now, follow me." They went together to the ſide of a miſerable ſtraw bed, upon which lay a woman, whoſe face wore the pallid hue of death; her eyes were cloſed, and her whole appearance was that of extreme illneſs.</p>

Five and forty years I have ſerved my prince with inviolable fidelity; I have ſought valiantly in ſupport of his rights; been five times wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and am now, in my old age, diſmiſſed without reward as a cripple, and am even deſtitute of a maintenance!—Dear God and Father in heaven, thou art an all-wiſe Being! thou knoweſt the moſt ſecret thoughts of men! before thy all ſeeing eyes, I now ſtand in the undiſguiſed ſimplicity of my heart, and aſk thee if I have ever murmured at theſe things? have ever once complained of this injuſtice? have ever repented ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding my blood in the ſervice of my country? Oh be thou a ſevere Judge over me, if I do not ſpeak the truth! If I have uttered a falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, annihilate me, rob me of the only hopes which have conſoled me in all my mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, that thou wilt reward me hereafter for all that I have ſuffered here.</p>
                  <p>"The joys of life have been meaſured to me with a penurious hand. Three times on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, during the long courſe of my exiſtence, have I enjoyed perfect happineſs; once when my excellent, my charming, my beloved wife united her hand to mine, when ſhe vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be mine for ever, and courageouſly to

to ſhare with me whatever afflictions thou mighteſt ſend for our trial; again, when this ſon was born to me;—and, for the laſt time, when this daughter came into the world. But that joy was of ſhort duration; for her life was her mother's death; her birth robbed me of my ſupport, my joy, my all!</p>
                  <p>"Lord! Father of all men; Searcher of all hearts; thou knoweſt the agony of my ſoul, the weight of ſorrow with which I was oppreſſed, as I approached her corpſe, and, for the laſt time, claſped her clay cold hand, and bade her farewel for ever; Oh the feeling of that moment; it was like the laſt gaſp of ſuffocation; But I recovered my fortitude, repreſſed the tears which were beginning to flow, and ſeizing my children, folded them to my breaſt, and cried, 'You ſhall one day repair to me what I have loſt, and thou Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Heaven, wilt reward to the deceaſed a thouſand fold, her love and fidelity!'</p>
                  <p>"Eternal God! I now preſent myſelf again before thy judgment ſeat, with theſe two children, the only treaſure which thou ever gaveſt me, and aſk thee if I have not fulfilled my paternal duty with the ſtricteſt integrity? If I have not done every thing for them that lay in my power? If I have not often eaten the coarſeſt bread myſelf, that I might be able to buy the beſt for my poor little ones? If I

have not as they grew older, often pinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed myſelf to pay a maſter for them, who would inſtruct them in thy religion, and in various kinds of knowledge? If I— but I will not reckon the performance of my duty any merit, for it coſt me little, as I found my greateſt pleaſure in cheriſhing theſe young plants. I ſeek merely to prove that I performed my duty faithfully, and therefore had reaſon to hope for reward, not puniſhment. And yet, omnipotent, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous God! yet is the latter in full, in over-full meaſure, fallen on me!</p>

to this inexperienced creature, and won her innocent heart; polluted her pure ſoul with voluptuous ideas, painted to her imagination the moſt charming repreſentations of the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and beguiled her of her honour and peace of mind.</p>
                  <p>"When the poor ſallen one perceived the conſequences of her folly, and mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it with the bittereſt tears and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, the ſeducer ſwore to be a father to her child, and left her, as he ſaid, only to obtain his father's conſent to their union, and then return to her arms. Daily ſhe expected his arrival, but daily expected it in vain. A letter, ſent without her know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, acquainted me with her ſorrows, and I flew to conſole her. The pain which I felt at the firſt ſight of her, I will not deſcribe, Oh God! thou waſt witneſs of my ſufferings, thou heardſt, for the firſt time, my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints; The lovely roſe was faded, her happineſs annihilated, all my hopes trodden in the duſt, all my proſpects darkened! Lord, in thy preſence I ſwore to demand revenge, to take revenge on the villain who had ſo ſhamefully abandoned her, and who, perhaps in ſome diſtant place, makes a jeſt of her's, and her afflicted father's ſorrows. My heart was hardened, but her tears ſoftened it; and, at her irreſiſtable entreaties I promiſed to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give

if your heart be not of ſtone, if your ſoul be not quite depraved, pity this poor creature, who in ſpite of all her ſorrows, all the name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs miſeries which you have brought on her loves you ſtill, tenderly, ſincerely loves you! Inhuman wretch, hear how ſhe ſhames you, what a pearl you have caſt away! This child died two days ago, but we have not ventured to take it from her yet. In her ſhort intervals of recollection, ſhe preſſes it earneſtly to her breaſt, and laments that her only remembrance of you ſhould become the prey of corruption. Ah you weep, you are moved! God has bleſſed my words! I have finiſhed—do you begin now! but this I muſt tell you, had you beheld this ſcene unmoved I would have fired theſe piſtols through your head, and then ſurrended myſelf up to juſtice. I have killed the murderer of my child, and of my grandchild, I would have ſaid; condemn me if you can condemn me!"</p>
                  <p>The ſight of the ſuffering female and the dead child, with the harſh language of the injured father, had made ſo ſtrong an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion on Wolfgang's ingenuous heart, that he wept bitterly, and inwardly curſed the author of all theſe ſorrows as fervently as the wretched parent himſelf. It was now his turn to ſpeak, for the old man was ſilent, and
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:038544_0054_10125396DE88F0B8"/>
awaited his determination; but he was too much affected, at preſent, to attempt enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the explanation neceſſary to his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quittal, and indeed felt that it would be in pain till the ſwooning female was recovered. For as it plainly appeared from the old man's diſcourſe that her ſeducer was not known ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to him or his ſon, ſhe was conſequently the only perſon who could, at once, ſet right this miſtake. As he began therefore to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover himſelf, and to reflect on what had paſſed, he waited anxiouſly for the moment when her returning ſenſes would enable her to ſee this error, and acknowledge his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence.</p>
                  <p>But this moment came not. Tortured and debilitated as ſhe had been by all her ſufferings, this unfortunate creature could not ſupport the account of her betrayer's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing walking arm in arm with another wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, at the very time when, according to her hopes and ideas, he was returning to her. This laſt blow ſnapped the thread of life; and while her father was endeavouring to ſoften the heart of her ſeducer towards her, her ſoul was flown to a better world, there to receive a recompence for all its wrongs.</p>
                  <p>The old man, who watched Wolfgang's emotions, and ſaw how earneſtly he looked at his daughter, went up at laſt to her bed.
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:038544_0055_1012539B30461BC8"/>
"Clara," he ſaid, "dear Clara, revive, awake to joy, to happineſs, your deceiver weeps, he loves you ſtill: How often, with the bare poſſibility of this being ſo, have I rouſed you from the ſtrongeſt ſwoon, will you not revive at the certainty of it?

<stage>(sinking back)</stage>
Ah ſhe is! ſhe is!"—</p>
                  <p>James, who had hitherto ſtood ſilent, now ſprang forwards and raiſed the old man upon the bench; then, with a countenance full of anxiety, he approached his ſiſter's bed, and, in a mournful tone, confirmed the old man's apprehenſions. A long and awful pauſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued; the father and ſon, in deep deſponden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, felt themſelves deſtitute of all conſolation; and Wolfgang, full of anxiety as to what the iſſue of this affair might now be, ſought in vain for any hopes of its coming to a happy concluſion. The old man at laſt broke ſilence: like a lioneſs, robbed of her young, he ſtarted up ſuddenly, and ſeized the trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling Wolfgang by the breaſt—"You have ſnatched her away from me, You have killed her," he cried with a dreadful voice. "Are you omnipotent, then revive her again! but if you are not, then deſpair, no, pray, pray, your hour is come: you muſt be ſacrificed
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:038544_0056_1012539DA1D24F58"/>

Your father alſo ſhall feel what it is to have his deareſt hopes borne to the grave, to be, with one ſtroke, robbed of all the joy of life, Why did he give exiſtence to ſuch a villain?"</p>
                  <p>Wolfgang, who now perceived that ſilence would only aggravate his misfortune, who was conſcious of his innocence, and that, by an extraordinary accident, he was in danger of being made to expiate the fault of another, had now recourſe to entreaties. He conjur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the raving father to be calm for ſome mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes, and hear what he had to ſay; and, if he did not then find him quite innocent of this crime, he would willingly undergo the ignominious torture of the moſt dreadful death that could be inflicted on him.</p>

               <p>As he ſaid this, he fired a piſtol at Wolf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gang, but as he trembled extremely, both from age and paſſion, the ball only paſſed by his head without hitting him.</p>
               <p>Self-defence and preſervation are me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical. Every one who falls, without knowing it, puts his hand before his face, as in the greateſt danger of being injured by the fall; and every one who is attacked, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors to defend himſelf on the ſame mechanical principle. When the old man,
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:038544_0059_101253A4F3412F70"/>
therefore, aimed the ſecond piſtol at Wolf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gang, the latter ſeized his arm, and ſtruggled with him for it. James haſtened to the aſſiſtance of his father, and, at this moment the piſtol went off, and ſhot him through the head, as he was bending forward to lay hold of Wolfgang's arm.</p>
               <p>James fell inſtantly, and, in his fall, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed the light which ſtood by Clara's corpſe. The old man had been thrown down in the ſcuffle; and, not knowing that he had killed his ſon, he called to him for help, and raved with the greateſt deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
               <p>Wolfgang, who merely wiſhed to ſave his life, not revenge himſelf, took this oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of trying to make his eſcape. He had reached the door juſt as it was opened, in a great hurry, by a peaſant who lived in the ſame cottage, and who now came in with his ſervants on the alarm of hearing the piſtols, with a firebrand, by way of light, in his hand. They forced Wolfgang back; and ſeeing James in the agonies of death, and the old man ſtruggling upon the ground raving with all the frenzy of deſpair, on the murder of his child, it is no wonder that they took the former for the perpetrator of this deed, and, without liſtening to his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes,
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:038544_0060_101253A7656C6220"/>
bound him, and dragged him out of the houſe directly. They threw him down in the yard, and one of the ſervants was left to watch him, while the others returned into the room to the aſſiſtance of thoſe within.</p>
               <p>After a ſhort interval, the peaſant came out again, and ordered his ſervant to make haſte, and put the horſes to the waggon, and carry the murderer before the Juſtice imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately. He ſtood guard himſelf while the ſervant went to execute this order; and though Wolfgang earneſtly endeavoured to prove his innocence to him, his proofs made not the leaſt impreſſion on the peaſant. "Defend yourſelf as you can before the Juſtice," he ſaid; "it is of no uſe your doing it to me. But it will be a hard matter for you to prove your innocence there. The wounded man is already dead; the old man lies in the laſt extremity, and will ſoon be dead alſo. How it is with the daughter I do not know yet myſelf, but probably not much better, for ſhe is as cold as ice, and as ſtiff as a board. It is very poſſible that you may have the lives of all theſe to anſwer for, I would not take one of them on my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience."</p>
               <p>Wolfgang, who ſhuddered as much at this account as the good-hearted peaſant himſelf,
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:038544_0061_101253A903453FF0"/>
now entreated that they would carry him either to the Baron von Tiefenthal, or the Counteſs von M—. "Both know me," he added, "and both will atteſt my inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence."</p>
               <p>"Tell all this to our Juſtice," ſaid the peaſant; "if he believes what you ſay, it is no concern of mine; I have fulfilled my duty, and waſh my hands of it. But you may be ſure that I ſhall openly witneſs againſt you what I ſaw and heard. It is deteſtable to murder any man, but it is doubly deteſtable and cruel to murder ſuch excellent people; and if you are the ſtray bird, whom the unhappy young creature ſought for ſo earneſtly, the Lord be merciful to your poor ſoul! You will then certainly be damned; for the favour of the great is not current in heaven; the nobleman reckons for no more than the peaſant there."</p>
               <p>With ſuch very poor conſolation the cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ager entertained his priſoner till the ſervant had put the horſes to the waggon. Wolf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gang begged that if they would not quite un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do the cords with which he was bound, they would, at leaſt, looſen them a little, as they obſtructed the circulation of the blood, and occaſioned him almoſt intolerable pain. But his petition was not attended to; they threw him into the waggon, and the ſervant ſet off with it directly.</p>

                  <p>"The devil fellow, do not talk ſo long! recollect that we are not Judges! Hollman, do you get upon the horſe, for he is not able to ride yet. Go on as faſt as you can, that you may be ſoon over the frontiers, and ſtop at the oak. We ſhall expect you there, or at leaſt not be far behind."</p>

                  <pb n="65" facs="unknown:038544_0064_101253B127359900"/>Hollman got upon the horſe, and threw his mantle to Wolfgang. "There," ſaid he, "wrap yourſelf in that, and ſleep away your fear; for when we get home, you muſt be jovial. We have all reſolved to drink your health to night." He now gave the horſes a whip, and drove on to the left. The troop of horſemen followed them at firſt, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards took another route.</p>
               <p>To deſcribe Wolfgang's feelings is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. Of all the enigmatical occurrences which had befallen him for the laſt two days the dreadful incidents at the cottage, and his preſent extraordinary deliverance appear-to him the moſt ſo; and though he could only ſuppoſe, as in the former inſtance, that they originated in miſtake, he perplexed himſelf in vain to find out from whence theſe miſtakes could ariſe, and becauſe ſo confuſed with a multiplicity of conjectures on the ſubject, that he lay, for ſome time, like a perſon in a dream. But, as his blood began to circulate again freely, and reſtored the full powers of his underſtanding, he gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally loſt the recollection of his paſt, in the examination of his preſent ſituation; and, from the ſingular diſcourſe and behaviour of his deliverers, he ſoon concluded that he was not in very good company. At firſt he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to enter into converſation with his
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:038544_0065_101253B2C520ED60"/>
driver; but when he conſidered that, by this means, they might eaſily diſcover their error reſpecting himſelf, and that this man might not be pleaſed to find he was carrying an entire ſtranger, he thought it beſt to be ſilent. Reflecting then on the fate of the poor ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, and the indifference with which he was murdered, he believed, not without reaſon, that the end of this adventure was to be dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and therefore determined, while it was poſſible, to make his eſcape.</p>
               <p>As he made this reſolution, they were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up a ſteep, woody hill. It was ſo dark that Wolfgang could ſee neither the horſes nor driver; and taking advantage of this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable obſcurity, he crept ſlowly and ſilent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of the waggon. They were then at the top of the hill, and to his great joy the man drove on very faſt.</p>
               <p>Alone, and without any knowledge of the country, Wolfgang ſtood, for ſome time, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decided what courſe to purſue. At firſt he thought of going back to a village at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the hill, through which they had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; but then recollecting that the horſemen might be behind, whom he by no means wiſhed to meet, he gave up that idea, and ſought for a bye-way, which might carry him in ſecurity, either to the right or left of the
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:038544_0066_101253B53AF2CA30"/>
road. After groping forward for a little while, he ſaw, notwithſtanding the darkneſs, a road open to the left, upon which he walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forward as faſt as poſſible. This became gradually narrower, and was ſo ſteep and rugged that poor Wolfgang laid down at laſt quite tired, glad rather to await the return of day there, than to go on any farther in ſuch uncertainty.</p>
               <p>He ſoon fell aſleep, and did not awake again till the ſun was riſen, and gave him an opportunity of examining his new lodging, which was in a craggy dell amidſt ſome high rocks, from whence, in the dark, he muſt have vainly endeavoured to find his way out. After clambering about now for a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able time, he came to a kind of path which led him from his rockey vale into one of a far more agreeable nature. A beautiful mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, enamelled with flowers, and ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a thick wood, lay before him; and the lowing of a little herd of cattle, which was grazing not far off, gave him hopes that he was near ſome inhabited place. Still trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling from the yeſterday's adventure, he wiſhed firſt to ſee ſomething of the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of this valley from a diſtance before he ventured amongſt them, and with this view ſtood for ſome time under a tree; but as he ſaw no living creatures beſides the herd,
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:038544_0067_101253B886B44730"/>
which could not at all ſatisfy his curioſity, he ventured at laſt to go on, and ſoon came in ſight of a ſmall neat cottage. Agitated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween hopes and fears, he went thither, wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in his mantle, and knocked at the door, wiſhing to obtain there both the means of ſatisfying his hunger, and a guide to conduct him on his way.</p>
               <p>After repeated knocking, an old woman came to the door, aſked him, in a very rough manner, why he knocked ſo violently, and what he wanted there?</p>

                  <speaker>Wolfgang.</speaker>
                  <p>"Dear mother, I loſt myſelf yeſterday in this ſolitary country. I ſlept laſt night in the wood. I do not know my way, and ſeek now for a guide who may conduct me again to the road."</p>

               <p>Wolfgang followed her joyfully into a neat little room, the walls of which were hung with very pretty prints, and altogether gave him the idea that it could not belong to a quite common poſſeſſor. He had juſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted the chair which was offered him, as he ſaw, in one corner of the room, a young
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:038544_0068_101253BAF61A7E90"/>
maiden in a neat peaſant's dreſs, who was combing out her long hair, and did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to concern herſelf with the entrance of a ſtranger. "Make haſte, and get yourſelf ready," ſaid the old woman to her, and then went out to cook her porridge. The maiden now finiſhed her employment, plaited up her hair, and turned round to their gueſt.</p>
               <p>"Good morning, Sir," ſhe ſaid, ſmiling; "from whence comeſt thou ſo early?" It ſeemed to Wolfgang as if he had heard this voice before, He looked at her, and his ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe was excited to the higheſt degree; for not only her voice, but her face, her whole figure, her manner, were perfectly like the Counteſs von M—, with whom he was walking the evening before. Doubting, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the poſſibility of finding her here, he looked at the maiden again, and the reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance appeared to him ſo ſtrong, that his doubts began to give way to the evidence of his eyes; and he was juſt going to aſk her by what miracle ſhe was there, and in that dreſs, as the old woman came in with a bowl of porridge, and interrupted his intended queſtions.</p>

               <p>The maiden took a little baſket of cherries upon her arm, and went out without even looking at Wolfgang; whoſe aſtoniſhment, during this converſation, had exceeded all that he had felt before, and by no effort of his underſtanding could he form any conjecture that ſeemed plauſible enough to elucidate this myſtery. The teſtimony of his ſenſes almoſt convinced him that the maiden, who had juſt left the room, was the Counteſs von M—, with whom he had been walking
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:038544_0072_101253C4C955B988"/>
the preceding evening, and from whom he was ſo unpleaſantly ſeparated; and the ſight of her rekindled in his boſom the paſſion he then felt for her, and which the unfortunate adventure of the night had ſuppreſſed, but not extinguiſhed. Several times he was about to aſk her the reaſon of her being there, and in ſo different a dreſs; but her not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing to know him, and her generally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different and even repulſive behaviour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him checked this inclination.</p>
               <p>As he ſtill farther revolved in his mind the ſtrange circumſtances of the Counteſs being there in that dreſs; being ſent out to watch for him, and invite him thither; of her behaving ſo kindly to him the day before, and now, as if ſhe did not know him; of how they knew that he would come that way; and how he, a poor Savoyard, could be of any importance to their happineſs, he became more and more perplexed. Unable to ſolve this in any other way, he began at laſt to think that he was purſued by ſome hoſtile enchanter, who by his deluſions brought him into all theſe unaccountable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures.</p>
               <p>Some old romances, in which he had learnt to read, had rather given him a turn for the marvellous; and his heated imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:038544_0073_101253C662B325F0"/>
repreſented the probability of this, till he felt ſatisfied that all which had befallen him was the effect of ſorcery, and he ſat in the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt anxiety, expecting new wonders to ariſe every moment.</p>
               <p>In the meanwhile the old woman, whoſe face nearly reſembled the phyſiognomy of a witch, as they are deſcribed in Feenmarchen, and other romances of the kind, was ſetting the room in order. Wolfgang, who examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her accurately during this time, took her for the wife of the ſorcerer, and had juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to be on his guard againſt her, as ſhe had finiſhed her buſineſs, and came towards him.</p>

Determined, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, not to remain here, he got out of the window, and ran forwards, He had ſcarcely reached the wood, when he ſaw the old wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and two peaſants going to the houſe.

               <p>AFTER walking till he was quite faint and tired, Wolfgang pauſed, and took off the mantle given him in the night by the horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who drove the waggon, and which he had from that time kept wrapped about him, and folding it up, carried it under his arm. By the height of the ſun and his extreme hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, he gueſſed it muſt be about noon, as he came to a more open part of the wood, which he judged to be near the end of it, and going on with renewed alacrity at this proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, he ſoon arrived at its termination. The joy which this at firſt gave him was of ſhort duration; for on looking down a valley directly before him, he perceived, to his utter diſmay, that he was oppoſite the ſame houſe from whence he had eſcaped that morning. Firmly convinced now that he was enchanted and conſtrained by the art of the old woman to return to this place, he had almoſt reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to reſign himſelf quietly to a fate which ſeemed unavoidable, as he heard a voice not
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:038544_0076_101253CE94AF6518"/>
far from him; and giving way mechanically to his fear, he ſprung into the thicket, and concealed himſelf under a buſh. He diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed the ſound of footſteps very plainly, and looking ſtedfaſtly towards the quarter from whence they came, to his great aſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment ſaw the Counteſs von M—ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, dreſſed as a lady. She was read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and walked ſlowly, followed by two ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, one of whom he immediately recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected as aſſiſting to put him into the carriage the day before. A little dog, which was run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning after her, coming up to his hiding-place, began barking ſo violently that the Counteſs took notice of it, and ſtopping, ordered one of the ſervants to ſee what occaſioned his making ſuch a noiſe. Poor Wolfgang was now ſoon diſcovered lying, drawn together in the ſmalleſt poſſible compaſs; and like a hair when it is ſurpriſed, ſitting, looking at the dog, not knowing which way to fly; and the man returned to his miſtreſs with the infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, that the foreign gentleman, who was with her yeſterday, lay not far off under a buſh.</p>
               <p>"How, the Signor here!" cried out the Lady, and tried to make her way towards him. Now or never; you muſt fly the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantreſs, thought Wolfgang, and choſe the

former. As he heard her drawing near, he therefore ſtarted up, and ran into the thicket. The noiſe that he made betrayed his flight to the Counteſs, who called very earneſtly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, "Stop, Signor! only hear me! I have ſomething very important to ſay to you. Indeed I will not aſk you what you were do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing here!" But all her entreaties to him to ſtop, had no other effect than to increaſe his impatience to get away.</p>
               <p>As long as I can eſcape this Syren's voice by flying, thought he, it is happy for me, while he aſſiduouſly endeavoured to get through the underwood. His purpoſe was ſoon anſwered, for the Counteſs was not able to follow him, as her clothes hung in the buſhes: and before ſhe could diſengage them, he was out of the ſound of her voice. He arrived at laſt, quite fatigued, at the foot of a high hill, which he muſt either paſs over, or return through the wood; his fear decided for the former, but his extreme wearineſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced him to reſt a little before he commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced this arduous undertaking.</p>
               <p>He had wrapped himſelf again in his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and laid down in hopes of getting to ſleep as the approach of ſomebody diſturbed and alarmed him. He looked up with anxiety
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:038544_0078_101253D3C0EDB390"/>
and ſaw to his utter amazement that it was the Counteſs von M—, as he had ſeen her in the morning at the old woman's in her peaſant's dreſs, and with the baſket on her arm. Though he crept cloſe to the hill, (for he was unable to fly) it was impoſſible but ſhe muſt ſee him, as ſhe came along a foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>path, which he had not perceived before, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly oppoſite to where he lay. She ſtared at him, and ſtood ſtill in apparant irreſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In order to conceal her embarraſſment, ſhe began to tie her ſhoe-ribbon, which had got looſe, and glanced ſideways at Wolfgang as he ſtood there in his mantle like a ſtatue. He had now an opportunity of ſeeing one of the prettieſt feet in the world; but he purpoſely turned aſide his head, to avoid, as he believed, a temptation thrown in his way by the devil.</p>
               <p>When ſhe had tied her ſhoe, ſhe ſurveyed him attentively, but did not dare to advance; and he was ſtill ſilent, but involuntarily ſtole a look every now and then at this charming creature. At laſt ſhe began to ſpeak. "Sir," ſhe ſaid, timidly, and came two ſteps nearer to him, "I hope I have nothing to fear from thee. I am haſtening home, for my mother is certainly expecting me with impatience, and I entreat thee not to prevent my going."</p>

               </sp>
               <p>She now took courage, and darted by him as quick as an arrow. When ſhe was about three ſteps from him, ſhe turned about, and ſaid, "Sir if thou art the unhappy murderer whom they have been ſeeking for to-day in the wood, fly directly over the frontiers; go up the hill to the right, and ſtraight down from thence thou wilt find the way, and mayſt get there before night." Having ſaid this, ſhe ſoon vaniſhed, and left him in the greateſt confuſion.</p>
               <p>Nothing was really more probable than that he was taken for a murderer, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued as ſuch; yet it ſeemed much more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable to him that this caution was only the deceit of the ſorcereſs, who, by means of her colleague, wanted to frighten him into fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the path to the right, that he might come again to her dwelling, and at laſt fall into her ſnare. He reſolved therefore to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue his courſe to the left, and rather to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main all night under a tree—rather to die for want of refreſhments, than to go any more into that neighbourhood; and exerting
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:038544_0080_101253D8E92470B0"/>
all his ſtrength, he began to climb the hill. After much labour he arrived at the ſummit of it, from whence he overlooked the whole country, and ſaw at his feet a large village, towards which he went, reſolved there to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire his way to the Baron von Tiefenthal's, and if poſſible to obtain from him his paſſport his clothes, and his wares, and then for ever leave a country in which he thought the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of his ſoul in danger.</p>
               <p>Near him as the village appeared to lie, owing to his fatigue, and accidentally taking the longeſt way, he did not get there till the evening. Wrapt in his mantle, and without a hat, for he had loſt that, he knew not where, the night before he went into the ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe of the village, and ſeating himſelf at the neareſt table, aſked for a glaſs of beer and a bit of bread. The hoſt, an unwieldy corpulent man, who was ſitting in an old arm-chair, was the only perſon in the room, and he let him aſk two or three times before he went out to fetch what he deſired. At laſt he brought the refreſhment ſo much wanted by Wolfgang, who ate and drank heartily, without obſerving that the hoſt ſtood by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining him very narrowly.—"From whence come you thus alone?" ſaid he, after ſome time; "and which way are you going?"</p>

One of them, who had fetters in his hand, and the two ſervants, drew near to Wolf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gang. "Sir," ſaid this man, "will you yield yourſelf a priſoner, or muſt we ſeize and bind you by force?

               <p>Wolfgang's ſurpriſe at this ſpeech may be eaſily imagined. "I ſhall not make any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance," he ſaid; "do with me what you will, but I am innocent."</p>
               <p>"That may poſſibly be," anſwered the hoſt; "but probable it certainly is not.

                  <p>"Aha! the old ſtory! the common cry of all rogues when they are taken with ſtolen goods! Neighbour put on the irons. Our Juſticiary will ſoon force him to confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. I hope, with God's aſſiſtance, to get back all I have loſt."</p>
                  <p>"I wiſh you may with all my heart," an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the man with the irons, as he faſtened them on Wolfgang's feet, who became con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with his new ſituation, becauſe he hoped to prove his innocence before the Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiary, and to be delivered at laſt from the perpetually renewed perplexities, and the eternal anxieties in which he was involved. But as they took off the mantle, and all at once cried out, "Heavens! this is the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer who was ſought for ſo aſſiduouſly in the morning! every thing anſwers to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of him! the ſame clothes—the ſame hair, the ſame face! his courage failed, and he began to weep aloud.—"God!" he exclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

"in what miſery, in what ſorrow, ſhall I, though guiltleſs, be plunged!"</p>

               <p>The bye-ſtanders were unmoved by his diſtreſs.—"Had you," ſaid one of them, thought of what you were about beforehand, you might have been ſpared your ſighs and tears. But theſe waſh out no blood; that can only be atoned by blood."</p>
               <p>Amidſt theſe comfortable remarks, Wolf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gang's hands were bound behind his back, notwithſtanding his entreaties againſt it, and his aſſurances that he would not fly; and then all preſent held a council, how they could moſt expeditiouſly convey this dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous thief and murderer to priſon while it was light, that he might not again murder his conductors, and eſcape as he had done the day before.</p>
               <p>Every word of this converſation added to Wolfgang's grief and deſpair. He had been conſoled all day by the firm belief that theſe terrible adventures had not actually happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but were only an illuſion; and this was now entirely deſtroyed, as he heard from every mouth a confirmation of the dreadful hiſtory. One lingering hope ſtill remained, that this might be a new deluſion; but this gradually forſook him, as they threw him bound into a

waggon, ſurrounded by above a dozen armed men, who threatened to ſhoot him if he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to ſtir, and was completely annihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as at laſt, after a ride of two hours, he was lifted from the waggon, and carried into a dark cave, the door of which was cloſed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, and carefully locked.</p>

               <p>WOLFGANG lay weeping upon the cold damp earth, bemoaning his misfortunes, and proteſting his innocence in vain; for no one was near to hear and anſwer him. The moſſy walls indeed re-echoed his ſighs, but this afforded him very little conſolation. Far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than that was the ſucceſs of his efforts to ſet his hands at liberty. The cord, with which they were bound, was accidentally looſened in the waggon, and the negligent attendants had not examined it, as they well knew that even with the uſe of his hands, he could not force his way through the two iron doors which guarded the entrance of the cave. He was thus able to wind them gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:038544_0086_101253E7E116CB70"/>
out of their bonds, and render his ſituation by this means ſomewhat leſs irk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome.</p>
               <p>Though he had a hard bed, yet he had a quiet conſcience; and thus, in conſequence of extreme bodily fatigue, he ſoon fell aſleep. About midnight he was awakened by a kind of dull continued knocking; and, ſtarting up ſtill confuſed with ſtupor, he rubbed his eyes to ſee from whence this proceeded, but in the darkneſs which ſurrounded him he could diſtinguiſh nothing, and awaited, in trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling ſilence, the event of this noiſe, which ſeemed to iſſue from the farther part of the cave, and varied frequently in the ſound. Notwithſtanding his being unable to ſee, fear kept his eyes turned towards this place, when, all at once, he heard a loud crack, and ſaw a ſudden ray of light which fell on the oppoſite wall; and after the noiſe of ſomething falling, as if not far from him, the light encreaſed, and by degrees illuminated the whole cave. His hair ſtood now an end, and he would have moved from the place where he lay, but all his faculties were cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred in his ears and eyes; he was otherwiſe paralyſed with terror, and had not the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to ſtir.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="88" facs="unknown:038544_0087_101253EA56B86BE8"/>A tall black man now came down into the cave, almoſt cloſe to Wolfgang, with a belt acroſs his ſhoulder, marked with ſeveral kinds of necromantic figures. In his right hand he carried a lighted torch, in his left a long ſtaff, and under his arm he had a roll of white cloth which he laid upon the ground. Another man ſoon followed him, who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be dreſſed in white, and had ſome tools in his hands; but what they were Wolf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gang was not able to diſcriminate, for he was nearly deprived of all his ſenſes by this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected appearance. With the little ſtrength he had remaining, he raiſed himſelf from the ground, and, with an agitated and horrible voice, cried out, All good ſpirits praiſe God!' Scarcely had he uttered theſe words, before the torch fell from the ſorcerer's hand, and he and the other man vaniſhed directly.</p>
               <p>The torch continued burning, and as Wolf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gang came by degrees to the uſe of his ſenſes, it occurred to him that light was better than darkneſs; for terror increaſed with the latter, and leſſened with the former. He therefore mechanically ſeized it, and trembling, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed his dwelling. At his feet lay the bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, and near it a pickaxe and ſhovel, which the ſorcerer and his companion had leſt behind them. In looking carefully about to ſee if they were hidden there, he ſaw the
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:038544_0088_101253ECC8FA7258"/>
opening which they had made, and through that the ſtarry ſky and the moon, whoſe rays then fell upon him. At this ſight the love of freedom, prevalent in every man, but moſt in the impriſoned man, baniſhed all terror from the heart of Wolfgang, and he thought only of being at liberty.</p>
               <p>Without knowing the contents of it, he took the roll of white cloth under his arm, and did not forget the pickaxe, in order, with the aſſiſtance of this, to releaſe himſelf from his ſetters. Holding the torch in his hand, he went through the opening, and came into a garden; and having now light enough from the moon, he threw the torch back into the cave, and haſtened forwards. He had ſcarcely gone a hundred ſteps before he came to an open door, and through that to a plain, the extent of which he was not able to diſcern. He ſat down on the outſide of the garden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall, and ſtriking his fetters with the pickaxe the faſtening of them gave way; and thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, he walked briſkly along the plain. Being now deſirous of ſeeing what the bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle contained, he untied it as he went, and found a very handſome green coat and waiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coat. Theſe, thought he, are, without doubt, given me by the ſorcerer with ſome ſiniſter deſign, and I certainly would not put them on, if I knew how otherwiſe to get to
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:038544_0089_101253EE63BEAA50"/>
the Baron von Tiefenthal's. But, as I am ignorant of the way thither, and muſt, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, inquire it of ſomebody, it is very likely that, in my preſent clothes, I may be again taken for a murderer, and as ſuch, dragged anew to priſon. It appeared probable to him beſides, that he ſhould be purſued as ſoon as his flight out of the cave was diſcovered, and that he ſhould be known directly by the ſame means.</p>
               <p>All theſe reaſons were ſo weighty, that they not merely overcame his fears of the clothes, but gave him courage to put them on, which he did immediately, and threw his blue-laced ſuit, which ſeemed to him at firſt ſo beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, into the next buſh. He then walked on conſidering over the adventures of this night. That a ſorcerer tormented him, and would for ſome purpoſe ſeduce him, no longer, in his opinion, admitted of a doubt, after the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of the laſt two days, and his having, not above an hour before, ſeen him face to face. Yet, that he could not mean very ill by him, as he always delivered him from the greateſt dangers, appeared probable, and of this he was ſtill more convinced, as he felt, by chance, in the pocket of his new clothes, and found a leathern purſe ſtored with twelve ſine new dollars, and ſix ſhining pieces of gold. He had never in his life been the
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:038544_0090_101253F0D9408210"/>
poſſeſſor of ſo large a ſum; his joy was, therefore, very great, and if his conſcience whiſpered him that he ought not to keep the devil's money, his inclination to it perſuaded him, on the other hand, that one piece of it offered to the church, when he returned to his native country, would propitiate the whole ſin. The power of the ſorcerer was alſo become leſs terrible to him, ſince he found that he and his colleagues fled directly on his uttering an exorciſm. But then again reflection painted to him, in ſtrong colours, the danger of ſtaying any longer in this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted country. A beautiful female and a large ſum of money are ſnares, thought he, that will conduct me ſoon to the abyſs which he has prepared for me, and then ſorrow and repentance will be too late.</p>
               <p>The importance of theſe conſiderations confirmed Wolfgang in his intention of going to the Baron von Tiefenthal's caſtle; and if he found him, as he had reaſon to believe he was, in league with the ſorcerer, to get poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, by ſome artifice, of his own clothes, and, above all things, of his paſſports, and then to fly away by night.</p>
               <p>Amidſt theſe projects and reſolutions he had reached the end of the plain, and come to the borders of a wood, into which he did
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:038544_0091_101253F41C073778"/>
not much like to enter at this late hour; but yet the dread of being purſued, and ſooner diſcovered in the open country, determined him, at laſt, to give the preference to the former. The moon was now going down, and his fears increaſing with the increaſing darkneſs; and the thickneſs of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood making it difficult for him to advance, he threw himſelf down under a tree, there to await the dawn of day. Anxiety would not ſuffer him to ſleep; every little noiſe, even a falling leaf, was magnified by his terrors into a ſubject of alarm, that kept him conſtantly on the watch.</p>
               <p>As the firſt rays of the ſun illuminated the country, he roſe from his hard bed, and, in hopes of finding a road, ſtole, like a frighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed roe, to the end of the wood, and looked to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the open plain which lay before him. He ſoon ſtarted back trembling, then rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed his eyes, and looked again, and trembled ſtill more violently. Willingly would he have perſuaded himſelf that he had ſeen wrong, but the third time that he ventured to look confirmed his terror.</p>
               <p>The fatal houſe, from which he had not been able to get away the day before, was now directly over againſt him. "Am I then condemned everlaſtingly," he cried out

               <p>A FOOT PATH, at which Wolfgang ſoon arrived, ſeemed, by his view of it, to wind down the hill as if it would carry him far from the houſe.

I could not have brought myſelf to do this, if I had not conſidered it as certain, that the crafty Counteſs had expreſsly ſtipulated with you never to come to my caſtle again, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thought this the only means I ſhould have of delivering to you myſelf the packet you left at my houſe, which, I imagined, might contain matters of importance, and of ſeeing you once more. Theſe being the only objects of my viſit, this unexpected
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:038544_0094_101253FAC8140610"/>
meeting gives me great pleaſure, as I can ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil them here. I muſt own to you, at the ſame time, that it gives me great concern to have loſt you ſo ſoon. I had indulged pleaſing dreams of the future—but they are paſt; I am awakened, and perceive clearly that dreams are not always fulfilled."</p>
               </sp>
               <p>Wolfgang would have let the Baron ſpeak for an hour if he had choſen it, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupting him, as he did not underſtand his diſcourſe, and had not courage to aſk for an explanation of it, as the meeting him in the wood, in this manner, appeared to him like enchantment. The Baron was now ſilen,t expecting his anſwer; but Wolfgang ſtood, with the two great ſtones in his hand, which he had ſeized to defend himſelf againſt the dog, with ſtaring eyes, and not ſpeaking a word, awaiting the moment in which Tiefen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thal, according to his promiſe, would deliver him his property, the object, at preſent, of all his wiſhes.</p>
               <p>Louiſa, at length, broke this ſilence. She was dreſſed to-day more advantageouſly than ever; and a more attentive obſerver than Wolfgang in his preſent ſituation could be, muſt have noticed that this was done pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely. A light ſtraw hat, which appeared, by mere accident, to be put on ſideways,
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:038544_0095_101253FE5945D170"/>
diſcovered her light hair falling in natural curls. This hat, it is true, rather hid the languiſhing right eye of the fair Louiſa, but then it gave to the left a more extenſive range for its operations. The freſh morning air had overſpread her face with an agreeable colour, which was yet more heightened by the contraſt of her entirely white dreſs. Thus dangerouſly equipped, ſhe ſtood now before Wolfgang, and ſhut out every other proſpect from his eyes. "Signor," ſhe ſaid coaxingly, and took his hand which ſhe held with both her's, "I have alſo abundant rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to complain of your leaving us ſo abrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. I alſo dreamt, like my father, of enjoying your agreeable and inſtructive converſation for a long time. I hoped that you would compenſate to my good father the loſs of his ſon, by ſucceeding to his place. All theſe charming proſpects are now vaniſhed. My father mourns anew, and I have no more a brother! With you, dear Signor, it certainly remains to revive our hopes! What the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron would not venture to do, I, as a woman may, with more right to expect, at leaſt with more hopes of ſucceſs. As, perhaps, it is not mere chance that has brought us together ſo unexpectedly, and as the preſence of the certainly charming Counteſs does not anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilate all the force of my petition, I venture boldly to preſs you, to entreat of you to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:038544_0096_10125400CEB7C6C8"/>
with us, to live with us, to command our houſe, our fortune, as the maſter of them
<stage>(pressing his hand softly, and looking lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing in his eyes.)</stage>
I ſhall, certainly, do every thing in my power to make your ſtay with us as agreeable as poſſible."</p>
               <p>Louiſa pauſed, and Tiefenthal, who ſtood there full of expectation, like a General who has ſent the flower of his troops againſt the valiant foe, was ſtartled and grew pale as he found all his hopes diſappointed, himſelf and his army totally defeated by Wolfgang's an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</p>
               <p>"I regret," ſaid the latter ſtammering, "I regret, with all my heart, that I am not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of your kind invitation, and cannot accept of it. Circumſtances, that I am not able to relate, conſtrain me to leave this country as faſt as poſſible; and I was actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly walking this way, in order to fetch my ſmall ſtock of clothes and the reſt of my things, and then forever to bid it farewell!"</p>
               <p>Louiſa ventured a new attack. "Well then," ſhe cried out, "you ſhall keep your reſolution thus: you ſaid you were coming to us, therefore, to expedite your purpoſe, get into our carriage. I aſſure you we ſhall
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:038544_0097_101254026879D4E8"/>

               <p>The Baron von Tiefenthal, who read a refuſal of this invitation in Wolfgang's reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute mien, thought it beſt to make his retreat in good order, and, if poſſible, to retire with ſome booty. "What ſignifies all this?" he ſaid to Louiſa; "if the Signor will not grant us the honour of a viſit willingly, we have no right to conſtrain him to it. Here, Sir,
<stage>(to him)</stage>

               </sp>
               <p>The Baron von Tiefenthal accepted theſe ſtones with much apparent ſatisfaction; and
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:038544_0100_1012540AE99D7140"/>
whiſpered to his daughter, as he handed her into the carriage, to aſk for a ſimilar remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance. Louiſa fulfilled her father's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and the ſtill more aſtoniſhed Wolf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gang made haſte to gratify her wiſh. It had rained, and in order not to ſoil her hand, he looked for ſome clean pebbles, which he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to her, with the wiſh that they might become precious ſtones to ornament her hair. Louiſa received the preſent and the wiſh with many handſome acknowledgments, and Tie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenthal once more repeated his regret at be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo ſoon, ſo unexpectedly, ſeparated from his new friend. But as Wolfgang made no other anſwer than by a ſilent ſhrug of the ſhoulders, there was nothing left for the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron to do, but to order the coachman to drive on; and the man, giving his horſes a whip, the carriage was ſoon out of ſight.</p>
               <p>Happy as a poor ſinner who has obtained pardon at the place of execution, Wolfgang now breathed freely, and ſtepping aſide into the thicket, began to unpack his parcel. He found there his Savoyard jacket, his paſſport, ſome clean linen, his wares, and at laſt Louiſa's portrait very beautifully painted in miniature, and ſet with pearls. Well pleaſed with the languiſhing maiden, who appeared to ſmile at him, he looked at the picture for ſome time; but when he conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:038544_0101_1012540C8926A2D8"/>
that ſhe was certainly the daughter of a ſorcerer who perſecuted him, he caſt it away, and began to change his dreſs. He ſoon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the Savoyard again, with his hatchels and mouſe-traps upon his back; and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Creator for having reſcued him ſo happily from the threatening danger, throw his green clothes into a buſh; but the purſe which he found in them he could not reſolve on parting with, the ſum of money it contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſeeming to him too great to renounce.</p>
               <p>With joy and alacrity he now aſcended the hill, and ſaw, from the top of it a village lying on the left in the valley, which he hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by the look of it, was not that where he had been made a priſoner the day before. His hunger, which had been for ſome time very conſiderable, increaſed on the ſight of the ſmoaking chimnies, and he reſolved to go thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſatisfy it, and then proceed on his way into Saxony. An agreeable path, ſhaded with young beeches, ſeeming to promiſe him a nearer way to the village; he turned into it, but had not gone far, before he found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſurrounded with high rocks, and looking around him, trembling between hope and fear, he heard a noiſe, and almoſt imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſaw the Counteſs dreſſed as a pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant girl.</p>

               <p>AS it may perhaps be a long time before the poor maiden overtakes the flying youth, or may even be poſſible that ſhe quite loſt him in the thick underwood, I will, in the meantime, relate another hiſtory for the amuſement of my readers, which at firſt ſight may appear to be out of its place here, and to be as diſtinct from this as any other hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the world; but which they will ſoon perceive to be very properly introduced, as having a particular connection with the ſtory recorded in the preceding chapters.</p>
               <p>Ten years previous to the adventures of our Savoyard, there lived, in the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of the Fichtelberg, a ſturdy young vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage ale-houſekeeper, who had formerly tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled in many foreign countries as a, butcher,
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:038544_0105_1012541650E78F78"/>
but returned home, on the death of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to take poſſeſſion, as heir, of this ale-houſe where the old man had gained an honeſt live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood.</p>
               <p>He married a handſome young wife, and lived jovially with her. His only employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments the whole day were, calling to her to go to the cellar when his gueſts wanted beer, and ſitting and drinking with them. He left the care of his farm to his ſervants, and never ſaw his corn or his beaſts before he carried them to the market-town to be ſold, from whence he never failed to come home intoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated.</p>
               <p>That ſuch alehouſe-keeping, and ſuch farming, could only end in ruin, my readers of any ſenſe will already have foreſeen. I ſhall therefore only add as a warning to the imprudent, that at the end of three years, the ineffectual dunning of his creditors was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by a ſeizure and ſale of his property; and that Jacob, for ſo was this diſorderly hoſt called, being ſtill purſued by many diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented claimants, cut himſelf a ſtick from the next tree, and with this laſt remains of his he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary portion, wandered once more into the wide world. He left his wife and child as ſecurity to his creditors, who were really
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:038544_0106_10125419B20D9170"/>
ſo compaſſionate as to allow them a mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>
               <p>Entirely unuſed to labour, and wanting ſubſiſtence, he begged his way into Italy as a Pilgrim, and laughed at the pious zeal of the fools, who ſupported him in his holy purpoſe with plentiful alms, while he was in reality a heretic. Before he reached Rome, he fell in with ſome banditti who were going thither in company to the Jubilee. The ability of the man, his ſtrength, his intrepidity, induced this troop to accept him as a member, and ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate him into their myſteries.</p>
               <p>Jacob was ſoon one of the moſt adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and formidable of the Italian banditti. No one executed a murder, or any deſperate undertaking, with ſuch cold blooded reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He was ſoon renowned amongſt his brethren for his great achievements, and wherever any hazardous enterpriſe was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined on, however diſtant, the German Jacob was conſtantly ſent for, who for double pay always undertook and accompliſhed the deed to the great increaſe of his fame. By theſe means it was no wonder, that, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding a life of pleaſure and expence, he ſoon amaſſed a handſome fortune.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="108" facs="unknown:038544_0107_1012541C243ECB18"/>His numerous murders having, at length, created a general alarm in the country, the officers of juſtice were every where on the watch for him; and, as the deſcription of his perſon was circulated throughout Italy, he reſolved to avoid the ſtorm which threatened him, and till it was ſubſided again, to return into Germany.</p>
               <p>After ſeven long years, when his wife, wearied with fruitleſs ſorrow and expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, had given him up for loſt; when his neighbours and acquaintance never hoped to ſee him again, he arrived, dreſſed as an opu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent batcher, with a handſome cart and two fine horſes, at the public houſe of his native village. All the inhabitants, who ſoon col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected about him, were aſtoniſhed at his reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectable appearance, envied his wife, whom they had before compaſſionated, and were quite ſtupified with ſurpriſe when the often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatious Jacob poured out a great bag of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quins upon the table, and calling to his yet unſatisfied creditors, paid them the principal and intereſt of his debt with friendly thanks.</p>
               <p>The whole country ſoon reſounded with Jacob's return and great good fortune. Every one was amazed at it, and every one aſked how he had acquired it; but no one could give any account of this, becauſe Jacob him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:038544_0108_1012541E943A9AA8"/>
anſwered every queſtion of the kind with a myſterious laugh, or yet more myſterious ſhrug of his ſhoulders. Often, when he ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerouſly paid the reckoning at a drinking bout for his former friends and neighbours, and thus awakened their curioſity anew, they importuned him to tell them by what means he had made his fortune. And once, when the alehouſe-keeper of a neighbouring vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage preſſed him more ſtrongly than all the others, and directly taxed him with having ſtolen it, he wiſely reſolved to miſlead this man from his but too juſt and and alarming idea, and to give him one leſs dangerous: "Neighbour," he ſaid to him as they parted, "in order to obviate your unjuſt ſuſpicious, I will relate my whole hiſtory to you, which I have not yet related to any one. You may perhaps at ſome future time derive the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt advantage from it, and will then own with gratitude that I have rewarded you with good for evil. Come to me early to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow morning, and then, to you confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, you ſhall hear every thing."</p>
               <p>The curious hoſt came to Jacob the next morning; and firſt begging pardon for his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate prattle the day before, then claimed the performance of his promiſe. "I will keep to it as a man of honour," ſaid Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,

"if you will previouſly agree to two conditions."</p>

               <p>Jacob then began the following hiſtory, which he had deviſed long before: and which as my readers, after the above relation, will know at once was entirely fabulous.</p>
               <p>"Neighbour," he ſaid, "you will recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect that people often come into our country out of Italy, who deal in mouſe-traps and hatchels, or ſometimes bring dancing mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mots.
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:038544_0110_10125422CA4EB7B8"/>
You muſt know alſo that under this pretence theſe people ſteal to our Fichtel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg, and having, from their ſuperior know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, the means of diſcovering the treaſure concealed there, they return home laden with great wealth, and laugh heartily at us ſtupid Germans."</p>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Host.</speaker>
                  <p>"That to be ſure I know very well I have actually ſeen one of them ſtealing about here. My father was alive at that time, and was with me when I met him in the field; he told me then, that one of theſe Italian hatchel-men had ſaid once to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we were very ſtupid people that we did not make a better uſe of the treaſure which was laying about here every where. He had often, he added, ſeen a herdſman throw a ſtone after a cow which was worth twice the value of the cow itſelf. My grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father entreated the ſtranger to teach him the art of finding out theſe treaſures. He ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed him therefore to meet him the next day upon a rock; but as my grandfather came there, he was terrified at the ſight of a great black he-goat, and ran back to his houſe, and could not recover himſelf for a long time."</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Jacob.</speaker>
                  <p>"It is very agreeable to me that you are already ſo well informed on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:038544_0111_101254266161DE30"/>
as I can for that reaſon go on with my hiſtory without digreſſion. When I kept the alehouſe in the village; an Italian hatchel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man came to me one eevning complaining of a violent cholic, and begged for a lodging.—I pitied him, and out of true Chriſtian charity let him want for nothing. Six weeks he lay ill at my houſe, and I took care of him all that time without any recompence. As he recovered his health, he expreſſed the utmoſt gratitude to me. 'I ſhall never forget what you have done for me,' he ſaid, at parting; 'ſhould any misfortune ever befall you in Germany, then come to Rome, and viſit the church of St. Peter. We ſhall certainly meet there, and it will be a pleaſure to me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and entertain you in this manner,'—At the time I laughed at this odd invitation; but when my creditors ſeized all my property, and were afterwards continually teazing me, then it came into my mind; and as I had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more to loſe here, I reſolved to try how far I might confide in this man's fair ſpeeches.</p>
                  <p>"I begged my way to Rome, and viſited St. Peter's Church every day, but never met the Italian, and had at laſt quite forgotten his promiſe. I was aſking alms once in a broad ſtreet not far from thence, when a gentleman
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:038544_0112_10125428D5FE66D0"/>
looked out of the window of a great palace, made a ſignal to me, and immediately ſent a ſervant down to conduct me to him. I was carried through many ſtately rooms, the ſplendour and beauty of which quite dazzled me, and came at laſt into a cabinet, where a gentleman in a brocaded night-gown ſat up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſofa, and was taking ſnuff out of a gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en box. After commanding the ſervant firſt to reach me a chair, and then to withdraw; 'Sit down,' he ſaid to me; 'ſit down, good Jacob, you muſt be much tired with your long journey. How does your wife? how is your child?—I ſtood perfectly aſtoniſhed at this ſpeech, and could not imagine how it could poſſibly be, that ſo fine a gentleman at Rome ſhould know me, my wife, and child.</p>
                  <p>He noticed my ſurpriſe, and aſked me, laughing, if I then really did not know him. 'No,' ſaid I, trembling, 'I do not know your Excellency.' Without ſaying a word more, he aroſe, and left the room. I had now an opportunity of examining the cabinet, which was extremely magnificent, being ornament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a profuſion of gold and ſilver veſſels of various kinds; and I was tempted more than once, to put one of them at leaſt into my pocket.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="114" facs="unknown:038544_0113_1012542A6FE57598"/>"After about a quarter of an hour the door opened again, and the poor hatchel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, whom I once lodged in my houſe, and had now ſought for ſo long in vain at Rome, came in. He was in the ſame clothes which he wore then, and had hatchels and mouſe-traps upon his back. 'Buy a hatchel! buy a mouſe-trap!' he cried, as he walked up and down the room. 'Well,' ſaid he at laſt, as I ſtared him in ſilence, 'do you not know me yet?' 'I know you well,' I anſwered; 'but how you come here, how you dare venture into this room to walk about, and cry your wares, is a queſtion, that, with the help of all my underſtanding, I cannot anſwer to my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.'—'But I will explain it to you in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,' he replied.</p>
                  <p>"On ſaying this, he began to undreſs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, by firſt throwing off ſome falſe hair which he had upon his head; and then run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning out for a moment, he returned in his brocaded night-gown. 'Now do you know me?' he ſaid; 'now do you believe that the mouſe-trap dealer and I are the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon?'—'I believe it, I anſwered, becauſe my eyes convince me of it, though my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is ſtill inclined to contradict them.' 'It ſhall ſoon be demonſtrated as clearly to that, as to your eyes,' ſaid he. 'Sit down by me, ſit down; make no ceremony, and liſten

to me patiently. The compaſſion which you ſo diſintereſtedly exerciſed towards me de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves not only reward but confidence. In the ſame proportion in which I now place confidence in you, ſhall alſo be your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.'</p>
                  <p>'I am deſcended (he continued) from a poor, but very old and once reſpected noble Italian family. My father, from neceſſity, ſerved in an inferior office under the Pope, and when he died, left me without money, without friends, and conſequently without any other proſpect than that of ſtarving. I am not aſhamed to own that, like you, I once aſked alms in the ſtreets of Rome; and was fed for ſome years as a poor ſcholar, with the beggars' broth of the Capuchins. As I was one evening fainting with hunger and thirſt, begging at a very late hour, I met a hoary old man with a knotty ſtick and a little lantern in his hand. He held the light to my face, and examined it narrowly for a long time, and then commanded me to follow him in a ſolemn manner. I ſhould deviate too much from the purpoſe of my narrative, if I related to you, circumſtantially, how this ſingular man, by degrees, won my affections. He provided me with all the neceſſaries of life, inſtructed me in various ſciences, and at laſt took me into his houſe: He was in ſhort
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:038544_0115_10125430D2747CC0"/>
quite a father to me, for to him I owe all my knowledge, and all my riches.</p>
                  <p>'As he grew older and weaker, he taught me the rare, but in Italy not quite forgotten art, of diſcovering treaſures concealed in the earth; and of diſcerning, in ſome of the moſt apparantly common ſtones, precious ſtones of infinite value. As he had always aſpired to the knowledge of the higheſt ſciences, and ſtill hoped to find out the ſecret of the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſam of eternal life, he had but ſeldom, and only in caſes of neceſſity, made uſe of this glorious means of becoming rich with very little trouble. He died without having at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained his object, and left me his writings, his inſtruments, and a moderate ſum of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. With this I immediately reſolved to travel about the world, and, by means of my ineſtimable art, to collect a ſufficient fortune to paſs away my life in independence and enjoyment.</p>
                  <p>'From the papers of my foſter-father I clearly perceived, that the German Fichtel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg was the ſpot where the greateſt treaſures lay concealed in the bowels of the earth, and that this hill was alſo remarkable for a profuſion of precious ſtones. It appeared likewiſe, that by attending to the proper ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and, hour, it was extremely eaſy to get
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:038544_0116_1012543345146E28"/>
poſſeſſion of a portion of theſe riches. After the example, therefore, of many others who were in the ſecret, and who, as it was rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in theſe manuſcripts, had already amaſſed fortunes there, I went to the Fichtelberg as a hatchel and mouſe-trap dealer. But at your houſe I muſt have ended my life with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having attained my purpoſe, if it had not been for the kindneſs and attention of your good heart, for my diſeaſe was extremely ſtubborn.</p>
                  <p>'I ſhall now recompenſe you for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſted compaſſion you exerciſed towards me at that time. I would willingly have done it at parting, for I had at that time great wealth in my power; but I feared to excite ſuſpicions in your neighbourhood that might prejudice me and any others of my countrymen who came after me, and thence prudently reſolved to defer the reward till a more ſeaſonable opportunity. Without hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing occaſion for more than common acute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, I plainly perceived that your huſband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry went on miſerably; that you were plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by your ſervants, and that your credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors would ultimately ſeize all your proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. On that account, when I bade you fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel, I invited you to Rome, in hopes of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, able to reward you there without creat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any jealouſy againſt you, or any ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:038544_0117_10125434DE75DDE8"/>
againſt myſelf. My wiſh is now fulfilled; ſtay with me, forget your ungrateful country, and be happy here; you ſhall never more feel want, but have every thing in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.'</p>

               <p>THE generous Marquis faithfully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed his promiſe. I lived entirely with him; he appointed me his Maſter of the Horſe, and I ſoon became his principal fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite. When any one wanted to ſolicit a favour from him, they applied to me; and if I gave them my aſſiſtance, they were certain of ſucceſs. You will eaſily imagine that this kind of life was very agreeable to me; I had money always as plenty as hay, and took many opportunities of turning it to a good account. I muſt to my ſhame own to you, that in an eternal round of pleaſure I forgot my native land, and every thing that I had left behind me; and for years never thought even of my wife and child. But at laſt I grew tired of this ſcene of diſſipation,
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:038544_0118_101254386AF96760"/>
and began to be very frugal and ſteady, and to think often of my poor child and my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken wife. I became in ſhort ſo uneaſy, that frequently I was not able to conceal my tears from my benefactor.</p>
               <p>"Several times he enquired the cauſe of this dejection; and when I could no longer withhold it from him, he promiſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move it immediately. 'I ſee,' he ſaid, 'that you are become home-ſick; I cannot blame you for it, nor am I ſurpriſed at it, for I have been in foreign countries myſelf, and well know what it is to languiſh after one's native land. I love you, and would willingly have you always with me; but as my firſt wiſh is to promote your happineſs, I will, without heſitation, ſacrifice my incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to your's. Come to me at the ſame hour to-morrow-morning, and I will, in the meantime, take care to provide you with a comfortable independence.' I left him, and no day in my life ever appeared to me ſo long as this; I could neither eat nor ſleep for joy, that I ſhould ſoon ſee my wife and child again.</p>
               <p>"I was with the Marquis the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before the appointed hour, and found him in earneſt converſation with his eldeſt ſon. 'Are you here already,' he cried, laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:038544_0119_1012543B2E99D710"/>
as he came to meet me. 'Your haſte clearly proves that I was not deceived in my yeſterday's conjecture. Go in peace; and that you may never experience any want in Germany, take this bag of gold with you; it contains eight thouſand ſequins, which I hope will be ſufficient to ſupport you and your wife and child decently.</p>
               <p>"You may readily ſuppoſe, neighbour, how I was ſtartled at ſo large a preſent. I could not ſpeak; I threw myſelf, weeping, at the feet of my benefactor, and knew not how to expreſs my gratitude. The good old man raiſed me up, kindly aſſuring me once more that he would never ceaſe to be my friend; and that I might boldly return to him, if through any accident I was again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to diſtreſſed circumſtances. The young Marquis then putting in, ſaid, 'Dear Jacob, I have a reciprocal ſervice to aſk of you. My father has revealed to me to-day that I muſt ſoon travel into Germany, and viſit your na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive place. There is yet much concealed treaſure remaining there, which we ſtand in need of for the further aggrandizement of our family. I ſhall alſo appear in the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a hatchel and mouſe-trap dealer, and ſearch for theſe treaſures. Should any misfortune befal me there, then, for the ſake
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:038544_0120_1012543D9F721068"/>
of my father's kindneſs, be you my friend, and I will reward it to your children.'</p>
               <p>'Dear, dear ſon of my great benefactor!' I cried out quite tranſported, 'as ſoon as you come to our village, put up at my houſe. I will attend and take care of you as the apple of my eye. I will accompany you every where, and conduct you again in ſafety to the arms of your father.'</p>
               <p>'Thanks! a thouſand thanks for your good intentions,' ſaid the Marquis, 'but my ſon cannot take advantage of them. He muſt not, during his journey, go to the houſe of any friend or acquaintance; for if he did, the aim of it would be loſt. You cannot do him any ſervice yourſelf; but I expect from your gratitude, that you will prepare ſome kind-hearted people of you neighbourhood to be courteous to him, and ſoften the hatred that moſt of your countrymen bear to us Italians Endeavour to make them ſenſible, that a ſtranger may often be able to reward the ſlighteſt ſervice a thouſand fold, and let them underſtand that we are actually bound to do it. Your own experience muſt convince you of the truth of what I ſay. You undoubtedly know ſome of your neighbours whoſe honeſt and good hearts diſpoſe them to be benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent towards the poor; name them to my

               <p>"I promiſed to do what he required, and named to him all thoſe on whoſe hoſpitality I believed he might rely; and he wrote their names carefully in his pocket-book.

<pb n="123" facs="unknown:038544_0122_10125441B6C5AAE0"/>
then there would be a number of intereſted perſons, who would ſhew him beneficence merely from ſelfiſh views; and thus the riches which he collected here would not be ſufficient for the repayment of theſe obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Judge now yourſelf, neighbour, what a ſtruggle it haſt coſt me, to become as it were perjured, and betray my great benefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. Had you not yeſterday ſo openly and expreſsly attacked my honour, and had I not apprehended that your ſlander might bring me to juſtice, where I might perhaps have been conſtrained to make every thing known the greateſt treaſure in the world would not have tempted me to violate his confidence.

               <p>The inquiſitive hoſt appeared now quite contented and full of joy, and was already building a thouſand caſtles in the air. The cunning Jacob laughed within himſelf, and was rejoiced that he had ſo completely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him, and could now enjoy his plunder in peace.</p>
               <p>The ſplendid proſpects which the hoſt was now inceſſantly dreaming of, made him often muſing and thoughtful; he no longer worked ſo diligently as he had done, but loved beſt to ſit in ſome corner, where he might, without being diſturbed, buſy himſelf with the idea of his future fortune. His wife was offended at this unuſual behaviour in her huſband, and reſolved to find out the reaſon of it. Whoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:038544_0124_10125447B5828068"/>
knows any thing of women, will know very well how continually they plague their huſbands on ſuch an occaſion, and will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready have propheſied that ſhe carried her point at laſt. In fact ſhe was very ſoon the joint poſſeſſor of the ſecret.</p>
               <p>Nothing oppreſſes a weak mind like a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, or gives it the fancied importance it wiſhes for, like being able to reveal one. Thus Catherine, for ſuch was the name of our muſing hoſt's wife, was no ſooner miſtreſs of this, than ſhe combed her hair ſmooth, put on her Sunday gown, and haſtened to the caſtle of the Lord of the Manor. She had ſerved there ſix years as cook, with great diligence and honeſty, and was for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon always well received in the family, and now hoped to acquire much greater conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence there from the nature of her preſent errand. She went from the kitchen directly up to the apartment of the miſtreſs of the caſtle, and was conducted by her to her papa, who was no other than the Baron von Tie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenthal. As he inferred from the importance of her look that ſhe had ſome weighty intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence to communicate, he ſpoke very cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly to her, and offered her a chair. This ſet Catherine's tongue a going, and the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron was minutely informed of the above mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous hiſtory. The Counteſs von M—

alſo learnt it a ſhort time after, much in the ſame manner, as ſhe was buying ſome flax of Catherine, and won her confidence by her affable behaviour.</p>
               <p>Hoſt, Baron, and Counteſs, now all fabri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated their particular plans how to decoy the young Marquis, when he appeared, as a hatchel and mouſe-trap dealer, in their neighbourhood; and to entitle themſelves, by the moſt attentive beneficence, to a part, or perhaps the whole, of his great treaſures. By Catherine's prudent management ſhe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded her huſband to reveal the ſecret, that he knew already, to the Baron; and the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron prevailed on the hoſt to promiſe, that he ſhould have immediate information of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival of the young Marquis.</p>
               <p>The Baron von Tiefenthal was the eco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomical ſon of a very extravagant father, and it was with difficulty that he could ſupport his ſituation with an inheritance encumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the debts of the latter. He was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry naturally therefore extremely rejoiced that ſo fortunate an opportunity was likely to be preſented to him of diſencumbering his eſtate. His daughter was now marriageable, and who can blame the good father that he wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to bring about a match between her and the rich Marquis? and the more certainly
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:038544_0126_1012544BC564CC60"/>
to accompliſh his purpoſe, he confided his whole plan to her beforehand.</p>
               <p>The Counteſs von M— was the lively widow of an old diſagreeable huſband, who, to her great joy, died ſoon after their marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and left her the unlimited poſſeſſion of a large fortune. Being much inclined to ſhow, luxury, and diſſipation, ſhe had, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in two years, nearly run through this for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, when ſhe heard from the good natured hoſteſs this lucky ſecret. It was therefore equally natural that ſhe ſhould alſo deviſe every means to decoy the expected Marquis to herſelf, and thus hope to ſecure an inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſtible ſource of riches.</p>
               <p>In her early youth the Counteſs had ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly loved, and been beloved by, a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Lieutenant; and in conſequence of this amour, at ſeventeen ſhe became the mother of a daughter, whoſe birth was ſo carefully concealed that the Counteſs was never ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, though ſhe remained at her father's houſe. The child was immediately com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the care of a poor parſon's widow.</p>
               <p>When the Counteſs became a widow herſelf, ſhe took her daughter and this old woman to live near her; for notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the general giddineſs of her character,
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:038544_0127_1012544F5A564F40"/>
ſhe loved the former with maternal affection. This child of love, whoſe name was Emily, was extremely like her mother; but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making any remarks on this ſtriking reſemblance, ſhe was unanimouſly held, by the good natured peaſants, to be the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the parſon's widow; and in order to avoid more critical obſervers, ſhe lived with her in a retired cottage built for them by the Counteſs in her park; to which, after the death of her huſband, ſhe had added part of a neighbouring wood.</p>
               <p>The real mother of this child, who wiſhed to eſtabliſh her darling reſpectably, thought the preſent a fine opportunity to endeavour to accompliſh her object; and by throwing her in his way, hoped that ſhe might capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate the inexperienced Marquis. With this view, Emily had been ſent every day du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the whole ſummer, to the ſummit of the Fichtelberg, to await his coming, and, by the inſtructions of her mother, ſhe was to do all in her power to attract and detain him.</p>
               <p>Such was the ſituation of affairs when the innocent Wolfgang arrived in this country. By all thoſe who were intereſted in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:038544_0128_10125451CF4C1B70"/>
of the expected Marquis, he was taken for him, and for this reaſon was received by them with ſo much honour.</p>
               <p>It is now certain that no ſorcerer deluded him when he thought he ſaw the Counteſs von M—, ſometimes as a fine lady, and ſometimes as a peaſant girl. Nor was it more extraordinary, when he was in a park laid out after the Engliſh faſhion, that he ſhould by various ways, conſtantly come again to the houſe ſituated at the end of it and to which all theſe ways purpoſely led.</p>
               <p>But then who was the old man whom Wolfgang ſo undeſignedly murdered? Who the poor forſaken female? Who were the horſemen who releaſed him the firſt time? And who the ſorcerer who releaſed him the ſecond time out of captivity?</p>
               <p>Theſe queſtions I cannot poſſibly anſwer now. The time will come when my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders will learn every thing; but the where and the when I muſt leave undetermined; becauſe the little Atalante has overtaken the panting Wolfgang, notwithſtanding his great advantage of her, and is holding him faſt by the arm. And it is proper now to liſten to
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:038544_0129_1012545369640DD8"/>
their diſcourſe, or there would be a chaſm in the hiſtory.</p>

               <p>In order to avoid the appearance of any thing unnatural and inconſiſtent in my nar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rative, I conſider myſelf as neceſſitated here to deſcribe the ſituation of poor Wolfgang, when he was led ſo unexpectedly from one extreme to another. In running he had ſtumbled over a ſtick, and, though he had indeed endeavoured to perſerve his balance, after tottering up and down for ſome time, like a nine-pin when it is touched by the ball, the diſproportion of gravity at laſt drew him backwards to the ground: he fell amongſt the elaſtic branches of ſome young beeches, which rocked him up and down, and made it impoſſible for him to riſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe every ſupport which he caught at was too weak, and let him ſink again.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="132" facs="unknown:038544_0131_10125459754AC2E0"/>In this ſituation the purſuing damſel over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took him. She laid hold of his arm, but prudently did not draw him from it, as he was now no longer able to fly, but remained in her power. In running after him the buſhes had often caught her; one of them had half torn off her handerkerchief, another ſnatched it quite away; but entirely occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied with the deſire to overtake the flying youth, ſhe perceived nothing of this. But as Wolfgang uncovered his eyes, and from an irreſiſtible impulſe drew her towards him, and boldly ſnatched a kiſs, ſhe became at once ſenſible of her loſs, and ſpringing from his arms with all her ſtrength, in extreme confuſion turned her back to him.</p>
               <p>It would have been eaſy for him now to fly, but the tables were turned, and at this moment, if the maiden had flown, Wolfgang would have followed her, as aſſiduouſly as ſhe had followed him before. Devils and ſorcery were altogether vaniſhed from his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, and he thought only of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the damſel's arms. You muſt be mine! my wife! thought he at this moment, and drew near to her again.</p>
               <p>"Rude unmannerly man!" ſhe ſaid, "give me back my handkerchief, or I will
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:038544_0132_1012545BEC154F10"/>
never look at you any more; give it me, or I will go away directly."</p>

                  <speaker>Wolfgang.</speaker>
                  <p>"Dear, dear maiden! how ſhould I give you what I do not poſſeſs? probably you have loſt it in running."</p>

               <p>Emily, for it was her, went on before, and Wolfgang followed patiently after her. He looked carefully at every buſh, for he hoped, if he found the handkerchief, at leaſt to ſee the fair maiden's face again, and perhaps to earn a reward for his zeal. Fortune favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him; he ſaw it hanging on a buſh not far off, and jumping forward, he cried out, as happy as a king who had reconquered his loſt kingdom, "I have it!

               <p>Wolfgang preſſed Emily to his breaſt, and though they ſpoke not a word, their hearts underſtood each other, and the inſeparable bond of love was inwardly ſworn to by them both.</p>

               <p>They walked on, and as Wolfgang began now to recover his recollection, the terror that this lovely creature might be an illuſion of enchantment took poſſeſſion of his mind, for he extremely dreaded the loſs of her. In
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:038544_0135_10125463934B29C8"/>
order to become more certain on this point, he began to aſk, "Who is your mother, dear maiden?"</p>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Emily.</speaker>
                  <p>"We ſhall ſoon be with her; ſhe lives at the end of the park in the little white cottage, the roof of which thou ſeeſt ſhining there."</p>
               </sp>
               <p>At the words, white cottage, he ſtarted; and when he actually ſaw the top of the roof, his ſteps tottered. The magnet by his ſide drew him forwards; fear of the ſorcerer and all his crew, held him back. But, as the moſt ancient of the Poets have already evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently proved that love vanquiſhes every thing, my readers will eaſily imagine that, notwithſtanding his doubts and fears, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to follow the fair maiden, and could not poſſibly perſuade himſelf that Satan could aſſume a form of ſuch purity and perfection. To obtain, if poſſible, ſtill farther light, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan again to aſk queſtions.</p>

thing that thou ſeeſt belongs to her. No mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can love a child more tenderly than ſhe loves me."</p>

                  <p>"I know that, ſimpleton! She has told me every thing, and complained bitterly that thou waſt ſo abominably taken away from her lately, as ſhe was bringing thee to viſit me."</p>
               </sp>
               <p>Wolfgang was very glad, from this relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to be more and more confirmed in his conjecture, that his ſuppoſition about the devil and ſorcery had been an error. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, he thought, as the Counteſs von M— and this maiden are different perſons, the other ſorcerer-like adventures may probably have ariſen from equally natural cauſes. Wiſhing to inveſtigate this ſtill more clearly, he reſolved to continue his queſtions; and hoped from the information of his beloved maiden, to obtain ſatisfactory explanations on theſe heads. He was juſt going to aſk how it could poſſibly be, that from various,
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:038544_0137_10125467A32A5990"/>
and apparently contrary ways, he always returned to the ſame houſe, from which he believed himſelf far diſtant, when all at once a great noiſe behind them caught his attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He turned about inſtantly, and ſaw two men in maſks ſtanding before him. "We have you at laſt, my Lord Marquis!" they called out, jeeringly; and before Wolfgang could recover himſelf, and make any anſwer, one of them ſtabbed him twice in the body with a dagger, and then they both made their eſcape into the thicket.</p>
               <p>Wolfgang ſunk, rattling in the throat, to the earth; his eyes cloſed, and the afflicted deſpairing Emily ſoon ſaw no ſigns of life in him. She at laſt recollected, that if it were poſſible for any aſſiſtance yet to be of ſervice to him, her mother, who had ſome ſkill in the uſe of certain herbs, was moſt likely to render it efficaciouſly. She haſtened there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to her, and ſoon returned, weeping and out of breath, with the old woman. As they came to the place where Wolfgang was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked by the murderers, a profuſion of blood plainly pointed out where he had lain; but the body was gone. They perceived a bloody track from this ſpot, which they followed, and it led them down through the thicket, and brought them at no great diſtance to the edge of the ſhaft of an old mine, where the
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:038544_0138_1012546A1619E9C8"/>

               <p>Emily and the old woman ſtood for ſome time quite diſconſolate by the ſide of this hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible grave. The former wept, though a new acquaintance, the object of a ſtrong and tender paſſion; the latter mourned over her diſappointed hopes of wealth, which had all vaniſhed with the ſuppoſed Marquis. The fear that the murderers might return once more and plunge them, as evidence of their guilt, into the dreadful abyſs, at length rouſed the old woman to think of returning; and Emily, entirely abſorbed in her ſorrow, followed her in ſilence.</p>

               <p>CAPTAIN Wildner became a ſoldier ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from neceſſity than inclination; becauſe
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:038544_0139_1012552D2C38D8B8"/>
his father, Colonel Wildner, though he left behind him a high reputation for courage and integrity, ſcarcely left a pittance of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune ſufficient to pay the expences of his funeral. The ſon, who had always main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained as diſtinguiſhed a character for virtue and bravery as the father, at forty years old had only riſen to the rank of Captain. With the ſomewhat more liberal income which he then enjoyed, he began to feel in its full force the truth of the ſaying, "That it is not good for man to be alone." He ſought therefore for a helpmate amongſt the daughters of the land, and ſoon found one in the perſon of a parſon's daughter, who was indeed poor in worldly wealth, but rich in the qualities which moſt laſtingly ſecure the happineſs of the marriage ſtate.</p>
               <p>Wildner began firſt to live in her ſociety, and his wife and two children became ſo dear to him, that he would not have exchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his ſituation for the poſſeſſion of kingdoms. After a few years of enjoyment, a war, which deſolated his native land, tore him from the only bleſſing that the world had ever afforded him, and which he reſigned, on the call of duty, with infinite reluctance.</p>
               <p>When he returned home for the firſt time, after an abſence of ten years, he found his
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:038544_0140_101229C75B0A2A38"/>
wife dead, and his two children, a boy and girl, under the care of a near relation, whoſe extraordinary kindneſs to his forſaken wife and babes gave ſome conſolation to the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted huſband. As theſe children were nearly grown up, the father took his ſon with him, to join the army now ready to march, to oppoſe an enemy which had juſt rekindled the flame of war againſt his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. His daughter, an almoſt perfect model of conſummate beauty, and with a mind of the moſt untainted innocence, continued un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the protection of her ſecond mother; and nothing but the hope that the welfare of his darling would be ſecure under ſuch protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, could have enabled the father to ſupport this ſeparation with any fortitude.</p>
               <p>The foſter-mother of Clara had hitherto lived in the town; but longing for quiet, a not unnatural conſequence of age, ſhe moved into a neighbouring village, and there, in the calm of ſolitude, devoted the remainder of her days to God. Clara accompanied her thither, and from her gentle ſentimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal character, ſoon found a thouſand pleaſures in the country, that ſhe had never felt in the town. It was a luxury to the native ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of her ſoul, to leave her downy pillow early in the morning, and contemplate, from an adjoining hill, the majeſtic riſing of the
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:038544_0141_101229C900E3A558"/>
ſun. Her heart expanded, with the reviving animation of nature, to the ſublimeſt emoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of delight. She adored the omnipotence of God in this glorious picture; ſhe worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped him in every blade of graſs, and in every drop of dew which ſhone like chryſtal upon its delicate texture and vivid hue.</p>
               <p>Nothing opens the heart, and awakens every dormant feeling in the human ſoul, to a ſtate ſo ſuſceptible of impreſſion, as the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene beauty of ſuch a morning. Every thing lives, every thing moves, every thing expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, in its own peculiar manner, its participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the joys of this moment. The lowing of the herds, the bleating of the ſheep, the ſinging of the birds, the hum of the inſects, all fill the great chorus which hails the return of day. But it is a ſcene only to be felt, not deſcribed. No poet, no painter, can do it juſtice; it is too great, too ſublime, to come within the limits of their powers. Whoever really feels and enjoys it, will own with me, that at no other time he ever finds his mind elevated towards the Sovereign of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with ſuch a fervor of devotion. The heart overflows with an exceſs of feeling; one ſtretches out one's arms, and longs to embrace the utmoſt bounds of creation; the graſp is too mighty, and the full ſoul ſeeks a
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:038544_0142_1012546D891220D8"/>
kindred mind to ſhare theſe overpowering emotions.</p>
               <p>As Clara ſat, in one of the fineſt mornings of the ſpring, under the ſhade of a ſtately old oak, with all theſe ſenſations newly awakened in her boſom, ſhe was ſeen by the young Baron von Tiefenthal, who lived in a town not far diſtant. He had been ſent thither by his father for the purpoſe of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing his ſtudies; but inſtead of fulfilling this, devoted himſelf to all kinds of diſſipati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He was hunting in this romantic coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, as he now ſaw, unnoticed by her, the beautiful Clara. The power of her charms had an inſtantaneous effect on him. In the courſe of his licentious amours, he had never ſeen the bloom of ſuch a cheek, the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſuch an eye, and ſtill leſs any thing like the innocent pleaſure which was paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on her lovely face, evidently ariſing from her enjoyment of the beauties of nature, as ſhe contemplated the ſurrounding country.</p>
               <p>Tiefenthal, whoſe intemperate paſſions were already highly excited, reſpectfully ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching the fair creature. "I am fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate," he ſaid, "to find here a congenial ſoul, which can feel what I feel, and will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore pardon my breaking in on theſe feelings which my heart is full of, and ſo ardently
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:038544_0143_10125470004686B0"/>
wiſhes to ſhare with one of ſimilar ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments."—Clara ſtarted up, alarmed, and would have flown, if her heart had not felt this ſimilarity too powerfully; or if the youth who ſtood before her, had not been ſo hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and had not ſupplicated ſo urgently for her longer ſtay. One word brought on another. The diſſembler knew ſo well how to play his part; talked ſo much of the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of nature, of the pleaſures they held out to the admirers of them, that the unſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing female ſoon found his company agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and was not diſpleaſed when he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to come there again the next morning, and ſhare with her this rational delight.</p>
               <p>I ſhould deviate from my purpoſe, and extend my hiſtory to many volumes, if I ſhould continue to relate thus circumſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the whole account of the ſeduction of the artleſs Clara. I will therefore be as conciſe as poſſible. She ſaw the beautiful youth again the next and many following days. She found his converſation extremely agreeable, and giving way to the impulſe of nature, ſhe ſoon loved him with the greateſt tenderneſs, without having any idea of his villainy, and her own danger. But before two months were elapſed he had taken ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of her innocence, and ſhe became his victim.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="145" facs="unknown:038544_0144_1012547199BB91F8"/>Clara felt her fall very deeply, and in the firſt bitter moments of regret, determined never to ſee the youth again. But his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſions, and the pleadings of her own heart, for him, were ſo powerful, that notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her reſolution, ſhe ſaw him again in the evening, and from that time received his clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtine viſits in a remote chamber in the houſe of her foſter mother. The natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of this connection enſued; and as ſoon as Clara was ſenſible of it, ſhe claimed from her lover the fulfilment of his ſolemn engagements, and entreated him with anguiſh to conceal her ſhame, and marry her as ſoon as poſſible.</p>
               <p>Tiefenthal renewed his promiſes, and then left her, in order, as he ſaid, to mention the ſubject to his father, and to obtain his conſent to their marriage. But this was only a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to deceive her, for he returned immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to the town; and while the anxious Clara was praying for the ſucceſsful iſſue of his errand, and his ſpeedy return, he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten her in the arms of proſtitution. One evening when he was drunk, a quarrel aroſe between him and one of his companions, from whom he would forcibly have taken a favourite girl, and he was ſtabbed by him in the ſcuffle, and died without having repented —without having even confeſſed the crimes
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:038544_0145_101254740FF5B180"/>
that he had committed here below. His fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was informed of his miſerable end, and as he very naturally endeavoured to draw a veil over it, his being dead was but little known, and the manner of his death ſtill leſs.</p>
               <p>While the corpſe of Tiefenthal was moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering in the grave<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and his ſoul gone to its dreadful account, Clara was impatiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting his return. Every day increaſed her ſorrow, and alſo made her ſituation more conſpicuous, till at laſt ſhe was no longer able to conceal this, and much leſs her tears from the watchful eye of her foſter-mother. She owned to her the reaſon of her ſorrow; and the dreadful intelligence had ſuch an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect on her, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> it threw her into a deadly ſickneſs. Before ſhe died ſhe wrote to Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Wildner, informing him of Clara's un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy ſituation, and or the probability of her own death.</p>
               <p>On the very day in which the wretched Clara had buried her invaluable, and now for ever loſt friend, her father and brother returned, and entered her room in a violent agitation. She fainted away at the ſight of them, and was only recovered, after ſome time, by the affectionate careſſes of her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. He ſoothed her anguiſh, and promiſed
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:038544_0146_101254775B6590A8"/>
never to think harſhly of her; and alſo to pardon her ſeducer if he would repair the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury that he had been guilty of, and reward her too tender love by making her his wife. As ſhe ſtill believed that her lover was ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, and now with his father, the Captain did not go to the town, where, by minute en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries, he would probably have learnt his dreadful end; but he ſet out with her direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the village in which was the Baron von Tiefenthal's caſtle. His intention was, firſt to ſpeak with the young man, and if he found him faithful, then to talk with the old Baron on the juſtice due to his daughter; but if he found young Tiefenthal a villain, unmindful of his engagements, he then reſolved to take fearful vengeance on the traitor.</p>
               <p>Before ſhe could reach the village, poor Clara, overcome by fatigue and anxiety, fell dangerouſly ill. In conſequence of this they ſtopped at a cottage, the owners of which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them with kindneſs, and entertained them in the beſt manner they were able. After two days of ſevere ſuffering, Clara, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before her time, was delivered of a boy. Both mother and child were almoſt dead; and unfortunately in this part of the country there was no medical aſſiſtance to be obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The poor diſconſolate old father often <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> for hours by her bedſide in ſilence and
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:038544_0147_10125479D1F198F0"/>
deſpair; but when now and then Clara ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to revive, and claſped her crying in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant to her breaſt, he was comforted again, and hoped that all might yet be well.</p>
               <p>In converſation with his kind hoſt, he learned that the old Baron von Tiefenthal's Caſtle was only about nine miles from thence; that his ſon was a profligate youth, the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of all parents who had handſome daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and of all huſbands who had handſome wives; and that he was now the declared lover of the beautiful Counteſs von M—. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he was at preſent with his father, or ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving about elſewhere, the old peaſant, who ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom left his ſolitude, could not tell.</p>
               <p>This heart-rending diſcription of the ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer of his child induced the Captain to ſend his ſon to the village, which lay near the caſtle, to learn ſome farther particulars re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting young Tiefenthal, and whether he was now in the country. He went the ſame day on which the old Baron brought poor Wolfgang with him to his houſe. Many of the inhabitants of the village, who in paſſing, took him for his ſon, warned their daughters of him in the preſence of young Wildner; and when he made farther enquiries about him, he heard the ſame account that had already been given to his father. "We ſuppoſed
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:038544_0148_1012547B6D8AD428"/>
him," they added, "dead; but weeds do not die, and now we muſt take care, or we ſhall live to ſee new diſtreſſes brought amongſt us by his debaucheries."</p>
               <p>When the ſon returned with this lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble account to his father, both, glowing with indignation, vowed to revenge themſelves on the traitor, if he would not render full and complete ſatisfaction to the injured Clara. Young Wildner went out again, and ſwore to his father not to return till he brought the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayer with him.</p>
               <p>He met the Counteſs von M—'s coach as ſhe was carrying Wolfgang to her caſtle; and being informed by a peaſant that it was her, and that her companion was no doubt the young Baron von Tiefenthal, he followed the carriage with haſty ſteps, and overtook them walking in the grove. His impatience for revenge did not permit him to aſk for any explanation; he only peremptorily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Wolfgang to follow him, who inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently complied with this demand.</p>
               <p>The ſequel of this melancholy ſtory is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready known to my readers, and it would therefore be ſuperfluous to relate it again.</p>

               <p>ON the evening of the ſame day, in which poor Wolfgang was ſo barbarouſly murdered, the innocent Emily, ſeated under the ſhade of a lime, wept ſincerely this unexpected misfortune. He was, in their ſhort acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, become very dear to her, and was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways preſent to her imagination, as he had knelt before her, when they ſilently, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſively pledged to each other mutual fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. To have loſt him in a moment after, and that without a hope of ever ſeeing him again, were circumſtances of ſuch bewilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing horror, that all attempts to reconcile herſelf to them were vain. Not far from her ſat her foſter-mother and the Counteſs von M—, with diſappointment ſtrongly depict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on their countenances, in earneſt conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. All their plans and hopes were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated by Wolfgang's death, and the thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Counteſs felt, for the firſt time, a real anxiety how to diſengage herſelf from her debts, and leave an unencumbered eſtate to her daughter. They had juſt come to a reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:038544_0150_1012548135BDC448"/>
to have the dead body drawn out of the ſhaft early the next morning, and to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate to themſelves whatever they might find in the pockets of the deceaſed, as a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful inheritance, as a young peaſant ran by them in the utmoſt haſte; anguiſh and fear were painted on his brow, and his terrible groans made them notice and ſtop him. "What has happened to you?" aſked the Counteſs.</p>

"I was ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering berries in the wood near the ſhaft—there is ſomething alive in it—it moaned—I ran away! and now I always think it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after me!"</p>
               </sp>
               <p>"That is my poor Savoyard!" cries Emily, ſtarting up; "Oh if he yet lives, how happy I ſhall be!" "Yes, indeed, how happy we ſhall be!" cry the Counteſs and the old wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.—"I will go to him! I muſt ſee him and comfort him!" cries Emily, and ſhe was going forwards. The prudent old woman detained her, and convinced her that to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort him was impoſſible, till they had obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed aſſiſtance to draw him from the ſhaft.</p>
               <p>The inhabitants of the neighbouring vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage were ſummoned; and, furniſhed with co<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="152" facs="unknown:038544_0151_10125483A64B6BC8"/>
this purpoſe. On the way it firſt occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the Counteſs, that perhaps the depth of the ſhaft might baffle all their endeavours; but an old peaſant, who walked next to her, aſſured her to the contrary, for that one of his calves had fallen in there the year before, and that he had ventured down to reſcue it, and did not find the hole above forty feet deep, and the bottom of it was overgrown with ſoft moſs. He offered to go down now with a rope, and bind the unfortunate perſon who had been thrown in there, when thoſe on the outſide could draw him up, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards himſelf. This comfortable account drew them all on with increaſing haſte, and they came to the mouth of the ſhaft in a very ſhort time. Emily was the firſt there, and bending over the edge, ſhe called to her dear Savoyard, and was anſwered by a deep moan.</p>
               <p>The peaſant went down, and ſoon called out, "Draw him up, I have faſtened him well. He is ſtill alive, and ſpeaks, but it is in a language that I do not underſtand." Every one took hold of the ropes, and drew with united ſtrength; Emily herſelf was amongſt them, and was anxiouſly careful that her Wolfgang might not be wounded anew in this operation. At laſt the load came near, and with one effort more it lay before them, when they all became ſpeechleſs with
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:038544_0152_101254854569A690"/>
aſtoniſhment at ſeeing, not the hoped-for Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyard, but a handſomely dreſſed woman. She moaned lamentably, and kept her right hand upon her heart. Her clothes were bloody, and when they examined her, they found a dagger plunged, up to the hilt, in her left breaſt. As ſhe endeavoured, in vain, to draw this out, a good-natured peaſant rendered her this aſſiſtance, and a ſtream of blood flowed after it. The unfortunate wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man once opened her large blue eyes, and then expired in the arms of the Counteſs.</p>
               <p>Emily very earneſtly entreated the peaſant in the ſhaft, to ſearch if there was not ſtill another body to be found. But he aſſured her, on his honour, there were no more.</p>
               <p>Deceived in their hopes, the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany wandered back in a melancholy diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, fully convinced by this double proof, that there muſt be robbers and murderers harboured in the wood. The Counteſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, therefore, to have it ſearched tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly the next day, and, in the meanwhile, for the greater ſecurity of her darling, to take her, and her foſter-mother, with her to the caſtle. The corpſe of the ſtranger was alſo brought there, and they examined her clothes and her pockets, but found not the leaſt clue to lead them even to gueſs who ſhe
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:038544_0153_10125487BB6E6E88"/>
might be; they only diſcovered that this poor murdered woman was very big with child. This dreadful ſight excited new compaſſion in the heart of the Counteſs; ſhe wept very ſincerely for her, and the next day had her buried in her family vault.</p>
               <p>Early the enſuing morning, the peaſants from the village aſſembled again, and went, with the ſervants of the Counteſs, to ſearch the wood; and if they did not take the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers, at leaſt to alarm them by this atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and probably remove them from thence. They returned, in the evening, without ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs; for, notwithſtanding their extreme dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, they had neither found any traces of Wolfgang, nor of the murderers. After this, Emily returned to the cottage with the old woman, and the Counteſs reſolved to go and reſide, for ſome time, in the neighbouring town, partly to baniſh care, and partly to execute a plan which ſhe had formed, for the payment of her moſt urgent debts.</p>
               <p>The day before that fixed on for her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, a ſtranger arrived at the caſtle, and enquired of the ſervants if the Counteſs von M— lived there. On being anſwered in the affirmative, he deſired to ſee her, and, when he was conducted to her, he preſented her with a caſket carefully ſealed up, and
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:038544_0154_1012548B09E52460"/>
begged for a certificate that he had delivered it faithfully. The Counteſs opened the caſket directly, and found, to her great aſtoniſhment, that it contained four thouſand ſequins, and a quantity of jewels which were apparently of great value. She examined it with the greateſt care, but found neither let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter nor any thing elſe, by which ſhe could at all imagine from whom this magnificent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent came, or whether it was properly allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to her. But the addreſs, to which ſhe again referred, appeared to prove this clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. She enquired in vain of the bearer for farther ſatisfaction, for he was unable to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify her curioſity.—"I am," he ſaid, "a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary and Magiſtrate of the little town of W—, which lies four miles from hence. Yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day afternoon a carriage arrived there, and ſtopped at the Golden Sun, and a gentleman who had been dangerouſly wounded, was lifted out of it by his ſervants. He deſired that a ſurgeon might be ſent for directly; but as the only one who lives in our town, was gone into the country, this requeſt was of no avail. He then begged to have a notary ſent for, and I was ſummoned to him immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. He ſpoke to me at firſt in Italian, but as I did not underſtand him, he ſpoke to me in German. His firſt enquiries were about the next town, and whether he ſhould meet with a ſkilful ſurgeon there. When I had
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:038544_0155_1012548D81028B80"/>
given him information on theſe particulars, he aſked if I knew where your Excellency lived. On my aſſuring him that I did, he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered his valet to reach him this caſket. With much difficulty he wrote a very ſhort note, and laid it in the caſket, which he then ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up himſelf, and dictated the direction that is upon it to his valet. At laſt he delivered it to me with the moſt urgent requeſt to bring it over myſelf to your Excellency without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay. This I faithfully promiſed; and he then gave me, as he expreſſed himſelf, a purſe of fifty ducats for my trouble, and ordered his ſervants to carry him again to his carriage. Before I could ſet out, he drove paſt my houſe; and what ſurpriſed me very much, went a quite contrary way than the directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which I had given him to the capital."</p>

               </sp>
               <p>Before the Notary took leave of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs, ſhe made him a handſome preſent, and
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:038544_0158_1012549503375570"/>
earneſtly entreated him to enquire which way the Marquis was gone; and if he learnt where he was, to let her know directly. The Notary promiſed to do this, and the better to keep his word, left the caſtle immediately.</p>
               <p>The Counteſs examined the preſent to Emily once again, and found that it was more than ſufficient for the payment of her moſt preſſing debts; but as it belonged en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to her darling, ſhe was too conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious not to ſhow it to her, and aſk her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent firſt, before ſhe appropriated it to this purpoſe. She ſent for her; and firſt relating the incident which had juſt occurred, then mentioned her wiſh to apply this treaſure to the liquidation of her debts, to which ſhe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented without heſitation.</p>
               <p>Emily, who was as firmly convinced as the Counteſs that no other than her dear Savoyard could have ſent her this magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent preſent, wept and lamented him ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. "He became dear to me," ſhe ſaid, "in the few moments of our acquaintance, and will eternally continue ſo from this dying proof of his love for me. Oh! could I but ſave him, could I but nurſe and comfort him! I would willingly paſs my life with him, even if it was to be in poverty." The Counteſs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to conſole her, and attained her
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:038544_0159_10125497722AE928"/>
end completely, as ſhe clearly proved to her, that a man, endowed with ſuch ſupernatural ſtrength, would certainly alſo have the means to heal his wounds. "If he could," ſhe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, "reſcue himſelf out of the ſhaft with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any aſſiſtance, if he could, in ſo ſhort a time, provide himſelf with a carriage, horſes, and ſervants, he, no doubt, poſſeſſes the power of reſtoring himſelf to health, by his ſuperior knowledge probably in the uſe of ſimples. In the meanwhile only waſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently; he will ſooner or later return quite recovered, and make you the happieſt of women." Emily promiſed to be eaſy, and looked anxiouſly towards the day in which ſhe ſhould again ſee the beloved of her heart.</p>
               <p>Before two days were paſſed, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs had ſold the jewels; and being now poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of ſixty thouſand florins, on the third day ſhe ſatisfied the greater part of her cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors. As ſhe ſat down to table in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in company with her Emily, much ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier in her mind on being relieved from theſe incumbrances, a meſſenger on horſeback ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at the caſtle. He brought her a letter from the Notary, in which he informed her, that he had been fortunate enough to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the route which the Marquis had taken, and followed him to the next Saxon frontier town, where, to his great grief, he found
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:038544_0160_101254991133E670"/>
him in his coffin, and ſaw him buried the ſame day. That to the ſurpriſe of every bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, his ſervants had vaniſhed immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his death, and left no traces of which way they were flown. That the magiſtrate of the town had been called in to take charge of whatever he might have left; but that, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting ſome few clothes, and a little linen, there was not any thing found. It was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a well grounded preſumption, that his ſervants had taken poſſeſſion of whatever papers and money he might have had with him, as ſoon as their maſter was dead, and had diſappeared on that account.</p>

               <p>EMILY, on this freſh diſappointment of her fondeſt hopes, felt all her ſorrow renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the greater keenneſs. She mourned in Wolfgang, a lover and benefactor, who had, in her opinion, undeniably proved in the latter his ſincerity in the former character. Gratitude and love thus, combined to fill her ſoul with a lively grief, that ſhe did not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:038544_0161_1012549B89AE87E8"/>
to diſſemble. In vain her noble mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſought to conſole her; ſhe rejected all conſolation, and withdrew, unperceived from the company, in order to be able to weep without interruption.</p>
               <p>The evening was delightful; the full moon, with her melancholy light, illuminated the whole region, and invited Emily to wander down the avenue of the Caſtle, at the end of which ſhe ſtood ſtill, abſorbed in her diſtreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful feelings. In this ſituation, without having heard any previous noiſe, ſhe felt herſelf all at once ſeized by ſomebody with very ſtrong arms, who held her from behind, while ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtopped her mouth, and covered her head; and then lifting her up, they carried her off with the utmoſt haſte. After run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning for ſome minutes, they put her into a carriage, but ſtill covered up, and drove off directly; and now as the rattling of the wheels would prevent her cries being heard, they took the bandage from her mouth.</p>
               <p>She wept and complained in vain, for they appeared not to mind her, as ſhe received no anſwer, though ſhe perceived plainly that ſomebody ſat on each ſide of her. When they had driven for about an hour, the carriage ſtopped. Emily was lifted out, and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding her earneſt remonſtrances, they
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:038544_0162_1012549DF94CEA30"/>
undreſſed her to her ſhift. In her efforts to reſiſt them ſhe pulled off the cloth that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered her head, and ſaw to her great amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that ſhe was in a wood; that it was two men who were undreſſing her, and that two others ſtood by with lighted torches. Believing herſelf to be, without doubt, in the hands of thoſe villains who had murdered her poor Wolfgang before her eyes, ſhe fully expected to ſhare the ſame fate; and, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with apprehenſion, ſunk into a ſwoon, out of which the was firſt rouſed by the ſhak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the carriage. To her great aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhe found herſelf quite dreſſed again; and this aſtoniſhment was increaſed, as ſhe perceived that ſhe was dreſſed as a man. The day now began to dawn, and ſhe looked with ſurpriſe alternately at herſelf, at the fine car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and at her conductors; an old gentleman ſat on her left hand, and oppoſite to her two domeſtics, who carefully obſerved all her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; the former held a ſmelling bottle in his hand, and addreſſed himſelf to Emily in a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of which ſhe underſtood not a word. Quite confounded by all the inexplicable cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of her ſituation, ſhe remained for ſome time ſilent; but as ſhe began to recover from this, and to feel with renewed force her cruel ſeparation from her mother, ſhe was entirely overcome, and, beginning to weep bitterly, fell at the feet of the old man.—
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:038544_0163_101254A148FE0850"/>
"Whoever thou art," ſhe ſaid, "let me hope for compaſſion from thy age, and they vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable countenance! What have I done that I am treated in this manner? Whither doſt thou carry me? Oh, take me again to my diſconſolate mother, or at leaſt leave me at liberty!"</p>
               <p>The old gentleman ſmiled rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuouſly, and made a long ſerious ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangue in the ſame, to her unintelligible lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, as he ſpoke before; and notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her repeatedly aſſuring him that ſhe did not underſtand him, he went on with yet more ſeriouſneſs, and at laſt pulled out a dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and a piſtol, which he held to her breaſt with terrible threats; and Emily, trembling and weeping, ſhrunk from him into the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the carriage.</p>
               <p>A repetition of ſuch ſcenes frequently took place between this poor captive and the old gentleman, who ſhe obſerved was treated by the others with great reverence. They tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled very faſt, only ſtopping occaſionally for very ſhort intervals; and previouſly to theſe, bandages were always put over Emily's eyes and mouth, and ſhe was made to ſit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the floor of the coach, and obliged often to remain ſome hours in this ſituation. She ſoon took notice that it was only in uninha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited

places that they allowed her the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges of ſight and ſpeech, or ever permitted her to get out of the carriage, at which times the old gentleman always kept watch over her at a little diſtance, and never ceaſed to threaten her terribly. All kinds of refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were offered to her, but ſhe ſtubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refuſed them, till the old man conſtrained her to eat by the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

She was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to ſleep, and, but for her youth and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous conſtitution, muſt have ſunk under the fatigue and diſtreſs which ſhe ſuffered. The idea of making her eſcape was conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſent to her, and particularly during the night, when her conductors were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered with ſleep; but ſhe ſoon perceived that this would be impracticable, as two ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, who ſat upon the box all day, always rode by the ſide of the carriage at night, and waked the guards within whenever they came to a place where they were to take freſh horſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="166" facs="unknown:038544_0165_101254A5586D3068"/>Four days and five nights they went on in this manner, and poor Emily was become extremely weak, when at the dawn of the fifth day they ſtopped at a houſe, without her conductors having as uſual put the bandages upon her eyes and mouth. To her great aſtoniſhment and ſatisfaction the door of the carriage was opened, and ſhe was urged to get out, and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

They brought her ſome coffee, which ſhe ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with great eagerneſs, not having had any thing of the kind during her journey; and the old gentleman took more pains to entertain her than ever. On Emily's again aſſuring him that ſhe did not underſtand one word of what he ſaid, he ended the converſation with reproaches; and ſhe plainly ſaw that he made complaints of her behaviour to the owner of the houſe, and ſhewed him a letter which greatly excited his ſurpriſe; but ſhe was already ſo much uſed to riddles, that this appeared indifferent to her, and, muſing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in herſelf, ſhe did not pay them any farther attention.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="167" facs="unknown:038544_0166_101254A8B4F868D8"/>They ſoon ſet out again on their journey, and travelled now more leiſurely, putting up regularly at the inns, where ſhe was liberally provided with every thing, and a particular table was always prepared for her. In the evening, as the old gentleman conducted her to a ſeparate bed chamber, he gave her a parcel of women's apparel, at ſight of which ſhe once more felt real pleaſure. Out of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude ſhe kiſſed the hand of the old man, who endeavoured to prevent her ſhewing him this reſpect; and kiſſing her's in return, he then withdrew, and left her to examine the clothes, which ſhe found much handſomer than thoſe ſhe had been accuſtomed to wear.</p>
               <p>One of Emily's great concerns had been, the being obliged to be dreſſed like a man; and her awkward comical manner in this dreſs had often excited the ſmiles of her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductors, and as often made her bluſh. A long mantle, which they had given her, was her only conſolation, and ſhe was never content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but when ſhe could cover herſelf in it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely. Every female, who imagines herſelf for a moment in Emily's ſituation, will not probably be ſurpriſed that ſhe put on this long wiſhed-for dreſs directly, and throwing herſelf upon the bed, ſlept ſoftly after her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive fatigue.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="168" facs="unknown:038544_0167_101254AB28D1EF98"/>On the evening of the tenth day, after this metamorphoſis, they travelled later than uſual. The old gentleman was this day more than commonly eloquent; his manner was urgent, and often affecting, and Emily could underſtand plainly that he was very ſolicitous for an anſwer from her. But however wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly ſhe would have gratified him, it was not in her power; ſhe could only reply to him by tears and geſtures, and was obliged to bear patiently his thruſting her from him, and the renewal of all his former threats. About midnight he became quiet, and the carriage ſoon ſtopped at a large building, which ſtood in a wild country, ſurrounded with wood.</p>
               <p>Emily, who had hitherto been always pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting plans for her eſcape, which ſhe ſtill hoped to accompliſh, was in terrible conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation when ſhe ſaw this building, on account of its being ſo entirely different from all thoſe to which ſhe had been habituated. An in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward foreboding pointed it out to her as the boundary of her journey; and though ſhe hoped indeed now for ſome explanation of this enigmatical affair, ſhe alſo feared to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience new misfortunes. After knocking a long time, and ringing a great bell, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body came to one of the windows; and after making many enquiries of thoſe waiting with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:038544_0168_101254ACC74501F8"/>
the door was at laſt opened. Two wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, whoſe ſtrange dreſs excited Emily's ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, came out with lamps in their hands, and received her as ſhe was liſted out of the carriage; and likewiſe a letter, which was delivered to them by the old gentleman. The door was ſhut again directly, and Emily's aſtoniſhment was extreme, to find herſelf left by all her hitherto conductors, and only in the company of the two women.</p>
               <p>They carried her through a long paſſage, ſparingly lighted by one lamp, till they came to a little room which they forced her to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. They talked to her for ſome time, but ſhe did not underſtand them, and they were as much at a loſs when ſhe anſwered them in German. At length they left her alone, and her diſtreſs and fear were much increaſed when ſhe began to examine her room nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly. In one corner of it there was a ſtraw bed, upon which lay an indifferent woollen cover; next to this ſtood a little altar, and upon it there were a crucifix and ſome other images: a ſmall wooden table and a ſtool completed the inventory of the furniture of this place. My readers will immediately un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that Emily was in the cell of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent; but this ſhe could not gueſs, as ſhe was educated in the Proteſtant religion, and from her youth had lived in a ſolitude, where
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:038544_0169_101254AF5CFDBCD8"/>
ſhe never even ſaw any Catholic clergy, or could acquire any idea of a cloiſter. It was not at that time the cuſtom of writers to make romantic hiſtories of Monks and Nuns, and conſequently ſhe could not, through ſuch me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diums, become acquainted with the cuſtom and appearance of convents. It is eaſy to pardon her, therefore, if ſhe feared and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, from this indifferent furniture, that ſhe was in a priſon, and gave herſelf up to ſorrow. She ran to the window, to breathe the free air, and tranquillize her beating heart; but the cloſe grate which ſurrounded it frightened her back, and contributed to confirm her the more in her terrible conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>It was paſt midnight, and ſhe was extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tired with her long journey, but yet ſound no inclination to ſleep. She ſtarted indeed with horror from the bed, upon which, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſuggeſtions of her ardent ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, many innocent victims had lain convulſed with agony. As ſhe was dwelling on this idea, ſhe all on a ſudden heard the ſound of a dull bell, and ſoon after a noiſe in the whole building, ſucceeded by a murmur of praying mournfully. This ſhe immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concluded to be the carrying ſome poor ſinner to the place of execution, having often heard from her foſter-mother accounts of this
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:038544_0170_101254B2A39E4558"/>
kind; and, ſuppoſing herſelf to be now in danger of a ſimilar fate, ſhe ſunk to the ground in a ſwoon.</p>
               <p>Early in the morning the Nuns found her in a lamentable ſituation; the fatigue and terror that ſhe had undergone had brought on a violent fever, attended with delirium; ſhe raved dreadfully, and fancied every Nun who came near her was one of the ſervants of the executioner. Theſe feeble creatures could with difficulty get her into bed, and they were obliged to gird her down in order to keep her there.</p>
               <p>In this manner lay the poor loſt Emily, ſlowly languiſhing out her exiſtence; for all the aſſiſtance which the Nuns attempted to adminiſter to her, and that of the ſpiritual and bodily phyſicians, who were called in to her directly, was of no avail, for the fever continued to rage unabatedly, and the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium increaſed.

               <head>CHAP. XVI.</head>
               <p>THE ſlumbering powers of juſtice having been once more awakened in Italy againſt the daring banditti, the former colleagues of Jacob, they continued, after his departure, to experience ſo vigorous a proſecution, that, no longer finding any proſpect of ſafety in their native land, the majority of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to follow the example of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned companion, and retire till the ſtorm was laid; and in the meantime determined to pay him a viſit in Germany. "We may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly," ſaid they among themſelves, "find ſomething to do there; the cold-blooded Germans will perhaps ſuffer us quietly to gain a livelihood on their highways till we can return hither without danger."</p>
               <p>Jacob was very much ſurpriſed one day at meeting two of his moſt intimate comrades in one of the ſtreets of the capital, and to learn from them that there were twenty others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides themſelves likewiſe in the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:038544_0172_101254B6B1C1CEE8"/>
Their joy at this unexpected rencon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre was much greater than his, becauſe he had at that time firmly reſolved never to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in robbery and murder again, but to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy his lately acquired fortune in quiet. But in this company he was ſoon induced to give up his reſolution, and to unite in their ſcheme of highway robbery. He carried them into a wood through which the road to Saxony lay; and before the cloſe of the firſt day, after they were lodged there, this ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditti, eager for prey, had robbed three car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, and murdered as many men. Theſe unuſual accounts frightened the whole coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; every one talked of theſe murders, and every one armed themſelves againſt the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers.</p>
               <p>As one of the banditti Ventured once into a village to buy proviſions, he was, on ſome ſuſpicious circumſtances, arreſted by the peaſants, as one of the perpetrators of theſe recent murders, and carried before the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate to be examined. When the reſt of the troop heard from their truſty Jacob, that their comrade would be conveyed in the evening from the village Judge to the office of the inquiſition, they waited in the road for him; and while they believed that they were reſcuing their comrade, they ſet poor Wolfgang at liberty, who was then carried
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:038544_0173_101254B9FA055CF0"/>
as a priſoner the ſame way. His eſcape therefore was no more ſupernatural than his being taken up for a thief on entering the ale houſe of the village, wrapt in the very mantle which had been ſtolen from the hoſt, or than his being ſuſpected as a murderer, after the deſcription given of him by Captain Wildner.</p>
               <p>Wolfgang was at that time unknown to himſelf, carried to the caſtle of the Counteſs von M—, becauſe the village in which they arreſted him lay within her juriſdiction, and there, as my readers will recollect, he was confined in a cave for want of a better priſon. In this cave, according to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of a foreigner, a huntſman who had often ſojourned there, a great treaſure was burried. The ſteward of the Counteſs, who had often, as he waited on her at table, heard her talk of the great treaſure which lay concealed in this country, heard about this time from a peaſant what was ſaid by the huntſman, in conſequence of which, he ſent for him directly. The huntſman not only maintained the truth of his account, but aſſured the ſteward that this treaſure might eaſily be obtained; and he engaged to ſearch for it, for him, if he would give him a new coat and waiſtcoat, ſome linen, twelve
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:038544_0174_101254BCB642CAF8"/>
new dollars, and ſix new ducats for the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit who guarded it.</p>
               <p>The ſteward agreed to every thing, and promiſed to bring the preſent with him to the place; and the cunning huntſman hoped to eſcape with it, and elude the expected per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of his engagement. The ſimple ſteward was in his room, preparing himſelf by praying and ſinging, for this undertaking, when Wolfgang was brought priſoner to the caſtle, and without his knowledge confined in the cave. When he came, equipped with his preſent, and whatever elſe was requiſite for their employment, to the door of this place, which was uſually open, and found it barred, the huntſman, who was eager for the prize, aſſured him that this was the only night that the treaſure could be raiſed without danger; and adviſed that they ſhould go down through the air-hole of the cave, which was reſolved on, and they enlarged it with their tools for this purpoſe.</p>
               <p>The huntſman who had often practiſed frauds of this kind, was dreſſed as a ſorcerer, in order to make more impreſſion on the fooliſh ſteward. Wolfgang, whoſe imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was full of ſorcerers, really took him for one, and, terrified at the ſight of him, uttered a violent ejaculation, which equally terrify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:038544_0175_101254BF27BCB2F0"/>
them, they made their eſcape as faſt as poſſible, leaving all their things behind them, and thus pointed out to Wolfgang the means of effecting his eſcape, and left him in poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their bundle, which he took away with him.</p>
               <p>The village hoſt, whom Jacob impoſed on with his well invented tale, and who, by his loquacity had occaſioned ſo much reſpect to be paid to, and ſo many misfortunes to befall poor Wolfgang, met Jacob the morning after this adventure. He told him that the young Marquis was actually arrived, in the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a mouſe-trap and hatchel dealer, and had ſtaid one night at his houſe.</p>
               <p>Jacob liſtened attentively to this account, and learnt, on further enquiry, that, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his promiſe, his neighbour had not kept his ſecret, but had related the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that he entruſted him with, to others; and that the Baron von Tiefenthal, and the Counteſs von M—, were now eagerly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to decoy the ſuppoſed Marquis to their houſes, that they might create to themſelves, by their attention, an ample claim to his remunerations. He promiſed his neighbour, who was jealous of this, to take an opportunity of informing the young
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:038544_0176_101254C0C6E31790"/>
Marquis of theſe deſigns, and then haſtened forwards.</p>
               <p>Sooner or later thought Jacob, as he went along, it will be diſcovered, that the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis, whoſe coming I have foretold, is only a poor mouſe-trap and hatchel-dealer, and I ſhall then be known for a liar, and perhaps draw on myſelf a judicial examination. It will be beſt, therefore, that I prevent this diſcovery, by removing the object who would occaſion it out of the way. He conſulted with his comrades on this, and went out, with one of them, to ſearch for the innocent creature who was to be their ſacrifice. They went with this view through the wood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing the Counteſs von M—, and ſaw, from a little diſtance, Wolfgang and Emily come down the hill together. They recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized their victim directly, and ſtealing near, ſtabbed him twice with a dagger, and left him, as they hoped, dead. They purpoſely ſpared Emily, that ſhe might ſpread the news of his death in the country, and likewiſe the belief that he was really a perſon of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, becauſe he was murdered without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing robbed, by two men in maſks, who called him Marquis.</p>

               <p>LOVE acknowledges no rank, no laws; it derides all threats, defies all dangers, and overcomes all the impediments, which like a barrier, oppoſe themſelves againſt it. If any evidence were yet wanting of the truth of a propoſition already ſo clearly proved, it is ſtill farther confirmed by the hiſtory of the young Ducheſs R—, which I ſhall now relate to my readers.</p>
               <p>The Duke of R—, her father, was a man of the firſt rank and fortune in Italy. She was his only child, and the heireſs to his great property; in addition to which, ſhe was univerſally allowed to be one of the moſt beautiful women of her time. With theſe attractions, it was not ſurpriſing that a multitude of lovers ſacrificed to her charms the incenſe of flattery and adoration; and that the moſt diſtinguiſhed families in Italy courted her alliance. But to his homage ſhe was inſenſible; for ſhe had long loved in
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:038544_0178_101254C68AD17090"/>
ſecret, with the tendereſt affection, a young Marquis, who was indeed extremely hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, but ſo poor, that for want of any other means of living, he had for ſome years ſerved her father as his maſter of the horſe. She, who had before ſeldom rode out, now found her only pleaſure in this exerciſe, which gave her an opportunity of being in the company of this beloved object; a part of whoſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice it was, to ride by the ſide of any of the family when they went out on horſeback. Often when they went through a ſolitary wood in this manner, ſhe would purpoſely by a quick gallop, leave the hoſt of ſervants far behind them; and when they were thus alone, her uſual timidity gave way to an elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, but yet perfectly modeſt expreſſion in her fine countenance, of the inward ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of her heart.</p>
               <p>The happy maſter of the horſe at laſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood her, and theſe young inexperienced children ſoon gave themſelves up entirely to the guidance of their tender paſſion. As they frequently loſt themſelves in the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt parts of the woods, and were ſome hours before they returned to their followers, the moſt attentive of theſe probably conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuſpicions of them, and immediately im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted their conjectures to the old Duke. Without giving any reaſon for it to his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:038544_0179_101254C900DB9AC0"/>
he diſmiſſed the maſter of the horſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly from his ſervice, and hoped, in this manner, to avoid making the affair public, and put an end at once to what he thought a mere romance. But this precaution came too late; a month ſooner perhaps the young Ducheſs might have been able to forget her lover, but now ſhe was reminded of him eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day, every hour, by the conſequences of their paſſion, which, together with the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh occaſioned her by this ſeparation, made the unfortunate Marquis a thouſand times more dear to her. She ſoon found an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of writing to him, and in this letter ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly avowed not to expoſe herſelf to the dreaded wrath of her parents, but to follow the impulſe of her affections, and fly with him into the wide world. Full of anxiety, ſhe made preparations for this flight with the greateſt caution and expedition, and when ſhe accompliſhed it, took with her all her jewels, and a caſket of her father's full of gold.</p>
               <p>When the old Duke heard of the elope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his only child, he was quite raving, and ſwore to ſacrifice all his fortune if he could but ſee her again, and take his revenge on her, and the companion of her flight. He ſent out ſcouts after them to all countries, ſupplied them with large ſums of money, and made them take an oath not to return with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:038544_0180_101254CA9B30E448"/>
the delinquents. But one after another returned without having attained their object, till the houſe governor of the Duke was the only one ſtill remaining in purſuit of them. His letters were the ſole comfort, the forlorn hope of the diſtracted father; for this man al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways wrote word that he was on the track of the fugitives, and expected yet to overtake them.</p>
               <p>This auſtere, but faithful ſervant, had cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen four men in Italy for his companions, whoſe capacities for ſuch a ſervice he knew from experience; and with the aſſiſtance of theſe excellent blood-hounds, he had always diſcovered the route of the perſecuted lovers, who perceiving that they were followed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued their flight without intermiſſion. They had already wandered through France, and the greater half of Germany, when they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at Leipſic; and here, as they had not for a long time had any freſh alarm of being purſued, they reſolved to reſt.</p>
               <p>In the ſame hotel at which the Marquis and the Dutcheſs put up, lodged the Baron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs von Z—, from Dreſden. This Lady, attracted by the angelic countenance, and the whole appearance of the Dutcheſs, ſought to become acquainted with her, and ſhe, happy to meet with ſuch a perſon in a foreign
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:038544_0181_101254CD1192E6C0"/>
country, who appeared to take a cordial in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in her fate, encouraged this acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, which ſoon became a ſincere friendſhip. As the Dutcheſs was one day about to open her whole heart to the Baroneſs, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis came into the room in great embarraſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and in a few words made known to her, that her father's old houſe-governor was that moment arrived at Leipſic, and had put up at a neighbouring hotel. "I paſſed by," added the terrified Marquis, "as he ſtepped out of the carriage, and can hardly doubt but that he muſt have ſeen and known me."</p>
               <p>This account overwhelmed the Dutcheſs with affliction; and as the amiable Baroneſs enquired into the cauſe of her diſtreſs, they revealed their ſituation to her, and entreated to have her advice and protection. "I will endeavour," ſaid the Baroneſs, quite affected, "to procure you an aſylum. You muſt fly, but fly in ſuch a manner that your followers ſhall not be able to diſcover you any more. On the populous highways from one great town to another, you will always be tracked, and never enjoy any reſt. I have a friend in Bayreuth, who, like you, has felt the power of love; and I will ſend you to her, where you will be kindly received, and may live ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely under her protection till this ſtorm is over, and the anger of your parents is ſoften<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed."
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:038544_0182_101254D0592D4C18"/>
They thanked her moſt cordially for this advice and aſſiſtance, and ſet out the ſame night. The Baroneſs ſent her gentleman with them, and gave them a letter to the Counteſs von M—; for this was the friend to whoſe attention ſhe recommended them.</p>
               <p>This old ſervant, who knew all the bye-roads, conducted them happily over the frontiers, and they almoſt believed themſelves out of the reach of danger, as they were now not above five miles from the Counteſs's caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, when they were ſtopped in a wood by ſix men in maſks. Theſe were ſome of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob's comrades, who were lurking here for booty, and hoped to obtain it from theſe travellers; but this time their expectations were deceived. The Marquis's ſervants were well armed, and reſiſting their attack, wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them ſo ſeverely, that they were glad to ſeek their ſafety in flight, though unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately not till they had wounded the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis, whoſe only ſolicitude had been to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect the Ducheſs from their aſſaults.</p>
               <p>Being apprehenſive that this might be the party ſent after them by the Duke, and that they would return to the purſuit of them, the Marquis entreated the ſervants to drive on again with the utmoſt ſpeed. The blood was all this time flowing faſt from his wounds,
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:038544_0183_101254D2CDE60778"/>
and when they came to the end of the wood, they ventured to make a pauſe, that they might endeavour to ſtop it. But he, more anxious about his beloved Dutcheſs than for himſelf, ſaid earneſtly, "Do not mind me, but aſſiſt her, and ſave her if poſſible; for I fear much that this alrrm may bring on her premature delivery, and make our farther progreſs impoſſible."</p>
               <p>The Baroneſs's gentleman was of the ſame opinion, and therefore adviſed the hiring a carriage in the next village, "in which," he added, "I will carry the Dutcheſs to the Counteſs's, where ſhe will find ſafety and conſolation in the arms of a friend, while you go on to the neareſt town, and put yourſelf under the care of a ſurgeon. I will come to you there, and if your wounds do not prevent it; will conduct you unnoticed to the caſtle, and thus fruſtrate all further purſuit."</p>
               <p>The Marquis approved of this plan, and conjured the gentleman to put it into execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion without delay, as he found his wounds grow ſo extremely painful as abſolutely to require aſſiſtance. They were juſt ſetting off again, as a well dreſſed farmer paſſed them in a light carriage. The gentleman called to him, and aſked if he would, for double the uſual pay, carry a lady, who was taken ill
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:038544_0184_101254D4662F11F8"/>
in conſequence of a fright, to the Counteſs von M—'s caſtle. The man inſtantly agreed to it, and they all rejoiced that ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable an opportunity had occurred to forward their ſcheme. The ſtill fainting Dutcheſs was put into the carriage directly, and the gentleman ſeated himſelf by her; and in their hurry a little medicine cheſt, in the form of a chatulle, was all that they took with them. The poor Marquis was thus parted from this beloved object without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to bid her farewell; but the hope of ſeeing her again ſoon made him ſupport this ſeparation with tolerable fortitude.</p>
               <p>It is with ſorrow that I acquaint my read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of theſe hopes being diſappointed, from the unfortunate circumſtance of the Dutcheſs's falling into the hands of the formidable Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob; for he was the man in whoſe-carriage ſhe was placed. It was in the morning of this day that he had murdered poor Wolf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gang, and he was now going to viſit his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rades in the wood, to hear what they had made of their day's work. The preſent op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of acquiring, in all probability, a conſiderable booty, was too enticing for him to let it paſs by unemployed. He purpoſely carried <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> charge the wrong way; and ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping in a remote part of the park, while the gentleman was buſy in endeavouring to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:038544_0185_101254D6E0CCE960"/>
the Ducheſs, he thruſt daggers into the hearts of both of them. His firſt care, after this deed, was to ſecure all the property of the deceaſed, and then to conceal their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. He carried the murdered gentleman a conſiderable way to a ſtream of water, which he knew to be of a great depth; but as this fatigued him very much, and the fear of being diſcovered filled him with anxiety, he threw the body of the Ducheſs into a neighbouring ſhaft, which he thought deep enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal his villainy from all the world. He then haſtened to his companions, to whom he gave an account of this tranſaction; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the ſame time alarmed leſt the hand of Juſtice ſhould be raiſed againſt them by the friends of theſe victims, and that they ſhould be ſurpriſed in their retreat, he warned them of this, and adviſing them to retire for a few days, aſſiſted himſelf in carrying ſuch of them as were wounded over the frontiers. Thence it came, that the huntſmen and peaſants, who ſearched the wood the next day, found no traces of the robbers.</p>

               <p>THE wounded Marquis, not meeting with a ſurgeon in the next town, and perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his debility increaſe, diſpatched the Nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry from thence, with all the jewels which he had with him, beſides a large ſum of money, to the Counteſs von M—, with whom he flattered himſelf the Dutcheſs was then ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived in ſafety, and whom he wiſhed, in caſe of his death, to ſecure from all danger of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture want; and as her name was Emily, from thence aroſe the miſtake of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs, already known to my readers, in ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this depoſit was a preſent to her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. He ſet out again directly, and took the road to a little Saxon town, where, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the account of his hoſt, he would find a ſkilful ſurgeon: but too much enfeebled by the loſs of blood, he died after the firſt dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of his wounds. He had previouſly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the remainder of his money amongſt his ſervants, and adviſed them to withdraw immediately after his death, that they might
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:038544_0187_101254DCF0252A30"/>
elude the ſearch of the Duke's emiſſaries, and thus eſcape his vengeance. To one of them he confided a ring of great value, and a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Counteſs von M—, in which he informed her of his approaching fate, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured her to be a mother to his Emily, and earneſtly deſired, that in her preſent circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances ſhe might not be informed of his death.</p>
               <p>This treacherous ſervant reſolved to make his advantage of this truſt; and firſt deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the letter, he went to Leipſic in order to ſell the ring, and then intended to return to his native country. As he was going through one of the ſtreets of this town, he was met by companions of the Duke's houſe governor, who knowing him directly for an Italian, ſoon made an acquaintance with him, and heard, over a glaſs of wine, the whole hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his unfortunate maſter; and that the young Dutcheſs, for he could not gueſs to the contrary, was with the Counteſs von M—, and there expected the arrival of the Marquis.</p>
               <p>Rejoiced at this diſcovery, they carried the traitor directly to the bed of their ſick chief, who was ſo enfeebled by the unuſual fatigue, of their haraſſing journey, that he had been confined to it for many days. His illneſs had
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:038544_0188_101254DE8F45AB00"/>
rather been a check to their enquiries after the fugitives, and he already feared to have loſt all traces of them, when he was unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly delighted by this account. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed the betrayer a thouſand fequins, if he would, by craft, get the Dutcheſs into their hand; and he immediately undertook this, and the plan of carrying her off was projected the ſame night.</p>
               <p>As the houſe-governor had no expectation of being able to travel at preſent, and wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to loſe any time in the execution of this ſcheme, he confided the proſecution of it to one of his comrades, who was once Captain to the conſtable of Mantua, and who knew very well how to conduct an enterprize of this kind. He had three companions with him, whoſe courage he had already proved on ſimilar occaſions, but who all, like himſelf were unacquainted with the perſon of the young Dutcheſs. The houſe-governor promiſed to follow them as ſoon as he was well enough; and if he ſhould not overtake them on the road, he ordered them to carry their priſoner to the Convent della Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione, to the Abbeſs of which he gave them a letter. He alſo gave them letters to the Duke, and furniſhed them with money in abundance for their journey. One of them went for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, in order to beſpeak <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

He provided them with both men's and woman's clothes for her; and charged them to dreſs her as a man till they got into Italy. From the firſt ſtage, where the betrayer was to receive his reward if they accompliſhed their project, he engaged to come back to Leipſic with the horſes, and acquaint the houſe-governor with their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.</p>
               <p>They ſat out on the third day, and arrived in the evening of the fifth, juſt at twilight, at a little diſtance from the Counteſs von M—'s caſtle. According to their pre-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed plan, the traitor was to go thither, and to ſay in ſecret to the Dutcheſs, that the Marquis, who was much better, had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched him to warn her of the Counteſs, as he had certain proof that ſhe was in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding with the emiſſaries of her father, and would ſhortly deliver her to them. That he therefore conjured her to follow his meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:038544_0190_101254E46FB99720"/>
privately to the carriage, in which he was waiting not far off, to receive her with open arms. In this trap they all hoped the inexperienced Dutcheſs would be caught, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this faithleſs ſervant was confided in by the Marquis; and, on account of his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the German language, had been ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry valuable to them.</p>
               <p>He ſtole down the caſtle avenue with this view, as Emily was walking there bewail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her Wolfgang. The ſhade of the trees, and the pale illuſive light of the moon, led him into the error of ſuppoſing her to be the young Dutcheſs; and he returned to his comrades to give them an account of this fortunate incident. Quite delighted at this information, they went ſoftly down the walk, and ſeized Emily juſt as ſhe was ſeating herſelf upon a bank of turf. That the error reſpecting her was not immediately detected, aroſe from the circumſtance which I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready mentioned, of none of theſe men, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting her own treacherous ſervant, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Dutcheſs; and he had now remained with the carriage in order to be ready in his office, as coachman, to ſet off the moment that they had ſecured her.</p>
               <p>As they undreſſed Emily in the wood; this traitor firſt perceived his miſtake, and was
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:038544_0191_101254E6100C46C0"/>
more than once half inclined to diſcover it to his comrades; but as he conſidered that he ſhould thereby loſe his promiſed recompence, he reſolved to keep his own ſecret. Be the unkown who ſhe will, he thought, ſhe will at laſt be known; and whatever ſhe may have endured, will probably be made ample amends for it. He let them go on therefore, and when they were happily arrived at the deſtined ſtage, with ſome trepidation he aſked for his reward; and when he had obtained this, he promiſed indeed to carry the account of their proceedings to the houſe-governor; but inſtead of doing it, he left the horſes to run in the next wood, and went directly to Tyrol, on his way to his native town.</p>
               <p>His departure made it impoſſible for Emily and her conductors to come to any explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as none of them underſtood a word of German, and ſhe as little of Italian. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this centainly doubtful circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, it never came into the mind of the otherwiſe ſenſible Captain, that there was any miſtake in this affair; for he was firmly convinced that the Dutcheſs was only acting a part, becauſe ſhe ſaw herſelf amongſt ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, whom ſhe thought ſhe could miſlead by affecting a total ignorance of her native lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. Emily's eyes, her hair, her whole countenance, her ſize, anſwered ſo exactly to
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:038544_0192_101254E88ADB24F0"/>
the deſcription of the fugitive, which he had often ſtudied with great attention, that to queſtion this being her, ſeemed almoſt impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; and if he ever had any doubts of it, they were all at an end when he ſaw a dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond croſs upon her neck, exactly correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponding to that deſcribed as worn by the Dutcheſs, and which Emily had taken from amongſt the jewels ſent by the Marquis, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving to wear it as an everlaſting remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of him. The impenetrable diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his priſoner, therefore, added much to her offence in the eyes of her conductor, and he often, for hours together, endeavoured in vain to impreſs her with this idea.</p>
               <p>The joy of the old Duke was very great when he heard from the Captain of his daughter's being found, and placed in the convent. In the violence of his anger, on her firſt going off, he had threatened to murder her with his own hand if he ever ſaw her again; but time, and the long-felt abſence of this only and beloved child had moderated this terrible reſolution; and he was even con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering whether he ſhould not forgive her, when a meſſenger arrived from the convent with an account of her being dangerouſly ill, and not likely to recover. This intelligence, and her diſconſolate mother's mournful ſhriek, made him tremble, and he directly
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:038544_0193_101254EA28A00E10"/>
reſolved that they ſhould ſet out together to viſit their ſick child, and if their forgiveneſs could ſave her, to grant it without reſerve.</p>
               <p>Juſt after the Nuns had informed the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſs of Emily's death, the Duke and Dutcheſs arrived at the convent, languiſhing to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace their daughter. The Abbeſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived her exalted gueſts with a ſorrowful countenance, and announced to them the fatal news of her deceaſe. The Duke, ſtruck to the heart, remained ſilent for ſome time; at laſt he cried out, "It is hard, very hard, to have loſt my only child ſo long, and now to find her dead!" He tottered to a chair, and, without farther complaint, ſat quite abſorbed in his deep feelings. The old Dutcheſs, weeping and lamenting bitterly, haſtened to the cell to viſit the death-bed of her daughter. "If I can no more," ſhe cried, "preſs my living child to my breaſt, nothing ſhall hinder me from kiſſing her corpſe, and dying with her!" She threw herſelf down by Emily, and kiſſed her pale face; but ſtarted back, as ſhe, with a deep ſigh, raiſed herſelf up and ſtared at the unknown Dutcheſs. To deſcribe the ſenſations of the latter is not poſſible. For one moment, her joy at finding her child, whom ſhe believed dead, ſtill liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, was inexpreſſible; but terror and aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment inſtantly ſupplanted her joy, as ſhe
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:038544_0194_101254EE4A615170"/>
perceived that inſtead of being her, this was a perſon whom ſhe had never ſeen, before. The Nuns ſtood by in amazement, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther party at all knew how to account for this extraordinary circumſtance.</p>
               <p>Emily ſunk back upon her bed directly; ſhe felt herſelf better, but extremely weak. Her death-like ſleep had been the criſis of her fever, and the awakening her would have been very dangerous, if ſhe had not fallen into it again immediately. She was faſt aſleep before the Dutcheſs got breath to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of thoſe about her the particulars of her being brought thither; on hearing which, ſhe was convinced that the conductors of Emily were either deceived themſelves on this occaſion, or had deceived them for the ſake of the reward that they had offered for this ſervice.</p>
               <p>As Emily was the only perſon from whom the Dutcheſs could hope for an explanation of this myſtery, ſhe recommended her ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly to the care of the Nuns, and returned to the Duke to acquaint him with the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take ſhe had diſcovered. Without a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's delay he ſent off a meſſenger to the Captain who had left Emily at the convent, to deſire that he would come to him, and in the meantime he continued there to await
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:038544_0195_101254F0B7FA1FB8"/>
her recovery. He heard from the Nuns that the ſtranger ſpoke only German; but as he was maſter of that language, this was of no conſequence to him, and he was very impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient to ſee her. On the fourth day from her beginning to amend, ſhe found herſelf much better, and was able to converſe; and, as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſtrict rules of the place, no man, the phyſician and confeſſor excepted, was permitted to viſit the cells of the Nuns, ſhe was brought into an outward room, where the Duke was expecting her.</p>
               <p>Emily wept for joy at being once more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed in her mother tongue, which had a happier effect on her than all the medicines ſhe had taken. She anſwered all the Duke's enquiries; and it was with grief he found, that ſhe could not give him any account of his daughter.</p>
               <p>Theſe unhappy parents experienced ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſimilar diſappointment on the arrival of the Captain, who heard of this miſtake with aſtoniſhment. He owned that he had at firſt almoſt doubted himſelf whether this could be the Dutcheſs, but was confirmed in her being ſo, on ſeeing the brilliant croſs upon her breaſt, which exactly anſwered the deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> was ſaid to wear. Her refuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſpeak Italian he therefore conſidered
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:038544_0196_101254F255328768"/>
as mere diſſimulation, and had purpoſely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed it from her father, left it ſhould ſtill more inflame his anger againſt her.</p>
               <p>The croſs was now produced, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately recognized by the Duke and Dutcheſs as belonging to their daughter, and they preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Emily to tell them where, and from whom ſhe had obtained it.</p>
               <p>The innocent Emily related every thing that ſhe really knew, and much more that ſhe believed ſhe knew. She aſſured the Duke that ſhe had received this croſs, together with many other jewels, and a large ſum of money from her lover, who was called the Marquis Lanego. He had been, ſhe ſaid, ſome time about in their country, as a mouſe-trap and hatchel dealer, and had collected a great deal of the treaſure which lay concealed in the Fichtelberg. That on the day in which they had firſt become acquainted, he was mortally wounded in her preſence by two men in maſks, and, as ſhe ſuppoſed, killed upon the ſpot; but that ſhe heard of him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards with a carriage, horſes, and ſervants, travelling to a neighbouring town, from whence he had ſent her the money and jewels as a token of remembrance, and that he had died at another town upon the frontiers of Saxony.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="198" facs="unknown:038544_0197_101254F3FB66D150"/>At firſt the Duke conſidered this account as the delirium of her fever; but as ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly repeated the ſame ſtory, he knew not at laſt what to think or believe. The maſter of the horſe, who ran away with his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, was named Lanego: he could only there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuppoſe that this, in his eſtimation, great villain, had ſhamefully forſaken her, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipated her fortune with another woman. If this was the caſe, then his child, he reflected, might now be languiſhing in the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme miſery; and wretched at this idea, he thought directly of going into Germany to ſeek for her, but previouſly he deſired once more to talk with Emily, and begged her to relate the whole ſtory circumſtantially. She accordingly did ſo; and as ſhe now found that the Duke was in ſearch of his daughter, whom the Marquis had carried off, it came at once into her mind whether the lady they had drawn out of the ſhaft might not be this daughter.</p>
               <p>The Duke, on farther enquiry, was by degrees nearly convinced that this murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed lady was his child; but, in order to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain greater certainty on this point, he reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to go into Germany immediately. He concealed from the poor mother the new fears that he entertained, and flattered her
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:038544_0198_101254F8680A36B0"/>
with hopes of conducting his beloved daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter again to her arms. With this proſpect the Dutcheſs ſuffered him to go quietly, and on the third day he ſet out with the Captain and Emily. The joy of the latter was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out bounds, when ſhe heard that ſhe was to return to her native country, and ſee her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Counteſs again. This joy made her very talkative, and with the <hi>naivete</hi> of her manner ſhe often charmed the Duke from his reveries, and almoſt annihilated every ſuſpicion which he had ſecretly indulged againſt her. He began to believe her account to be literally true, and that ſhe, as well as his own daughter, had been innocently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the arts of the Marquis. She won the heart of the Duke ſo much during their long journey, that he often ſwore in ſecret, if he found his own child dead, and Emily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally faultleſs, that ſhe ſhould ſupply her place to him, and ſhould be his heireſs.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XIX.</head>
               <p>AFTER a journey of four weeks, the travellers arrived at the Counteſs von M—'s eſtate. Emily's heart overflowed with joy, as ſhe diſcovered from a diſtance the turrets of the caſtle, and the little white cottage in the wood. Her unaffected expreſſions of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light drew tears from the Duke, and ſhe confirmed her intereſt in his heart as ſhe ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly wiped away thoſe tears; and repeated<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſured him, that ſhe would do every thing in her power to comfort him, if he did not find his child again.</p>
               <p>As they drove into the court yard of the caſtle, and the ſervants diſcovered Emily, every one of them broke out into a loud cry of joy, and ran into the houſe, which ſoon reſounded with the united ſhout of "Emily is here again! Emily is here again!" The Counteſs von M—flew impetuouſly to the window, and fell back in a ſwoon as ſhe ſaw her child, whom ſhe believed to be dead.
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:038544_0200_101254FC79BC2AA8"/>
Emily hurried up ſtairs, and found her in this ſituation; but her tears and her kiſſes ſoon revived the fainting Counteſs; but ſhe could not ſpeak—ſhe could only feel, and locked her child in her arms.</p>
               <p>The old Duke ſtood there ſpeechleſs, and beheld this meeting with tears in his eyes. He was fully ſenſible of the delight it muſt be to embrace a child again under theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, from the eagerneſs with which he longed for it himſelf.</p>
               <p>When Emily was able to ſpeak, ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired after her foſter-mother, and wiſhed to ſhare her joy with her. On this the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal heart of the Counteſs was no more maſter of itſelf; ſhe knew that Emily muſt take the old woman for her mother, and ſhe was envious of another's bearing away this tender appellation from her.—"Your old foſter-mother," ſaid the Counteſs, "has died during your abſence; but Heaven has preſerved your true mother in me. You are my child, and all the world ſhall know that you are ſo, and honour you as ſuch."</p>
               <p>The ſurpriſe of all the domeſtics preſent was very great; but the Counteſs continued her diſcourſe, and preſented Emily to them all, as her child, and as her heireſs. She ſaw,
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:038544_0201_101254FEEEC9C0B0"/>
ſhe thought only of her; and was too much taken up for ſome time to notice the Duke, who had no inclination to interrupt ſuch a ſcene. After ſhe became a little more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed ſhe perceived him, and Emily preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to her, her deliverer, her father.</p>
               <p>"I am happy," ſaid the Duke, almoſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, "to have reſtored a loſt child to your arms; but I am very ſelfiſh, for I aſk of you a like return. It were cruel now to check your enjoyment; but when you can turn your attention to me, pity an afflicted father, who has ſought a loſt child for a full year, and who hopes to learn tidings of her from you. Is my daughter really dead? Was ſhe the ſtranger to whom you generouſly gave a decent grave? Yet I do not wiſh to hear it to day; In the uncertainty of my fate, I will ſatisfy myſelf with partaking your joy, and hoping that the ſame may yet be mine. But if my daughter really lives, then no longer delay the bleſſed moment when I ſhall preſs her again to my childleſs boſom." After a pauſe, the Duke added, "I know, I feel that it is in contradiction to my requeſt; but I can no longer ſubdue the emotions of my heart, which impetuouſly demands intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of its darling."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="203" facs="unknown:038544_0202_1012550287C96880"/>The Counteſs, who was but juſt relieved from a ſimilar ſituation, was deeply affected by the Duke's diſtreſs, and found, with real ſorrow, from his anſwers to her enquiries, that ſhe was under the cruel neceſſity of rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing him of all hope. "Unfortunate old man," ſhe ſaid, "your daughter is too ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dead! It is but too true that I fulfilled the laſt mournful duty to her, and that ſhe lies buried in the vault of my chapel."</p>
               <p>The Duke gnaſhed his teeth, and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured ſome unintelligible words. "Oh, Madam!" he cried out at laſt, "the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereſt torments are nothing to what I feel. To be childleſs in my old age, and not to have the ſatisfaction of retaliating on the author of my miſeries, what he has ſo cruelly inflicted on me, my poor wife, and our only child, is too much. Mother or a child, pity me! If he is yet alive, and you know it, and conceal him from me, then may the curſe fall on you, which my bleeding heart now teems with againſt him, but which my tongue has not power to utter!"</p>

                  <p>"Your affliction is juſt, but the revenge you ſeek, if it were poſſible, would not ſoften it. The Marquis is dead; he was, as well as your daughter, murdered by a deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate banditti. He had, no doubt, injured
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:038544_0203_10125504F4AC96B0"/>
you, but he was faultleſs towards her. To the laſt hour of his life he loved her with the utmoſt tenderneſs, and never would have ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated himſelf from her, but with the hope of its being for her ſecurity, and that it would be but for a ſhort time."</p>

And probably—Oh not probably, too certainly, he murdered my child, in order the more eaſily to betray your's. Oh Madam! if you, on whom he would have drawn a like misfortune, can yet excuſe him, then—then I have nothing more to ſay with you! then—farewell!

will relate the whole ſtory of this misfortune to you faithfully, as it may prove a conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to you to be ſet right in this error, which I was once in myſelf, and to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that the Marquis is innocent of the death of your daughter, that he loved her to his laſt moment, and never even ſaw my child."</p>

               </sp>
               <p>The Counteſs related to the old Duke the hiſtory of the unfortunate lovers, as I have already related it to my readers. She had heard it from the Baroneſs von Z—, who had viſited her, in the expectation of find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them under her protection. Inſtead of which ſhe only heard the melancholy cataſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trophe, as ſhe did not doubt it would prove to be, of their fate; and the coffin of the murdered lady being opened to aſcertain this, ſhe immediately knew her to be the young Dutcheſs. As it appeared from the Baroneſs, that Emily and Lanego were the names of theſe lovers, the Counteſs was ſatisfied that the caſket ſent by the Notary was deſtined for the deceaſed, not for her daughter; and that the wounded Marquis who had ſent it, was not, as ſhe had ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:038544_0205_1012550A02E6A530"/>
the Savoyard who had been lately in that neighbourhood. There ſtill remained a myſteriouſneſs in this affair, which the Counteſs and Baroneſs could not ſolve; but in forming their conjecture on it, they were induced to believe, that it muſt have been the emiſſaries of the irritated Duke who were the murderers of theſe untimely victims, and they often execrated this unnatural revenge. But in another week this riddle was quite unfolded.</p>
               <p>The wounded banditti put themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the care of the ſame ſurgeon who had dreſſed the wounds of the deceaſed Marquis; and being ſuſpected by him, they were, on his advice, arreſted by the officers of juſtice, and they immediately confeſſed their guilt. Soon afterwards, the renowned Jacob was alſo taken as he was attempting to fly, and committed to priſon. He was ſubject to the Counteſs, and conſequently was brought before her juſticiary, who, as was the cuſtom with thoſe who would not voluntarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs their crimes, put him to the rack, and ſoon extorted his confeſſion. He not only acknowledged his recent murders, but alſo that he had deceived his neighbour, who had related it again to the Baron von Tiefenthal and the Counteſs von M—, with a fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous account of the means by which he had
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:038544_0206_1012550C744CF250"/>
acquired his fortune; and that theſe, truſting to his word, had taken a poor Savoyard for a Marquis, and that he had, for his own ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, murdered the innocent creature.</p>
               <p>This confeſſion enabled the Counteſs to prove clearly to the Duke the innocence of the Marquis, and the miſtake of Emily; and this operated ſo powerfully on him, that his ardent deſire of revenge was extinguiſhed, and ſucceeded by a deep ſorrow. The idea of the perſecuted lovers flying from one place to another, and being compaſſionated by ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, who had endeavoured to protect them from his anger, affected him very ſenſibly. He wept bitterly; and though the tears flowed principally for his daughter, they fell alſo for the Marquis, whom he would now willingly have accepted for his ſon-in-law. He begged pardon of the Counteſs for his injurious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions towards her, and thanked her ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely for the interment of his child. "To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow," he ſaid," I will viſit her ſad re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, and mourn over her coffin, which I will take with me; and if my old wife aſks me whether I do not bring back her daughter, I will give it to her. That moment will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be her laſt! but of what uſe are child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs parents in the world? They are like an arid tree, which if it is not thrown into the fire, only ſtands mouldering to decay."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="208" facs="unknown:038544_0207_1012550EEB462BB8"/>The Counteſs endeavoured in vain to ſooth the old Duke; but the ſoothings of Emily, who was already dear to him, and who became ſtill dearer, on being quite clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from his ſuſpicions, were of much more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. "Be you," he cried out, tranſported, as ſhe fell weeping upon his neck, "be you my ſecond Emily. Fate has not brought you to my arms in vain. I feel that only your ſociety can conſole me."</p>
               <p>The Duke indeed ſpoke truly; for though he wept frequently, he always became calm when Emily wiped away his tears, and call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him father. As the Counteſs was very eager to learn how her daughter came into Italy, and met with him, he gave her the hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of her adventure, and ſhe then regretted that ſhe had never made ſuch enquiries after her, as might have led to the diſcovery of this circumſtance. But as ſhe was in her own mind fully convinced that ſhe alſo was mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, nothing elſe had in her deſpair occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to her, but to beg of the Juſticiary to uſe every poſſible means of making the banditti own where they had concealed the body, that ſhe might at leaſt have the ſatisfaction of giving it honourable burial. But all the efforts of the Juſticiary to this effect were of courſe of no avail; and the Counteſs was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:038544_0208_10125510891758C8"/>
her wiſhed-for conſolation, of viſiting the grave of her child.</p>
               <p>In recounting over this ſeries of events, it did not eſcape the recollection of the Counteſs, that ſhe was accountable to the Duke for the money and jewels which ſhe had received from the Marquis, as being the property of his daughter. "That I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge myſelf your debtor," ſhe ſaid, "and fully intend to repay what fell thus acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally into my hands, will ſufficiently appear, from a letter which I wrote to you a month ago, mentioning this buſineſs, and the unhappy fate of the Dutcheſs. At that time, as I ſuppoſed, my child was dead, and every thing on earth was become indifferent to me, I offered to repay the value of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſit immediately, by the ſale of my eſtate; but now that I have her again, I wiſh to leave her my eſtate, and hope, from your generoſity, to obtain time to reſtore, by pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent management, what ſaved me from ruin."</p>
               <p>The Duke aſſured the Counteſs, that he never ſhould deſire, nor accept of any reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and as the Counteſs refuſed this, he turned to Emily, and conjured her to grant this firſt requeſt of her new father. Unable
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:038544_0209_101255134019AE38"/>
to withſtand his earneſt entreaties, ſhe grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully accepted his munificent preſent, and put an end to this generous contention.</p>

               <p>ALL the inhabitants of the caſtle now ſhared a general joy, excepting the old Duke; for the loſs of his child was too re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and too deeply felt, for him to take a part in it. As they were about to ſit down to ſupper, the Counteſs aſked Emily, if ſhe thought no more of her Wolfgang. "It is not handſome," ſhe ſaid, "thus ſoon to have forgotten ſo tender a lover."</p>
               <p>Emily's cheeks were ſuffuſed with a deep bluſh at this queſtion. "Forgotten!" ſhe anſwered; "I ſhall never forget him! He was very dear to me before, and his death and his innocence make his memory yet dearer to me. I ſhould forget all my paſt misfortunes, if he was but ſtill alive!"</p>

               <p>At this moment Wolfgang came into the room, ſimply, but very genteely dreſſed. He had heard long before of Emily's arrival, and
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:038544_0211_101255194B8D88E8"/>
hurried to ſee her as ſhe came up ſtairs, and thus thought himſelf prepared for this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view; but all his reſolution vaniſhed as he approached to kiſs her hand, and congratulate her on her happy return. He trembled, he looked earneſtly at Emily; tears of joy ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into his eyes, and he could only ſigh.</p>
               <p>Emily was in a ſimilar, or even more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed ſituation. This unexpected meeting with a man whom ſhe loved, and lamented as dead, was almoſt too much for her. She in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntarily gave him one hand, and catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his with the other, ſunk ſobbing into his arms.</p>
               <p>The Counteſs witneſſed this mutual over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow of tenderneſs with much emotion. "Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor Tartini," ſhe ſaid to Wolfgang, "you are right; the bond of pure love is eternal!"— "Yes indeed, eternal!" he cried out, quite tranſported.—"Eternal! eternal!" ſtammer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Emily after him.—As ſhe recovered a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle from her aſtoniſhment, ſhe began to aſk how it was poſſible that he yet lived; that he who was ſo dreadfully wounded, now ſtood before her quite well?</p>
               <p>As the like queſtion will no doubt be aſked by my readers, I will relate his hiſtory in the
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:038544_0212_1012551BB98BD3A8"/>
moſt conciſe manner poſſible, to them and the enquiring Emily at the ſame time.</p>
               <p>Wolfgang had indeed received two ſtabs with a dagger from the wicked Jacob; but one of them had only bent a rib, and the other, from his giving a ſudden turn, had on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cut the fleſh without injuring any vital part; but overcome by pain and terror, he fell apparently lifeleſs to the ground, Jacob, in general unerring in his blow, believing him dead, eſcaped with his colleague; and Emily went to fetch the old woman.</p>
               <p>Wolfgang revived ſhortly after, and his imagination picturing to him theſe murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, as in league with the ſorcerers, he exert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all his ſtrength, and fled. Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he endeavoured to tie up his wounds, they bled very much, and at the end of the wood he ſunk down quite exhauſted. There he was found by a ſhepherd, who took him to his cottage, and tended him carefully. As perſons of this deſcription have commonly ſome practical knowledge in phyſic, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the juice of certain herbs to his wounds, and nature operating yet more powerfully than the medicine, in four weeks he was able to leave his ſtraw bed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="214" facs="unknown:038544_0213_1012551E2FBC4E70"/>About this time his benefactor, who lived in a ſolitary place, heard from a huntſman who paſſed by his flock, the hiſtory of the banditti, with all the particulars before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated. The circumſtance of this diſcovery be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made, by means of ſome wounded men belonging to this troop, excited ſuſpicions in the mind of the ſhepherd. Perhaps, he thought, my gueſt is one of theſe wretches; and the certainty of his being an Italian con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming this conjecture, in order to purify himſelf from all imputation of guilt for hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing harboured him, he left the flock to his ſon's care, and went to the Juſticiary of the Counteſs, to whom he revealed what he ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected. He, very naturally from this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, immediately arreſted Wolfgang, and threw him into priſon.</p>
               <p>His examination, by leading to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of who he was, entirely exculpated him from theſe ſuſpicions, and gave the Counteſs the ſatisfaction of finding that her Savoyard yet lived. He was directly releaſed from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement, and as his wounds had grown worſe in priſon, ſhe took him into her houſe to be taken care of till he was perfectly reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. She was, by Jacob's confeſſion, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized of her error of his being a rich Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis, and having the knowledge of concealed treaſures; but as her heart was peculiarly
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:038544_0214_10125520A5707900"/>
open to compaſſion by the loſs of her child, and as he had ſuffered ſo much from her miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take about him; and had become dear to her daughter, inclination, as well as juſtice, led her to pay him this attention.</p>
               <p>The Counteſs often viſited Wolfgang dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this time; and beſides her diſcovering ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good qualities in him, he gained on her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections by the cordial ſhare he took in her affliction for the loſt Emily, whom he lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſo much unfeigned tenderneſs, that ſhe wept in return with him, and was often obliged, in the midſt of her own ſorrow, to give him conſolation.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as Wolfgang's health was re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, the Counteſs gave him the appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her Secretary, clothed him properly, and let him eat at her table. He felt theſe beneficences deeply, ſtudied with great dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and was not aſhamed at the age he then was, to learn to write, in order to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come worthy of the title which his benefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs had at firſt beſtowed upon him ſo unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly. His continued application, his ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere gratitude, and his unceaſing regret for Emily, ſo won the heart of the Counteſs, that ſhe ſoon loved him as her ſon. It was in ſhort with her as with the old Duke, that ſhe felt a chaſm in her heart, and wiſhed to fill it
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:038544_0215_1012552318D5B638"/>
up; thus ſhe hoped that Wolfgang would leſſen, if not ſupply, the loſs of Emily to her, when Emily herſelf appeared.</p>
               <p>I will not be prolix on the concluſion to which my hiſtory now tends, as I hope my readers gueſs it already.</p>
               <p>At the end of three months, Wolfgang and Emily were, with the conſent of the noble mother, man and wife. If any of my readers wonder that a lady of rank could ſo readily marry her only child to a poor young Savoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard peaſant, I muſt courteouſly entreat them to remember, that ſhe was an illegitimate child, and having no pedigree of high decent, could never expect that a LEGITIMATE NO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BLE would marry her.</p>
               <p>The old Duke, who became daily more at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached to theſe young people, was preſent at their nuptials. His firſt intention had been, to leave the caſtle immediately after the full conviction of his misfortune, with the body of his dead child; but before he could ſet out, he received advice by a courier of the death of his wife, who was unable to ſupport the certain loſs of her daughter, which ſhe had learned from the Counteſs's letter, ſoon after his departure. He now therefore ſtood more in need of conſolation, and was eaſily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:038544_0216_10125524B2F29A40"/>
on to ſtay and receive it from Emily, who made it her ſtudy to ſoften his affliction.</p>
               <p>By the advice of the Duke, the Counteſs von M— ſoon ſold her eſtate, and went with him and her children into Italy. He there endowed our young Savoyard with conſiderable poſſeſſions, and by his influence got him raiſed to nobility; and the family of Wolfgang ſtill flouriſhes there in great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence and reſpectability.</p>
               <p>The Duke married the Counteſs von M—, and lived with her and his adopted children, during the remainder of his life, in perfect happineſs.</p>
