            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE following Diſcourſes are a <hi>hurried</hi> At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to ſave a ſinking Land. The Author was on a long Journey, when he received the Confirmation of the melancholy News from the <hi>Ohio;</hi> and he had but two Days to prepare for the Pulpit, after his Return. And as it was judged proper by many immediately to publiſh the Sermons, he had no Time to reviſe and tranſcribe them for the Preſs: For the Country now being in a very uncertain and fluctuating State, a Diſcourſe adapted to its preſent Situation, may be improper a few Monthſs, or even a few Weeks hence. To ſpend Time about Embelliſhment, at ſuch a Juncture, would be egregious Trifling.</p>
            <p>The Account of the Drought, I know to be true; and Thouſands will be ſenſible that it is not aggravated. The Account of the fatal Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at the <hi>Ohio,</hi> is founded upon the beſt Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligences I could get; and if there be a few cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantial Miſtakes, the Subſtance is undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly true.</p>
            <p>As many of our Countrymen are ſtupidly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſenſible of their Danger, and cannot exert them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:007644_0003_102D983C0961C778"/>for their own Defence, 'til they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmed; and as but few ſeem diſpoſed to view the preſent Poſture of Affairs in a <hi>religious</hi> Light; the Author had impatiently looked for ſomething of this Kind from ſome more maſterly and leiſurely Hand. But being diſappointed, and ſurrounded with Importunities from various Quarters, he thought himſelf obliged to undertake it, tho' under peculiar Diſadvantages.</p>
            <p>If it may but contribute to the Safety of his Country, and to the Reformation of his Fellow-Subjects, his End in this Attempt, as well as his Deſires and Prayers, will be anſwered.</p>

               <p>P. S. Feb. 14, 1756. <hi>The following Diſcourſes were ſent to the Preſs a few Days after the News of the Defeat at Monongahala. But the Preſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neceſſarily employed about other Things, and other unforeſeen Obſtructions happening in the Printers Way, the Publication was unavoidably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed. But it is hoped, it is not now impertinent nor unſeaſonable; as no very conſiderable Alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on has happened in our public Affairs, except the Victory obtained by the brave Sir <hi>William Johnſon,</hi> at <hi>Lake-George;</hi> which was a great Encouragement to us, tho' not a deciſive Stroke.</hi>

Can two walk together, except they be agreed? Will a Lion roar in the Foreſt, when he hath no Prey? Will a young Lion cry out of his Den, if he have taken nothing? Can a Bird fall in a Snare upon the Earth, where no Gin is for him? Shall one take up a Snare from the Earth, and have taken nothing at all? Shall a Trumpet be blown in the City, and the People not be afraid? Shall there be Evil in a City, and the Lord hath not done it?</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>IF my late Journey deprived me of Leiſure to make proper Preparations for your Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment To-day; I muſt own, it has helped me not a little, in furniſhing me with Materials adapted to this melancholy Seaſon. I have ſeen the Staff of
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:007644_0005_102D9841322BA890"/>Life juſt broken in moſt Places; in a Tour of about an hundred Miles
<note n="*" place="bottom">Thro' the Counties of <hi>Hanover, Goochland, Albemarle, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> The Fields which were wont to look green and flouriſhing with our Staple Commodity
<note n="†" place="bottom">Tobacco.</note>, on which our Trade ſo entirely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends, I have ſeen prepared with Labour and Pain, but unplanted, or the Plants parched and fading, I have ſeen the Fields, that in former Seaſons pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed abundant Support for Man and Beaſt, and were rich in ſtately, blooming Corn, now withering, and hardly promiſing a few ſapleſs Leaves for our Cattle, and a few huſky Ears for ourſelves. I have ſeen the Planter, that was once ſurrounded with Affluence, pointing to his empty withering Fields, and ready to ſmite upon his Breaſt, and ſay, "Alaſs! what ſhall I do for Corn to ſupport my Family next Year? I would juſt now ſell ſome of my Slaves, or any Thing in my Poſſeſſion, and that at an Under-Rate, to purchaſe a ſure Supply, if I knew where to get it." This Scarcity is the more threatning, as <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> the Granary of <hi>America,</hi> has alſo ſuffered ſeverely by the Drought. And as the numerous <hi>Britiſh</hi> Iſlands in the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> depend upon that Province for a Supply of Wheat, and upon us for Corn; they will alſo have a deep Share with the Colonies on the Continent in the Effects of this unfruitful Seaſon. Indeed there are but few Parts of his Majeſty's Dominions, but will be ſenſibly affected by it, more or leſs. It ſeems to be a wide-extended circulating Diſtreſs; and we ſhould feel it as ſuch.</p>
               <p>There is alſo a general Complaint of the Stagna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Trade, the Scarcity of Money, the Weight
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:007644_0006_102D9842CA56DDA8"/>of the various Taxes, the high Price of Goods, and the low Price of your Staple Commodities: And ſome poor Families are already in the very Jaws of Famine, and the Children crying for Bread, and there is juſt none for them. What op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive, complicated Calamities are theſe? Your own Circumſtances will teach you Sympathy in this Caſe; or if any of you are ſo happy as to be free from ſome of them, you have your Share in others of them; and this muſt affect you with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern for yourſelves, and Compaſſion for others, on whom the whole Burden may fall with greater Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion.</p>
               <p>Were theſe Calamities <hi>ſingle</hi> and <hi>alone,</hi> we could not but feel and lament each of them. But when they are <hi>complicated</hi> and united, they are heavy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed; and this is the melancholy Caſe of moſt Parts of this Colony.—But Oh <hi>VIRGINIA!</hi> Oh my Country! even this Complication of Afflictions is not all thy Burden. Beſides all this, we <q>hear the Sound of the Trumpet, and ſee Garments rolled in Blood.</q> We have received the melancholy Confirmation of the News we were ſo unwilling to believe, concerning the Fate of a great Part of our Army. Our brave General is no more; near fifty of our beſt Officers, and near ſix hundred of our Men, are killed or wounded; an Army of one thouſand three hundred Men routed; and all this, (Oh indignant Mortification!) all this by four or five hundred undiſciplined, cowardly, inſidious Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages. Who can ſo much as in Thought, take a Survey of the bloody Field, without all the tender and mournful Paſſions working within him? <q>How
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:007644_0007_102D722A2ABE5E18"/>are the mighty fallen, and the Weapons of War periſhed! Ye Banks of <hi>Monongahala,</hi> upon you let there be no Dew, neither let there be Rain upon you, nor Fields of Offerings: For there the the Shield of the Mighty is vilely caſt away
<note n="*" place="bottom">2 <hi>Sam.</hi> i. 21, 27.</note>.</q> See there the mighty Dead rolling in their own Blood! ſome of them ſcalped by mercileſs <hi>Indians,</hi> left without the Honors of Burial in a howling Wilderneſs, to be devoured by the Fowls of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and Beaſts of Prey! See the wounded writh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Pain, ſurrounded with all the Terrors of Death, and groaning out their Life, in Amazement and Conſternation; many dying of Wounds not mortal, if proper Care could have been taken of them! while the Remnant that eſcape, ſhift for themſelves, and fly in the wildeſt Horror, thro' a barren Wilderneſs, without the Supports of Life! Who can realize ſuch a Scene, without ſharing in the Sufferings of theſe unhappy Men; eſpecially if we conſider, they ſuffer for our Sake, <hi>i. e.</hi> for our own Defence; and whether we may not alſo add, they ſuffer for <hi>our Sins,</hi> we ſhall enquire preſently. To complete our Loſs, our fine Artillery, Baggage, Horſes, Wheel-Carriages, are deſtroyed, or fallen into the Hands of our Enemies, to ſtrengthen and enrich them, and to weaken and impoveriſh us, The <hi>New-England</hi> Men indeed are puſhing their Conqueſts wherever they turn, under the Smiles of Heaven, to which they look, and in which they truſt; and this we ſhould acknowledge with Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, as a ſingular Bluffing, and greatly tending to the Advantage of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Colonies in general;
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:007644_0008_102D98456DF87690"/>but in another View, methinks it makes us more ſenſible of our peculiar Misfortunes and Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this Colony; as tho' we were ſingled out to Deſtruction, and nothing could proſper in which we are concerned And perhaps the Routing of the <hi>French</hi> in their Northern Settlements may cauſe them to over-run this Colony, in Order to make Repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals, and ſet them on fighting from a ſtronger Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple than Ambition, <hi>viz.</hi> a Care to provide a Place for themſelves to go to.</p>
               <p>But even this is not all. I have the melancholy News to communicate to you, that ſundry Families in our frontier Counties have been murdered by the barbarous <hi>Indians.</hi> They were aſleep in their Beds of Reſt, without dreaming of Danger; and the firſt Thing that awakened them was the deadly Blow of the bloody Ax, or the dying Shrieks of a murdered Father, a Wife, or a Child. Some of them were carried Captive, and afterwards found in the Woods, mangled and half-rotten, with all the Marks of Barbarity and leiſurely Torture upon them; ſcalped or beheaded; <q>their Women ripp'd up, and left in a Poſture too monſtrous to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, and even their <hi>Blood drank</hi>

<pb n="10" facs="unknown:007644_0009_102D984778CB1BB8"/>over a long and tedious Tract of Rocks and Mountains, near two hundred Miles, into the more thickly inhabited Parts of the Country. There they now are, Men, Women and Children, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Covering but the inclement Sky, expoſed to the Dews of the Night, and the ſcorching Heat of the Day, without Bread, except what the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of others affords them. For they were obliged to leave their plentiful Harveſts behind them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaped; and they could carry with them but little of their Houſhold Furniture, their Stock, or any of their Poſſeſſions: They were glad they could 'get their own Lives for a Prey. As for thoſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies that live in the populous Parts of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, they are obliged to gather together into Forts, where the Women and Children continue in Crowds Night and Day; and the Men by Day venture out, tho' in conſtant Fear of their Lives, to look after their Farms, and make a little Proviſion for their subſiſtence; and as the Drought there is very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere, it muſt be a ſcanty Proviſion indeed. In theſe Forts, which are very numerous in various Parts, they now meet to worſhip God: And they dare not go up to the Sanctuary, without carrying their Arms along with them; and they are always in trembling Expectation to be ſurprized by the Enemy.</p>
               <p>Our happy Situation, about the Center of the Colony, has kept us hitherto in Peace and Safety. But it may not be always ſo with us: The Inroads of the Enemy may reach even to us. Or if we ſhould be diſturbed only by diſtant Alarms; yet theſe unhappy Creatures are proper Objects of our
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:007644_0010_102D9849F5925EE8"/>Compaſſion, and of our Interceſſion before God. They are our <hi>Brethren,</hi> Fellow-Chriſtians, and Members of the ſame <hi>Body politic</hi> with us: And it is in the Body politic, as in the <hi>natural Body;</hi> when <hi>one</hi> Member ſuffers, <hi>all</hi> the Members ſuffer with it. To all this I may add, the poor State of our Militia, which has hitherto been a mere Farce. —The Scarcity of Arms and Ammunition in the Country.—The ſtupid Careleſſneſs, or ſneaking Cowardice, of not a few of our Inhabitants,—and the Danger of Inſurrection and Maſſacre from ſome of our own gloomy Domeſtics. And theſe are very alarming Circumſtances, that may juſtly excite our Fears; though they are not deſperate; nor ſhould they cauſe us to deſpond, and give up ourſelves for loſt.</p>
               <p>I know I ſhould mingle a great deal of chearful <hi>Light</hi> with theſe gloomy <hi>Shades,</hi> to form an exact Picture of the preſent State of our Country. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all theſe Calamities, we ſtill enjoy a rich Variety of Bleſſings. Though God is riſen up to puniſh us, yet he does not puniſh us as our Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities deſerve; nor ſtrip us of every Comfort. As yet, we enjoy Food and Raiment; and the Scarcity of one Part of the Country, is rendered more tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable by the Proſpect of Plenty in other Parts, which have been refreſhed with Rain from Heaven: And even this threatning and melancholy Year, may yet compare with the moſt fruitful and happy Years of ſome populous Countries on our Globe. Our Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Forces have more than made Repriſals for our Loſs; and the Succeſs of our Fleet, under Admiral <hi>Boſcawen,</hi> has given a conſiderable Blow to the
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:007644_0011_102D98503AA03D60"/>Power of <hi>France</hi> by Sea. Our Inhabitants are nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, and ſome of them reſolute, and capable of making a good Defence; and a conſiderable Part of our Forces have ſurvived the fatal Ninth of <hi>July,</hi> in which ſo many of them were ſlaughtered. Theſe and ſundry other Things have an encouraging Appearance; and we cannot overlook them without Ingratitude, and exceſſive Deſpondence. But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding theſe favorable Circumſtances, and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſuch future Turns of Providence as may make for us, it is beyond all Doubt, this will be the <hi>moſt melancholy and calamitous Year that</hi> Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia <hi>has ever ſeen;</hi> and he is a ſtupid Creature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that can flatter himſelf with better Hopes.

               <p>The Prophet <hi>Amos</hi> was ſent to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the latter End of their Kingdom, to warn them of the ſore Judgments of Famine, War, and Captivity, which were juſt coming upon them, for their long Courſe of ſinning from Generation to Generation. It was to theſe <hi>Iſraelites</hi> that the Words of my Text were primarily directed; and they are equally ſuitable to us in our preſent Circumſtances, which are ſo like to theirs.</p>
               <p>Let us now enquire.</p>
               <p n="1">I. Who is the <hi>proper original Author</hi> or Inflictor of the Calamities under which our Country groans? Is our Country under no Influence or Power, but what is viſible? Are all our Affairs under the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of <hi>Chance</hi> or <hi>Fortune?</hi> Or is this World the <hi>abſolute, independent</hi> Kingdom of <hi>Men,</hi> without any Subordination to a ſuperior Power? Or do na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Cauſes operate, and accompliſh Events of <hi>themſelves,</hi> without any Dependence upon the great Creator? Alaſs! do we lie at the Mercy of blind Cauſes, or of the ſtrongeſt Arm, or the moſt politic Head? Are we to look no higher than the <hi>Clouds,</hi> for the Cauſe of Drought? And are we to trace the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:007644_0013_102D9853DA09F848"/>Origin of the Defeat of our Army, no farther than the Power or Stratagems of the <hi>French</hi> or <hi>Indians?</hi> If this be Caſe, what a miſerable World is this? what a State of <hi>Anarchy</hi> and <hi>Confuſion?</hi> Then we have nothing to truſt to, but the Arm of Fleſh; we are cut off from the Relief of Prayer to an all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling God; we are caſt off from the Rock of Confidence in his all-governing Providence: For why ſhould we pray to, or truſt in, one, that does not concern himſelf in our Affairs? But is this really the Caſe? Is the World left thus without a ſupreme univerſal Head? Every pious Heart muſt anſwer, "I hope not; or I am undone." And I can aſſure you, your Hope is well grounded. <q>The Lord reigneth; let the Earth be glad

Such is the Government of the univerſal Ruler, under which we live; and we ought not to make the Excellency of it an Objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt its Reality.</p>
               <p>There is not ſo much Need, I preſume, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince your <hi>Reaſon</hi> of this Truth, as to inculcate it upon you, to make your <hi>Hearts</hi> ſenſible of it. Certainly it is no <hi>Extravagance</hi> of Faith, it is no ſuperſtitious Imagination, to believe, that God ſtill rules the World he has made, and that he has not caſt it off as a diſregarded Orphan. A Man need not be an <hi>immoderate</hi> or an <hi>over-credulous</hi> Believer, to admit this. This is one of the firſt Principles of <hi>natural</hi> Religion, as well as a fundamental Doctrine

There is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy that ſubſiſts between God and <hi>Virginia,</hi> a Controverſy not about Trifles, but about the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives of his Crown, and the Rights of his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; a Controverſy <hi>which</hi> ſhall be obeyed, whether his holy and righteous Will, or the perverſe Will and wicked Luſts and Paſſions of Men; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he or his Creatures ſhould be moſt loved and regarded; whether Holineſs be the only Way to Happineſs, and whether his Son <hi>Jeſus,</hi> whom he has ſent into the World, and made known in our Country, ſhall be owned and loved as a Saviour and Lord. He inſiſts upon it, that the Concerns of Eternity are of infinitely greater Importance
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:007644_0020_102D9862B5FDF9C8"/>than thoſe of Time; but many of the Inhabitants of our Land are of another Mind: They pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue the Riches, the Honor, the Pleaſures of this World, as their great Concern, and take but very little Thought or Pains about their everlaſting State. Let God be diſobeyed, let Chriſt be neglected, let Heaven be loſt, let their Souls be damned, They care not; they <hi>will</hi> have their Pleaſures; they <hi>will</hi> drink, and game, and ſwear, and whore: they <hi>will</hi> purſue the World with Eagerneſs and Avarice. God inſiſts upon it, that if a People profeſſing his Name, would enjoy his favourable Preſence with them, they muſt abandon their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Vices, and turn to him: Our Countrymen differ from him in this; they expect the Bleſſings of his Providence, and yet go on impenitently in their Sins. He aſſures them that Sin will deſtroy them at laſt: They will not believe him, but hope for Happineſs, tho' they indulge themſelves in it. He recommends Holineſs of Heart and Life, as abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to everlaſting Happineſs; and as the moſt pleaſant and delightful Courſe: They count it a needleſs or a moping, dull, melancholy Thing, and hope to be ſaved without it. He has pronounced <hi>Jeſus</hi> the only Saviour; but they are not ſolicitous about an Intereſt in him, nor thoro'ly ſenſible of their Need of him; but flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves their own Works will go a great Way to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their Salvation. They alſo differ widely in <hi>Diſpoſition</hi> and Temper. He loves Holineſs; they loath it. He hates all Sin, in its moſt alluring Forms; they delight in it, and will indulge it. Thus it has been for a <hi>long Time:</hi> We 'have walked contrary to God.' He has waited a long Time to
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:007644_0021_102D9865254C2FF0"/>ſee if we would make up the Difference; but Men inſiſt they are right, or at beſt put him off with a Purpoſe to repent in ſome uncertain Hereafter, which he foreſees they will never arrive at, or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver improve. He would have them view the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Poſture of their Affairs in a <hi>religious</hi> Light, and humble themſelves before him: He has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioned the Drought and the Sword as his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters to preach Repentance to them; but few of them <q>repent of their Wickedneſs, ſaying, What have I done? every one turneth to his Courſe, as the Horſe ruſheth into the Battle

               <p>But <hi>why</hi> has he inflicted upon our Country ſuch <hi>Calamities?</hi> We have ſeen he is the Author of them, and that <hi>there is no Evil</hi> in our Land, but <hi>the Lord hath done it.</hi> And why hath he done it? Has he made the Heavens as Braſs over the Heads, and the Earth as Iron under the Feet, of an <hi>innocent</hi> People? Has he defeated an Army that was to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend a <hi>righteous</hi> Country? Has he done all this with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Cauſe? No; <q>
                     <hi>Will a Lion roar in the Foreſt when he hath no Prey?</hi>
                  </q> Will he collect his Rage, and ſpring out of his Thicket with a hideous Roar, when he ſees nothing that is a fit Prey for him? No; he will not fly at a Rock or a Tree, but at ſome Animal which Inſtinct teaches him to devour. <q>
                     <hi>Will a young Lion cry out of his Den, if he have taken nothing?</hi>
                  </q> No; but when he has got his Prey in his deadly Paw, he roars over it, and tears it to Pieces. And would the righteous Judge of all the Earth <hi>roar</hi> againſt us, in his Judgments, if we were not a fit <hi>Prey</hi> for his Vengeance? would he blaſt the Fruits of the Earth, and <hi>roar</hi> againſt us in the horrid Sound of War, if our Sins had not made us fit to be devoured by his righteous Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? No; <hi>Innocence</hi> may always be ſure of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection under his Government; and <hi>penitent</hi> Sinners may hope for his Mercy; but <hi>impenitent</hi> Sinners he will puniſh in the World to come for their perſonal Sins; and impenitent Nations he will viſit with his righteous Judgments, for their national Sins, in this World: I ſay, <hi>in this World;</hi> for it is only in <hi>this</hi>

                     <hi>Can a Bird fall in a Snare upon the Earth, where no Gin is for him?</hi>
                  </q> Can it be enſnared and taken, where no Snare is laid for it? No, and can a People fall under Calamities, when God has not ſpread the Net of his Judgments to take them? Or would a righteous God ſeize them with his Judgments, if they had not deſerved it by their Sins? No; it is Sin that laid the Snare in which we are fallen: It
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:007644_0024_102D986B533BE788"/>is Sin that has ſhut the Heavens, and reſtrained the Clouds from dropping down Fatneſs on the parched Earth: It is Sin that way-laid our Army, and cut them off: It is the Sin of the <hi>Country</hi> for which they fought, rather than their own: For we are to conſider Soldiers, not as acting for themſelves, but for their Country; and they ſtand or fall, according to the Deſigns of God towards that Country, without any Regard to their <hi>perſonal</hi> Character. If God has a gracious Deſign towards a People, he will make their Arms victorious, and defend them againſt their Enemies, however wicked the Men may be whom they employ as Soldiers. But if the Iniquities of a People are full, and he intends to ſcourge them, then he will defeat even an Army of Saints, and determine the Event of War againſt them. And was it the <hi>Sins</hi> of our Land that cut off our brave General, and ſo many of our choice Men? Alaſs! what a ſhocking Addition is this to our Grief for their Loſs? This ſeems to indite us as guilty of their Blood. O VIRGINIA! what a Miſchief have thy Sins done? God would not thus afflict a righteous or a penitent People: The Juſtice of his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is as obvious a Truth, as any Principle of natural or revealed Religion: And the Judgments of God upon a Land are infallible Evidences of general Guilt and Impenitence.</p>

What filthy Luſts, what miſchievous Paſſions harbour there? How many Hearts among us are cold or lukewarm towards God, and his Son Jeſus Chriſt, and never felt his Love ſhed abroad in them?

How many old, unregenerate Hearts, that have never been changed by the Almighty Power of God? How many that are wholly unacquainted with the various Exerciſes, the Joys and Sorrows, the Hopes and Fears that are familiar to every true Chriſtian? How many that never embraced the Lord Jeſus as

                        <hi>AMOS iii. 1—6.</hi>
                     </bibl> Hear this Word that the Lord hath ſpoken againſt you, O Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> againſt the whole Family which I brought up from the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> ſaying, you only have I known of all the Families of the Earth; therefore I will puniſh you for all your Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.—Shall one take up a Snare from the Earth, and have taken nothing at all? Shall a Trumpet be blown in the City; and the People not be afraid?—</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>IN the foregoing Sermon, I left unfiniſhed an Inquiry of great Importance to us in the preſent Situation of our COUNTRY, <hi>viz.</hi> "What is the Reaſon that God hath withheld ſo many of his uſual Bleſſings from us?'—This Part of the Enquiry I have already anſwered; and I hope your Hearts are ſtill under the Impreſſions of it. If he does not <hi>walk</hi> amicably with us, it is becauſe we are <hi>not agreed:</hi> And if he afflicts us, it is becauſe we have ſinned againſt him. <hi>The Lion hath roared</hi> againſt us, becauſe he hath found us a proper <hi>Prey.</hi> But it remains for us to enquire, "Why he hath done this, notwithſtanding our paſt Bleſſings and Deliverances, and the many Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:007644_0033_102D9881F0CEFAD8"/>with which he hath been pleaſed to diſtinguiſh us?" We may gather an Anſwer to this from his Conduct towards the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> related in the firſt and ſecond Verſes of my Text.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were the Poſterity of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> thoſe favourite Patriarchs, with whom God condeſcended to enter into Covenant, both for them and their Seed. They were a Family miraculouſly delivered from <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Slavery, conducted thro' an hideous Wilderneſs into a Land of Liberty and Plenty, and protected there by an immediate Providence. But their higheſt Privilege was, that God had taken them for <hi>his Church</hi> and peculiar People, favoured them with a Revelation of his Will, and a Religion from Heaven, and ſent his Prophets to them to inſtruct and admoniſh them.—But that ungrateful People forgot their Obligations to their divine Benefactor, grew weary of his Service, rebelled againſt him, and became debauched in Principles and Morals. And will it ſecure them, when thus degenerate, that they were once diſtinguiſhed with ſo many Bleſſings, and ſtill profeſſed themſelves the Church of God? Could this ſecure them againſt his Judgments? No; ſo far from it, that theſe very Circumſtances encreaſed their Guilt, and rendered their Puniſhments more certain and ſevere. <q>
                     <hi>You only,</hi> ſaith the Lord <hi>have I known of all the Families of the Earth:</hi> I have choſen you to be my Church and People, while I ſuffered other Nations to walk in Darkneſs, and at a Diſtance from me:</q> And what follows from hence? Not, <q>therefore I will grant you greater Indulgence in Sin;</q> or, <q>I will over-look it in
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:007644_0034_102D98841C326628"/>you, though I might puniſh it in other Nations:</q> but, <q>
                     <hi>therefore I will puniſh you for all your Iniquities:</hi> whoever eſcape, you ſhall not: tho' I ſhould bear with the Sins of others, I will not bear with yours, whom I have known and diſtinguiſhed from them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>There are many good Reaſons for this peculiar Severity towards the profeſſing People of God— He has a particular <hi>Property</hi> in ſuch; and therefore he expects particular Obedience from them.—He has a ſpecial <hi>Kindneſs</hi> for them, and laid them under peculiar <hi>Obligations</hi> of Gratitude; and conſequently their Undutifulneſs and Ingratitude muſt touch him very near. A Man is more affected with the unkind Treatment of a Friend or a Child, than a Stranger or an Enemy.—God is peculiarly <hi>related</hi> to ſuch a People; and therefore their Wickedneſs reflects more Diſhonour upon him, than that of thoſe who do not profeſs his Name.—God may alſo have Deſigns of ſpecial Grace towards ſome of them, and he may chaſtiſe them for their Amendment, and in order to deliver them from the more dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Puniſhments of the eternal World. A Father may correct his <hi>Child</hi> for a Fault that he would over-look in a Stranger.—Such a People have peculiar <hi>Helps</hi> and Advantages, and are under ſpecial Obllgations; and conſequently their Sin is much more aggravated, than that of Heathens, who are not in ſuch favourable Circumſtances for Religion. On all theſe Accounts it is juſt, reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and indeed neceſſary, that God ſhould puniſh with peculiar Severity the Sins of his People, on whom his Name is called; and that they ſhould not
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:007644_0035_102D9886A4DE1088"/>fly to his Altar for Protection, in their Rebellion againſt him.</p>
               <p>Let us now apply theſe Things to ourſelves and our Country. God has diſtinguiſhed us with a rich Variety of Bleſſings, above moſt People in the World, and made our Country a favourite Spot of the Globe. The firſt Planters of this Colony, paſſed thro' ſurpriſing Viciſſitudes; and were more than once in Danger of being entirely cut off by their <hi>Indian</hi> Predeceſſors. But thro' the tender Guardianſhip of Providence, they ſurvived all theſe Dangers: And now, this Wilderneſs is improved into a fruitful Field; and we have enjoyed as long an uninterrupted Peace and Plenty, as perhaps any Country upon Earth. Our Colony has prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly increaſed of late Years in the Number of its Inhabitants; and in Extent of Ground, it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps equal to our mother Country. It has been an happy Refuge to the Poor; who ſwarm the Streets, and crowd the Work-Houſes and Hoſpitals, in other Countries: Here they generally enjoy a very comfortable Subſiſtence by moderate Induſtry; and hardly any of them are incapable of providing for themſelves.</p>
               <p>Theſe are great Bleſſings; but they are not the <hi>greateſt</hi> with which Heaven has diſtinguiſhed our Land. He has brought his Goſpel, as a Vine from afar, and planted it in this Wilderneſs, that was once the Reſidence of Heathen Savages and wild Beaſts. The <hi>BIBLE</hi> is, or may be, the common Bleſſing of our whole Land; and none who enjoy that Directory to everlaſting Life, have Reaſon to complain, that they are left wholly deſtitute of the
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:007644_0036_102D988AA5EDD6C0"/>Means of Salvation, We are a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant</hi> Country; and how few Parts of the World can ſay ſo? I might add what will not appear incredible to ſome of you, who have been the happy Subjects or Witneſſes of it, that God has ſent his Goſpel into ſundry Parts of our Land, and among us in particular, in its Purity, and attended with his own Almighty Power, to make it effectual to renew many depraved Hearts, and reform many vicious Lives: And wherever ſuch a Work is going on, I ſhall rejoice in it as a WORK OF GOD, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Name it bears: Yes, my Brethren, I ſhall rejoice to ſee <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> pure, practical Chriſtianity, Chriſtianity free from the Encumbrance of Party-Names, flouriſh and encreaſe; and without this, it is but little Matter what Party is uppermoſt, or has the ſorry Sanction of a civil Eſtabliſhment.</p>
               <p>With theſe important Privileges has God favored our Land, and us in particular. Thus graciouſly has he <hi>known</hi> and diſtinguiſhed us, above moſt of the Families of the Earth. But will theſe Favors <hi>indemnify</hi> an ungrateful Land, in the Abuſe of them, or warrant them to offend againſt their peculiar Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor? Will this <hi>neglected</hi> Bible, will this <hi>abuſed</hi> Goſpel, will theſe <hi>profaned</hi> Ordinances, ſhelter you from the Judgments of God, when your Sins cry aloud for them? Will a <hi>ſlighted</hi> Saviour deliver you? Will his <hi>profaned</hi> Name ſanctify your Crimes, and be a Mark of Protection to you? Does the <hi>Abuſe</hi> of Mercy, promiſe you <hi>farther</hi> Mercy? Does the ungrateful Forgetfulneſs of paſt Deliverances, encourage you to hope for future? Do not theſe Things, on the other Hand, give you Reaſon to
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:007644_0037_102D988C413A06A0"/>fear the contrary, that <q>
                     <hi>becauſe</hi> he hath known you above moſt of the Nations of the Earth, <hi>therefore</hi> he will puniſh you for all your Iniquities?</q> Our Enemies are perfidious <hi>French</hi> Papals, and ſavage <hi>Indian</hi> Heathens; they may be as bad, or worſe, than we, in all Reſpects, but this, that we ſin againſt more Light and Love, and break thro' more endearing Obligations. Yet he may juſtly uſe them as his Rod to ſcourge us, becauſe he is more nearly related to us, and more warmly reſents our Provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, than theirs. The <hi>Babylonians</hi> were an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of wicked heathen Idolaters; and yet he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed them to puniſh the <hi>Jews,</hi> his peculiar People. Indeed it is very common for him to employ wicked Men in this Drudgery; hence they are called his Hand, his Sword

Go to the Place in <hi>Shilob,</hi> where God ſet his Name at the firſt, and ſee what he has done there for the Wickedneſs of his People <hi>Iſrael</hi> ‖.</q> Go to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to <hi>Antioch,</hi> to <hi>Greece,</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſee what powerful Empires he has demoliſhed, what flouriſhing Countries he has laid deſolate, what ſtately Cities he has buried in Ruins, and what numerous and eſtabliſhed Churches he has rooted out; and all this for <hi>their Sins;</hi> and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular for their ungrateful Abuſe of Mercies and Privileges, and above all for the Abuſe of the
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:007644_0038_102D988E51FBBE98"/>Goſpel. Be warned by theſe dreadful Examples, O my Country; leſt thou alſo ſhare in their Doom.</p>
               <p>The III<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Enquiry now remains, How <hi>long,</hi> we may expect, theſe Calamities will continue on our Land? And what is the moſt promiſing Method to remove or eſcape them?</p>
               <p>God has always ſome wiſe Deſign in all his Diſpenſations, and particularly in the inflicting of Calamities: And his Deſign in it, as far as we may venture to determine, is either to <hi>reform,</hi> or to <hi>puniſh</hi> a People. I know of no national Calamity, but what is intended for one or the other of theſe Ends; and generally, <hi>both</hi> are intended with regard to different Perſons. God may deſign to <hi>chaſten</hi> and <hi>amend</hi> ſome as a Father; and by the ſame Stroke to <hi>harden</hi> and <hi>puniſh</hi> others, who are ripe for his Judgments.</p>
               <p>Theſe are his Deſigns towards thee, O my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, in the preſent critical Juncture; to <hi>amend</hi> thee, or to <hi>deſtroy</hi> thee; to bring ſome of thy Inhabitants to Repentance, and to harden the incorrigible, and viſit them with his deſpiſed Vengeance. And can we hope he will remove his angry Hand from us, till he has accompliſhed his Deſign one Way or other. <q>
                     <hi>Shall one take up a Snare from the Earth, and have taken Nothing at all?</hi>
                  </q> ſays my Text. No, he will let it lie there, 'til he has caught his Prey, if poſſible. And will a wiſe God ſcatter his Judgments for no End at all? or will he remove them, before they have anſwered his End? No; they ſhall accompliſh the Thing for which he ſent them.</p>
               <p>

Here then my Country, thou art caſt into a Dilemma between <hi>Reformation</hi> and <hi>Puniſhment.</hi> Thou haſt no other Alternative, but, REPENT, and LIVE, or, CONTINUE IMPENITENT, and PERISH. I will not determine in what particular Manner and Degree God will accompliſh either of theſe Deſigns; this is only known to himſelf. And alaſs! I can give you no great Encouragement, that his gracious Deſign of <hi>Reformation</hi> is likely to be accompliſhed on the <hi>Generality.</hi> Multitudes rather ſeem hardned in Impenitence, or ſunk in <hi>Infidel</hi> Diſtreſs. They do not regard the divine Hand in the preſent Miſeries of their Country, not penitently reflect upon their Sins, as the Cauſe of them. The Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of Scarcity, and the Alarm of War, only throws them into a Panic, and perhaps extorts a tranſient Prayer from them. <q>Lord, in <hi>Trouble</hi> have they viſited thee; they poured out a Prayer when thy Chaſtening was upon them

                  </q> But alaſs! I ſee but few Evidences of their being awakened to be religious in Earneſt, and to turn to the Lord with all their Hearts. And indeed, all the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they are capable of, will never bring them to this, without the kindly aluring Influence of divine Grace. Therefore cry earneſtly to God for this Bleſſing; which can make the Miſeries of our Land the happieſt Events that ever you ſaw. The Converſion and Salvation of Sinners, is a greater Bleſſing than Peace, or the Abundance of Corn and Wine. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               <p>I ſhall ſhut up this Diſcourſe with an Advice or two, ſuited to the preſent Situation of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Put yourſelves in a Poſture of Defence.</hi> We do not certainly know the Deſigns of our Enemies, whether they intend immediately to improve the Advantages they have gained, and over-run the Country; or whether they will content themſelves for the preſent to ſecure the Acquiſitions they have made, and to ravage and plunder our Families. But we ought to provide againſt Contingencies, and prepare for the worſt. Therefore furniſh your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with Arms and Ammunition, as well as their preſent Scarcity will allow. You may yet need them for your own Defence; or if the Enemy ſhould not make Inroads ſo far into the Center of the Colony, your Aſſiſtance may be neceſſary for the Protection of our poor expoſed Brethren in the remote Weſtern Counties, that are liable to their Barbarities: For it is unreaſonable that the whole Burden of defending our Frontiers ſhould lie upon them. If you have a Drop of <hi>Britiſh Blood</hi> in your Veins, if your have any Thing of the Spirit of <hi>Men,</hi> or of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> exert yourſelves on this Occaſion. It now becomes you to be all <hi>Patriots,</hi> all <hi>Soldiers.</hi> Your Liberty, your Property, your Religion, your Lifes, your All, are at Stake: Your Families,
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:007644_0044_102D723DB27432E0"/>your Poſterity call upon you to exert yourſelves, and not deliver them up to Slavery, to Cruelty, to Superſtition. Had you ever had the unhappy Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of a <hi>French</hi> Government,—a <hi>French</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment over <hi>Proteſtants,</hi>—a <hi>French</hi> Government over <hi>conquered</hi> Proteſtants,—over conquered <hi>Britons,</hi> their natural Enemies; you would be deeply ſenſible that all theſe Bleſſings are in Danger; and you would rather generouſly riſque your Lives, or fly to the remoteſt Parts of the Earth, than ſuffer ſuch an Iron Yoke to be rivetted about your Necks. Therefore 'quit yourſelves like Men, be ſtrong.' The Imprecation of the Prophet, will fall upon the mean, ſneaking Coward. <q>Curſed be the Man that keepeth back his Sword from Blood.</q> Shall we tamely reſign ſuch a flouriſhing, wide-extended Country into the mercileſs Hands of Barbarity, arbitrary Power, and popiſh Superſtition? Have we enjoyed the Bleſſings and Privileges of our Country, while in Peace; and ſhall we abandon it, and leave it to ſhift for itſelf, when in Danger? Certainly ſuch ſordid, effeminate Souls are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of a Place in any Country. Can you bear the Thought, that Slavery ſhould clank her Chain in this Land of Liberty? That the Houſe of God ſhould be made the Temple of Idols? That you ſhould entail Slavery, and Idolatry upon your miſerable Poſterity? Can you bear the Thought, that <hi>Indian</hi> Savages, and <hi>French Papiſts,</hi> infamous all the World over for Treachery and Tyranny, ſhould rule <hi>Proteſtants</hi> and <hi>Britons,</hi> with a Rod of Iron; and riot in thoſe Poſſeſſions, for which you have ſweat and labored? If you have any
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:007644_0045_102D724A269AE770"/>manly Reſentment within you, let it kindle at the Thought: <hi>Paſſion was made for ſuch an Object;</hi> and you may lawfully indulge it. The Caſe of our Country is not yet deſperate: <q>In the Name of the Lord, we will yet lift up our Banners;</q> and hope for Succeſs and Victory. But if a Spirit of Preſumption, or Cowardice, continue to lull a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep, or unman, the Inhabitants, I muſt give thee up, O my Country! Such a Set of daſtardly Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are unworthy of ſo happy a Spot on the Globe; and no Wonder if their Dwellings ſhould caſt them out.</p>
               <p>If any of you are frightned and intimidated from venturing your Lives for your Country, becauſe you are full of Fears about your everlaſting State, and you would deſire to live longer, to make it ſure: To ſuch of you I would ſay, Now you find the bad Effects of your former Negligence. Had you <q>given all Diligence to make your Calling and Election ſure,</q> in Times of Peace and Safety, you would not probably be left in ſuch Perplexity, in the Hour of Difficulty. You have no other Way now, but diligently improve the Time you have: And if, after thorough Self-examination you can entertain even trembling Hopes of your Preparation for Eternity, you may couragiouſly venture, and leave the Event to God. Your cowardly Deſertion of the Cauſe of your Country, and ſeeking to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long your Life by that unlawful Means, will not be a likely Way to remove Doubts and Fears. You would be always haunted with a Conſciouſneſs of Guilt; and that would damp your Spirits, caſt a Gloom over your Minds, and obſcure the Evidences
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:007644_0046_102D9898B9F130E0"/>of your Hopes. FOLLOW THE PATH OF DUTY, wherever it leads; for that will always prove the ſafeſt in the Iſſue.</p>
               <p>As for ſuch of you as are really unprepared for your latter End, and juſtly conſcious of it; I have ſundry Things to ſay to you; and oh! that they may ſink deep into your Hearts. (1.) How may it ſhock you to think, that you who have lived ſo long in the World, ſhould want more Time to turn to God, and prepare for Eternity? Alaſs! what have you done with the ten, twenty, thirty, or forty Years that God has given you for this Purpoſe? Ah! are they all gone, without doing any of the great Work you were ſent into the World for? Have they all been waſted upon Sin, the Fleſh, and the World, and ſacrificed to the Devil? Have you been deſtroying yourſelves all this Time? Oh! Sirs, have I not told you of this, but in vain? Have I not often warned you of the Danger of Delays in turning to God? Will you now at length believe me? Oh! will you now conclude it high Time for you to return to God? (2.) If the Reaſon why you deſire to preſerve your Lives longer, be, that you may have Time to turn to God, and prepare for Eternity, then you are carefully improving the Time you now have. It is a vain Pretence that you <hi>want more Time</hi> for this, if you do not <hi>uſe the Time you have.</hi> And are you doing ſo? Are you ſeeking the Lord in earneſt, and endeavouring to repent and turn to him? If not, you only want Time to ſin longer, to purſue the World and your Pleaſures longer. And can you expect, God will indulge you in ſuch a wicked
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:007644_0047_102D989B65106B28"/>Deſire? (3.) It is not the Want of Time but the Want of a Heart, that keeps you unconverted. St. <hi>Paul</hi> was converted in three Days, the <hi>Jaylor</hi> in a few Hours, and St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Hearers under one ſhort Sermon; and why may not you hope for the like Bleſſing, if you exert yourſelves in earneſt? (4.) To excite you to this, let me try an Argument or two from a new Topic.—It is you and ſuch Sinners as you, that have brought all theſe Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties upon the Country: Impenitent Sinners are the Bane of Society; and bring down the Wrath of God upon it. Therefore if you would ſave your Country, repent and be converted. What a cutting Thought may it now be to you, <q>I am one of the guilty Creatures for whom my Country is now ſuffering?</q>—Conſider alſo, if the Things you fear ſhould come upon you, how miſerable would you be! An angry God above you! a withering, ravaged Country, an Aceldama, a Field of Blood, around you! a guilty Conſcience within you! and a burning Hell, juſt before you! Then you will borrow the deſpairing Complaint of <hi>Saul,</hi> 
                  <q>The <hi>Philiſtians</hi> are upon me, and God is departed from me.</q> Then you will ſee the Uſe of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and bitterly lament your Neglect of it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now make it your Concern.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Let this be a Seaſon of Prayer and Supplication among us.</hi> If God be the ſupreme King of our Country, let us implore, and depend upon, his Protection. <q>Should not a People ſeek unto their God
<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Iſaiah</hi> viii. 19.</note>?</q> Prayer is the <hi>Language of Nature in Diſtreſs;</hi> and Men that had no other Principle to
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:007644_0048_102D989CEE8685C0"/>direct them, have fled to this Refuge, upon the Appearance of Danger. <q>Some put their Truſt in Chariots, and ſome in Horſes;</q> and our Country has no doubt offended in putting their Confidence in a brave General, in veteran Soldiers, and a fine Train of Artillery; and what is become of them all? Let us learn for the future to put our Truſt in the Lord of Hoſts; and <q>if he be on our Side, we need not fear what Man can do.</q> His Aſſiſtance is to be obtained only in the Way of <hi>Prayer:</hi> Therefore lift up your Cries to him; keep your Souls always in a praying Poſture. And for your Encouragement, let me aſſure you, that 'the fervent Prayer of a righteous Man,' is not uſeleſs Breath pour'd out in the Air, but 'avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth much.' In this Way the feeble and timerous, and even the tender Sex, may contribute to the Defence of their Country, in ſome retired and peaceful Corner. They may engage the God of Heaven to become our <hi>Ally;</hi> and <q>thro' him we will be able to puſh down our Enemies; thro' his Name will we tread them under, that riſe up againſt us

               <p>Finally; Do not indulge exceſſive Deſpondency in the preſent diſcouraging Poſture of Affairs. What is your Religion good for, if it do not ſupport you in ſuch a Time as this? Do not diſgrace it, by unmanly daſtardly Fears. Shew the World that you have a God to go to in your Difficulties, and that you can chearfully live or die under his Shelter. I am ſolicitous for the Behaviour of my Countrymen in general, at this Juncture: But I muſt tell you,
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:007644_0049_102D98A04E156860"/>I am particularly ſolicitous, that you my Brethren of the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> ſhould behave with Honor and Spirit; and ſhew yourſelves worthy of theſe Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges you enjoy, and of thoſe you claim. Many of us have taken the <hi>Oaths</hi> to His Majeſty's Perſon and Government; and we cannot deſert the Cauſe of our Country, at this Time, without groſs Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury—But I ſhall deſiſt. Your own Hearts, I hope, ſupply my Defects, and ſuggeſt to you a thouſand Conſiderations adapted to the preſent Caſe and may God make them prevalent with you. <hi>Amen.</hi>
