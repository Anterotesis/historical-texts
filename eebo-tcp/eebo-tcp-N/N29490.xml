            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>THe second thing is to speak concerning the Judgment it self of the righteous. And there are two things the Scriptures speaks of, which Christ will do at his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond appearance in the judgment of the righteous.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Christ will take an account of the righteous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Rom</hi> 4. 10, 12. <hi>We shall all stand before the Judgment</hi> S<hi>eat of Christ, and every one of us shall give an account of himself unto God;</hi> though the righteous shall not be brought to condemnation, yet they shall be brought into judgment, which will be for their Masters honour and their own: especially of those who can give a good account of the Tallents their Lord hath entrusted them withal.</p>
               <p>I know it is a question among Divines, whether the sins of Gods people will be mentioned: and made manifest at the day of Judgment; I shall not determine the question, since the Scripture is not so plain; possibly the Lord having par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned them, covered, blotted them out of the Book of his remembrance, he will not mention them on that day; but sure I am, if they should be mentioned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it will not be to

their disgrace and grief, but to their more abundant joy in the Lord who hath forgiven them: If they should read their sins in the Book of Gods remembrance; they will find them like so many debts crossed out with the red lines of Christs blood: if the Devil should be permitted to accuse them at that time, who is now the Ac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But these four things Christ will take an account of, in the judgment of the righteous.</p>

               <p n="2">2. <hi>Christ will take an account of the improvement of the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents of graces and gifts, and opportunities of service which he hath intrusted them with all, Mat</hi> 25. 19.

               <p n="3">3. And especially, <hi>He will take an account of their works of Mercy, Mat.</hi> 25. 35, 36. <hi>I was hungry, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink:</hi> I <hi>was a stranger, &amp; ye took me in: naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sited me, I was in Prison, and ye came unto me,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>It will even astonish and confound the righteous to hear such language as this from the Lord Jesus Christ: when he appears in such glory, they will be ready to question, when he was in any want, and received relief at their hands: <hi>When saw we thee an hungry, or a thirst, or naked, and ministred any help.</hi> We received all from thee, but we could give no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to thee: thou didst relieve us, and redeem us out of the deepest poverty and misery in which we were sunk, and should have perished without thy help: but what relief hadst thou from us; <hi>Then the King will answer and say unto them, v.</hi> 40. <hi>Verily I say unto you, in as much as ye have done it</hi> to <hi>one of the least of these my Brethren, ye have done it unto me.</hi> At such a time and such a time, the poor came to you for relief making use of my name, whose backs for my sake ye cloathed, and whose bellies you refreshed, and whose ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities you supplied, that was done unto me; though they were poor, they were my brethren: some of my servants were brought into straights for Conscience sake, and you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them, or sent help to them: you received me then, and gave help to me, and I am come to give you a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand sold reward. Were this truth more effectually believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, what a forwardness would there be in Christians to works of mercy: surely they would look upon that part of their estate as best improved: which in such works is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed.

Surely it was none but the wisdom of God that could contrive the way of satisfaction to his justice, by the incarnation of his Son, by the union of the divine nature in the second Person of

evidence them to be from God alone: we read 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 12. of them which preached the Gospel with the holy Ghost sent down from Heaven. This hath been, this is unto this day.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The wonderful power of the Gospel in the first preaching of it, doth evince that it was from God, when so great a part of the world was in so short a time subdued unto the obedience thereof; when the Gospel prevailed not only amongst many of the Jews after Christ Ascension, and the effusion of the holy Ghost more largely upon the Apostles, so that three thousand people were converted to the faith by one Sermon of the Apostle Peter. Acts</hi> 2. 41. <hi>and five thousand more, Act.</hi> 4. 4. <hi>but especially, in that it prevailed amongst the Gentiles and Heathens, and so many Churches of Christ were planted and brought, not by carnal weapons but by Spiritual, to the subjection and obedience of the Lord Jesus.</hi> This power will appear to have been from God, if we consider,</p>
               <p n="1">1. How <hi>few</hi> men were employed in the first preaching thereof; there were not many which we read of, besides <hi>Paul &amp; Barnabas</hi> who preached unto the <hi>Gentiles</hi> at the first. If there had been multitudes of witnesses, it might have given the more credit to the Doctrine, when the testimony of a few is not easily believed and received.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That these men were but of little esteem in the World;</hi> that they were Jews whom the Gentiles had an antipathy against; and so were not so ready to believe there report, and entertain their message; that their persons were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible in their eyes; that they were like crucified per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to the world, and therefore unlikely to find accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>That whatever humane Learning and Wisdom any of them were endowed withall, yet they did not make use of it in their preaching, they did not come with excellency of speech and wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in declaring the testimony of God, but used all plainness, which was not likely in it self to produce such great effects.</hi>

               <p n="5">5. The power of the Gospel in the first preaching appears, <hi>in that it met with so much opposition; the Devil</hi> stirred up it struments against <hi>it, the powers of the Earth</hi> were against it, as well as <hi>the powers of Hell! great men</hi> did oppose it, <hi>Philosophers</hi> were against it, <hi>Learned men</hi> did oppose it; the <hi>Jews</hi> were against it, and raised up persecution against the Apostles, and <hi>the hearts of all men</hi> naturally were against it; and when there was such an opposition against it; surely it was none but the power of God which could cause it to prevaile and conquer, and cause so many Nations to bow and yield obedience hereunto.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The wonderful power and efficacy of the word, where it is preached unto this day,</hi> is a strong Argument that it is the Word of God.</p>

In the Scripture we have relation of <hi>Miracles,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they were confirmed: such as the Plague of <hi>Egypt;</hi> the dividing of the Sea for the <hi>Israclites</hi> to pass thorow; the raining of Manna from Heaven; the standing still, and going back of the Sun: the preservation of the three Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in the fiery Furnace, and the like, in the old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; especially the Miracles wrought by our Saviour and his Disciples, which the new Testament do record, such as healing the sick, the lame, blind, deaf, leprous, by a word, the feeding many thousands with a few Loaves of bread, the calming of the Sea, the raising of the dead after burial, and the like, all which did exceed the power of nature; and however wonderful things, might be wrought by Men in a praestigiatory way, which God may permit some to be delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded withall; yet all true Miracles, as these were, could be wrought by none without his immediate power, which he would never put forth for the confirmation of lies and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits; therefore we may strongly argue from hence, that the Scriptures which have been confirmed by these Miracles, are indeed the Word of God. I know the great question then will be, whether there were ever such Miracles wrought, which the Scriptures makes mention of, whether the historical relation both of Prophesies and Miracles be not a forgery, for the introduction of the worship, which the Scriptures calls for? therefore,</p>

These Arguments for the Divine Authority of the Scriptures may be sufficient to stop the mouths of gain-sayets, but without the testimony of the spirit in and by them, none will be sufficient to effect a saving faith. Thus it is evident from the truth, and divine Authority of the Scriptures, which do so clearly reveal and foretel it, that the Lord Jesus Christ will certainly appear to Judgment.</p>

               <p>Here we have a Disputation concerning the Doctrine of the Resurrection, wherein we may take notice of,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>opponents,</hi> and they were the <hi>Sadduces,</hi> who denied the Resurrection, they denyed the immortality of the Soul, for they said there was no Angel nor Spirit: <hi>Acts</hi> 23. 8. And they denyed the Resurrection of the body.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Respondent;</hi> and that was the <hi>Lord Jesus Christ,</hi> the wisdome of the Father; he that when he was but twelve years old, did dispute with the Doctors in the Temple, and filled all that heard him with astonishment at his understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and answers, <hi>Luke</hi> 2 46, 47. And much more now, when he was so much encreased in wisdom, was he able to deal with the <hi>Sadduces,</hi> and answer them about this truth, of which (he coming out of the bosome of the Father, and being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with his secrets) he had so perfect knowledge; he had answered the <hi>Herodians</hi> before most wisely to their ensnaring question, whether it were lawful to pay tribute to <hi>Coe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ar;</hi> and he was able to give answer to the <hi>Sadduces</hi> about the Resurrection.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>Objection</hi> of the <hi>Sadduces.</hi> Master, <hi>Moses</hi> said, &amp;c. their Argument against the Resurrection, is this: If there were a Resurrection, then there would be a confusion in Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, insomuch as seven Men having been in this World married to one Woman, all of them would claim a propriety in her, and to whom should she belong, would not this breed a discord? Must not six of them with grief be deprived of her, who once was their Wife? And could this agree with the state of perfection and happiness, in which all the just should be raised? The <hi>Sadduces</hi> thought now they had out Saviour upon the hip; they thought now it is likely, that they should confound him with this Argument, that they
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:039280_0157_1033B2939568F118"/>
should gravel him and shame him before the People; they could not answer it themselves, and they thought that our Saviour could not answer it neither; and truly the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection hath subtilty in it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The <hi>answer</hi> of our Saviour lies in vers. 30 <hi>In the Resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are like the Angels of God in Heaven.</hi> Hereby he gives them to understand that there would be no confusion in Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons at the Resurrection, that there would be no enjoyment or deprivation of conjugal Relations there, because such Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons would then cease; and Men and Women would then be like Angels, which neither have such Relations, neither do stand in need of them; the end of such Relations will then cease, and the Relation will cease too.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>One end of the conjugal Relation here, is, the propagation of Man kind insomuch as the number is incompleat, and will be incompleat till the end of the World, and the number is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleating by Generation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but at the Resurrection the number of Man kind will be compleat; the number of the Elect will be perfect, and in this regard they will be like to Angels<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whose number was compleat at the first and therefore this end of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage ceasing, the Relation should cease also.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Another end of marriage is mutual help; and this end also will cease; at the Resurrection the wicked they shall have no help, the righteous shall have no need of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. And with this Answer to the <hi>Sadduces</hi> Objection, we may take notice of Christs Discovery of their <hi>errour,</hi> and the grounds thereof, namely their ignorance of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and the power of God; whereby, our Saviour doth suggest a strong Argument, to prove the Doctrine of the Resurrection, drawn from the power of God, and the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; the Argument is this. <hi>If there be power in God to raise the Dead, and in the Scriptures he hath revealed that he
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:039280_0158_1033B291E1DBD0F0"/>
will do it, then there will certainly be a Resurrection of the Dead; But there is power in God to raise the dead, and in the Scriptures he hath revealed that he will do it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That there is Power in God to raise the Dead, is evident, and none which acknowledge his Deity can rationally deny; he that had power to make the World out of nothing, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ath power to raise the Dead out of their Graves; he that had power to give life, hath power to restore it; he that hath all power, hath this power; he who is infinite in power, who is omnipotent, unto whom nothing is difficult, he can raise the dead, and joyn soul and body together after a long separation. There is little doubt, but God can raise the dead<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the great question lyes in his will, whether he will or no, Therefore,</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Scriptures reveal his will herein; be that in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures hath promised that he will raise the dead, being (o pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful and faithful, he will certainly do it; but God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised in the Scriptures, that he will raise the dead. And though in the old Testament the Doctrine of the Resurrection be spoken of more obscurely yet our Saviour fetcheth a proof of the Doctrine out of the Book of Moses, which the Sadduces (as is observed) did only acknowledge. Vers.</hi> 31, 32 <hi>As touching the Resurrection of the Dead have y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e not read what was said to you by God, I am the God of Abraham, &amp;c. God is not the God of the dead, but of the living; our Saviour proves the Doctrine by strong inference drawn from this place, which needs a little opening to perceive the Argument.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is not unlikely but our Saviour cleared the thing in more words, (for we have but the heads in Scripture of many things which were delivered in large discourses) he made it so clear that it fatisfied the people, and silenced the Sadduces.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Argument formed up is this: If God be the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the God of <hi>Isaac,</hi> and the God of <hi>Jacob,</hi> when they are dead, then <hi>Abraham, Isaac, &amp; Jacob</hi> will rise again from the dead; and so there shall be a Resurrection from the dead; but God calls himself the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the God of <hi>Isaac;</hi> and the God of <hi>Jacob,</hi> when they are dead, as they were, when he spake those words to <hi>Moses</hi> out of the bush; therefore they shall rise from the dead.
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:039280_0159_1033B28FD1421F10"/>
The consequence our Saviour proves, because he is the God of the living, and not of the dead <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> if that <hi>Abraham, &amp; Isaac, &amp; Jacob,</hi> be living before God, in regard of his purpose to raise them from the dead, because he is their God, when their bodies lie rotting in the grave, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they may be called living when dead, <hi>by him who quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the dead, and causeth those things which are not</hi> (but shall be) <hi>as though they were. Rom.</hi> 4. 17. then <hi>Abraham, &amp; Isaac, &amp; Jaoob</hi> shall be raised from the dead, as certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as if they were actually living; but they are living be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for God, in regard of his purpose and promise to make them alive; which is evident from the nature of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant which he hath made with them, which doth include a promise of blessedness, and perfect happiness, which he will give unto them. If God be the <hi>God of Abraham, &amp; the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob,</hi> he is their God in covenant, and by consequence will make them perfectly happy, not only in regard of their souls, by receiving them into glory, when they dy; but also in regard of their bodies too, by raising them from the dead at the last day, till which time their happiness is but in part, and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; and therefore hence may strongly be inferred<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they shall be raised; and by consequence all in covenant shall be raised, to receive the perfect happiness promised in the covenant; and by parity of reason, that all out of covenant shall be raised to receive the compleat punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment threatned to sinners for their sins; and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence that there shall be a general Resurrection. Thus our Saviour confirms this great doctrine of the Resurrection, whereby he stopped the mouths of the Sadduces; his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer made the people astonished, and the Sadduces con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded; they came with their mouths open, but they went away with their mouths shut; they came with full cry, but they went away in silence; he put the Sadduces to silence.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The second Scripture to prove the Resurrection, is in 1 <hi>Cor. Cap.</hi> 15. thorowout; It seemeth, that some a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the <hi>Corinthians</hi> who called themselves Christians<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> did
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:039280_0160_1033B28E4E467EC8"/>
deny the Resurrection; now the scope of the Chapter is to refute this dangerous errour, and to prove the truth, which the Apostle doth by several Arguments.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The first Argument is drawn from the Resurrection of Christ;</hi> If Christ be risen from the dead, then believers which are his members, shall be raised also; he will not suffer his members to lie for ever rotten in the grave, because his mystle I body then would never he grown up unto per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: Christ is the first fruits of them that sleep, <hi>V.</hi> 10. As certainly as he was awakened out of his sleep in the grave on the third day, so certainly shall all those that do, or shall sleep in Jesus, be awakened out of their grave at the last day: But Christ is certainly risen from the dead, which the Apostle proves,</p>
               <p n="1">1. From the Prediction thereof in the Scriptures, as his death was foretold, so also his resurrection was foretold in the type of <hi>Jonab's</hi> being cast out of the belly of the whole on the third day.</p>
               <p n="2">2. From the testimony of those persons to whom the Lord Jesus Christ did appear after his Resurrection, namely of <hi>Cephas,</hi> all the Apostles, above five hundred brethren at once, who law him before his Ascension; and last of all, in that he was seen by himself upon the way to <hi>Damascus</hi> after his Ascensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: all which witnesses did with one mouth confirm the truth of Christs Resurrection.</p>
               <p n="3">3. From the absurdities which would follow if Christ were not risen.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The Apostles would then be found false witnesses and the Spirit of God which spake in them, would be a false spirit, which is impossible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Then their preaching would be in vain, and the whole doctrine of Christianity, which was built partly upon this founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, would fall to the ground.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Then their faith would be i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> vain: because if Christ were still dead, he would not be a meet object for their faith, for then he could not be the Son of God, nor a Mediatour between God and man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Then Believers would be yet in their sins; their sins would
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:039280_0161_1033B28CCAF636A0"/>
remain un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ardoned; because satisfaction to Gods justice would not have been compleated, had the bonds of death still held our Saviour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Then they which were fallen asleep in Christ would be pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished in regard of their bodies, like the beasts when they die; because if Christ were not risen, it would be impossible that they should ever rise any more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Then believers should have hope only in this life; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause if Christ were not risen and ascended into Heaven, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare room for them there, they could not have any good-grounded hope of ever being received into that place; and by consequence it would follow, that believers, the best of men, upon the earth, would be the most miserable men of all others, because they are exposed to so many sufferings for the sake of Jesus Christ: If they had hope only in this life, they would be most miserable in regard of sorrow, (though not in regard of sin) for their hopes of future glory do support and comfort them under all their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions; if they should loose their hopes, they would loose their comforts, and be of all others the most forlorn and sorrowful; it would break their hearts, and bring them to despair. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly then Christ is risen, and as certainly shall the dead be raised.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The second Argument whereby the Apostle proves the Resurrection, is drawn from the Paralel between the <hi>first Adam,</hi> and Christ the <hi>second Adam,</hi> V. 21. &amp;c. <hi>Since by man came death by man also shall come the Resurrection; for as in Adam all die, so in Christ shall all be made alive.</hi> By <hi>Adam</hi> sin came into the world, and death by sin, and death passed upon all his posterity, because all have sinned, at least in him: By Christ came righteousness into the world, and by righteousness life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and all his posterity shall be raised by him unto eternal life at the last day, because all are partakers of his righteousness.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third Argument is drawn from the reign of Christ at the right hand of the Father, until all his enemies be put under his feet; and the last enemy which shall be destroyed is Death; and death is no wayes perfectly destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but by the Resurrection of the dead out of their graves,
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:039280_0162_1033B28AE7A66018"/>
and the putting immortality upon the body: then when this corruptible shall put on incorruption, and this mortal shall put on immortality, death shall be swallowed up in victory; therefore since death, with other enemies, shall be put under Christ's feet, it is of necessity that there should be a Resurrection.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The fourth Argument is in <hi>V.</hi> 29. <hi>Else what shall they do that are baptized for the dead: if the dead rise not, why are they baptized for the dead?</hi> The words are diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult; various are the interpretations which are given; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

as we have an Emblem of death upon us when we are asleep, so our awaking again, and arising from our beds, it an Emblem of our Resurrection at the last day. It is certain that the dead shall be raised<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which hath been proved.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And secondly, it is as certain that Christ shall raise them. <hi>I will raise them at the last day. Joh.</hi> 6. 40. this is spoken of believers; but it is spoken also of all, <hi>Joh</hi> 5. 28,29. <hi>The hour is coming, in which all that are in their graves; shall hear his voice and come forth: they that have done good to the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of life, and they that have done evil, to the Resurrection of damnation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence it strongly follows, If the dead shall certainly be raised, and the Lord Jesus shall raise them, that the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Christ to do it, is certain.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Argu.</hi> The third Argument to prove the certainty of Christ's second appearance may be drawn from the certainty of the last general Judgment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If there will certainly be a day of general Judgment, and the Lord Jesus Christ will be the Judge; then the second appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Christ is certain: But there will be certainly a day of general Judgment, and the Lord Jesus Christ will be the Judge; therefore Christs appearance is certain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The certainty of the last judgment is evident from Scripture, <hi>Heb</hi> 6 2. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 9. <hi>Rom</hi> 25,6,7. and elsewhere frequently, and I shall further prove it by Scripture Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.</p>
               <p>It doth appear there will be a day of Judgment,</p>
               <p n="1">1. From Gods <hi>appointment. Acts</hi> 17. 31. <hi>He hath appointed a day wherein he will Judge the world in righteousness.</hi> God appointed the Creation of the world, which accordingly he effected: he appointed the reconciliation of the world to himself, which he brought to pass; and having appointed the Judgment of the world it shall as certainly be brought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

<pb n="161" facs="unknown:039280_0164_1033B28749F18C28"/>
and God being so infinite in power, nothing can hinder the effecting of what he hath determined shall be done.</p>
               <p n="2">2. From Gods <hi>Supreme and Universal Soveraignty;</hi> he is the blessed and the great Potentate, which rules over all the Kingdoms of the earth; <hi>He is the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 15. All the children of men are not only his creatures, but also his subjects. As it is the work of earthly Kings to judge their subjects, and to dispense re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and punishments: so God being the supreme Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, will judge all his subjects; Kings are but Gods Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerents, they rule under him, and they must give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count unto him; God will judge the judges of the Earth; men do often judge unrighteously, sometimes through their own wickedness and partiality; sometimes through igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and false information; the righteous are condemned by some, and notorious offenders are acquitted; and those which judge most righteously, cannot find out all that should fall under the lash of he Law, and the strictest laws of men do not reach all offences against God; therefore there is need that the Soveraign Lord and King should call the whole world to another judgement, which will be at the last day.</p>
               <p n="3">3. From Gods most <hi>excellent Wisdom</hi> in the mannagement of his government over the children of men; the wisdom of God now is much out of sight, and is little taken notice of in the world: there seems now to be a great disorder and confusion in the government of men; the most faithful subjects of the King of Heaven in most places are trodden un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der foot, and have many bitter cups put into their hands; and the most vile Traitors and Rebels<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> against the highest Majesty, are lifted up into the seat of honour, and spend much of their dayes in mirth and jollity; we read in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the various and great afflictions of Gods People. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 36 37. Some there were <hi>mocked, and scourged, and tortured, they were sawen asunder, they were slain with the Sword. they wandered about in Sheep-skins, and Goat skins, being destitute, afflicted and tormented,</hi> and yet such as the <hi>World was not worthy of;</hi> whereas it is said of the wicked, <hi>Psal.</hi> 73 5,7,10.
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:039280_0165_1033B285C6E07F80"/>
                  <hi>Their eyes stand out with fatness, they have more than heart could wish, and Waters of a full Cup are wrung out unto them; and they are not in trouble like other Men, neither are they plagued like other Men. S</hi>ee also <hi>Psal.</hi> 17. 14. <hi>Job.</hi> 21. <hi>from the</hi> 7 <hi>vers. to the</hi> 14<hi>th.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that if there were not another Judgment, God would seem to have been an ill-contriver of Government for the welfare of his people, and to have ill-consulted his own glory in the World; yea his enemies would seem to have out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witted him; therefore it is needful there should be a day of Judgment, when all things shall be set at rights, and put in order<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when Gods wisdom all along shall plainly appear in the view of all, and his glory be made manifest; when his people shall be exalted, and his enemies debased.</p>
               <p n="4">4. From the infinite holiness of God, now the holiness of God i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s under such contempt; then he will make his holiness to shine with an amazing excellency in the eyes of all those that did dispise it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. From Gods <hi>justice and Righteousness;</hi> God hath given unto Man a most just and righteous Law, and annexed threatnings of everlasting punishment, which he will inflict upon the breakers thereof; Gods justice cannot be satisfied without execution of his vengeance in the punishment of all transgressors, except it be of such who have an interest in the satisfaction, which was made by the Lord Jesus Christ; and all the Children of <hi>Adam</hi> being transgressours, and very few of them having an in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="5 letters">

of God doth engage him not to punish the wicked for their sins, but also to give his people that reward which the Lord Jesus Christ hath purchased and prepared for them; therefore there must be a day for him to do it in.</p>
               <p>Thus it doth appear, that there will be a day of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Judgment.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That Christ will be the Judge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is also evident from Scripture, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 31. <hi>He hath appointed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a day wherein <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e will judge the World in righteousness by the Man whom he hath ordained, whereof he hath given assurance unto all Men, in that he hath raised him from the dead.</hi> And <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 10. <hi>We shall all stand before the Judgment Seat of Christ.</hi> And 2 <hi>Cor</hi> 5. 10. <hi>For we must all appear before the judgment Seat of Christ, that every one may receive the things done in this body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.</hi> And Christs judicial proceedings is set forth at large, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. Hence then it follows, that the Lord Jesus Christ shall certainly appear to Judgment. I might add other Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments drawn from the faith, and hope, and expectations of the righteous, and Christs faithfulness, love, and the engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his honour to appear again, but so much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the certainty of Christs second appearance.</p>

               <p>If any should doubt of the certainty of Christs appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, because the Scripture speaks of the speediniss thereof, as if Christ had been in those dayes presently to come, and yet above sixteen hundred years are past, since the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise was made.</p>
               <p>I answer, that the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> who in his first Epistle <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

That there was then a lett to the Revelation of the Man of sin, which was the Heathenish <hi>Romane</hi> Empire which lett was not likely in haste, neither was removed till some hundred of years after; and therefore it is evident from that place, that the coming of the Lord was not to be until several ages after the writing of the Scriptures. This may be sufficient to give satisfaction concerning the length of time, since the Scripture tells us that the Lord Jesus would quickly appear.</p>

If any profane Mockers shall scoff at this answer, and say, where is the Promise of his coming? Do not all things remain as they were since the Creation? Do not the Sun, and Moon, and Stars keep their constant course? And what likelihood of the darkning of the Sun, and falling of the Stars, and the passing away of the Heavens with a great noise? Is not the Earth established upon sure foundations, and what likelihood of moving it and burning it, with the works which are upon it? and if Christ would have come so quickly, would not he have been here before now? I answer,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the <hi>Apostle Peter</hi> foretels, that in the last days such scoffers should arise. 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 3,4.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

That though many hundred years be past since the promise, that the Lord would come quickly, yet there is not a failure, in regard of God; for though the time be long, in regard of our account, who are of so short continuance; and time seems tedious to us, because of the miseries of our short life; yet in regard of the eternal God, the time is but short, for in his sight <hi>a thousand years is out as one day, and by that account there are not yet two dayes past since the promise.

               <p n="2">2.
