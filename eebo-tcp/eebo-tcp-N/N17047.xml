            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>ON Monday the 26th of January, 1789, the ſaid <hi>Morhouſe</hi> was called down and arraigned before the Court, and there charged by indictment with forging a bond in the name of <hi>Richard Mulherrain,</hi> and purporting to be given by the ſaid <hi>Mulherrain</hi> to <hi>Zebulon Roſs,</hi> jun. on the ſecond of December and year 1779, witneſſed by <hi>Iſrael Young</hi> and <hi>Jacob Ott;</hi> conditioned for the payment of One Thouſand Pounds New York currency. To which indictments he plead <hi>not guilty,</hi> and put himſelf upon the country for trial, and informed the Court he ſhould be ready to anſwer to his Indictments on Wedneſday the 28th of January; which day being agreed to, he was re committed to Priſon. On Tueſday the 27th January, the ſaid <hi>Morhouſe</hi> was again called down, and charged by two indictments: The one with having been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the forgery of the aforeſaid bond, and the other for uttering the bond knowing it to be forged. To both which indictments he plead <hi>not guilty;</hi> and after putting himſelf upon his country for trial, he prayed the Honorable Court to inform him upon which indictment he ſhould firſt be tried, ſo that he may prepare himſelf to anſwer it, as he made uſe of no Counſel; but the Court refuſed to inform him. He was then ordered back to priſon, and the next day he was brought down again, alſo the ſaid <hi>Iſrael Young,</hi> one of the ſubſcribing witneſſes aforeſaid to the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

then called, to ſeveral of which the ſaid <hi>Morhouſe</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, and appeared to judge by the phiſognomy of their countenances whom he choſe and who not, as he was a perfect ſtranger to them all. After the Jury were ſworn, they then proceeded to examine the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes for the People. The firſt of which was <hi>Peter R. Livingſton,</hi> Attorney, who being ſworn, declared, "Tthat ſome time in the fore part of Auguſt laſt he received a card from one <hi>John Wilſon,</hi> deſiring him to call up to the priſon, and in conſequence of which he called up, and there for the firſt time ſaw Mr. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> the priſoner now upon his trial at the bar: That he appeared to be a perſon of addreſs, and informed him, the deponant, that he was conſined upon ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion of counterfeiting money, and he thought very unjuſtly, and deſired me to endeavour to extricate him from his impriſonment, which I engaged to do, but was not able to effect it. About two or three weeks thereafter, I was at the goal, and there ſaw Mr. <hi>Wilſon</hi> again, who informed me, that he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a bond in judgment from a gentleman in the country againſt a <hi>Richard Mulherrain,</hi> merchant, in this city, with orders to proſecute it, and he wanted my advice upon the ſubject, which I gave him. He then took me into a room, and ſhewed me his letters of attorney from <hi>Zebulon Roſs,</hi> who was the man, he ſaid, that ſent him the bond, and to whom the bond was given. He then diſcloſed to me that his name was <hi>Abraham Morhouſe,</hi> which, for particular reaſons, he had concealed under the name of <hi>Wilſon.</hi> He then deſired me to take the bond, and put it into proſecution, to which I agreed, and receipted him for the bond in the name of <hi>Abraham Morhouſe;</hi> but as I did not then take the letters of attorney, which authorized him to proſecute. I called up the next day and got them. I then called upon <hi>Jacob Ott,</hi> one of the witneſſes to the bond, and queſtioned him about <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> and he declared he ſaw the bond legally executed. I deſired him to call the next day, to go before the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

mean time Mr. <hi>Mulherrain</hi> came to me, and convinced me that the bond was forged; with that I went and delivered it to Judge <hi>Morris,</hi> together with the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of attorney, and was determined he ſhould be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted for them (the ſaid bond and letters were produced) which he ſwore were the ſame he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of the ſaid <hi>Morhouſe</hi>"</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jacob Ott,</hi> as one of the ſubſcribing witneſſes before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, was then called and brought forward to be ſworn; but the ſaid <hi>Morhouſe</hi> objected againſt him as being an evidence, as he had killed a man in <hi>Nova Scolia,</hi> for which he was convicted and burnt in the hand, upon which he was turned aſide, and <hi>Richard Mulherrain</hi> was called and ſworn, and declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <q>That he never gave the bond now in queſtion, and that he had never any dealings with <hi>Zebulon Roſs,</hi> jun. except to the amount of twenty-ſeven pounds which he had ſupplied his family with, and for which the ſaid <hi>Roſs</hi> owed him; and that ſome time in the month of <hi>September,</hi> the aforeſaid <hi>Jacob Ott</hi> came to him and informed him that there were ſome men in gaol who were about forging a bond againſt him to a large amount, and wanted to engage him the ſaid <hi>Ott,</hi> to be a witneſs to the ſaid bond, but that he would not do it without letting him know of it; and further the ſaid <hi>Mulherrain</hi> declared that he did not at firſt credit the ſaid <hi>Ott;</hi> but after ſeveral informations of the ſame kind, he was induced to believe him, and for fear that the bond might be withdrawn from Mr. <hi>R. Livingſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>'s hands, and ſo the rogues eſcape puniſhment, he at length agreed to have <hi>Ott</hi> go and witneſs the bond.</q> (Upon which one of the Jurymen, a very obſerving young man, aroſe and deſired to know, how <hi>Ott</hi> could go and witneſs the bond after it was in the Attorney's hands? At which queſtion the ſaid <hi>Mulherrain</hi> appeared very much diſconcerted, and made no immediate reply—whereupon the Honorable Judge <hi>

point of time, and put the ſtory to rights himſelf, after the ſaid <hi>Mulherrain</hi> had recollected himſelf. He the ſaid <hi>Mulherrain</hi> again declared, "That ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his advice he believed that <hi>Ott</hi> went and became a witneſs to the ſaid bond, and that he had applied to Mr. <hi>R. Livingſton</hi> the Attorney, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced him to give up the ſaid bond to the Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Judge <hi>Morris,</hi> which he did" Then the ſaid <hi>Mulherrain</hi> produced a letter, ſaid to be wrote from the ſaid <hi>Zebulon Roſs,</hi> jun. to him, <hi>Mulherrain,</hi> deſiring him not to put him to trouble for the ſmall ſum of money he owed him, for that it ſhould be ſettled as ſoon as poſſible.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mulherrain</hi>'s clerk was then brought forward, and affirmed (being a Quaker) "That ſome time ago he had filed the aforementioned letter among <hi>Mulherrain</hi>'s papers" The ſaid <hi>Mulherrain</hi> declared, "That he had ſeen the priſoner at the bar before, but never knew him by any other name but that of <hi>Wilſon.</hi>"</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jacob Ott</hi> was again called<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the ſaid <hi>Morhouſe</hi> making the ſame objection as before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Court over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled it, and declared that <hi>Ott</hi> ſhould be ſworn, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the records of his conviction could be produced. The ſaid <hi>Morhouſe</hi> obſerved that they could not be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, but offered to prove his conviction by very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponſible witneſſes but the Judge would not admit him to prove it, as he ſaid it tended to particulars. Accordingly <hi>Ott</hi> being ſworn, and declared, "That in the fore part of September laſt he was at the goal, when Mr. <hi>Wilſon,</hi> the priſoner at the bar, aſked him to be a witneſs to a bond, againſt a <hi>Richard Mulherrain,</hi> and offered him the ſum of fifty pounds to do it, upon which he agreed to it at the ſame time tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Mr. <hi>Wilſon</hi> he would do any thing for money; but he did not do it then but firſt went and informed the ſaid <hi>Mulherrain</hi> of what he was aſked to do; and that after ſome converſation the ſaid <hi>Mulherrain</hi> agreed for him to do it. He then went up to the goal and told Mr. <hi>Wilſon</hi> he was <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

            <p>The witneſſes for the people being got through with, the evidences for the priſoner were then called, <hi>Peter Learman</hi> being firſt called and ſworn, declared 'That ſome time in the year 1779, he ſold to <hi>Zebulon Roſs</hi> jun. a gold watch, a ſilver watch, and locket, upon cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit; that ſome time towards Chriſtmas, in the ſame year, he was at <hi>John Romers'</hi> houſe by the Fly Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket and there ſaw <hi>Roſs,</hi> who informed him he was making a ſettlement in the next room with <hi>Richard Mulherrain,</hi> and that if he could get any money of <hi>Mulherrain,</hi> he would then pay him, and accordingly aſked him into the other room, with that he went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the other room, and there ſaw <hi>Mulherrain</hi> and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral others; that <hi>Roſs</hi> then aſked <hi>Mulherrain</hi> if he could let him have any money to pay Mr. <hi>Learman, Mulherrain</hi> anſwered ha had none with him, and beſide, as the ſame was equal, and as the bond was drawn, it would not be worth while to alter it; with that the deponent made anſwer that he was not then in want of money, and that Mr. <hi>Roſs</hi> might pay him ſome other time. Mr. <hi>Mulherrain</hi> then ſat down and ſigned a bond in judgment, which was read, and mentioned one thouſand pounds in the condition payable in one year from that date.

Capt <hi>Roſs</hi> then took out the bond and ſhewed it to the deponant, and ſaid he believed he ſhould ſend it down by ſome friend to put in proſecution, as he was in want of the money.</p>
            <p>The bond was then produced, which Mr. <hi>Learman</hi> declared to the beſt of his knowledge to be the ſame which he had ſeen executed by Mr. <hi>Mulherrain,</hi> and the ſame which Capt. <hi>Roſs</hi> had ſhewn him in 1787.'</p>

               <hi>Thomas Barrett</hi> was then ſworn and declared.

The bond was produced and Mr. <hi>Barrett</hi> ſwore to the beſt of his knowledge it was the ſame bond he ſaw at Charleſton. The letters of attorney from <hi>Zebulon Roſs,</hi> jun. which authorized the ſaid <hi>Morhouſe</hi> to put the ſaid bond in proſecution, were then produced, and Mr. <hi>Barrett</hi> declared them, according to the beſt of his knowledge, to be the hand-writing of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid <hi>Zebulon Roſs.</hi>'</p>

That after I was a priſoner Mr. <hi>Ott</hi> uſed to come and ſee me often, and appeared to pity my ſituation, as he ſaid he knew I did not deſerve it; and one day he told me if I would give him a coat I had, and which he was much in want of, he would bring in tools for me to break priſon, which I agreed to, and gave him my coat; but ſame days afterwards he came and told me that as the tools would coſt conſiderable, and the riſk was very great, he would not do it for the coat, but that if I with the others in the room, would make up fifty pounds for him, he would bring in tools ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to break the priſon, and likewiſe a ſet of keys that would unlock all the doors of the gaol, ſo that if we were detected in breaking out, the keys would then anſwer to let us out by the doors. I told him it was impoſſible for us to raiſe ſo much money then. He then told me that if I could get Mr. <hi>Wilſon</hi> to give his note for the money, he would take it. I told him I would try. Accordingly the next day happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to get the liberty of the Hall, I told Mr. <hi>Wilſon,</hi> if he would give his note to Mr. <hi>Ott,</hi> for Fifty Pounds that he would get me out, and as ſoon as I was out I would ſettle the matter with him, which he by my perſuaſion conſented to do, and Mr. <hi>Ott,</hi> coming there that day, we then, Mr. <hi>Wilſon,</hi> Mr. <hi>Ott,</hi> and myſelf, went up ſtairs together, and Mr. <hi>Wilſon</hi> gave Mr. <hi>Ott</hi> a note for Fifty Pounds, payable in a few days, but how many I do not remember; Mr. <hi>Ott</hi> the next day brought me a rope, a chiſel and three gimblets, but never brought any keys. We broke the room with the tools, and myſelf and five more went out, Mr. <hi>Wilſon</hi> was then confined in the room, with us but would not go out. The note was then produced, and Mr. <hi>Tobias</hi> declared it to the beſt of his knowledge, to be the ſame that Mr. <hi>Wilſon</hi> the priſoner at the bar, and called now by the name of <hi>Abraham Morhouſe,</hi> gave <hi>Jacob Ott</hi> for him.'</p>

               <hi>John Ketcham</hi> was then ſworn, and declared, "That a few evenings ago he was in a public houſe, and that <hi>Jacob Ott</hi> and ſeveral others were there, and that he heard <hi>Ott</hi> ſay that he was waiting for Mr. <hi>Mulherrain</hi> to come home, that he wanted to get ſome money from him; and that <hi>Ott</hi> further ſaid, that he could get money of <hi>Mulherrain</hi> when he wanted it, and he could get 50 or 60l. of him, if he wanted."

Gentlemen, will be what reaſon I had for altering my name from <hi>Morhouſe</hi> to <hi>Wilſon,</hi> to which I anſwer: Gentlemen, at a very early period of my life I quitted my father with his conſent, and commenced buſineſs on my own bottom, bought a ſtore near Clavarick, and drove on a large trade between that and this city, my credit being firmly eſtabliſhed which enabled me to trade largely, and at the ſame time with a conſiderable profit to my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:021976_0010_0FB64A71F85883C8"/>
but being young and unexperienced in the world, I did not take that precaution and care as might be expected from one further advanced in years, and rip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened by experience: being naturally of an eaſy and benevolent temper, I was induced by ſolicitations to give large credits, and when the day of payment came, by their pleading up ſcarcity of money and their ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to pay, my eaſy nature would never permit me to diſtreſs them or their families, and by that means payments were put off from time to time, and many of them remain unpaid to this day In leſs than a year after I commenced buſineſs, by a calculation of my affairs, I imagined I had made as much money as I ſhould ever want, and at that time having a great inclination to travel I equipped myſelf with a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable degree of ſplendor, and ſet out to explore the ſouthern ſtates, having firſt put my affairs which I was obliged to leave behind into the hands of a friend, with expreſs orders for him to collect as much money as would pay my debts and to obtain as ſpeedy as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible a diſcharge from all my creditors. I then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced my journey, which continued through various parts of the world for four years ſucceſſively during which I experienced as many viciſſitudes of fortune as perhaps any man ever did in that length of time. But returning laſt ſpring, and finding myſelf heartily tired of rambling. I then ſeriouſly came to a reſolution of ſettling myſelf, and to quit a roving life; with theſe ſentiments I applied to my friend (whom I at my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture had left my buſineſs with) and deſired to know what progreſs he had made in my affairs. But to my ſurpriſe I ſoon diſcovered that he had paid ſo much attention to his own buſineſs, that he had entirely neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected mine, and I therefore ſaw very little difference in my affairs, but found they remained nearly in the ſame ſituation as I left them, which cauſed me to draw my property immediately out of his hands and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to truſt no one, but ſettle my own buſineſs my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf As ſoon as I came to take a view of my affairs, they afforded a very diſagreeable proſpect, and I found
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:021976_0011_0FB64A736D9C3D30"/>
myſelf reduced in a labyrinth of perplexities and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; for although I had much more owing me than I owed, yet the ſcarcity of money and the ſituation of many of my debtors, I ſoon ſaw would make it very difficult to collect money enough to pay my debts; and being at the ſame time jealous that were my cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors acquainted with my return, they would immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately fall upon me unprepared for their money, and ſo caſt me into priſon, which you are all ſenſible, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, is a very poor place for a man to ſettle his buſineſs in. This idea, Gentlemen, brought me to a reſolution of embracing my free moments, to bring my creditors to a favorable compoſition. But not knowing who to truſt, I thought no one would be ſo proper to tranſact the buſineſs as myſelf; and well knowing that from my long abſence and the great al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration made in my perſon, my moſt intimate friends would not know me by ſight. I therefore called my name <hi>John M. Wilſon,</hi> and as it were under this invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible diſguiſe, I could with eaſe and pleaſure ſettle the buſineſs for <hi>Abraham Morhouſe,</hi> and my acquaintance with all the circumſtances, and diſguiſed as a friend, would enable me to do juſtice on all ſides, both to myſelf and my creditors, and I make no doubt, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, but you will conſider the ſtratagem as a very innocent one, as you plainly diſcover that it was laid to injure no man, but to contribute to the general good. With theſe intentions, Gentlemen, I came to this ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and put up at a genteel houſe, avoided company or connexion, and confined myſelf wholly to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of my favorite plan, and had already viſited ſeveral of my creditors, and under my diſguiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed with them freely upon affairs between them and <hi>Abraham Morhouſe,</hi> without their having the leaſt miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt that they were then converſing with him, and ſhould have brought on a compromiſe in a few days that would have proved highly beneficial to both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. But fortune, not yet tired of perſecuting an innocent victim, thought proper to cut of my favorite hopes, and plunged me again into a ſea of troubles,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:021976_0012_0FB64A75351080D0"/>
for this purpoſe they ſeemed to infuſe ſuſpicion into the heads of ſome conſtables who were in ſearch of perſons they firſt ſuſpected of counterfeiting money, that I was one likewiſe, that it would be proper for them to take up, they in conſequence took me before Alderman <hi>Wool,</hi> who ſeemed to have catched the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, and that ſo ſtrongly, that he immediately with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ceremony, ſent me to gaol, but for what I never could learn from that time until this. I indeed heard a flying report that I was committed for paſſing coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit money, but this I knew to be a miſtake, as I had not paſſed a paper bill for eight months before, but being in gaol I was to make the beſt of it, and being in want of money, I wrote to Capt. <hi>Roſs</hi> who owed me a conſiderable ſum, that he wrote me back, which my letters of attorney here plainly ſhew, that he had no money, but ſent me a bond in judgment againſt <hi>Richard Mulherrain</hi> for £.1000 and deſired me to collect ſaid bond, pay myſelf out of the money, and return him the overplus. This bond when I received it I gave it to <hi>Peter R Livingſton</hi> to collect. Now, Gentlemen, pleaſe to mark how candidly I tranſacted the buſineſs, for although I was then known by no other name but <hi>Wilſon</hi> but the moment that I found myſelf obliged to do buſineſs, I deſpiſed doing it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a borrowed name, but immediately diſcloſed my true name, as this receipt will demonſtrate where he acknowledges to have received of <hi>Abraham Morhouſe</hi> the above mentioned bond to put in ſuit, which plainly ſhews that all I did and meant was honeſt and ſquare, and that I never changed my name to defraud any man. Gentlemen, I made this obſervation to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince you of the candor of my ſtory, and I make no doubt but your good ſenſe will diſcover that every ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence I have ſpoken, is founded on abſolute facts and without the leaſt evaſion from the truth Now, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, the bond that Mr. <hi>Roſs</hi> ſent me to collect, and the bond which I put into <hi>Livingſton</hi>'s hands, and which he receipted me for in the name of <hi>Abraham Morhouſe;</hi> this is the ſame bond, Gentlemen, that I
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:021976_0013_0FB64A7D7B67B3E0"/>
am now to be tried for being concerned in the forge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of, and as you are informed by <hi>Ott</hi>'s evidence in the gaol too; Now Gentlemen, as the matter may appear ſomething ſtrange to you how I could receive a bond from <hi>Roſs</hi> who at the time he ſent it me was at 100 miles diſtance and within a few days after forge that bond in priſon? the two declarations are diametrical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppoſite to each other, and therefore one muſt be falſe and the other true, I make no doubt but you will without heſitation, from the examination of the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, declare me innocent of the charge; but to ſhew you how conſcious I am of my own integrity, and at the ſametime ſhew you the opinion I have of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of my adverſaries, I ſhall make a few obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on the ſubject, to which Gentlemen I beg your attention.</p>
                        <p>"You here behold, Gentlemen, a bond ſigned by <hi>Richard Mulherrain,</hi> witneſſed by <hi>Iſrael Young</hi> and <hi>Jacob Ott.</hi> Two witneſſes to an obligation of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is as much as the law requires, and therefore this bond is not deficient in that point, but you may ſay the witneſſes do not agree; for here is <hi>Ott,</hi> one of the witneſſes declares that the bond is forged, and that he was to receive Fifty Pounds to become a witneſs, and has here the note for the money to produce, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Mr. <hi>Mulherrain</hi> ſwears he never gave ſuch a bond. It is true. Gentlemen, they have ſworn ſo, and by that means the grand jury was induced to indict Mr. <hi>Young,</hi> which has deprived me of the privilege of his evidence, but with what juſtice I will leave it to you to judge. You ſee, Gentlemen, Mr. <hi>Mulherrain</hi> is called upon in this caſe to be an evidence, in which he has two alternatives, by taking the one he abſolutely ſwears about Sixteen Hundred Pounds out of his poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, and by taking the other, ſwears as much in, and I think, Gentlemen you will readily judge which his choice is: the Honorable Court ſays, that the law makes him a good witneſs, but pray Gentlemen, does any law human or divine, (except in a Court of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience) oblige a man to bear teſtimony againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf?
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:021976_0014_0FB64A82AA022E50"/>
I believe not, if ſo, then why ſhould a man be permitted to be an evidence in his own favor, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be unconnected with reaſon and reaſon is held as the foundation of law. I acknowledge, Gentlemen, that in ſome caſes it corroborates with reaſon and juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, that a man ſhould be an evidence on his own be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, for inſtance, where a man has property ſtolen from him, and no other evidence but his own can be procured to prove the property his, in ſuch and the like caſes, it is reaſonable that his evidence ſhould be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted on his own behalf, but then he ſhould be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined with the utmoſt caution, and no more weight ſhould be laid upon his teſtimony than could be juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by circumſtances, the ſituation of the caſe conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It is true, <hi>Mulherrain</hi> produces a letter as a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance to prove the truth of his evidence, but as there is no proof its ever being wrote by <hi>Roſs,</hi> I don't ſee, Gentlemen, that you can take any notice of it, eſpecially as there are ſeveral weighty circumſtances againſt him, which greatly overbalances the introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this pretended letter and which only ſerves to make <hi>Mulherrain</hi>'s fraud appear more conſpicuous, as will ſhortly be explained. Secondly, Gentlemen here is <hi>Ott</hi> ſwears that I engaged him to be a witneſs to this bond ſome time in the fore part of Septemper laſt, and gave him a note for Fifty Pounds to do it, do you believe this, Gentlemen, to be a fact? If you do, you muſt diſcredit ſeveral very ſubſtantial witneſſes, who are not only witneſſes of good reputation, but witneſſes that every circumſtance ſerves to prove the validity of their teſtimonies; therefore you cannot nor will not believe any thing that <hi>Ott</hi> informs you. Now, admitting <hi>Ott</hi>'s evidence to be falſe, which is moſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively the caſe, we ſhall naturally draw this plain and equitable inference, that is, <hi>Mulherrain</hi> being inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (as eaſily he might) that <hi>Roſs</hi> had ſent me the bond to collect, and knowing it to be for a large ſum of money, and finding in himſelf an inability or diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to pay it, he immediately falls upon a ſcheme to quit himſelf of the demand, and as the moſt expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious

way he applies to <hi>Ott,</hi> whom we find as long ago as when the bond was given, to be his favorite witneſs, as he then refuſed having any other but him to be a ſecond witneſs to the bond and from this we muſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally ſuppoſe, that <hi>Mulherrain</hi> knew his man, and and at that moment intended to cheat <hi>Roſs</hi> out of his property and laid his plans accordingly: in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of which determination he goes to <hi>Ott</hi> as ſoon as he found the bond coming againſt him, and agrees to give him a certain ſum of money to ſwear that the bond was a forgery this Gentlemen, you muſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively believe as you find by Mr. <hi>Ketcham</hi>'s teſtimony, that <hi>Ott</hi> declared that he was only waiting for Mr. <hi>Mulherrain</hi> to come home and he could get money enough, that he got money of <hi>Mulherrain</hi> whenever he wanted it, and to the amount of Fifty or Sixty Pounds, which money. Gentlemen, <hi>Mulherrain</hi> could never give <hi>Ott</hi> for any other thing, but for him to ſwear the bond was not a forgery, as we find in both of their teſtimonies; they deny ever having any dealings or connexions together In this manner he ſecured <hi>Ott,</hi> and engaged him to declare the bond a forgery; but being aſſured that <hi>Ott</hi>'s evidence would be no more than Mr. <hi>Young</hi>'s, and conſcious that Mr. <hi>Young</hi>'s in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity could not be corrupted by a golden fee, he formed another project, the execution of which he ſuppoſed, and that with ſome reaſon, would be a ſtrong circumſtance in his favor, and ſerve to prejudice the minds of the people on his behalf, he therefore orders <hi>Ott</hi> who had become his emiſſary to go to the priſon, and under the pretence of aſſiſting the priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to break gaol, to procure ſome kind of property or obligation from me, with which he propoſed work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing miracles. <hi>Ott,</hi> according to his orders, came up, but finding I had no inclination to quit my conſine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in that manner, ſecretly applies to ſome of the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

care to aſk ſuch a price as he was ſure they could not immediately comply with without aſſiſtance, he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore immediately offers to take my note, and help them to what they ſo eagerly deſired. Mr. <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bias</hi> with whom I was ſome acquainted, thought the offer advantageous, and readily agreed to ſolicit me to become his ſponſor for the Fifty Pounds, he ſucceeded; I gave my note as you ſee fully demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated by Mr. <hi>Tobias</hi>'s teſtimony, as ſoon as he had got the note, with eager tranſport he haſtens to <hi>Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herrain,</hi> informs him of his progreſs, who exults with him at the ſucceſs of their ſtratagem. Being now ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure in their own minds, no ſooner did <hi>Mulherrain</hi> find the bond in <hi>Peter R. Livingſton,</hi> the attorney's hands, but he applies to him, and with the benign influence of his purſe, engages him to go and deliver the bond to the Honorable Judge <hi>Morris,</hi> who by appearances was induced to believe the bond was a forgery, and that I was at the bottom of it, and immediately orders me to be treated accordingly, which orders I have very ſeverely experienced. Gentlemen, as to what the State's. Attorney has offered to your conſideration concerning the bonds mentioning State of New-York, which he ſays he thinks the cuſtom was at that time to mention province of New-York, and urges the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference as a proof that the bond is forged, but that nice obſervation of his can have no weight with you Gentlemen, when you conſider, that New-York was then an independent State, and the Britiſh being poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of this ſmall corner could not affect its title, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide Mr. <hi>Roſs</hi> was from the country where it was uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally called a State, and he without doubt, choſe to make uſe of a term which was not only more legal than any other but one that he had been familiarly converſant with. The State's Attorney likewiſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms you, Gentlemen, that there is a letter diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between <hi>Mulherrain</hi>'s name as ſpelt in ſigning the bond, and the manner he now writes it; this alſo he produces as the bond's being forged: but you will immediately perceive, Gentlemen, that he could not
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:021976_0017_0FB64A8ACA227798"/>
produce a ſtronger circumſtance of the bond's being a good one; for you <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                           </gap>, Gentlemen, he produces no proof that <hi>Mulherrain</hi> did not write his name in 1777, as it is here ſigned to the bond, but produces a paper which <hi>Mulherrain</hi> has wrote on purpoſe, and no other proof of its being his common method of writing, but his own oath, which how far ought to be credited. I ſhall leave it to you to judge; but ſuppoſing it to be really the caſe, that <hi>Mulherrain</hi>'s name to the bond is misſpelt, you muſt and will ſuppoſe, Gentlemen, that <hi>Mulherrain</hi> made the miſtake himſelf, and that wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; for you can't ſurely imagine, that any man would be ſo great an idiot, as to undertake to counterfeit another man's name (and eſpecially in a matter of this conſequence) unleſs he had the man's name and hand writing, ſo intended to be forged preſent, and to view with great care and circumſpection, ſo that both of theſe circumſtances are weighty additional proofs to what has already been clearly demonſtrated; which is this, that <hi>Mulherrain,</hi> at the time he gave this obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, laid his plans to defraud <hi>Roſs</hi> of his property, and evade the payment of the bond, and has proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed accordingly. For Gentlemen, I make no doubt but you are fully convinced, that <hi>Ott</hi> ſwore falſe, and that <hi>Mulherrain</hi> hired him to do ſo, and if his ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on would carry him ſo far as to ſubborn a witneſs to deprive a man of his juſt due, and take the lives of three innocent men, and plunge them into eternity, for no other reaſon but that they want obſtacles to his avarice. To crown the ſcene of baneful fraud, he would ſwallow an oath himſelf, eſpecially as it was likely to contribute ſo largely to his own intereſt. Gentlemen, you will be obliging enough to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der every circumſtance ſeriouſly. In me you behold a man oppreſſed with the heavy hand of tyranny, and loaded with affliction, more than ſix long months have paſſed ſince I was confined and cloſe ſhut up from all converſation of friends and acquaintance, and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually deprived of doing any buſineſs or even tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting what might procure perſons who were ſome

way acquainted with the circumſtances of this affair to come forth and declare the truth in ſupport of my innocence, while my adverſary. an opulent merchant, roamed at large, and ſpared neither time or money to ſecure his advantage and obtain my conviction, by which method only he could ſecure his ill covered wealth: but conſcious of my own innocence, and the reward due to virtue, I am regardleſs of his machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations; I have choſen you, Gentlemen, to be my guardians, and placed my life in your hands fully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that you will conſider the important truſt; for not only the lives of three individuals depends upon your verdict, but you, Gentlemen, are to decide the moſt important affair that perhaps ever was left to the judgment of twelve men; you now command the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of your country, and the eyes of every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon are upon you, eagerly awaiting the award of your judgment; you, Gentlemen, are to determine whether all public faith is to be broken, and all private con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts made void; whether all deeds, conveyances, bonds, notes, and receipts, &amp;c. &amp;c. are from this hour to ceaſe, and no covenants or agreements to be made, but by the word of mouth from man to man; or whether they may with reaſon, juſtice and ſafety be continued in their uſual and antient form; for if you find me guilty, no perſon that ever hears of the circumſtance of my condemnation, will ever be ſo fool hardy as to receive an obligation from any man, as it puts it <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

And you ſee I am charged with aſſiſting in the forgery of the bond, although I have produced my letters of attorney, which authorizes me to put the bond in ſuit, and have proved the letters geuuine, and proved the bond to be legally given by <hi>Mulherrain,</hi> and proved the bond to be offered years ago for ſale by <hi>Roſs?</hi> Neither is there any proof againſt the legality of the bond, but <hi>Mulherrain</hi>'s own evidence, which is ſufficiently bore down by diſintereſted witneſſes, which renders ſufficiently conſpicuous the authenticity of the obligation, as well as my innocence of the preſent charge.—I think, Gentlemen, I have plainly ſhewn the preſent caſe to be a very important one; but ſome attoruies may ſay, that I have not laid <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

reaſon and juſtice, the law will never cenſure you; for although by the laws being ſo numerous, and lawyers frequently wreſting them to their advantage conſtruing paſſages to ſuit their own particular caſes, without paying attention to their real meaning, by which means it renders them difficult for common capacities to underſtand; yet we find all laws founded upon the law of natural reaſon, and as <hi>Juſtinian</hi> obſerves, are reduced to three general heads, <abbr>viz</abbr> deal juſtly with all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hurt nobody<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and render every one his due.</p>
                        <p>"And your finding me guilty upon the evidence offered in this caſe, would in fact be complying with no one of thoſe important law maxims. You will like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Gentlemen, take notice, that I had a very fair opportunity to make my eſcape from priſon, and could have ſecured my liberty with the greateſt eaſe and ſafety. Had I been guilty of this charge, I ſhould have embraced the opportunity, and with the others, quitted my unhoſpitable manſion, to enjoy the pleaſing and delicious ſweets of liberty; for wiſdom teaches you that a guilty mind is ever tormented with diſagreeable fears and apprehenſions, and more eſpecially ſo, when in the hands of juſtice, which they ſo cruelly dread, for then they expect to receive a puniſhment equitable to their crimes: but Gentlemen, no one of thoſe fears tormented my breaſt; but conſcious of my own inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, I diſregarded the ſelf intereſted malice and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el perſecutions of my adverſary, but with humble re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation. I put my truſt in that Almighty Being, whoſe aſſiſtance I have often experienced in my hours of calamity, and remained in full belief, that his all-ſeeing ſpirit would aſſiſt me to declare my innocence to the world, and to convince the public of my inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: this belief made me forego the opportunity of relieving me then from unutterable diſtreſs to enjoy the bleſſings of freedom, but with my free and voluntary will now appear before you, and confide in you to publiſh my innocence, Gentlemen, favors I aſk none, for could I be ſenſible that my mind was ever ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved as to forge a bond, and to hire two men to

But I can poſitively aſſure you, Gentlemen, that ſo far from ever committing ſuch an action, you may rely upon it that the deed never once exiſted in idea: but Gentlemen fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying upon your integrity, I humbly ſubmit this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant caſe to your candid conſideration</p>

            <p>Mr <hi>Benſon,</hi> the States Attorney, then got up and made a few obſervations to the Jury; but was very ſhort and conciſe in his remarks.</p>
            <p>The Honorable Judge then roſe up and gave a charge to the Jury, which was very unfavourable to the priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, for he appeared to conſider the bond as a forgery, and that <hi>Jacob Ott</hi> had ſpoken the truth, in giving in his teſtimony.
