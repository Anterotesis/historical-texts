            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Subject matter of this little tract, are confeſſedly momentous and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry intereſting. Some things in it, we muſt acknowledge, are but little eſteemed in this degenerate age; and ſome things are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded by ſeveral late writers in Divinity. But Mr. <hi>Stoddard</hi> was ſo well known, as a wiſe, judicious and very ſucceſsful mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter in his life time, that his praiſe was in all the churches of <hi>New-England.</hi> And ſeveral of his printed pieces, particularly his <hi>ſafety of appearing in the righteouſneſs of Chriſt,</hi> and the following <hi>Tract</hi> have been found ſo very ſervicable to ſouls, in times when God has remarkably poured out his ſpirit, that God thereby has manifeſtly declared his approbation of them. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſerious chriſtians have often requeſted that this ſhould have a ſecond impreſſion. And conſidering how well it is adapted to the loweſt capacity, and how entertaining and inſtructive it may be to the more ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacious, it has been thought proper to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publiſh it. And now, a well-wiſher to the ſouls of men, and a Miniſter of JESUS CHRIST, does earneſtly recommend it to

Miniſters and People, high and low, as one of the moſt familiar and uſeful pieces extent; and prays the Lord to ſend a bleſſing with it to every ſerious reader.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>EOPLE are ſaid in <hi>Scripture</hi> to be converted, when they are turned from <hi>Heatheniſm</hi> to the Profeſſion of the Truth; ſo they are ſaid to be turned when there is ſome notable <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi> made among them. But then Perſons are ſaid to be <hi>ſavingly converted,</hi> when they are turned from the <hi>power of Satan unto God;</hi> when they have a work of <hi>Regeneration</hi> wro't in them; when they are made holy, and ſo are juſtified and made heirs of the Kingdom of Heaven; and this change is made <hi>at once</hi> in the Soul; it is wrought in the twinkling of an eye There is wont ordinarily to be a great deal of time ſpent in way of <hi>Preparation</hi> for this change: In order to this change there
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:011873_0005_0F87417B5E6E5C08"/>
is wont to be a work of <hi>Contrition</hi> and <hi>Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation;</hi> and tho' in the primitive times we read of men paſſing through the work in a very little time, yet ordinarily we find that much time is conſumed in the work of Preparation: There be many temptations to be overcome, flatteries and diſcouragements to be removed; men loſe a great deal of time by falling into ſlumbers, by backwardneſs to reform ſome evils, by try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to eſtabliſh their own righteouſneſs by fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they are not elected, or that God has given them up to hardneſs of heart, by imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their hearts to be better than they be, by unwillingneſs to own the Juſtice and Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of God, ſo that commonly ſeveral months are ſpent, and ſometimes ſome years, before they get through the work of Preparation; yet Converſion it ſelf is wrought at once, in the hearing of one paſſage in a Sermon, by the remembring of one Scripture. As it will be in the Reſurrection. 1 Cor. 15.52. <hi>In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the laſt trump<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the trumpet ſhall ſound and the dead ſhall be raiſed incorruptible, and we ſhall be changed:</hi> So it is in this firſt Reſurrection: John 5.25. <hi>The hour is coming and now is, when the dead ſhall near the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear ſhall live.</hi> For the clearing of this, Conſider</p>
               <p n="1">1. THAT <hi>Preparatory Work</hi> is no part of Converſion. It is an Antecedent to Converſion, but no part of Converſion. Sometimes under the work of Preparation, perſons are ſo exact in their Converſation, have ſuch affections and
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:011873_0006_0F87417C1E881210"/>
Comforts that not only others, but themſelves alſo think that they are converted; they have very great reſemblances of Grace, they have many meltings of heart, delight in Sabbaths, zeal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſin, as do carry a great appearance of a gracious Spirit; but all that they attain unto is no part of the work of Converſion, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ſtill in a natural Condition, and their religious affections are but counterfeit Graces. <hi>Paul</hi> ſeemed to himſelf as if he was <hi>alive,</hi> but afterwards he found himſelf <hi>to be dead,</hi> Rom. 7 9. <hi>I was alive without the law once, but when the commandment came, Sin revived and I died.</hi> Men under the work of Preparation are under the dominion and government of Sin, their corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are ſtunded but not mortifyed, they are reſtrained but not killed, they are like Vermin in the Winter, ſtupifyed but not dead; and whatever ſhew they make, they are deſtitute of Holineſs, in all their affections there is no love to God, in all their lamentations for Sin, there is no Godly Sorrow; their religion proceeds only from Natural Conſcience and Self-Love: The men are afraid of Hell, that makes them walk orderly, reſiſt Temptations and be ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for Sin; they hope that God is not ſo an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry as he was, that makes them forward in duties of religion; they conſider the moral evil of many ſinful practices, and that begets ſome kind of loathing of them; they hope in ſuch and ſuch ways to will the favour of God, that makes them forward in duties of Religion and chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; they hope ſometimes that God has pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:011873_0007_0F87417CDC84A4D8"/>
them, that makes them have ſtrong affections; but all theſe things are no part of Converſion: it may be ſaid to them as Chriſt ſaid to the <hi>Jews,</hi> Joh. 15.42. <hi>You have not the love of God in you.</hi> There is not one ſpark of Grace in them: Grace and Holineſs is quite of another kind: When they have gone through <hi>Preparation</hi> Work, Converſion remains wholly to be wrought.</p>
               <p n="2">2 When the Soul has performed <hi>one holy Action</hi> it is <hi>converted.</hi> One holy action may be performed in the twinkling of an eye: An act of Faith in Jeſus Chriſt, is done at once: And when the Soul has performed one holy Action it is converted: If one holy action be performed, there is a principle of Grace in the heart, there is a ſpirit of love, and faith, and humility; and ſuch a perſon is in an eſtate of Juſtification. There is a very great difference between <hi>Morality</hi> and <hi>Piety</hi> on this account. A man may carry temperately, chaſtly or juſtly, a day or two, yet not be a temperate, chaſt or juſt man: but if he carries holily one day, or one mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute, he is an holy man. If he performes one act of Faith, he is a Believer; if he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms one act of humility, he is a humble man. One act of Grace is an evidence that the mans heart is changed, and that he hath a principle of Grace: Men become morally temporate and chaſte by degrees, but they are not made Converts by degrees. The leaſt degree of Grace makes a man a Convert, or a Saint. Converſion may increaſe by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:011873_0008_0F87417F6373AB18"/>
men grow more and more holy by degrees, but Converſion is wrought at once; the firſt act of Grace makes a man a Convert.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Every man is <hi>under the Dominion of ſin,</hi> or <hi>delivered from the dominion of ſin.</hi> Thoſe that are not converted, are under the dominion of ſin, enemies to God, ſpiritually dead; but they that are converted, and delivered from the dominion of ſin, ſubject to God, and ſpiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alive; therefore converſion muſt be in the twinkling of an eye: If there were any conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable time wherein this work were a doing, then at that time the man would neither be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the dominion of ſin, nor delivered from the dominion of ſin; there would be a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble time wherein he would be neither dead nor alive, and ſo neither in an eſtate of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation nor juſtification: But ſurely, the next moment after his being freed from the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of ſin, he is ſubject to God. The ſame moment wherein he is delivered from ſin, he is an holy man.</p>

               <p>SOme have been of opinion that <hi>ſaving Grace</hi> and <hi>common Grace</hi> differ only in <hi>degree,</hi> that Sorrow for Sin increaſes till it becomes ſaving, and love to God increaſes till it becomes ſaving: But certainly, ſaving Grace doth differ
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:011873_0009_0F874180BB6932B0"/>
                  <hi>ſpecifically</hi> from all that went before: <hi>Gracious Actions</hi> are of another nature than the <hi>Religious Actions</hi> of natural men. The acts of common Grace may be very ſtrong and powerful: The <hi>affections</hi> of the Children of Iſrael were very ſtrong when they <hi>ſang God's praiſe,</hi> Pſal. 106.12. The <hi>affections</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> to Chriſt were very ſtrong, when they cryed, <hi>Hoſanna to the Son of David:</hi> The affections of the <hi>Galatians</hi> were ſtrong, when <hi>if it had been poſſible they would have plucked out their eyes, and have given them to Paul:</hi> And ſometimes the acts of ſaving Grace are very weak; there may be Godly Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row in a low degree; there may be an act of Faith with a great mixture of Unbelief; there may be true love to God where there is but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle love to him: Grace is low and weak at firſt, yea, after thirty years growth it is exceeding defective: Indeed true love to God prizes God above all the world, but that doth not prove that it is in a great degree; there may be a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to prize God before all the world, yet but a ſmall degree of that ſpirit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Inordinate love to the world is an affecting of that as the chief Good; when it is in the loweſt degree, it is ſo; that is the nature of it. So love to God whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a greater degree or a leſs degree, is an affection to God as the chief good: The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between ſaving and common Grace don't lie in the <hi>degree,</hi> but in the <hi>nature</hi> of them. This may aapear,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe ſaving Grace acts from <hi>other Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives</hi> and for <hi>another end</hi> than common Grace
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:011873_0010_0F87418220ECC5A0"/>
doth. The difference in motives and end, makes a ſpiritual difference in actions: If men do not act from gracious motives and for gracious ends, they do not the thing that God commands; there is no obedience to God in what they do; they don't attend the will of God: When men <hi>depend on Chriſt</hi> to ſave them, from the incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of their own goodneſs, and merely that they may be delivered from Hell, they act quite after another manner than the man doth that depends on Chriſt only from the encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of his Excellency, and that he may be delivered from Sin as well as from Damnation: When a man <hi>mourns for Sin</hi> becauſe it expoſes him to contempt among men, or wrath from God, or becauſe of the moral evil of it, he doth quite another thing from that man, who mourns for it becauſe it is a wrong to a God of infinite Glory: If his Sorrow were in the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree that his nature is capable of, it would not be gracious.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If the difference between ſaving Grace and common Grace lay in the degree, <hi>no man could judge that his Grace is ſaving.</hi> Men may know that they have ſaving Grace, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.13. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.10. But if the difference lay in the degree, how ſhould men go about to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine that their Grace was ſaving? The man may know that he has a greater degree of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, and ſorrow, and zeal, than formerly he had; he may have reaſon to think that he goeth beyond ſome other Profeſſors in theſe things; but upon what foundation can he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:011873_0011_0F874182DC5130F8"/>
that he hath them in ſuch a degree as to ſecure Salvation? Where has God revealed what degree is ſaving and what is not ſaving? What warrant has any man to judge himſelf in a ſafe condition, if there be ſeveral degrees of Grace that are not ſaving? What rule can any Miniſter lay down to guide men in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? Men muſt needs be left in a perpetual uncertainty, and remain in the dark about their eternal eſtate. If a man ſaw that he belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in Chriſt, that he repented of his Sins, that he aimed at the glory of God, it would be little comfort to him, becauſe he could not tell that it was in ſuch a <hi>degree</hi> as to ſecure his Salvation.</p>
               <p n="3">3 The Gaace that is given in Converſion is <hi>new.</hi> When a man is converted it's wholly new; when God converts a man he gives him a <hi>new heart,</hi> and puts a <hi>new ſpirit</hi> within him. 2 Cor. 5.17. He is a <hi>new Creature;</hi> not in reſpect of his Soul or the Faculties of it, but in reſpect of the inclinations of it But if common and ſaving Grace differ only in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, then his Grace is not wholly new, for he has had religious Joys and Sorrows, and a Zeal a long while; before he had ſaving Grace he had the ſame inclinations and ſpirit, only now it is heightned and increaſed; ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees are new, but the inclinations themſelves are not new; ſo that Converſion would be not the giving a new heart, but only an augment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch inclinations as were there before.</p>
               <p n="4">4 There is an <hi>oppoſition between ſaving Grace
<pb facs="unknown:011873_0012_0F87418589A21C38"/>
and common Grace:</hi> If one be oppoſite to the other, then they differ ſpecifically: Thoſe diſpoſitions that have contrariety one to the other, that are at war one with the other, and would deſtroy one another, are not of the ſame kind; and truly theſe are ſo: Common Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are Luſts, and do oppoſe ſaving Grace: Making his own Salvation his laſt end, is contrary to making the glory of God his laſt end: Hating Sin, not becauſe it wrongs God, but becauſe it expoſes him, is reſiſting the command of God: Bringing every thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſubſerviency to his own ends, is oppoſite to the bringing every thing into a ſubſerviency to God's Glory: The man that has but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Grace goeth quite in another path than that which God directs unto: When he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth about to eſtabliſh his own Righteouſneſs, he ſets himſelf againſt that way of ſalvation God preſcribes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3. There is an enmity in the ways of ſuch men as have but common Grace, to the ways that godly men take.</p>

               <p>THoſe holy <hi>Habits</hi> and Inclinations that God puts into the hearts of his People are not viſible in themſelves; men cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern them but by their <hi>actings</hi>

not able to ſee their own Souls, ſo they are not able to ſee thoſe habits that are in them, but only by their actings: They have a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to reflect on the operations of their hearts, and ſo come to the knowledge of thoſe habits that are in them; but they cannot ſee thoſe habits immediately: Hence no man is able upon his experience to tell the very minute when the habits of Grace were put into him: And generally men have thought that the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits of Grace are put into men before their cloſing with Chriſt; and they have been wont to argue in that manner, that there muſt be holy principles before holy actions, there muſt be life before there be life acts: But there is no neceſſity of this; the faculty of acting, muſt be before the action, the cauſe muſt be before the effect; the man muſt have a being before he can have any operation; but it doth not follow from thence, that there muſt be a gracious habit before there be any gracious action: There is no neceſſity that there be an <hi>antecedent habit,</hi> it is ſufficient if there be a <hi>concomitant habit</hi> and inclination. There was no neceſſity that <hi>Jacob</hi> ſhould have an habit of Love to <hi>Rachel</hi> before he actually loved her; that <hi>Michal</hi> ſhould have an habit of loving <hi>David</hi> before ſhe actually loved him; there was no neceſſity that <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> ſhould have an habitual inclination to Sin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they <hi>did ſin:</hi> So, there is no neceſſity that men ſhould have an inclination to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Chriſt and love God, before they do
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:011873_0014_0F8741875C01E818"/>
actually believe in Chriſt and love God; it is ſufficient that there be a concomitant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination that way: And thus it is from time to time; wherever there is an act of Faith and Love, there is a diſpoſition to act ſo for the time to come; but there is no neceſſity in nature that the inclination ſhould be ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent.</p>
               <p>And this ſuppoſition of an antecedent gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious inclination before actual Converſion, is attended with this inſuperable difficulty; that a man may have gracious habits, and yet be in a ſtate of condemnation; that he may have a ſanctified heart, yet be for a time un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Curſe; that his heart may be changed, and yet abide for a time under the Curſe. That he may be ſanctified yet not juſtified; for there is no Juſtification till there is actual Faith. When it is ſaid in ſcripture that we are juſtified by Faith, the meaning is not that we are juſtified by an habit of Faith, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Faith; for that Faith is ſet forth by words ſignifying Action; by believing on Chriſt, receiving Chriſt, coming to Chriſt, opening to him: It is ſaid of <hi>Abraham,</hi> he <hi>believed in the Lord, and it was counted to him for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> Gen. 15.6. The condition of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt be wrought by us; thence it is actual Faith that is intended: A diſpoſition to yield perfect obedience was not the fulfilling the condition of the Covenant of works; if that would have done, <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> would have been juſtified as ſoon as they were made.
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:011873_0015_0F8741876350D138"/>
So a diſpoſition to believe is not a fulfilling the condition of the Covenant of Grace; but actual believing.</p>
               <p>Moreover, it is evident that habitual and actual Converſion are together, becauſe both of them are effected by the ſame divine act, <hi>viz.</hi> The diſcovery of the <hi>truth and glory of the Goſpel.</hi> I am far from thinking that God is tied up unto this way; or that he cannot give the habits of Grace without ſuch a diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very; but it is evident from the word of God that he doth work the habit of Grace, and draws forth the act of Grace in this way: That he doth give this principle and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous inclination in this way is plainly taught; 2 Cor. 3 18. <hi>We all with open face behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as in a glaſs the glory of the Lord, are change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the ſame image from glory to glory, by the Spirit of the Lord.</hi> Changing into the image of God is by giving the habits of Grace unto them; beholding the glory of God as in a Glaſs is the diſcerning the glory of God in the Goſpel. We are taught the ſame alſo in 1 Cor. 4.15. <hi>I have begotten you through the Goſpel.</hi> In Regeneration men do receive the habits of Grace, the heart is renewed, and the man is made a new man; and this is wrought thro' the Goſpel, by the Goſpel, as <hi>underſtood;</hi> for it is in this way and no other that the Goſpel hath any gracious Efficacy on the heart: If a man hears the Goſpel twenty years, and has not the ſpiritual underſtanding of it, it will have no gracious effect upon him;
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:011873_0016_0F87418827664208"/>
but he diſcovers what a glorious way of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation God has prepared, and that works a great change in his heart: The ſame is taught, Jam. 1.18. <hi>Of his own will begat he us by the word of truth:</hi> that is by the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> which he calls the <hi>word of truth</hi> by way of excellency, and becauſe the truth of it was queſtioned by the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Heathens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And by this diſcovery God draws forth the exerciſe of Faith at the ſame time; that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery makes men immediately to receive the Goſpel. When men have a ſpiritual ſight of Chriſt, they will believe on him; if they withſtood the calls before and objected, they will be prevailed on by that ſight; Joh. 1.40. <hi>This is the will of him that ſent me, that every one that ſeeth the Son and believeth on him may have everlaſting life.</hi> And v. 45. <hi>Every man that hath heard and learned of the Father cometh unto me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is alſo impoſſible in Nature but that men when they do believe in Chriſt ſhould have an inclination or diſpoſition to come to him. Men may do ſome things out of a kind of compulſion, and do them upon ſome acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, by conſideration, and yet hate to do them at the ſame time: But the accepting of Chriſt is always an act of great freedom; when they do it, they do it out of choice, Pſal. 110.3. <hi>Thy people ſhall be willing in the day of thy pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</hi> They do it from conviction of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſs of Chriſt and benefit of coming to him; they love to come, and have a diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to do ſo for the future.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Believing in Chriſt is the firſt Act of Converſion,</head>
               <p>MEN that are converted do exerciſe all manner of Grace; they perform acts of Love and Fear, and Submiſſion, and godly Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and Patience, and Humility; but the firſt act of Converſion is to <hi>believe in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> There is no other gracious act that goeth before Faith. In <hi>this reſpect</hi> Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is wrought after the ſame manner in all that are converted: After the firſt act of Grace there is no certain order in the exerciſe of Graces, but this act of believing in Chriſt has the proceeding in all. Some men do not make a beginning in godlineſs in loving God, and others in ſorrow for Sin, and others in patience, and others in humility; but they all begin <hi>by receiving Chriſt as offered in the Goſpel:</hi> Falſe Converſions begin ſome in one way and ſome in another, but ſaving Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion always begins with believing in Chriſt. The man did a great deal in Religion before he believed in Chriſt, but he had no true love, nor godly Sorrow, nor Humility before: True Holineſs takes its riſe here, this is their entrance in at the ſtrait gate: There is no ſure ſign of Election before this, therefore we are adviſed to <hi>make our election</hi> ſure by our <hi>cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.10. This is that which brings men into an eſtate of Juſtification: <hi>He that
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:011873_0018_0F8741899F0D47A0"/>
believeth on him hath everlaſting Life,</hi> Joh. 3.36. Whatever went before gave the Man no title to Life eternal: There is no need of Holineſs to go before Faith: If there were need of Holineſs before Faith, either it would be to encourage men to believe; but there is encouragement enough without that, the Grace of God offered in the Goſpel and the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, are ſufficient en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, tho' men never did one good deed; for <hi>God juſtifieth the ungodly,</hi> Rom. 4.5. That is thoſe who have lived an ungodly life, 'till the very minute of their cloſing with Chriſt: Or elſe, if there were need of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Holineſs, it would be to incline the heart to come to Chriſt, but there muſt be ſome firſt act of Holineſs, and there is no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of any preceeding Holineſs to incline men to do the firſt act of Holineſs. When God diſcovers Chriſt, that inclines the heart to come unto him. Beſides, We may conſider,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That ſinners at their firſt coming to Chriſt, <hi>ſee nothing in themſelves to encourage them to come.</hi> When ſinners come at firſt to Chriſt they are <hi>weary and heavy laden,</hi> Mat. 11.28. They are <hi>athirſt,</hi> Rev. 22.17. They are convinced that their hearts are full of <hi>enmity to God:</hi> That they are empty of good, that they are <hi>wretched and miſerable, and poor, and blind, and naked,</hi> Rev. 3.17. Though formerly they thought themſelves alive, yet they are convinced that they are dead: They take encouragement from <hi>Chriſt, and the Grace
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:011873_0019_0F87418A5D3C3120"/>
and Faithfulneſs of God;</hi> but they ſee no good in themſelves to be an encouragement to them: Afterwards, godly men ſee ſomewhat in themſelves that is an encouragement to them; they can ſay ſometimes as <hi>David, I love the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 116.1. And as <hi>Job, Thou knoweſt that I am not wicked,</hi> Job. 10.7. And tho' they depend on Chriſt and the Grace of God alone; yet it is an encouragement to them to ſee the Grace of the Spirit in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. But ſinners at their firſt coming to Chriſt, ſee nothing in themſelves to be an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That men are <hi>ſanctified by faith.</hi> Act. 26.18. <hi>Sanctified by faith in me.</hi> Act. 15.9. <hi>Purifying their hearts by faith.</hi> Their Love and Repentance are the fruit of Faith; and therefore no other holy carriages are antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to Faith. All that are unbelievers are deſtitute of other Graces: If there be appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of Repentance and love to God's glory, they are but deluſions: If other gracious car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages depend on Faith, they do not preceed Faith; for the effect is not before the cauſe. If Faith have no being it can have no opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: If there were any Holineſs that went before Faith, that Sanctification is not thro' Faith in Chriſt, then their hearts were purified without Faith.</p>
               <p n="3">3 The <hi>Goſpel is the means of Converſion.</hi> It is by the Goſpel that the hearts of men are made holy: 1 Cor. 4.15. <hi>I have begotten you thro' the Goſpel.</hi> The works of Creation and
<pb n="17"
                      facs="unknown:011873_0020_0F87418D32D33718"

common Providence teach men to be holy, but do not make men holy: So the Law or <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works</hi> teacheth men that they ſhould be holy, but that does not make men holy; but it is the <hi>Goſpel</hi> that makes men holy: When <hi>Paul</hi> was ſent to preach the Goſpel, the deſign was to turn men from the power of Satan unto God; and if the Goſpel be the inſtrument of Converſion, men have no Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs 'till they do receive the Goſpel. So long as the offers of the Goſpel are rejected or neglected, it can have no ſanctifying efficacy on them: it may work ſome common affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions, but it does not change their hearts. If men are not wrought upon by the Goſpel to give entertainment to Chriſt, it hath no other gracious effect on them. The firſt gracious effect of the Goſpel is to make men come to Chriſt, other gracious effects are conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to this.</p>

               <p>THE act of Faith in accepting Jeſus Chriſt is the <hi>Converſion of the whole Soul unto God:</hi> for it is vertually all Grace, it includes in it ſomewhat of the <hi>Spirit</hi> of all other Graces: There is a diſtinction in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe

of ſeveral Graces; there is a difference between the acts of Faith, and Love, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and Humility; yet there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of the ſpirit of every Grace working in the Soul's firſt cloſing with Chriſt. As,</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is a <hi>believing of the Word of God.</hi> God ſpeaks a great deal in the Goſpel to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage Sinners to come to Chriſt. He tells us, that he calls us, that Jeſus Chriſt is the Son of God, that he is appointed to be a Prince and a Saviour, that he died for our Sins, that he has ſatisfyed the Juſtice of God, that he is riſen from the dead, and ſits at the right hand of God, that he will of his free Grace pardon all the Sins of thoſe that come to him; and the man when he comes to Chriſt receives the whole <hi>Doctrine of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel</hi> as the <hi>true ſayings of God:</hi> He rejects all carnal reaſons, and <hi>ſets his ſeal that God is true.</hi> He made a Profeſſion before, but now he does not <hi>ſtagger at the promiſe of God through unbelief;</hi> he is ſatisfyed that <hi>the Goſpel is no cunningly deviſed fable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> but the very Word of God; 1 Theſ. 2, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">2. There is <hi>Love to God and Chriſt.</hi> When the Soul marries to Chriſt, he doth it with a ſpirit of Love: He takes God as his Portion, he takes his ſatisfaction in God; he comes to
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:011873_0022_0F87418F18ED68A0"/>
God not for ſome Conveniency but for Bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, he takes him as one that is ſufficient to make him happy; he deſpiſes all the world in compariſon of God: He takes a compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency in God, and ſees the gloriouſneſs and amiableneſs of God: The love of God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in the Goſpel draws his heart. He loves to <hi>depend on Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and to put <hi>hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our upon him.</hi> This way of Salvation pleaſes him, he looks upon Chriſt excellent and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, he extols Chriſt: Cant. 5.11. <hi>My be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved is white and ruddy, the chiefeſt of ten thouſands.</hi> and v. 16. <hi>He is altogether lovely.</hi> His coming to Chriſt is not a forced thing; but he eſteems him <hi>fairer than the children of men,</hi> Pſal. 45.2.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is a <hi>Spirit of repentance.</hi> He has ſtood out a long while againſt the Calls of God, but now he repents, he changes his mind; therefore we have that expreſſion, Mat. 9.13. <hi>I am not come to call the righteous, but ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to repentance.</hi> The heart is not affected with grief juſt at that time only, but he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes his former courſe, perſiſts no longer in a way of oppoſition, but yields himſelf to Chriſt; he ſays as Iſa 21.13. <hi>Other Lords beſides thee have had dominion over me, but by thee only will I make mention of thy name.</hi> He gives up himſelf to live after another manner than he has done formerly: He hath been obſtinate a great while, but he ſtands out no longer, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſhes his former way, and comes over to Chriſt: His heart is changed, he is <hi>tranſlated from the kingdom of darkneſs into the kingdom of Chriſt.</hi>

The man is ſenſible that nothing but free Grace will help him, he depends on the meer mercy of God: Eph. 2.8. <hi>We are ſaved by Grace.</hi> He challenges nothing, he is ſenſible that he has deſerved Damnation, he counts that God might fairly deſtroy him: He does not magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy himſelf; if he be a man of underſtanding, if he be wealthy, if he make a figure in the world, if he has been uſeful and ſervicable to others, and to the Church of God, yet he looks upon himſelf <hi>leſs than the leaſt of all God's Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies;</hi> he takes no encouragement from any excellency in himſelf, he comes as a poor beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, he wants pardon and bleſſedneſs, but he has nothing to offer to God: The invitation is to ſuch; Iſai. 55.1. <hi>Ho, every one that thirſteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, come ye, buy and eat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea, come buy wine and milk without money and without price.</hi> And when the man comes to Chriſt he comes <hi>emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> willing to be <hi>beholding to Chriſt</hi> for all: He deſires Salvation, and is willing that God and Chriſt ſhould have the Glory of it. He comes for <hi>free Grace;</hi> his languague is as Pſal. 135. <hi>With the Lord there is mercy, and with him is plenteous redemption.</hi>

He ſees there is no compariſon between them, he ſees his own Righteouſneſs is but <hi>droſs</hi> compared with that <hi>Gold tried in the fire:</hi> He is willing for the ſake of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs to part with his own: Phil. 3.7. <hi>What things were gain to me, thoſe I counted loſs for Chriſt.</hi> Former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when he was invited to come to Chriſt, he had many reaſonings in his own heart againſt that way; but now he is ſatisfied in the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, and denies his own Wiſdom, will not liſten to any cavils, but ſays of Chriſt, that he is <hi>the power of God and the wiſdom of God,</hi> 2. Cor. 1.24. And that in him are hid all the Treaſures of wiſdom and knowledge: So he denies his own power; and reſts upon the power of Chriſt, to deliver him from temptation, and to keep him from Sin and preſerve him to Salvation.</p>
               <p n="6">6 There is a <hi>Spirit of Thankfulneſs.</hi> When the man ſees Chriſt offered to him, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and ſalvation upon his account, he looks upon it as an unſpeakable Mercy, and receives it as a great gift of Grace: He was wont for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly to ſlight the offer, and caſt contempt upon it, and neglected to receive it; but now
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:011873_0025_0F87419122CB7C68"/>
he looks upon it as a wonderful offer. He has honourable thoughts of the Grace of God. His heart is affected with God's Mercy, and comes gladly to Chriſt.

               <p>BY putting Grace into the heart God doth deſtroy the <hi>power of Sin.</hi> Natural men are not able to mortify their own corruptions: Whatever improvement they make of their natural abilities and outward opportunities, they will fall ſhort of mortifying their corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: They may do ſeveral things in order to the mortifying their Sins, but they cannot effect it: They may reſtrain themſelves much from the acts of Sin, but the lopping of the tree does not kill the root<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If they do not make proviſion for the fleſh, yet they cannot ſtarve it: If they bewail their Sins, and cry out againſt them, and call themſelves madmen, that will not do. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> bewailed his Sin, <hi>Exod</hi> 9.27. And <hi>Judas</hi> his, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.3. Yet both of them were far from mortification. Yea, if they ſtudy the danger and evil of their
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:011873_0027_0F874194D0C096E8"/>
Sins, that will not ſerve the turn. Such men may conſider, that if their Sins don't die, their Souls muſt die<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> according to that, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13. <hi>If ye live after the fleſh ye ſhall die, but if ye thro' the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the fleſh, ye ſhall live.</hi> They may think that Sin is diſhonourable and unprofitable; that there is ingratitude, injuſtice and impudence in it: If we conſider ſuch things a thouſand times o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, that will not mortify their corruptions; but it is God that doth it, and the way where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he doth it, is by <hi>infuſing a principle of Grace</hi> into the heart. The infuſion of Grace and the mortification of corruption<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are at the ſame inſtant. Mortification of corruption dont fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low after the infuſion of Grace, but is contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary with it. 2. Cor. 5 17. <hi>Old things are paſſed away, and all things are made new.</hi> Theſe two works are done by the ſame operation. God does not put forth two operations, one to make men gracious, the other to kill their corruptions; but the ſame divine act has theſe two effects, to give new inclinations, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the old. God reſtrains the corruptions of men before he puts Grace into them; and takes away much of thoſe evil habits that men had contracted by a courſe of Sin: He doth that by terrifying the Conſcience, giving ſome common encouragements, and by human re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints, and education; but it is by giving Grace to the Soul that corruption is morttify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Corruption is not mortifyed before the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of Grace, neither is the infuſion of Grace before mortification; but they are wrought at once by the ſame act.</p>

                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. The ſame light that works gracious inclinations, doth deſtroy Sin. The way wherein God communicates Grace is by teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men how glorious he is. He lets in <hi>Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel light,</hi> and ſo works gracious inclinations. Men ſee the <hi>reaſon</hi> why they ſhould love God, truſt in Chriſt, and be humble, and this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines the heart that way. God deals with men as with rational creatures; he diſcovers to them the <hi>Reaſon and Foundation</hi> of holy car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, and ſo diſpoſes the heart to them, 2 Cor. 4.18. <hi>We all beholding as in a glaſs the glory of the Lord, are changed into the ſame image.</hi> He makes them know himſelf, and ſo makes them ſincere. Pſal. 36.10. <hi>Stretch forth thy loving kindneſs to them that know thee, and thy righteouſneſs to the upright in heart.</hi> He teaches them, and ſo they come to Chriſt, Joh. 6.45. <hi>Every one that hath heard and learned of the Father cometh unto me.</hi> And it is the ſame way that he mortifies their corruption. This light weans them from the world, kills the pride of their hearts. This light makes them hate the ways of Sin. At the ſame time that they ſee reaſon to exalt God, they ſee the evil of pride. When they ſee reaſon to love God, they ſee that there is no reaſon to dote on the world, Act. 26.18. <hi>To turn them from dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to light and from the power of Satan to-God.</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 2 Natural Corruption is nothing elſe but the privation of Holineſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Contracted habits have ſomething poſitive in them, but natural corruption is only the privation of
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:011873_0029_0F87419713F5BDC0"/>
Holineſs. When man loſt the image of God, there was nothing poſitive put into him. The condition of man by nature is, that he is deſtitute of Love, and Faith, and Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and thence he runs into evil, and is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to love the world, and ſet up himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove God. This ſhews that the very giving of Grace mortifies corruption. When the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> is given, the privation is expell'd. When light comes into the eye, the darkneſs is gone: When ſight is given to men, blindneſs is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away: When life came into <hi>Lazarus,</hi> he was delivered from death: When love to God is put into the Soul, inordinate ſelf-love is mortifyed. When Faith is wrought in the heart, Unbelief is mortifyed. When men are made humble, their Price is mortifyed. When God conveys ſpiritual Life to men, without any more to do, they are delivered from ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Death: Rom 8.2 <hi>The law of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of life in Chriſt Jeſus, has made me free from the law of ſin and of death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 3 Holineſs doth imply in it a hatred to Sin. Where Sin is hated it is mortifyed; that was <hi>Paul</hi>'s ſpirit, Rom 7.15. <hi>What I hate, that I do.</hi> When Sin is hated, then the ſtrength of it is abated. The ſtrength of Sin lies in men's love to Sin. Wherever Sin is hated as the greateſt evil it is mortifyed: As it loſeth the love of men, ſo it loſeth it's ſtrength. That was a ſign of <hi>David</hi>'s morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, that he hated vain thoughts, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.113. And wherever there is Holineſs
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:011873_0030_0F8741972ABFE4B8"/>
there is an hatred of Sin. If the heart of a man be inclined to believe, he hates unbelief; unbelief is contrary to that inclination: So, if a man have an inclination to love God as his chief Good, he will hate the workings of pride and worldlineſs, the ſetting up any other thing above God. Sinful inclinations are enemies to Holineſs, and holy inclinations are enemies to Sin. They have a tendency in themſelves to deſtroy one another: Gal. 5.17. <hi>The fleſh luſteth againſt the ſpirit, and the ſpirit againſt the fleſh, and theſe are contrary the one to the other.</hi> There is a warfare between Grace and Corruption, they ſeek the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of one another.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. The more degrees of Grace men get, the more Sin is mortifyed. The more men put on the new man, the more they put off the old man. Holineſs and Mortification hold an exact proportion one to the other. As one Scale riſes, the other falls: As water comes into the veſſel, the air is expelled: The more light is in the air, the leſs darkneſs: 2 Sam. 3 1. <hi>David waxed ſtronger and ſtronger, and the houſe of Soul waxed weaker and weaker,</hi> As Grace flouriſhes, ſo Sin dies. Whenever there is any addition to Grace, there is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable ſubſtraction from Corruption. The more humility, the leſs pride. They that are very humble, are not very proud. They that have a great deal of Faith, have but little Unbelief. And when Grace ſhall be perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, no Sin ſhall remain; the perfection of
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:011873_0031_0F874197E48CBC38"/>
Grace doth expel all Sin. Where there is perfect light, there is no darkneſs. 1 Joh. 15. <hi>God is light, and in him is no darkneſs at all.</hi> Where there is perfect beauty, there is no ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh. Eph. 5.27. <hi>Not having ſpot or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing; but that it ſhould be holy with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blemiſh.</hi>

               <p>GOD is the Author of Converſion: Men muſt be born of the ſpirit.

And the way wherein he doth it, is by <hi>letting ſpiritual light into the Soul;</hi> by irradiating the mind, letting in beams of light into the heart. In that way God increaſeth Grace, and in that way he giveth Grace at firſt. While men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in darkneſs, they do remain in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of darkneſs; but by inlightning the mind he changes the heart.

               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. Man's being capable to know God makes him capable to be holy. If man had not a reaſonable Soul capable to know God, he could not be capable to be holy. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior creatures though they have ſome know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and reſemblances of reaſon, yet are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of the knowledge of God, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly are uncapable of holineſs, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly are not under the direction of the <hi>Moral Law.</hi> But if God makes man capable to know him, he thereby makes him capable of holineſs; the reaſon of it is, becauſe if he actually <hi>knows God,</hi> he <hi>will be holy:</hi> The know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God and holineſs go together: Pſal. 36.10. <hi>Stretch forth thy loving kindneſs to them that know thee, and thy righteouſneſs to the upright in heart.</hi> God is ſo glorious, that if he be known, the heart will be drawn to him. Pſal. 36.7. <hi>Becauſe of the excellency of thy loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the children of men put their truſt in the ſhadow of thy wings.</hi> The excellency of God draws the heart irreſiſtably to him, when it is know. The knowledge of God is inſeparable from holineſs. All that know him are holy: The very capacity to know God, makes men capable to be holy, to love him and truſt in him. The Angelical nature is capable to know
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:011873_0033_0F8741995E636758"/>
God, and ſo capable of holineſs, and ſo the human Nature: And when men are renewed in the image of God, they are renewed in knowledge; Col. 3.10. <hi>And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge, after tho image of him that created him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ar.</hi> 2. Until men <hi>know God,</hi> no <hi>terror, or puniſhment, or perſwaſion, will make them holy.</hi> Many men have very ſtrong perſwaſions ſet before them to induce than to be holy; the equity of it, the profit, the pleaſure, and the honour of it, are amply demonſtrated; ſuch arguments are as wont mightily to prevail in other caſes; yet the men are not gained, they make their hearts as adaments, and they will not be gained until they have the knowledge of God. If the perſwaſions do beget ſome deſires, if they do beget ſome reſolutions, if they prevail on men to make ſome attempts; yet they do not make men holy: Men muſt be taught of God elſe they will not be holy. Jon. 6 45. <hi>Every man that hath heard and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Father, cometh unto me.</hi> Terrors of conſcience will not make men holy. Men cannot be frighted into the love of God. Men may be ſcared it to <hi>Reformation,</hi> but not into <hi>Converſion.</hi> Trembling may take hold on hypocrites, yet they remain hypocrites. <hi>Cain</hi>'s terrors did not made him holy. <hi>Judas</hi> his terrors did not make him holy. Fear will make men hypocrites, but not Saints, Pſal. 78.34, <hi>When he ſlew them, then they ſought him,</hi> but, v. 36. <hi>They flattered him with their mouth, and
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:011873_0034_0F87419A2CD35F50"/>
lied unto him with their tongue.</hi> The <hi>fear of Hell</hi> will not make men hate ſin more than hell: Puniſhments will not make men holy. Hell-fire will not purge away men's droſs. One glimpſe of the glory of God, will do more than all the puniſhments in the world to make men holy. Cant. 1.4. <hi>Draw me and I will run after thee</hi>

The <hi>perfect knowledge of God is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with perfect Holineſs.</hi> Holineſs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways hold a proportion to men's knowledge of the glory of God. They that have not the knowledge of the glory of God, have not one ſpark of holineſs; if they pretend to it, yet they are utterly deſtitute of it. Men may ſet up <hi>Altars</hi> to the <hi>unknown God,</hi> but they never love an unknown God. And when there is the beginning of the knowledge of God, there is the beginning of holineſs; and as the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge God increaſes, ſo holineſs increaſes; they keep pace one with the other, they are in exact proportion one to the other. Every beam of light has heat in it, 2 Pet. 1.2 <hi>Grace and peace be multiplied unto you, through the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, and of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And when the knowledge of God is perfect, holineſs will be perfect. We can never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend God, nor ſearch out the almighty to perfection; yet the grace of Knowledge may be perfect: And when men do enjoy the light of Glory, they will be as holy as they deſire to be. Light and life will be perfected toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>Heaven</hi> is a place of <hi>perfect Light,</hi> and

               <p>
                  <hi>Arg</hi> 4. When <hi>men do ſee the glory of God, they would act againſt their nature if they ſhould not be holy.</hi> Every creature will act it's nature, and ſo will Man. When men know things to be true, they will aſſent to them. When men ſee God, they know his teſtimony to be true: When men know the excellency of God, they muſt chuſe him. The glory of God is ſuch, that it captivates the heart; where it is ſeen it has a magnetic power; it irreſiſtably conquers the will. There is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of loving God, when he is ſeen; if men ſhould not, they would act againſt their nature. There is no power in the will to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt holineſs when the glory of God is ſeen. It is impoſſible in nature that men ſhould know God and not be holy. The will always fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the laſt dictates of the Underſtanding. The Underſtanding is the guide of the will; the will always follows its direction. Men would offer violence to their nature, if they ſhould do otherwiſe. The <hi>excellency of God</hi> is a <hi>ſufficient reaſon for men's loving and ſerving him:</hi> Becauſe God has ſuch excellency, it is man's duty to love and ſerve him; and it is their happineſs to love and ſerve him: And when they know the excellency of God it will be their practice.

               <p>MAN in his natural eſtate is repreſented in Scripture at utterly depraved, <hi>dead in treſpaſſes and ſins.</hi> He is blind, and in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And it may be thought that he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capble to ſee the gloriouſneſs of God, until there be firſt an habitual change in his unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; but if we examine the word of God, we may find plain intimations, that this light doth precede the habitual change. Joh. 5.25. <hi>The time is coming, and now is, when the dead ſhall hear the voice of the Son of God; and they that bear ſhall live.</hi> Hearing the voice of Chriſt is antecedent to their living: It is in that way that life enters into them, 2 Cor. 3.18. <hi>We all with open face beholding as is a glaſs the glory of the Lord, are changed into the ſame image:</hi> Before they are changed into God's image, they do behold his Glory. This makes it evident, that men are capable to behold the glory of the Lord before the habitual change. God diſcovers his Glory, and that inclines him to aſſent and draws forth an actual aſſent. Which may be further conſidered by theſe conſiderations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. Man <hi>in his corrupted eſtate has his natural faculty of underſtanding.</hi> He hath the faculty of underſtanding in his corrupted eſtate, and in his renewed eſtate. A godly man has not two faculties of underſtanding
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:011873_0037_0F87419EA06365A8"/>
one whereby he knows God, and another whereby he knows other things; but by the faculty of underſtanding he knows God and Chriſt, and the truth of promiſes, and likewiſe rules of art, the motions of the Sun and Moon, and the natural cauſes. Where there is a natural underſtanding, endued with literal knowledge, and aſſiſted by the Spirit of God, there is a power to know God: In that caſe there is nothing wanting in order to the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual knowledge of God. Men need no other faculty in order to ſpiritual knowledge provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it be <hi>duly enlightned.</hi> To imagine that there needs any other Power, is to fancy the need of another faculty, or a faculty in a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, in order to the knowledge of God; as if we underſtood the creature by one faculty, and God by another. A faculty of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding inſtructed and aſſiſted by the Spirit, muſt needs enable men to know God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg</hi> 2. An <hi>babitual change in the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, does not give men a power to know God.</hi> It muſt be acknowledged, that there is ſuch a thing as an habitual change in the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Godly men have a ſanctified mind; they have a principle put into them, that leads them to judge aright concerning God and Chriſt; and a principle of Faith to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the teſtimony of God: But habits does not give men a power to know. We muſt carefully diſtinguiſh between a faculty or power and an habit: An habit is only an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to do a thing; an habit fits a man
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:011873_0038_0F87419F8B2EBF48"/>
to do a thing with more facility and dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Habits are not faculties; they do not enable men to do what they could not do before; they diſpoſe and incline the heart that way. A natural man has a prevailing inclination to judge wrong concerning God, and an oppoſition to believe right concerning God; his mind is averſe to the reception of thoſe doctrines that the Scripture teaches con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning God; but yet he has the faculty or power to judge aright when he is aſſiſted. And the godly man having received habitual light, has an inclination to judge aright of God and ſpiritual things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ar.</hi> 3. This <hi>actual light which men receive from the Spirit of God, doth beget habitual light.</hi> It is in this caſe as in many others; a man that has had experience of the ſweetneſs of honey, is inclined thereby to judge ſo from time to time: He that has had experience of the ſaltneſs of the ſea, is inclined to judge it ſo: And he that has underſtood the gloriouſneſs of God, is prepared and diſpoſed thereby to judge ſo from time to time. This diſcovery leaves ſuch a ſenſe and impreſſion on the heart, as inclines it for ever to judge ſo concerning God: They never forget what they have ſeen, and ſo are inclined to judge after the like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. And the more frequently they have emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent diſcoveries of God and Chriſt, the more ſtrongly they are inclined to judge ſo, and to reject the contrary temptations. Repeated diſcoveries ſtrengthen the habit, and diſpoſe
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:011873_0039_0F8741A021C946D8"/>
them with more readineſs to judge ſo. The inclination to judge aright of God is a ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al inclination, flowing from a conviction of the gloriouſneſs of God.</p>

               <p>MAny men that have had experience of this ſpiritual light, are able to give a very poor account how it doth at firſt work in their heart The underſtanding is ſo quick in it's operations, that the ſteps of thoſe diſcoveries that are made to the ſoul, does not fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their obſervation. They may be able to give ſome account what they ſaw, that they ſaw ſuch and ſuch encouragement to come to Chriſt; but they do not know how they come to be convinced of it. But we have abundant cauſe to conclude, that the firſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery that is made is of the <hi>gloriouſneſs of God.</hi> The knowledge of God is the foundation of all religion: Pſal. 36.10. <hi>Stretch forth thy loving kindneſs to them that know thee, and thy righteouſneſs to the upright in heart.</hi> Joh. 1.3. <hi>This is eternal life to know thee, the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Two things will make this evident.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. The <hi>ſpiritual knowledge of God doth not depend upon the ſpiritual knowledge of other things.</hi> There needs no antecedent diſcoveries in order to the ſpiritual knowledge of God.
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:011873_0040_0F8741A0E7775520"/>
When God opens the eyes of men, and gives ſpiritual underſtanding to them, there are two ways wherein they may ſee the glory of God.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By <hi>reaſoning from the works of Creation and common Providence.</hi> There is a great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the glory of God in making the world, Pſal. 19.1. <hi>The heavens declare the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God. and the firmament ſheweth his handy works.</hi> Iſai. 6.3. <hi>The whole earth is full of his glory.</hi> And when they behold the work of God, they may readily ſee, if their eyes be opened, that theſe things were made by a God of infinite power, and wiſdom, and goodneſs. There is a ſelf-evidencing light in theſe works of God, ſhewing that they are the effects of a God of infinite glory. The world is a glaſs, reflecting the glory of God; and when men's eyes are opened, they may plainly ſee it. So in other of the great works of God; the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral deluge, the burning of Sodom, the delivery of Iſrael out of Egypt, maintaining them in the wilderneſs, &amp;c. God often puts us in mind, that he has <hi>created the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth.</hi> That is an abundant manifeſtation to them that underſtand, that he is a glorious God, worthy to be believed, and loved, and obeyed. When men's eyes are opened, they ſee the force of the argument, they are at once ſatisfyed about the glorious properties of God. Reaſon enlightned by the Spirit of God, teaches men convincingly what God is.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="38" facs="unknown:011873_0041_0F8741A19CBF2180"/>2 <hi>By reaſoning from the word of God.</hi> The word of God has a ſelf evidencing light in it; it ſhews that it doth proceed from a God of infinite Glory. The holineſs of the law, and the wiſdom and grace that appears in the goſpel, are in themſelves very evidential of God's glory. And though multitudes of men that read and hear the word, are not convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of the divine authority of it; yet when God lets in beams of ſpiritual light, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it as the <hi>word of God;</hi> they are convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced that it proceeds from a God of infinite glory. When God ſhines into the heart, they ſee the <hi>glory of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.6. <hi>They do with open face behold as in a glaſs the glory of the Lord,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.18. They ſay, ſuch things would never <hi>have ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into the heart of man,</hi> if God had not revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2 9.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. The <hi>ſpiritual knowledge of other things, doth depend on the ſpiritual knowledge of God.</hi> The knowledge of particular revealed truths, doth depend upon the knowledge of God. Until they know God they can have no Faith; Faith depends upon the knowledge of God. Until they know God, they do not ſee a foundation for Faith, nor know any thing that is to be known only by Faith. Until men know God, they cannot know the <hi>ſaving benefit of the blood of Chriſt,</hi> or the <hi>Divinity of Chriſt,</hi> or the <hi>certainty of the Promiſes,</hi> or the <hi>happineſs of heaven;</hi> for all <hi>Faith</hi> doth depend upon our aſſurance of the <hi>faithfulneſs of God:</hi>
                  <pb n="39" facs="unknown:011873_0042_0F8741A262C371D0"/>
But when once we are convinced of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of God, we are prepared to believe whatever God has revealed. If God reveals things that are beyond natural reaſon to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, as the doctrine of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> and of the <hi>Incarnation of the Son of God;</hi> ſuch men will believe it. If God reveals things that are very contrary to carnal reaſon; As, that God is angry with carnal men, though they live in great proſperity; and that he delights in god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men, and will ſave them, though they are low, and in great affliction. If he promiſes pardon to them that have been very ſinful, if they accept of the offers of the goſpel, ſuch men will believe it. The conſideration of the everlaſting faithfulneſs of God, will over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come all objections. If men were at never ſo much loſs about the truth of them before, and rejected them as falſe, or ſuſpended their belief, looking on them as uncertain; yet as ſoon as ever he underſtands the faithfulneſs of God, the darkneſs of his mind is removed; he ſees a foundation for Faith, and ſo thoſe things which were myſteries to him before, are now heartily acknowledged. Heb. 11.7. <hi>Faith is the evidence of things not ſeen.</hi>

<pb n="40" facs="unknown:011873_0043_0F8741A31C1721B0"/>
Yea, men that are in great diſtreſs for the want of forgiveneſs, do reject the offer. They would fain be pardoned, and pray to God to accept them upon Chriſt's account; but they dare not accept of the offer of mercy. They have all manner of perſwaſions but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main unperſuadable; they reſolve to do it, they may attempt it, but do not effect it: It ſeems a dangerous thing, and a method to caſt away their own ſouls; they think God would be very angry with them for obtruding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon him: It ſeems to them a deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate adventure. But when they are <hi>convinced of the gloriouſneſs of God, they ſee encouragement enough to come to Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They ſee three things eſpecially that are encouragement to them,</p>
               <p n="1">1 The <hi>free Grace of God.</hi> They were wont to diſcourage themſelves becauſe of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs; it ſeemed to them as if the heart of God was turn'd againſt them, and they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured in that, that they might get ſomething to incline the heart of God towards them, that might appeaſe his anger, and attract his love: But when they have the knowledge of God, they are ſatisfied in the freeneſs of his grace; they ſee that there is enough in his own heart to move him, that there is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite ocean of grace there, that his thoughts are not as our thoughts, that there is an <hi>height and depth, and length and breadth in the love of God</hi> that it <hi>paſſeth knowledge;</hi> that he can pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty his greateſt enemies, and love thoſe that
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:011873_0044_0F8741A5F8AD23D8"/>
have nothing to commend them. They ſay he is God and not man: His mercy does not depend on any excellency in them: His grace is ſovereign grace, and he has <hi>mercy on whom he will have mercy.</hi> Though it be a great thing to be pardoned and ſaved, yet it is not too much for him to do. There is no need of any thing to move his heart; he can do it becauſe it pleaſeth him. They were wont formerly to limit the mercy of God, and to think it would have been ſufficient, if they had not been ſuch great ſinners, or if they were more broken for their ſins; but now they are convinced, that if they were worſe than they are, that the mercy of God it ſufficient for them; that there is an infiniteneſs in the grace of God; and after they have reckoned up many things that grace can do, that there is infinitely more than they can think of No badneſs doth diſcourage them, no want of goodneſs doth diſcourage them. There is no more limiting of the grace than of the power of God. There is mercy enough to ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their unworthineſs. Pſal 36 7. <hi>How excellent is thy loving kindneſs O God, therefore the children of men put their truſt under the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of thy wings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 The <hi>preciouſneſs and ſufficiency of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs.</hi> The threatnings of the law were a terror to them like a flaming ſword; they ſaw juſtice binding them over to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation; they thought that every jot and tittle of the law muſt be fulfilled; as <hi>Mat.</hi>
                  <pb n="42" facs="unknown:011873_0045_0F8741A75A9A7878"/>
5.18. That the law cannot be abrogated not moderated; that all the challenges of it muſt be anſwered. And when they heard of the ſatisfaction of Chriſt, they did not ſatisfy their conſciences. They were told that <hi>Chriſt Jeſus was the Son of God;</hi> that God has appointed him to be a mediator; that his ſacrifice was acceptable to God: And they looked upon thoſe things very probable; but were not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of them: But when they ſee God, and believe his word, Chriſt is <hi>precious to them,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.7. They look on him juſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the report of the goſpel. They ſay as <hi>Peter,</hi> Mat. 16. <hi>He is Chriſt the Son of the living God.</hi> They are ſenſible that he has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed us from the curſe, having born the curſe for us; that he has made <hi>reconciliation for iniquity, made an end of ſin, and brought in an everlaſting righteouſneſs;</hi> that in the Lord Jeſus we have <hi>righteouſneſs and ſtrength.</hi> They are ſatisfied that he hath made a new and living way to the holy place: They ſee now that the guilt of ſin was tranſlated to Chriſt; that the law has been executed on him; that his blood has quenched the fire of God's wrath; that an atonement is made, and God recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled. That Chriſt is at the right hand of God, <hi>exalted to be a Prince and a Saviour;</hi> that it is a ſafe thing to appear before God in his Righteouſneſs, there is no need of any additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to it. They ſay there are unſearchable ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in Chriſt. Before, they did not know but the doctrine concerning Chriſt was a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion,
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:011873_0046_0F8741A8434BA0C0"/>
a <hi>cunningly deviſed fable;</hi> but now they are ſure it is otherwiſe. Joh. 6.69 <hi>We be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and are ſure, that thou art that Chriſt, the Son of the living God.</hi> Joh 17.8. <hi>They have known ſurely that I came out from thee, and they believed that thou did ſend me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3 The <hi>faithfulneſs of the offers of the Goſpel.</hi> God in the goſpel makes many gracious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes. That <hi>ſuch as come to Jeſus Chriſt he will in no wiſe caſt off,</hi> Joh. 6 37 That <hi>thoſe that believe in Chriſt ſhall not periſh, but ſhall have everlaſting life,</hi> Joh. 3 16. That all that <hi>believe in Chriſt ſhall have remiſſion of Sins,</hi> Act. 10.43. And this light gives aſſurance of the truth of the promiſes: Before this light was given they ſeemed incredible. Sometimes they doubted of them becauſe of the greatneſs of them, ſometimes becauſe God was angry with them, ſometimes becauſe there were but few that were ſaved. But when this light comes into the ſoul, they ſee the certainty of theſe promiſes; they come with a divine authority upon the heart. 1 Theſ. 2.13. <hi>Ye received the word, not as the word of man, but as it was indeed the word of God</hi> The faithfulneſs of God convinces them that the promiſe is ſure. They receive it as infallible: They do not build their perſwaſions upon the opinions of men, but upon the word of God. Many men diſpute with a great deal of confidence for the principles of religion, againſt <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> but it is upon that ſuppoſition, that the Scripture is the word of God; and that they
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:011873_0047_0F8741A8613C9B20"/>
take for granted, but do not know it. But when this ſpiritual light is let into them, they are aſſured of the <hi>divine authority of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> they are aſſured it is the word of God, and know that God is faithful. They ſay as <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 12.6. <hi>The words of the Lord are pure words, as Silver tryed in a furnace of Earth, purified ſeven times.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. XI.</hi> No man is able to give a full Account of all that he ſaw when this light did firſt ſhine into his heart.</head>
               <p>THERE is a great deal of difference in this light as to the clearneſs of it; all that have this ſpiritual light do not ſee things with the like clearneſs; the diſcoveries are more dim in ſome than in others. There are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of natural light, ſo of the light of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſo of ſpiritual light. This light is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times called <hi>wiſdom.</hi> Sometimes becauſe of the clearneſs of it, it is called <hi>revelation.</hi> Eph. 1.17. <hi>That God would give unto you the Spirit of wiſdom and revelation in the knowledge of him.</hi> But whether the ſight be clear or more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, they do all ſee the truth of the goſpel; that Chriſt is a ſufficient foundation for them to build upon, that it is ſafe to caſt themſelves upon him; that Chriſt is precious, and that the goſpel is of divine authority. But no man is able to give an exact account of all that he did ſee at that time. The thing was done in
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:011873_0048_0F8741A932151350"/>
the twinkling of an eye; and though men ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver forget it, yet they cannot call to mind all that they were convinced of; no, not if they were to give an account the next hour. Men have not at that time the actual underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all goſpel principles: Indeed they ſaw that that way of Salvation that they had been for many years inſtructed in was true; but they have not the actual underſtanding of them at the very time: Yet they did ſee, and actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally underſtood at the time, a great deal more than they can remember.</p>
               <p>This may appear by theſe things,</p>
               <p n="1">1. From the <hi>ſhortneſs of the time</hi> wherein this diſcovery is made. There is but a very little time between the opening of the eyes, and the hearts cloſing with Chriſt, and the diſcovery is wont to laſt but a little time; and ſo it is impoſſible that he ſhould have a diſtinct re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of every thing that he ſaw. The <hi>Spouſe</hi> gives a very particular deſcription of Chriſt in figurative expreſſions, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. <hi>from v.</hi> 16. <hi>ad fin</hi> And ſo Godly men are able to do from what they find in the word of God; but they can remember but a little account of what they ſaw at that time. If a man caſt up his eyes to heaven, he ſees a multitude of ſtars; but is not able to give a particular account of what he ſaw of the ſeveral ſtars and conſtella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. So, if a man ſhould caſt his eye upon a beautiful Perſon, he is much affected with his beauty; but he can't give a particular account of all his features, the comelineſs of his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:011873_0049_0F8741A9EFEF9370"/>
eyes, cheeks and lips, nor give a deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them. If a man ſhould caſt his eye upon a <hi>Garden</hi> wherein their is a variety of flowers, he may be much affected with it, yet not able to tell particularly what ſorts of flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers he ſaw. Or if he ſhould caſt his eye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a curious piece of <hi>Embroidery,</hi> he may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive immediately that there is much curioſity in it; but he cannot give an account of all the colours and reſemblances that he caſt his eye upon. Thus it is when men's eyes are open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. They ſee the way of ſalvation to be a glorious way, but they cannot tell particularly all that they ſaw; they had but a tranſient ſight, and could not take ſuch diſtinct notice of things, as to lay them up in their memory.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There <hi>is need of the actual knowledge of many goſpel Truths, in order to the firſt cloſing with Chriſt.</hi> They heard of thoſe things of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten before, but they underſtood nothing in a right manner before; but they muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand them in order to their cloſing with Chriſt. They need to underſtand ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the <hi>Greatneſs</hi> of that Salvation that is offered. Men will not accept the offer, except they judge it worthy to be accepted. They need to underſtand, that the <hi>offer is made to them;</hi> the making of ſuch on offer to others is no warrant to them to accept thereof. They need to underſtand, <hi>their ſins may be pardoned;</hi> that the law does not render them uncapable of Pardon. They need to underſtand, that it
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:011873_0050_0F8741AA9ED23A70"/>
is God himſelf that makes the offer in the Goſpel: Nothing, leſs than that can be an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to accept. Men need to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that God has <hi>Mercy</hi> enough to pardon all their Sins, though they have no worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: If they do not underſtand this, they will not dare to accept the offer. They need to underſtand the <hi>Faithfulneſs of God,</hi> elſe they can ſee no ſafety in coming to Chriſt. They need to underſtand the <hi>ſaving Vertue of the blood of Chriſt;</hi> that it is acceptable to God, and ſufficient to purge away Sin. They need to underſtand that Chriſt Jeſus is the <hi>Son of God,</hi> that they may be ſatisfyed in the divine ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his blood' They need to underſtand, that God <hi>made</hi> him a <hi>Mediator,</hi> and <hi>wounded him for our Tranſgreſſions.</hi> They had need to underſtand the ſufficiency of Chriſt to ſanctify them and make them perſevere, and God's ability to fulfil his promiſes. And there is no godly man that can recover the remembrance of it, that at that time he ſaw all theſe things. Some can remember more than others; but none can call to mind all that he ſaw at that time.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Becauſe at that time men's thoughts are ſo fixed up <hi>one or two particular things,</hi> that they are hindered thereby from remembring ſome other things. Experience ſhews, that ſome men at their firſt converſion, have their thoughts more fixed on the conſideration of the <hi>free Mercy of God:</hi> They ſee a depths of compaſſion in the heart of God; that he has
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:011873_0051_0F8741AB5DBC6188"/>
no need of any external motive to draw his heart; that he can overlook all manner of provocations, <hi>has mercy on whom he will, and compaſſion on whom he will have compaſſion,</hi> as Rom. 9.15. Some men at the time had their thoughts more taken up about the <hi>Sacrifice of Chriſt,</hi> how he has born the curſe, bought us with a price, made his Soul an offering for Sin, fully ſatisfyed the Juſtice of God. And ſome others have their thoughts at the time more fixed upon the <hi>Faithfulneſs of God,</hi> that his <hi>words are pure words,</hi> that he is <hi>not as a man that he ſhould lie, nor the Son of man that he ſhould repent;</hi> that his word is a ſure founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to build upon. It is frequently ſo after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. They are led into it ſometime by the conſideration of ſome <hi>Scripture</hi> that comes to mind at that time. Sometimes by having ſpecial temptations juſt before; as if God could not find in his heart to pardon ſuch as they; as if Chriſt's blood would not anſwer for their Sins, &amp;c. And the thoughts being fixed on one encouragement makes others leſs obſerved. If a man takes particular notice of one <hi>Argument</hi> in a diſcourſe, he can give the leſs account of the reſt. If a man takes ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial notice of what concerns himſelf in a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, he will not take ſuch particular notice of what concerns others. If there be a great Shew, one perſon takes more notice of one particular, another of another, and are not able to give to good an account of the other things that they ſaw.</p>

               <p>BEfore God converts men, it is his manner to prepare them for it by a common work of his Spirit, which is called <hi>Preparatory,</hi> which puts men upon it to to be ſenſibly ſeeking after reconciliation. Men are called upon to <hi>ſeek firſt the kingdom of God and his righteouſneſs;</hi> to <hi>labour not for the meat that periſhes, but for that meat that doth endure unto eternal life.</hi> And men are blamed for ſlightly ſeeking, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.24. Many ſeek and are not able to enter. And that was the happineſs of ſome, their hearts were mightily ſet in ſeeking the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.13 Men are labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſome a long while for peace with God before they are converted: They are convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of the vanity of the world, and of the neceſſity of the favour of God and eternal life: They are convinced alſo of the inſufficiency of their own righteouſneſs, ſo as to relinquiſh hopes from that, but when God ſets in ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual light to convert men, that doth diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the ſame that they ſaw under the work of preparation, and that after a better manner than they ſaw them before,</p>

                  <pb n="50" facs="unknown:011873_0053_0F8741AE14834820"/>1 When God gives ſpiritual light and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veals his Grace and the Glory of Chriſt to the Soul, that <hi>diſcovers thoſe things that they ſaw un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the work of preparation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1 That will diſcover the <hi>terribleneſs of Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</hi> One thing that Sinners are ſenſible of under the work of preparation is, that the wrath of God is terrible: And they are wont to cry out as he, <hi>What muſt I do to be ſaved.</hi> Act. 16.30. And as <hi>David, There is no ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in my fleſh becauſe of thine anger, nor any reſt in my bones becauſe of my ſin,</hi> Pſal. 48.3. They ſee they, have expoſed themſelves to the heavy wrath of God, and are liable to damnation, which is intolerable. Iſai. 33.14. <hi>Who can dwell with devouring fire, who can dwell with everlaſting burnings?</hi> And the ſenſe of this is wont to fill them with <hi>Terror;</hi> they are afraid of dying quickly, and they are urged in ſpirit to cry to God, and beg the pardon of their Sins. This ſtirs them up carefully to reform their lives, and leave off all ſinful practices, and to reſiſt temptations. This makes them ſenſible of the vanity of the world. And when goſpel light is let into men, they will ſee the terribleneſs of the wrath of God for Sin. If they did not ſee that, they would not ſee the neceſſity of coming to Chriſt for Salvation; but when they ſee the truth of the Goſpel, they will be convinced of that; for then they will ſee the faithfulneſs of God, and the truth of the threatnings of the law: Then they

will believe the greatneſs of Chriſt's ſufferings, and thereby ſee the terrible wrath of God for Sin. Luk. 23.31. <hi>If theſe things be done in the green tree, what ſhall be done in the dry?</hi> In the ſorrows of Chriſt they will diſcern how intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable the wrath of God is, and what need there is of deliverance from it.</p>
               <p n="2">2 That will diſcover the <hi>vanity and inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of men's own righteouſneſs.</hi> Under the work of preparation they are by degrees led into the underſtanding of their own unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that they can do nothing to pacify the wrath, or merit the favour of God. When ſinners are in diſtreſs of conſcience, they are wont to labor to lay ſome bonds on the juſtice, or faithfulneſs, or mercy of God; and in length of time God is wont to ſhew them that their righteouſneſs dont anſwer the law, ſatisfies for no Sin, cannot draw the heart of God to them; that by their beſt works they are meriting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation; that their hearts are full of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to God; that they have no power to do any good; that they have nothing of their own to depend upon, but ſtand in need of free grace and the righteouſneſs of Chriſt: And when the goſpel light is let into them, that teaches them the emptineſs of their own works. When men ſee the excellency of Chriſt's righteouſneſs, they ſee it is a vain thing for them to think to pacify God them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; they ſhall never be able to get any thing of their own that is comparable to the righteouſneſs of Chriſt: That alone will ſerve

their turn, and they have no need of any other. Phil. 3.7. <hi>What things were gain to me, thoſe I counted loſs for Chriſt.</hi> When men ſee their own hearts under the work of <hi>Humiliation,</hi> they ſee the vanity of their own righteouſneſs; but when they ſee the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, they ſee further into the vanity of it, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Chriſt's righteouſneſs, and count <hi>their own</hi> as <hi>dung</hi> in compariſon with Chriſt's Phil. 3.8. <hi>And count them but dung that I may win Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. They are convinced of theſe things af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a <hi>better manner</hi> than they are under the work of preparation. Under the work of preparation, they are convinced of them by the illuminations of <hi>natural Conſcience.</hi> They ſee there is great danger of damnation, and that damnation is intolerable, and that the world is vain; that their own righteouſneſs cannot draw the heart of God; that it is juſt with God to deſtroy them. And ſome things they are convinced of by <hi>Experience;</hi> as, that they are blind, and under the dominion of their ſins, that they are <hi>dead in treſpaſſes and ſins.</hi> But when ſpiritual light is let into them, they know theſe things after a better manner, then they ſee theſe by faith; they believe the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of God in his word, and this has a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter affect upon the heart. He ſees ſo much of the world, that he hates a worldly ſpirit; he ſees the vanity of a worldly ſpirit, ſo that it is mortified ever after; and the vanity of his own righteouſneſs, and hates a ſelf-righteous ſpirit.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XIII.</hi> The way conſidered, wherein God by this ſpiritual Light doth convert Men, or make them holy.</head>
               <p>WHEN Man is in his corrupt eſtate the <hi>Eſſence</hi> of the ſoul remains intire, and that natural diſpoſition remains in the Will to follow the laſt dictates of the Underſtanding; ſo that when God makes this change in the <hi>Underſtanding,</hi> there is always a proportionable change made in the <hi>Will.</hi> When God makes an Underſtanding he makes a Will, and when he renews the Underſtanding he renews the Will: They are not two things, but one and the ſame ſoul, diverſely denominated according to <hi>two</hi> ſeveral <hi>ways of working,</hi> which are inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably conjoined. When the ſoul has this ſpiritual light, it neceſſarily acts accordingly. Therefore the way to converſion is this,</p>
               <p n="1">I. The ſoul <hi>ſees the reaſon and foundation of ſpiritual carriages.</hi> Holy carriages are very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable; but whatever is preſented before men to perſwade them, nothing will have any effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy on them, until God gives ſpiritual light; for naturally they are blind, they are at a loſs about the reality of thoſe things, tho' they make a continual profeſſion of them: But when God ſhines into their hearts with the light of life, they are convinced of thoſe things that are the foundations of ſuch carriages. They counted them probable before, but now they are evident to them.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="54" facs="unknown:011873_0057_0F8741B223A9BED8"/>1. They ſee the <hi>foundations of faith in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> When the eyes of men are opened they ſee the gracious Nature of God, that he can have mercy on whom he will have mercy, that he can find in his heart to have compaſſion on them, though they he meer creatures and uncapable to be any profit to him, though they cannot recompence him; and though ſinful creatures, whatever be the number and aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of their ſins: they ſee that there is an <hi>excellency</hi> in the <hi>loving kindneſs</hi> of God, Pſ. 36 7.</p>
               <p>They are convinced that none is like to God in Mercy; that he can abundantly par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; that <hi>his ways are not as our ways;</hi> that he is the God of all Grace; that his mercy is unlimited; that his mercy paſſes know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; and ſo their unworthineſs is no ground of diſcouragement. He ſees alſo a ſufficiency in Chriſt, <hi>Chriſt is precious in his eyes.</hi> 1 Pet. 2.7. God has made a new and living way by the blood of Chriſt, what tears would not do, what thouſands of Rams could not effect, that has been done by the <hi>blood of Chriſt;</hi> Chriſt has anſwered all the challenged of the Law, and made reconciliation, bought off our puniſhment, and made a purchaſe of eternal Life, he has fulfilled every jot and tittle of the Law, there be <hi>unſearchable riches in Chriſt,</hi> there is blood enough to cleanſe away all Sin, a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice ſufficient to make atonement, price enough for our redemption, ſo that they may be ſaved without any reflection on the juſtice of God. He alſo ſees the <hi>faithfulneſs of God</hi>
                  <pb n="55" facs="unknown:011873_0058_0F8741B31B7FB7F8"/>
in the offers of the Goſpel. God invites him to come to Jeſus Chriſt, and commands him to believe, and has promiſed to accept of him in a way of coming to Chriſt, Act 10.43. <hi>To him gives all the prophets witneſs that through his name whoſoever believeth in him ſhall have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Sins.</hi> And when men ſee theſe things, they ſee abundant encouragements to come to Chriſt, theſe encouragements remove all difficulties, there is no one objection but is eaſily anſwered, the way is clear and plain, they ſee there can be no danger in relying on Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2 They ſee the <hi>foundation of love.</hi> When their eyes are opened to ſee the <hi>gloriouſneſs of God,</hi> they muſt needs ſee the reaſon why they ſhould love him: for all the attributes of God <hi>are lovely;</hi> his <hi>Grace</hi> is lovely; his <hi>Mercy</hi> is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry endearing, that he has a heart to pardon Sin; and to provide a way of Salvation for Sinners; his <hi>Glory</hi> is renowned upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. Mic. 7.<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>8 <hi>Who is God like unto thee, pardoning iniquity,</hi> &amp;c. God is mightily praiſed in the Church upon that account, that his mercy endured for ever. His <hi>Juſtice</hi> alſo is a lovely excellent property, his name is celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon that account; the church praiſes him upon that conſideration: Rev. 19.2. <hi>That true and righteous are his judgments.</hi> So his <hi>Holineſs</hi> is lovely; the <hi>Seraphims</hi> cry be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, <hi>holy, holy, holy, is the Lord God of Hoſts.</hi> His <hi>Wiſdom</hi> is lovely; that is his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that he <hi>ſearches the heart and tries the reins
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:011873_0059_0F87410D79417498"/>
of the Childen of men.</hi> Jer. 17.10. His <hi>power</hi> is lovely. Pſal. 21.13. <hi>Be thou exalted Lord by thy own Strength, ſo will we ſing and praiſe thy Power.</hi> His <hi>Faithfulneſs</hi> is lovely; that is his commendation, that <hi>his faithfulneſs reacheth unto the clouds.</hi> Pſal. 36.5. that he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers his covenant from generation to genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He is praiſe worthy becauſe of <hi>all his attributes</hi> he therein excels all men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; he deſerves to be loved <hi>with all the heart, and with all the ſoul, and with all the ſtrength.</hi> All his Attributes are Perfections, and we have reaſon to delight in him. He is ſo excellent on the account of them that we have reaſon to make it the buſineſs of our lives to glorify him; we have reaſon to take a complacency in him, and chuſe him for our portion. When men ſee thoſe attributes, they ſee upon what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count he may juſtly challenge their love.</p>
               <p n="3">3 They ſee the <hi>foundation of Humility.</hi> When this ſpiritual light ſhines into Men, and they ſee the gloriouſneſs of God, they underſtand that <hi>all nations to him are as the drop of the buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, and as the duſt of the ballance, they are before him as nothing, and they are leſs than nothing and vanity,</hi> as it is ſaid, Iſai. 49.15, 17. There is abundant reaſon to be thankful to him for the leaſt mercy, and to ſay as <hi>David</hi> that <hi>he hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth himſelf to behold the things that are upon the earth,</hi> as Pſal. 113.6. And that it becomes them to be ſubject to his diſpoſals in all things; to ſacrifice all their intereſts to his glory, and to be obedient to his voice in every thing; to
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:011873_0060_0F8740DBB994E3F8"/>
be abaſed becauſe of their Sins, and lie in the duſt before him, as <hi>Job</hi> did, Job. 42.5, 6: <hi>I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear, but now mine eye ſeeth thee; wherefore I abhor myſelf and repent in duſt and aſhes.</hi> When their eyes are opened to ſee God's glory, they ſee reaſon to lie low before him. Pſal. 8 3.4. When <hi>I conſider the heavens the work of thy fingers, the moon and ſtars that thou haſt ordained; what is man that thou art mindful of him, and the ſon of man that thou viſiteſt him.</hi> When men ſee the gloriouſneſs of God, they ſee it an unreaſonable thing to ſet up their wiſdom againſt the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, and their will againſt the will of God, and their intereſt againſt the glory of God. They ſee an infinite differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between God and them, and that there is all reaſon that they ſhould be humble.</p>
               <p n="2">II. When they <hi>ſee the foundation of holy car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, they do immediately carry holily.</hi> They forthwith come to Chriſt with a ſpirit of love and humility. When he ſees the foundation of gracious carriages, he will carry graciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Now he acts reaſonably in truſting in Chriſt and loving God. While he was in the dark he was unperſwadable; they might as ſoon prevail with a ſtone as with him: But when he ſees that that is the proper motive, that will work upon his heart. When men ſee reaſon to be afraid, they will be afraid, and when they ſee reaſon to hope, they will hope. So, when they ſee reaſon to believe, they will believe, thorough conviction always prevails
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:011873_0061_0F8740DC6CBAED80"/>
on the heart; God carries on his work by <hi>Light.</hi> When ſuitable light is let into the heart, ſinners are ſcared; and when they ſee their own badneſs, they are broken off from their own righteouſneſs; and when they are <hi>turned from darkneſs to light,</hi> they are <hi>turned from the power of Satan to God.</hi> Act. 16.18. When God teaches men, then they come to Chriſt; Joh. 6.45. <hi>Every man that hath heard and learned of the Father cometh unto me.</hi> For,</p>
               <p n="1">1 When they ſee the foundation of holy carriages they are <hi>able to carry holily.</hi> Men cannot come to Chriſt unleſs the Father draw them, Joh. 6.44. But the way whereby he draws them is by <hi>teaching them,</hi> v. 45. And when this light is let into them, they are able. Many ſinners are concerned to get the pardon of ſin; and they reſolve to come to Chriſt, and they ſtrive to come to Chriſt, but they cannot; it ſeems to them a dangerous thing to venture themſelves on Chriſt, and they cannot overcome their fears: They ſet many encouraging conſiderations before them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but they cannot vanquiſh their fears; they dare not for their heart venture upon Chriſt: They are as unable to come as a man that is bound with chains is to come out of priſon. It is a terror to them to continue as they be, yet they dare not caſt themſelves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſt: But when their eyes are opened to ſee the free grace of God and the preciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt, their fears are removed; their fetters are taken off, and now they can come<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="59" facs="unknown:011873_0062_0F8740DD2B9349E8"/>
Yea, they dare not ſtay away from Chriſt, they would not for a world ſtay away from Chriſt: <hi>Satan</hi> with all his artifices cannot perſwade them to neglect Chriſt. They have been in great diſtreſs, and now they ſee the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief that is provided for them; they are under a neceſſity in their own ſpirits to accept the call. In like manner when they ſee the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſneſs of God, they are able to love him. They were before urged in conſcience to do it, and had abundance of arguments ſet before them to induce them to love him; but nothing would prevail upon them, becauſe they were ſtrangers to the lovelineſs of God: But as ſoon as ever their eyes were opened to ſee the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious grace of God in the goſpel, now they can love him. They made a profeſſion before, but now they are ſincere; Pſal. 36.10. <hi>Stretch forth thy loving kindneſs to them that know thee, and thy righteouſneſs to the upright in heart.</hi> The heart is drawn to God, they cannot deny their love to him. Whatever was dear to them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, now God is deareſt to them. And in like manner, now they can indeed abaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, when they ſee the divine excellency of God: They look on themſelves infinitely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior to him, and lay themſelves low before him.</p>
               <p n="2">2 When they ſee the foundation of holy carriages, they <hi>love to carry holily.</hi> There is naturally an enmity in the heart to holy car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages; Rom. 8 7. <hi>The natural mind is enmity to God, is not ſubject to the law of God, neither
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:011873_0063_0F8740DDE1EB5D68"/>
indeed can be.</hi> But this light makes them love holy carriages. When men ſee the preciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt, it mightily ſuits them to come to him; they take a complacency in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Chriſt. Some men force themſelves after a faſhion to venture on Chriſt; but when they ſee the divine authority of the goſpel, they love to come to him, as the hungry, man loves to eat, and the thirſty drink. Act 16, 34. <hi>He rejoiced, believing in God.</hi> He ſees that that makes it pleaſant to him; he ſees that God is worthy of that honour. He is a God of ſuch grace and faithfulneſs, that he is worthy to be truſted in; and he ſees that the honour of a glorious Mediator is due to Chriſt; and he ſees that it is a ſafe thing to come to Chriſt. There is no reſt any where elſe for the ſole of his foot, but Chriſt is a ſure foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, a precious corner ſtone: His heart takes contentment in relying upon him: All the world ſhall not perſwade him to forſake him, and make choice of any other refuge. Iſai. 45.24. <hi>Surely ſhall one ſay, in the Lord have I righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and ſtrength.</hi> So, the man loves to make the glory of God his end; and he loves to abaſe himſelf before God, and look upon himſelf as vanity, and nothing in compariſon of God. The ſight of the excellency of God and Chriſt draws his heart; and he loves theſe holy carriages. There was an antipathy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them in his heart before; but now God and Chriſt are lovely in his eyes, and he has a mind to come to Chriſt, and to honor God,
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:011873_0064_0F8740DE9DB61C10"/>
and he will not be reſtrained; for ſuch carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages are pleaſant to him. The glory of God and Chriſt draws the heart ſweetly and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully, and he rejoiceth therein.</p>
               <p n="3">3 This ſpiritual light <hi>makes the heart ſtand bent that way.</hi> This doth not only draw forth gracious actings, but leaves an Impreſſion and bias upon the heart that way. Beauty draws forth an act of Love, and leaves a diſpoſition to love. This ſight changes the mind and makes men judge otherwiſe of God and Chriſt than they uſed to do, and it changes the heart and inclines it to carry ſuitably. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction is an abiding conviction, and ſo the diſpoſition is abiding. This diſcovery is like the <hi>needles</hi> touching the <hi>loadſtone,</hi> it inclines it towards the <hi>north</hi> When this light is let in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the man he is principled to truſt in Chriſt, to love God, and live in a way of obedience, it prepares his heart to live in ſuch a way. When once he is throughly convinced of the gloriouſneſs of God and Chriſt, he is ſet in that way and it will abide with him as long as he liveth; there is an <hi>impreſſion</hi> left on the heart that will never wear out. 2 Cor. 3.18. <hi>We all with open face beholding as in a glaſs the Glory of the Lord, are changed into the ſame image.</hi> For,</p>
               <p n="1">1 When they do perform thoſe holy carria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, they are <hi>inclined to perform them</hi> It were impoſſible to do them without an inclination to do them. If the heart were not inclined to truſt in Chriſt, they would not truſt in him.
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:011873_0065_0F8740DF62D04EC8"/>
Holy actions are never forced. Men may be under a neceſſity to love God and truſt in Chriſt, but that neceſſity does not ariſe from compulſion but from inclination. Pſal. 110.3. <hi>Thy People ſhall be willing in the day of thy pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</hi> Before the man had averſion to thoſe gracious actions, he was under the diminion of a contrary inclination, but when he doth them, he is inclined to do them; and that <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual inclination</hi> leaves an <hi>habitual inclination</hi> on the heart that way. We indeed commonly ſay that one act does not make a habit; but we mean that one act doth not make a more perfect habit; as <hi>habit</hi> is diſtinguiſhed from <hi>diſpoſition,</hi> which is called <hi>habitus imperfectus.</hi> But one act commonly doth leave ſomething of an inclination that way: one act of love to another perſon or thing diſpoſes the heart to renew that act of love. One act is prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for another of the ſame kind; One act of faith puts the Soul into a believing frame: and one act of humility into an humble frame; he is more inclined to believe again than he was, and the clearer diſcovery he had of God and Chriſt, the more ſtrongly he doth believe, and the greater inclination doth remain in him to believe.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Such men as have this ſpiritual <hi>diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry never do utterly forget it.</hi> It is poſſible for a man to forget the firſt time when he had the diſcovery of God and Chriſt made to him, yet I judge that is not ordinary; but if he doth forget the time, yet he never utterly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:011873_0066_0F8740E01EA9CEC8"/>
the thing, he remembers that he hath ſeen God and Chriſt to be glorious: There be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times when he hath not the actual remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of it, and many times alſo when he has corrupt apprehenſions concerning God and Chriſt, and may be under the prevailings of carnal reaſon and unbelief, yet he never ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turly forgets what he has been convinced of, but doth recover the convictions that the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is true, and Jeſus Chriſt is an all-ſufficient Saviour, and ſo the inclination to holineſs doth abide in his heart. 1 Joh. 2.27. <hi>The anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which ye have received of him abideth in you.</hi> And though he hath not ſuch diſcoveries as he hath had, yet he knows he hath ſeen it and accordingly he hath an inclination ſtill to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry holily, when the glory of God and Chriſt are out of ſight. The man is ſure from what he has ſeen that it is ſo, and that maintains an inclination in him to carry himſelf holily.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XIV.</hi> There is a great difference between Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting Light, and common Illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</head>
               <p>MEN are wont to diſtinguiſh between <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional</hi> conviction and <hi>ſpiritual.</hi> Which diſtinction had need to be carefully underſtood; for man's rational faculty is the ſubject both of common and ſpiritual conviction.

<pb n="64" facs="unknown:011873_0067_0F8740E0E07ED518"/>
God gives common conviction, he works up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on reaſon; and when he gives ſpiritual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, he likewiſe works upon reaſon. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, ſpiritual conviction is rational convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Godly men act underſtandingly and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally, when they judge God to be worthy to be truſted, loved and obeyed; when they judge Chriſt to be the eternal Son of God, and an all-ſufficient Saviour. Yet the <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction</hi> may be allowed if it be thus explained; that <hi>rational conviction</hi> is that which men by their natural reaſon do attain; which they may gain by the force of their natural reaſon, improving the works and word of God; which differs very much from that conviction which men have by the ſaving work of God's Spirit. <hi>Common Illumination</hi> is of <hi>two ſorts;</hi> one is from the more common improvements of natural reaſon, the other from more affecting diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries wrought by a common work of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God. There is a conviction that ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth from the common improvement of natural reaſon. Thus men ſee clearly the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> religion is better than the <hi>Popiſh:</hi> That it muſt needs be a work of wonderful wiſdom and power to make the world, that the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Son of God muſt needs be of great value, that it was great love for God to give his Son to die: And hundreds of things of the like nature.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe rational convictions there are <hi>affecting diſcoveries</hi> of divine truths by the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon work of the ſpirit</hi> which make for a time
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:011873_0068_0F8740E1A01AEEE0"/>
conſiderable impreſſion on the heart. Luk. 14.15 <hi>When one of them that ſat at meat with him heard theſe things, he ſaid unto him, Bleſſed is he that ſhall eat bread in the kingdom of God;</hi> Mat. 13.20. <hi>He that received the ſeed into ſtony places, the ſame is he that heareth the word and anon with joy receiveth it.</hi> 2 Pet. 2.20 <hi>For if after they have eſcaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, they are intangled therein and overcome:</hi> Heb. 1.4, 5.6 <hi>For it is impoſſible for them that were one inlightened, and have taſted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghoſt, and hath taſted the good word of God and the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the world to come, if they fall away, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new them again to repentance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The two ſorts of illumination, are reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances of a <hi>twofold ſpiritual Illumination</hi> that ſaints have. One is by ſanctified reaſon, whereby men are convinced of divine truths. Men underſtand the divine authority of the Scripture, and thereby they are aſſured of the truth of Promiſes and Threatnings: They are aſſured that God made the world, and from thence they are convinced of his eternal Power and Godhead: They know that Jeſus Chriſt is the eternal Son of God, and thereby they know the ſaving vertue of his Blood.</p>
               <p>The other is by ſpecial diſcoveries of divine truths. They are led into <hi>Chriſt's chambers,</hi> as the phraſe is, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.4. God breaks into the heart by divine light, and gives great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries of his faithfulneſs, of his holineſs, his
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:011873_0069_0F8740E32BD70D90"/>
grace, the delight he takes in the ſacrifice of Chriſt, and many other things. 2 Cor. 4.6. <hi>God hath ſhined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God, in the face of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Both theſe ways of conviction ſeem to be intimated, Eph. 1.17. <hi>That God may give unto you, the ſpirit of wiſdom and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation in the knowledge of him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The difference between thoſe convictions that riſe from the improvement of natural rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and that do ariſe from ſpiritual reaſon, lies in theſe two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Natural reaſon <hi>doth not diſcover the Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of divine things.</hi> Sanctified reaſon doth ſee them to be <hi>ſure,</hi> Joh. 6.69. <hi>We believe and are ſure, that thou art Chriſt the Son of the living God.</hi> Joh. 17.8. <hi>They have known that I came from thee, and they have believed that thou haſt ſent me.</hi> Heb. 11.1. <hi>Faith is the evidence of things not ſeen.</hi> 1 Theſ. 2 13. <hi>They received the word not as the word of man, but as it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the word of God.</hi> But natural reaſon doth not diſcover the <hi>Certainty</hi> of divine truths: That can perceive the connection between one divine truth and another, and perceive how one thing follows certainly from another; but it doth not perceive the certainty of any. Carnal mens reaſoning is from ſuppoſition; they reaſon very rationally, but they do not ſee that which is the foundation of their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning to be certain. Carnal men and Godly men do both of them argue from the divine Nature of Chriſt. Both carnal men and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:011873_0070_0F8740E3E1313528"/>
do ſtrongly argue, that if Chriſt be the Son of God, there is a divine vertue in his ſuff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erings; and that it is ſafe relying on him. But here lies the difference; the godly man <hi>knows</hi> that Chriſt is the Son of God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.6. but the carnal man <hi>ſuppoſes</hi> that Chriſt is the Son of God. He ſays the Church believe it, the Old and New Teſtament give an account of it, and there be many things ſaid that make much for the confirmation of it. He diſcovered the ſecret thot's of men, did many miraculous works, roſe from the dead.</p>
               <p>Upon ſuch account he ſuppoſes him to be the Son of God, and judges it a heinous crime for any to deny it; out he doth not know theſe things, for he is ignorant of the divine authority of the word, and dare not venture on Chriſt, for fear it ſhould not be ſo. So it was with the <hi>Jews,</hi> they did not believe <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</hi> Joh. 5.46. Thus they both of them ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue from the <hi>Types</hi> and <hi>Sacraments.</hi> The god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man argues, that there were ſeveral types inſtituted by God, to ſhew the ſaving vertue of the blood of Chriſt; and the ſacraments in the <hi>New-Teſtament</hi> are inſtituted to be a memorial of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.24. The god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man argues from hence, that Chriſt has ſatisfied the juſtice of God; that Chriſt was the lamb ſlain from the foundation of the world, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7. Theſe ſacrifices were on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly types of Chriſt, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.17. And he is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly ſatisfied by theſe inſtitutions, that Chriſt is a glorious Saviour. Another man ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues in like manner, that God would never
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:011873_0071_0F8740E6A8043788"/>
have appointed ſuch Signs to ſignify Chriſt, if he would not have us truſt in him. He has not appointed theſe ſigns to deceive us; God would never teach his people a falſe way of Salvation: But his wound is, that he does not know certainly the divine authority of thoſe inſtitutions; he doth not know but they were the inventions of men. So, they both of them argue ſtrongly from the command to believe, from the promiſes of Salvation in a way of believing, from Chriſt's aſcenſion and ſitting at the right hand of God; but the carnal man is uncertain of thoſe things that are foundations of his reaſoning; he does not know but there is ſome miſtake: He thinks that there is a great probability of the truth of thoſe things, but he has no aſſurance: His principles are ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on an uncertain propoſition; and ſo he <hi>knows nothing as he ought to know.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 Carnal reaſon doth not <hi>receive a right idea of divine things.</hi> Godly men though they have the exerciſe of ſpiritual reaſon, cannot find out the Almighty unto perfection: But yet they do know God and Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.3. They have a true idea of God; they know him to be one of infinite perfection; they know him to be a God of infinite power, grace and faithfulneſs; they are convinced that he is worthy of that love, faith and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion that he calls for; Pſal. 18.3. <hi>I will call upon God who is worthy to be praiſed.</hi> They know that divine honour is due to him; Pſal. 29.2. <hi>Give unto the Lord the glory due unto his
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:011873_0072_0F8740E806748AC8"/>
name.</hi> But carnal men have not a right idea of God: They acknowledge that he is infinite in his perfections, and can give ſome deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his infinite perfections; but they have not a right <hi>Idea</hi> of his glorious nature, are not ſenſible what reverence and glory is due to him; and therefore they are ſaid to be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of him: Joh. 4.8. <hi>He that loveth not, knoweth not God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The difference between thoſe affecting illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations that carnal men have, and thoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries that are given to godly men, lies in theſe two particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The illuminations that carnal men have, are <hi>affecting,</hi> but not <hi>convincing.</hi> They are many times much affected with <hi>Joy;</hi> ſo they ſaid, <hi>What a bleſſedneſs is it!</hi> when <hi>Paul</hi> preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the goſpel unto them, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.15. It works deſires in them, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14, 15. And their hearts upon that occaſion may be mightily weaned from the world, and taken up about heavenly things: They may be mightily tranſported with zeal. The people of the <hi>Jews</hi> were ſo affected with Chriſt, that they were of the mind to <hi>make him a King.</hi> But theſe illuminations does not convince them; the men remain ignorant of God, and Chriſt, and the truth of the goſpel. Theſe flaſhes of light do not diſcover the certainty of divine truths. The people that cry <hi>Hoſanna</hi> to day, cry <hi>crucify him</hi> another time; and that was a ſign that they did not know him; <hi>for had they known, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.8. Many are greatly affected in the hearing of ſermons, that do not firmly
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:011873_0073_0F8740E877D1EEA8"/>
believe what they hear: Act. 25.48. <hi>When the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the word of the Lord; and as many as was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to eternal life believed.</hi> They were ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally much affected, but it was only a <hi>ſelect number</hi> that be loved. <hi>Stony ground hearers</hi> are much affected, but not convinced. Men are often affected with ſuch things as they look upon as probable; but ſpecial diſcoveries that God makes to Saints, are very affecting and <hi>convincing.</hi> Godly men muſt needs be affected with thoſe diſcoveries, for they are wondrous in their eyes: Pſal. 119.18. <hi>Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold the wondrous things in thy law.</hi> Sometimes the <hi>love of God</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>ſhed abroad in their hearts;</hi> that implies great affection, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.5. Divine truths are of a very affecting nature; They will ſtir up joy, and ſorrow, and deſires, and zeal; but theſe diſcoveries do not affect them only, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them: They ſee the glory of God; Pſal. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>3.2. <hi>To ſee thy power and glory, ſo as I have ſeen thee in the ſanctuary.</hi> They know the love of Chriſt that paſſeth knowledge, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.19. When they behold the glory of God, they are convinced of the glory of God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.18. When God ſhines into their hearts, he gives the light of the knowledge of the glory of God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. When men ſee the ſun, they know it is the ſun; and when they ſee the grace and faithfulneſs of God, they know he is ſuch an one; they do not only ſee the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſneſs of mercy, and holineſs, and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:011873_0074_0F8740E92EDDECC0"/>
but that God is gracious, and holy, and faithful.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The illuminations of carnal men <hi>does not draw forth any gracious Exerciſes.</hi> The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon diſcoveries that are given to carnal men, have a conſiderable effect upon them; beſides the ſtirring up of affections ſpoken of before, they have an effect upon the converſation; they many times make men to <hi>reform</hi> their lives, and caſt of ſinful practices: 2 Pet. 2.20. <hi>They eſcape the pollutions of the World through the knowledge of Chriſt.</hi> Sometimes they encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage men in ſeeking the pardon of their ſins. They may have ſuch a diſcovery of the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of heaven, of the graciouſneſs of God, and of the mercy of God in providing a way of Salvation, as may greatly encourage them to continue ſeeking his favour. They may likewiſe have that effect to make men pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous. Men may from thence conclude their own eſtate good: They may take encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements for aſſurances of the favour of God: May take occaſion alſo from them to get a falſe faith. If they have ſome diſcoveries of a readineſs in God to pardon ſinners, they may take encouragement to think, that men ſo qualified as they, that are reformed and ſorry for their ſins, may be bold to venture on Chriſt: But thoſe ſpiritual diſcoveries that God makes, do always draw forth the exerciſe of grace: Cant. 1.4 <hi>The King hath brought me to his chambers, we will be glad and delight in thee; the upright love thee.</hi> When God breaks
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:011873_0075_0F8740E9E639E380"/>
into the heart by light, the heart is drawn forth in love, and faith, and repentance. Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is reciprocal. When God draws nigh to his People, that mightily ſtirs up a ſpirit of holineſs; it doth not only ſtrengthen aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, but it ſtirs up all grace: Job. 42.5, 6. <hi>Now mine eye ſeeth thee, wherefore I abhor myſelf, and repent in duſt and aſhes.</hi> Eph. 3.19. <hi>And to know the love of Chriſt that poſſeth knowledge; that ye might be filled with all the fulneſs of God.</hi> This gives great increaſe to grace. 2 Pet. 1.2. <hi>Grace and peace be multiplied unto you, through the knowledge of God and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>

               <p>MEN may have knowledge of their own Converſion. The knowledge that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men have of it is uncertain; becauſe no man can look into the heart of another, and ſee the workings of grace there: Yet men may know that they are godly. Some ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly think that they have grace; but that which is not, cannot be known: Things that are not, are called, <hi>things that do not appear,</hi> Heb. 11.3. <hi>That which is wanting cannot be number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> Eccl. 1.15. All converted men do not know that they are converted. Though grace be viſible, yet many times it is not ſeen. Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things are not always ſeen; ſometimes becauſe it is night, ſometimes becauſe they are covered. It is the <hi>Calamity,</hi> and many times
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:011873_0076_0F8740EB490DEEA0"/>
the <hi>Iniquity</hi> of godly men, that they are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of their converſion. They do know that they have corruptions in them, and they may know that they have grace in them. This is very evident, becauſe many godly men have known their good eſtate. If this knowledge had never been attained, it might more reaſonably be queſtioned, whether it were at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable. <hi>Job</hi> was abundantly ſatisfied; Job 10.7. <hi>Thou knoweſt that I am not wicked:</hi> And he was not miſtaken, <hi>Job.</hi> 1.1. So <hi>David</hi> knew it; Pſal. 17.15. <hi>As for me, I ſhall behold his face in righteouſneſs.</hi> So <hi>Paul;</hi> 2 Tim. 4 7. <hi>I have fought the good fight, I have finiſhed my courſe, I have kept the faith.</hi> v. 8. <hi>Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteouſneſs.</hi> And we do not know of one godly man in the <hi>Scripture</hi> that was under darkneſs about his ſincerity. There be ſome Scriptures brought to prove the contrary, eſpecially ſome paſſages of <hi>Pſal,</hi> 88 But that <hi>Pſalm</hi> repreſents to us not the particular caſe of <hi>Haman,</hi> but of the <hi>Church of Iſrael</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Further, it appears that converſion may be known, becauſe we are directed to <hi>examine our ſelves</hi> in order to it; 2 Cor. 13 5, <hi>examine your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves whether you be in the faith, prove your own ſelves; know you not that Jeſus Chriſt is in you except ye be reprobates.</hi> 2 Pet. 1.10. <hi>Give diligence to make your calling and election ſure,</hi> And to what purpoſe ſhould we be adviſed to do a thing that is not doable? God does not adviſe us to impoſſibilities. All the command of God are poſſible to be fulfilled; if not perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:011873_0077_0F8740EBC9CD1050"/>
yet they may be fulfilled: Phil. 4.13. <hi>I can do all things through Chriſt, who ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall only add that conſideration<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that God makes many comfortable <hi>Promiſes</hi> to them that have grace; <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.7. 1 <hi>Jam.</hi> 12. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 3.10. But if men could not know that they have grace, that would fruſtrate the deſign of theſe promiſes; that would take away the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of their comfort; they would be unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of making application of the promiſes to themſelves. How much happineſs ſoever is made over to them in thoſe promiſes; yet if they could not know their own grace, they muſt be ſtrangers to their own happineſs, and not rejoice in the good that is made over to them.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>How may a godly man know that he has grace?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1 He cannot know it in a way of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing.</hi> We come to the knowledge of many things in a way of reaſoning; arguing from things known, to things that are not known. Thus a man may know his juſtification: He may argue thus, He that hath faith in Chriſt is juſtified; or he that has love to God is juſtified; or he that loves the brethren is paſſed from death to life: Becauſe there is a certain connection between theſe graces and a ſtate of juſtification. Thus a man may know by reaſoning, that he had this and that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular grace: He may argue ſo, If I have the grace of faith, I have the grace of love, or hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility; becauſe there is a concatenation of
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:011873_0078_0F8740EC2DD137B0"/>
graces, and they are inſeperable one from another: But they do not know that they are gracious in this manner; the knowledge of their graces does not come in at that door.</p>
               <p n="1">1 He cannot prove it from any ſuch acts as may proceed from other principles: A moral and religious converſation may proceed from other principles: Such a converſation is an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to other men to be charitable, but it is no demonſtration. The young man in the goſpel walked exactly; Mat. 19.20 <hi>All theſe things have I done from my youth. Paul</hi> was conſciencious; Phil. 3.6. <hi>Touching the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs that is in the Law I was blameleſs:</hi> Such a walk may proceed from fear of hell and hope of heaven. Zeal for God does not prove it; There may be zeal where there is no love: The <hi>Jews</hi> were great enemies to Chriſt, yet very zealous; Rom 10.2. <hi>I bear them record, that they have a zeal for God. Paul</hi> had great zeal before he had any grace. Natural conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence may produce zeal. Great affections does not prove it: The <hi>Jews</hi> cryed, <hi>Hoſanna to the Son of David.</hi> Striving againſt a ſelf-righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſpirit does not prove it: Men may ſtrive againſt it, yet not mortify it. Aſſociating with godly men does not prove it: <hi>Achitophe.</hi> was <hi>David</hi>'s companion, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55.14. Sorrows for the afflictions of the Church, and deſires for the converſion of Souls does not prove it: Theſe things may be found in carnal men, and ſo can be no evidences of grace. Thoſe things that are common to ſaints and hypocrites, does
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:011873_0079_0F8740ECE94A4C18"/>
not prove that a man is a ſaint and no hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite. Men muſt do more than carnal men to prove that they have grace: Mat. 5.10 <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept your righteouſneſs do exceed the righteouſneſs of the ſcribes and Phariſees, you ſhall in no wiſe enter into the kingdom of heaven.</hi> That which is common to hypocrites is no ſign of ſaintſhip. It is a vain thing to make that a plea, that <hi>Publicans</hi> may plead as well as they, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.46, 47. That which may riſe from a corrupt principle, will not prove a gracious principle; that which a beaſt may do, will not prove a thing to be a man.</p>
               <p n="2">2 He cannot prove it from any ſuch acts of Providence as are common to carnal men. Some men have ſmiling providences, and great deliverances. God is very bountiful; and many argue from thence that they are godly; but they do not argue ſtrongly: God may ſmile on men here, and frown on them in the day of Judgment. Jude 5. <hi>The Lord having <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

So, if God do the thing for men that they pray for, that, is no argument: Many prayers are granted that are not accepted. God hears the cry of the <hi>Ravens:</hi> God heard the voice of <hi>Iſhmael.</hi> Sometimes God denies men's prayers becauſe they aſk amiſs, but not always. Men may be inſtruments of a great deal of good in the Church, and in the common wealth; yet be
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:011873_0080_0F8740EE247CE1A0"/>
deſtitute of grace. <hi>Saul</hi> did a great deal of ſervice in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> 2 Sam. 1.24. <hi>Miniſters</hi> may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of the converſion of ſinners and the comfort of ſaints, yet not be godly. There were ſeveral godly in <hi>Iſrael</hi> under the miniſtry of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees;</hi> and the <hi>Ravens</hi> brought meat to <hi>Elijah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 They do not know it by <hi>believing that they are godly.</hi> We know many things <hi>by faith:</hi> Heb. 11.1. <hi>By faith we underſtand that the worlds were made by the power of God Faith is the evidence of things not ſeen,</hi> Heb. 11.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Thus men know the Trinity of Perſons in the Godhead; that Jeſus Chriſt is the Son of God; that he that believes in him will have eternal life; the reſurrection of the dead. And if God ſhould tell a ſaint that he hath Grace, he might know it by believing the word of God. But it is not in this way that godly men do know that they have grace: It is not revealed in the word; and the ſpirit of God doth not teſtify it to particular perſons.</p>
               <p>Some think the Spirit doth teſtify it to ſome; and they ground it on Rom. 8.16. <hi>The Spirit itſelf beareth witneſs with our Spirit, that we are the children of God.</hi> They think the ſpirit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veals it by giving an inward teſtimony to it. And ſome godly men think they have had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of it; but they may eaſily miſtake. When the ſpirit of God doth eminently ſtir up a ſpirit of faith and ſheds abroad the love of God in the heart, it is eaſy to miſtake it for a teſtimony. And that is not the meaning of
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:011873_0081_0F8740EEEED65F28"/>
                  <hi>Paul</hi>'s words. The <hi>Spirit</hi> reveals things to us, by opening our eyes to ſee what is reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the word: But the ſpirit doth not reveal new truths not revealed in the word. The Spirit diſcovers the grace of God in Chriſt, and thereby draws forth ſpecial actings of faith and love, which are evidential; but it doth not not work in way of teſtimony. If God do but help us to receive the revelations in the word, we ſhall have comfort enough without new revelations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paul</hi>'s meaning is, that the miraculous works of the Spirit are a witneſs to the Chriſtian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. The thing that is witneſſed is, that <hi>ſincere Chriſtians are the children of God;</hi> that the Chriſtian religion is the true religion; and that all that embrace it indeed are the heirs of eternal life: And the Perſon that witneſſeth is the <hi>Holy Ghoſt;</hi> he teſtifies to it by <hi>Miracles</hi> and <hi>extraordinary Gifts.</hi> The mighty works of the Spirit of God in the primitive times, were evidences of the truth of the Chriſtian religion; they were wrought for that very end. Heb. 2 4. <hi>God alſo bearing them witneſs with ſigns and wonders, and divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> 1. Theſ. 1 5, <hi>Our goſpel came unto you, not in word only, but alſo in power, and in much aſſurance, and in the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3 It is <hi>by Intuition or ſeeing of grace in their own hearts.</hi> It is by conſciouſneſs; as <hi>Peter</hi> knew his love to Chriſt, when he ſays, <hi>Lord, thou knoweſt all things, thou knoweſt that I love thee,</hi> Joh. 11.17. And as <hi>David</hi> knew his love
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:011873_0082_0F8740F1ACFD4DB0"/>
to God; Pſal. 116.1. <hi>I love the Lord,</hi> And as <hi>Job</hi> knew his repentance; Job. 42.6. <hi>I ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor my ſelf in duſt and aſhes,</hi> And as <hi>Paul</hi> knew that he <hi>knew Chriſt;</hi> 1. Tim. 1.12. <hi>I know whom I have believed.</hi> There is a reflecting power in man: As he can look out and ſee external objects, ſo he can <hi>look in,</hi> and ſee his <hi>own actions.</hi> In this manner ſaints know the <hi>corrupt workings</hi> of their own hearts: They know their pride, and worldlineſs, and fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs, and unbelief; ſo they know their grace. In this manner they know their natural actions; they know that they think, and what they think about; they know the acts of their wills, what they cauſe and what they refuſe; and the acts of their Affections; they know that they love their children; that they deſire meat and drink; that they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of pain and death; that they rejoice in their good things: So, they may have the knowledge by intuition, that they know God and Chriſt; that they receive the goſpel; that they love God and the ſaints; that they are ſorry for their ſins. A godly man under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding what it is to love God and to repent, though he cannot give an exact definition of them, yet may be able by his obſervation to know that he doth ſo; and may be as able to ſay, that he loves God, and believes in Chriſt, as to ſay, he has pride and worldlineſs in his own heart. There may indeed be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing or more difficulty in it, becauſe many actings of grace are low and weak; on that

account; it may be hard to ſee it; as it is hard to ſee the motion of water in a river, when it moves very ſlowly; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that account, becauſe <hi>grace is much coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeited;</hi> and there be many actings that do look like the actings of grace that are not ſo: But ſometimes grace works ſo powerfully, that it is <hi>very viſible;</hi> and men are able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh between grace and the reſemblance of it, and be ſatisfied underſtandingly: 1 Chron. 29.17. <hi>As for me, in the uprightneſs of my heart. I willingly offered all theſe things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding this, it may be of great uſe for <hi>Miniſters</hi> frequently to be giving <hi>ſigns of Grace.</hi> Theſe ſigns are of great uſe for the diſcovery of hypocriſy. The want of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar graces is a means to diſcover ſome. Some may be undeceived by conſidering, that they have not had an antecedent work of <hi>Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> The account of the way wherein God works grace, <hi>ſc.</hi> by the <hi>diſcoveries of Goſpel Grace,</hi> may convince others. The want of <hi>Obedience</hi> may convince others. So, the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing of pride or worldlineſs, and the want of doing duties out of regard to God's glory.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Signs</hi> alſo are of great uſe for the incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement and ſtrengthning of the ſaints. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the diſcourſing of ſuch things doth draw forth the exerciſe of Grace; and men find in themſelves that which they are hearing of. So it was with <hi>Peter:</hi> The very queſtion whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he loved Chriſt, kindled a ſpirit of love to him, that he was aſſured <hi>that he loved him,</hi>

Joh. 21.17. Sometimes the explication of the ſign, helps men to ſee it more clearly. They were at a loſs; but when it is clearly laid open, it helps them to ſee it. Beſides, it brings to remembrance what they formerly felt; and ſo it brings joy, and renews their comfort. Moreover, it helps them againſt many temptations: They are under fears be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Providence of God, and becauſe of corrupt workings of heart; but when they hear that complacency in God, and the ſight of the glory of Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are ſigns of a good eſtate, that ſatisfies them, and is a relief to them under their temptations.</p>

               <p>THE grace given in converſion, like other qualities, doth admit of innumerable <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees;</hi> and is very imperfect in the beſt of the People of God. Godly men are far from pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to perfection: Job 9.20. <hi>If I ſay I am perfect, it ſhall alſo prove me perverſe.</hi> Hence we find lamentations of ſome of the choiceſt men that have been in the world: Prov. 30. <hi>Surely I am more brutiſh than any man, and have not the underſtanding of a man.</hi> Rom. 7.23.24. <hi>I ſee another law in my members, bringing me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to captivity. O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the body of this death?</hi> The ſorrowful <hi>falls</hi> of <hi>David, Solomon, Hezekiah, Jonah, Peter,</hi> are ſufficient demonſtrations of
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:011873_0085_0F8740F403DBF9E0"/>
this; and that <hi>warfare</hi> that every godly man doth experience: Gal 5 17. <hi>The fleſh luſteth againſt the ſpirit, and the ſpirit againſt the fleſh; and theſe are contrary the one to the other: So that ye cannot do the things that ye would</hi> Eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, grace at firſt converſion is very ſmall; if after twenty or thirty years growth, it is very defective, it muſt needs be very ſmall at firſt.</p>
               <p>There be many reaſons why God ſuffers much ſin to remain in his people, while they remain in this world.</p>
               <p n="1">1 That <hi>the work of ſanctification may be ſo carried on, that they may be in continual need of Juſtification and Pardon</hi> The pardoning of the ſins that men committed in their uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted ſtate, is a great manifeſtation of the riches of his grace, and the virtue of the blood of Jeſus Chriſt; but God doth day by day pardon the repeated iniquities of his people; forgives men thouſands of times, tho' they have abuſed mercy, broken vows, fallen from reſolutions: This doth wonderfully command the grace of God, and the ſacrifice of Jeſus Chriſt. If there were not experience of it, it would be difficult to conceive, that God would be willing ſo to do. Theſe are migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty inſtances of the unſearchable depth of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy that is in the heart of God; and lead me to ſay, as Mic. 2 18. <hi>Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and paſſeth by the tranſgreſſion of the remnant of his heritage, and retaineth not his anger for ever, becauſe he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth in mercy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="83" facs="unknown:011873_0086_0F8740F45FC8B800"/>2 <hi>Becauſe they live among carnal men,</hi> ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered up and down among unconverted men; and if this their grace were perfect, they would not be ſit to live together; it would be known who were godly and who ungodly, which would fill <hi>Families, Towns,</hi> and <hi>Countries</hi> with <hi>Temptation:</hi> Godly Men would be put to it to bear the carriages of the ungodly, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly men would not know how to bear the carriages of the Godly; it would fill all ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties with diſquietment and trouble.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Becauſe <hi>this is ſuitable to thoſe Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that God has appointed in his Houſe.</hi> It is meet that all ſhould worſhip God; and the worſhip that God has appointed is ſuited both for the converſion of ſinners, and the building up of ſaints; to promote their humiliation and recovery from backſlidings and relief under temptations. If godly men were perfect, they and ungodly men would not be ſit to join to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in <hi>confeſſion</hi> or <hi>petition.</hi> The <hi>Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> that God has appointed are not fit to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by men that have attained to a <hi>perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in grace</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some ſaints do attain to greater perfection in grace than others; this is not always in proportion to the time ſince their converſion, but according to the improvement of their <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>me: It is ſaid of the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> that their <hi>ſaith grew exceedingly, and their Charity abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> 2 Theſ. 1.3. Some have more grace at firſt Converſion than others, and ſome may grow more in a <hi>Year</hi> than others in <hi>Seven,</hi> and
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:011873_0087_0F8740F57565EFE8"/>
though it would be a preſumptuous thing to determine the degree of Grace any have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to in this life, yet it ſeems probable that Saints do not ordinarily, if ever attain to ſuch meaſures of grace, but that they have more corruption than grace.</p>
               <p>It ſeems to be but a little grace compared with corruption, that God's choice ſervants do attain unto. It is ſaid of the <hi>angel of Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia, Thou haſt a little ſtrength, and haſt kept my word and haſt not denyed my name.</hi> Rev. 3.8. And the experience of the people of God ſeems to confirm this: <hi>Sin doth eaſily beſet them;</hi> Heb. 12.1. Corruption is like a fountain that is continually ſending forth its waters. Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations do quickly infeſt. Pride and worldli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and diſcontent and unbelief are very ready to work and there is a great backwardneſs to ſpiritual duties, to faith and love, and to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the ſovereignty of God. Men's enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are ſo dear to them, that they have great difficulty to reſign them up to the pleaſure of God. There is much <hi>formality</hi> that doth at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend duties of religion; and there is much ſpiritual blindneſs, ignorance of God and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Neither doth it make againſt this aſſertion, that ſome of the people of God have <hi>a very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary Coverſation;</hi> for there are many <hi>other principles</hi> that join in with grace to effect this; natural conſcience, regard to reputation, a good temper, principles of morality, hope of reward and fear of puniſhment. If an exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary

When you come to lie in torment, can you ſatisfy your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that you have had your good things? Will you be able to applaud your ſelf as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving acted the part of a wiſe man? Will you glory in your wiſdom, and bleſs your ſelf for loitering away your time? One hours expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of the pains of hell will effectually teach you that peace with God is worth your care and labour; and that working out your
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:011873_0096_0F8740FE354F4EF0"/>
Salvation is no intollerable burden. If the <hi>Doctrine of Hell</hi> be a dream, if when you di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed your Soul would be reſolved into its firſt principles, if there were no hell but only in the imaginations of doting men, you might bleſs your ſelf in your way: But if there be a God in Heaven that will execute vengeance upon ungodly men, your neglecting to get in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a converted condition is higheſt madneſs and folly: You act like the man poſſeſſed with the devil, that caſt himſelf ſometimes into the fire, and ſometimes into the water. One would think that you ſhould be ſaying to your ſelf as they, Iſai. 33.14. <hi>Who among us can dwell with the devouring fire?</hi> Am I patient enough, am I ſtrong enough, am I ſtout enough, to bear everlaſting burnings? Are you more hardy than the devils, who <hi>believe and tremble?</hi> When men are in great pains, they hope that they will abate after a while: When they have ſorrows, they hope for a change af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a while: But what will you have to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort you, when your miſeries are everlaſting? When death ſhall come upon you, can you bid it welcome? You had rather be turned into nothing than be turned into hell. Is it not better to take pains that you may eſcape, than loiter away your time, till deſtruction comes upon you like an armed man?</p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>If you be converted, God will beſtow eternal life upon you?</hi> If a man be indeed converted, yet he may have great afflictions in this world. Though God many times rewards men with

outward bleſſings, yet that is a more arbitrary way, and he mixes many afflictions with them. So it was with <hi>Jacob,</hi> and <hi>Job</hi> and <hi>David;</hi> but converted men ſhall have eternal life. He will beſtow ſome other things of great conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence upon them: He will hear their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, accept their ſervices, and have communion with them; and at laſt he will beſtow eternal life upon them. Jam. 5.20. <hi>He that conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth a ſinner from the error of his way, ſhall ſave a ſoul from death.</hi> Act. 3.19. <hi>Repent and be converted, that your ſins may be blotted out, when the time of refreſhing ſhall come from the preſence of the Lord.</hi> Act. 26.18. <hi>To turn them from darkneſs to light, and from the power of ſatan un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, that they may receive the forgiveneſs of ſins: and an inheritance among them that are ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</hi> After they are converted, they may do that which is very provoking to God, and God may execute fatherly anger upon them; but they ſhall not miſs of eternal life thereby; there is no falling from a ſtate of Adoption, or Juſtification. Converſion will iſſue in <hi>Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</hi> Job. 4.14. <hi>The water that I ſhall give him, ſhall be in him a well of water, ſpringing up into eternal life.</hi> It is a great thing to go to heaven, but this ſhall be the portion of all that are converted. The generality of men ſhall fall ſhort of heaven, but no converted man ſhall fall ſhort.

               </p>
               <p>And can you content yourſelves to loſe ſuch a benefit? If your Salvation be ſecured, then you may bleſs yourſelf, you may rejoice in hope of the glory of God. If you be under affliction, if you hear of wars and troubles, you may ſay as <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 46.1, 2. <hi>The Lord is my ſtrength and refuge, a preſent help in time of trouble, therefore will I not fear, though the earth be removed.</hi> When you look into the Bible, there you may read your title. When you hear the word, you will hear abundant matter of conſolation. When you are exerciſed with your corruptions, you may comfort your ſelves with that, after a while Chriſt will preſent you <hi>without ſpot or blemiſh.</hi> When <hi>Satan</hi> is tempting, you may rejoice in that, <hi>God will tread Satan under your feet ſhortly.</hi> When you mourn under the withdrawings of God, you may be refreſhed with that conſideration, that ere long you ſhall <hi>behold his face in righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> When you are afflicted with your igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, you may rejoice in that you ſhall be <hi>wiſe like the angels of God.</hi> When you are afflicted with a dull, crazy, diſtempered body, you may remember to your comfort, that Chriſt will <hi>change your vile body, and make it like to his own moſt glorious body.</hi> You deſire ſuch and ſuch earthly comforts, but you have reaſon to be more indifferent about thoſe; they will not make you happy if you have them; and the want of them will not make you miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. Can you be contented to have your

portion in this life, and that others have hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and eternal glory! Chriſt has died for the Salvation of ſinners; God has appointed or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances to perſwade men to be ſaved, and is it not worth the while for you to labour in it? If you get into a ſtate of Salvation, you ſhall not need to be afraid of death; death that is a terror to the princes of this world, need be no terror to you: You may look upon it as a conquered enemy: You may ſay, <hi>O death, where is thy ſling, O grave, where is thy victory!</hi> Does it not make too much of your pains and trouble in ſtriving for converſion; heaven will make amends for all. Men that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicing in worldly things, <hi>walk in a vain ſhew;</hi> but heaven is not a little thing. It is a wonder that God does not ſay, it is too much to give heaven to ſuch as we; we ſhould be far from ſaying it is too little for us. It becomes you to ſay, let who will take the world, ſo you may obtain heaven. There may be ſome joy in earthly things; but in <hi>God's preſence there is fulneſs of joy</hi> They that enter into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, enter into the joy of <hi>their Lord.</hi> They are bleſſed, to whom it ſhall be ſaid, <hi>Inherit the kingdom prepared for you.</hi> If it be good to have meat, and drink, and cloathing, to be <hi>with Chriſt is for better.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4 There is <hi>much difficulty in the way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion.</hi> Thus are we taught by Chriſt; Mat. 7.14. <hi>Strait is the gate and narrow is the way that leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.</hi> Indeed we read of ſome that have been
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:011873_0100_0F874102E1A4CB00"/>
converted on a ſudden, that took no great pains to be converted; So the Jailor. <hi>Act.</hi> 16. the <hi>Woman of Samaria,</hi> Joh. 4 Many of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles; Acts 13. It may poſſibly be ſo now with <hi>Some</hi> on their ſick beds; and therefore there is ſufficient encouragement for <hi>Miniſters</hi> to adviſe them, and pray for them. God can ſuddenly let in ſo much light as is ſufficient for their Converſion. But if God do not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully prevent it, ordinarily there is much difficulty in the way; and Chriſt Jeſus makes that argument for men to labor after it. Luk. 3.14. <hi>Strive to enter in at the ſtrait gate.</hi> There be abundance of difficulties in the way, ſo that except perſons labor in it, they are never like to be converted: <hi>Many ſeek and are not able to enter.</hi> Their <hi>Ignorance</hi> makes the work difficult; they are in great danger to take wrong paths; their reaſon miſleads them, and they get out of the right way, and ſo make a great deal of work for themſelves. Their <hi>love to carnal things</hi> makes the work difficult; there is much oppoſition from a <hi>worldly Spirit,</hi> that makes them dull and ſluggiſh, that ſwallows up a great deal of time, that fills them full of care. Their <hi>Pride</hi> is a great hinderance; it fills with conceits of their own ſufficiency. Their <hi>fearfulneſs</hi> creates a great deal of diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, and they are ready to be diſcouraged. They have a great deal of <hi>frowardneſs;</hi> and they are ready to be diſguſted and prejudiced. The blindneſs of their minds hinders them from ſeeing their way. A Spirit of <hi>ſelf love</hi> leads
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:011873_0101_0F8741046757DE70"/>
them in wrong paths. And Satan is laying many ſnares for them, works on their corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and takes all occaſions to ſtrengthen their luſts.</p>
               <p>There is a great deal of difficulty in the way of <hi>Reformation.</hi> It is a great while ſometimes before they will forſake their evil ways: If they do many things like <hi>Herod,</hi> yet they ſtick at ſome particulars; they will bear many a gird of Conſcience <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> they will reform ſome things; they have their excuſes and eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. If they do thoroughly reform, and do duties of ſelf denial, it is not brought about without a great deal of Terror. His mothers curſe made <hi>Micah</hi> to reform his injuſtice; <hi>Judg.</hi> 17. They will not caſt away their Idols of Gold without a great deal of terror, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 2.20, 21. Many Perſons deal very deceitfully a great while about the work of reformation; they pretend to reformation when they are not throughly reformed; their moiſture is turned into the drought of ſummer before they will comply.</p>
               <p>And there is a great deal of difficulty in the work of <hi>Humiliation.</hi> They are called to come to Jeſus Chriſt, but they will try other methods firſt, and go about to eſtabliſh their own righteouſneſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3. They dare not venture upon Chriſt till they have made their hearts better. They ſay they are no pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, yet they have great dependance upon their works. Sometimes they fancy they are converted, and pleaſe themſelves that God is
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:011873_0102_0F874104EDECAEF0"/>
bound in faithfulneſs to pardon them upon Chriſt's account: Prov. 12.30 <hi>There is a generation that are pure in their own eyes, yet are not cleanſed from their filthineſs.</hi> Sometimes they think they have taken a great deal of pains, and done a great deal of ſervice, and can't conceive that it is a fair thing for God to caſt them off. It looks very hard for God to deſpiſe all they have done, and reject them: Iſai. 58.3. <hi>Wherefore have we faſted, and thou ſeeſt us not? wherefore have we afflicted our ſouls, and thou takeſt no knowledge?</hi> Sometimes they take notice of the meltings of their heart, their deſires of holineſs, their delight in ſabbaths: And it ſeems to them as if God could not be very angry; as if they had melted the heart of God into compaſſions, and made him more eaſy, and willing to pardon them; as if God could not find in his heart to caſt them off; as if their lamentations could force the pity of God. And when their hearts appear worſe, they nouriſh an hope to bring them too; and take a great deal of pains to work up ſuch frames as may lay bonds on God to ſave them. They are told, that it is in the pleaſure of God to beſtow mercy or deny it; but they dread the thoughts of that, and try twenty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions before they will ſubmit to God. They ſtrive much to bring God under a nece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſity to ſave them. They make objections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God's prerogative. They ſtrive to bring their hearts into a kind of ſubmiſſion, making a righteouſneſs of it; and would ſubmit to
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:011873_0103_0F874105A1219CF8"/>
prevent ſubmiſſion. There be ſo many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fficulties in the way, that men had need be greatly concerned, and be <hi>working out their ſalvation with fear and trembling.</hi> There is ſo much difficulty, that many times it is long, and with great ſtrugglings that they do obtain. Some never do obtain: After a great while they grow diſcouraged, think it is to no purpoſe, grow cool and indifferent, ſtart ſome other deſign, and by degrees are intangled in the pollutions of the world again; they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come like the ſalt that has loſt its favour. Some perſons ſettle at length in a way of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal confidence, build their hopes upon the ſand. There be many Phariſaical Profeſſors, that glory in themſelves, and <hi>ſpeak peace to, themſelves when there is no peace.</hi> They are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with falſe appearances of love, and faith, and <hi>think themſelves ſent thing when they are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi> Some others ſpend their days like <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the <hi>wilderneſs;</hi> they wander about from mountain to hill, ſeeking reſt and finding none. They beat upon the coaſt, but never enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the harbour: They are ſtriving, and death comes and puts an end to all their hopes. But thoſe that get into a converted condition, have many difficulties to grapple with before they do obtain; and they are under a neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to labour much in it. Mat. 11.12. <hi>The kingdom of heaven ſuffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. It is <hi>hopeful if you ſtrive, that you may obtain.</hi> He that <hi>ploughs, ploughs in hope.</hi> If
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:011873_0104_0F874106683DA6A8"/>
there were no hope of obtaining, men would not be prevailed with to ſeek. Hope made the king of <hi>Nineveh</hi> ſeek the favour of God, <hi>Jonah</hi> 3.9. Deſpair kills the heart, and cramps the powers of nature, and makes men deaf to perſwaſions; but hope makes men pray, and ſtrive, and run ventures, and endure hardſhip. Hopes of a cure makes the ſick uſe medicines. Hopes of a harveſt makes the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman to till his ground. Hopes of arriving at the port, makes the mariner hoiſt his ſails. Hopes of victory makes the ſoldier fight. And God encourages men to ſeek him from the hopes of ſucceſs. Iſai. 55.6. <hi>Seek ye the Lord while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near.</hi> Men are wont to give way to a diſcouraged ſpirit, partly from dark ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances, partly from frowardneſs, partly from ſlothfulneſs: But they do very ill, for it is <hi>hopeful</hi> that they may obtain. For,</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) God will beſtow <hi>converting grace upon ſome.</hi> We are indeed aſſured that all will not obtain. We are alſo aſſured that ſome will obtain; for there are a number of men whoſe names are written in <hi>the book of life.</hi> There may be more of them in one age than in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, more of them in one profeſſing country and town than in another; but all that are elected ſhall obtain, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.7. There is a number that are redeemed by Chriſt, that he did deſignedly ſhed his blood for: He laid <hi>down his life for his ſheep,</hi> Joh. 10.15. God would never have ſent him into the world, but
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:011873_0105_0F874107200382C8"/>
that he deſigned to convert and ſave many ſinners through him. He has promiſed to Jeſus Chriſt the ſalvation of many; Iſai. 49 6. <hi>I have given him to be a light unto the gentiles and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to the ends of the earth.</hi> Pſal. 72.17. <hi>Men ſhall be bleſſed in him, and all nations ſhall call him bleſſed.</hi> This is the promiſe ſpoken of, Tit. 1.2. <hi>In hope of eternal life, which God that cannot lie promiſed before the world began.</hi> God has made a donation of an eternal kingdom to Chriſt, Mat. 16.18 <hi>The gates of hell ſhall not prevail againſt the Church</hi> The work of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion ſhall be carried on in all ages. Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances ſhall not be in vain; Mat. 28 19.20. <hi>Go, teach all nations, baptizing them; and lo I am with you even to the end of the world.</hi> When God ſends ſowers to ſow, <hi>ſome ſeed</hi> ſhall fall on <hi>good ground</hi> The Goſpel is as a <hi>Net</hi> that ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſome <hi>good fiſh, and ſome bad.</hi> As other great works of God are continued, ſo this work of converſion ſhall continue in all ages. Though ſatan has a kingdom in the world, yet Chriſt will always have a kingdom here as well as he.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) There is <hi>ground to hope that he will beſtow converting grace on you.</hi> You are under the means of Grace; accordingly the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the goſpel ſhould hope for you, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly take pains with you: It would be a very ſinful thing if they ſhould be diſcouraged about you, and neglect to teach, and warn, and direct you. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us that he warned all his hearers, <hi>Acts</hi> 10, 31. And as there is
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:011873_0106_0F874107E0BFCDE8"/>
ground for the Miniſter to take encouragement to endeavour your converſion, ſo there is ground for you to be encouraged, to ſtrive for your own converſion.</p>
               <p>If it were beyond the power of God to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert, or beyond the grace of God to pardon you, then you would have reaſon to be diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged. Men may not expect impoſſibilities; but God can renew his image within you. The ſoul of a man is a ſuitable ſubjection grace; and as long as the faculties of the ſoul do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, a capacity to be gracious doth remain. Your corruptions are accidental, and ſo may be mortified. Your mind cannot be ſo blind, a to be incapable of light. Your heart can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſo hard as to be uncapable to be made ſoft. If your corruptions are very ſtrong, om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency can overcome them. Mat. 19.26. <hi>With God all things are poſſible.</hi> Neither is it beyond the grace of God to pardon you. It is great folly to ſet limits to that which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite. God's grace exceeds man's ſinfulneſs: His <hi>thoughts are not as our thoughts, nor his ways as our ways;</hi> but high above them, as the heavens are above the earth. Indeed if God had revealed, that he would not pardon you, that would cut off all hope; but there is no ſuch thing in the word. God ſays in his word, <hi>that his ſpirit ſhould not always ſtrive with fleſh,</hi> Gen. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.3. but that only ſignifies, that he would <hi>wait only an hundred and twenty years, and then bring the flood.</hi> He ſays, that the heart of the people ſhall be <hi>made fat,</hi> Iſai. 6.10. but that was a <hi>national Judgment;</hi> particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:011873_0107_0F874108CAE419E8"/>
might be converted for all. Sometimes God ſware concerning <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that they ſhould not <hi>enter into his reſt,</hi> Pſal. 95.11. but there is no ſuch thing ſaid concerning you. God ſometimes pronounces that curſe, <hi>Let him that is unjuſt be unjuſt ſtill, and him that is filthy be filthy ſtill,</hi> Rev. 22.11. but he is uſing means with you ſtill. You may take notice of ſome dark appearances in Providence; that you are of ſuch an age; that God has refuſed hitherto to hear your prayers; that in the days when many have heard the voice of the Son of God, you have been left; But it is unwarrantable and preſumptuous, without Scripture or Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to draw any dark concluſions from thence.</p>
               <p n="3">3 If <hi>you be ſtriving, there is a great deal of hope that you will obtain.</hi> If men are ſtriving, and will not be diſcouraged, it is very hopeful that they will in time be converted; eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if they be directed aright, and be not flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered; for diligent ſeeking is God's way; God's voice unto men is, <hi>Seek ye my face;</hi> Pſal. 27.8. So, <hi>Seek the Lord and his face, ſeek his ſtrength evermore;</hi> Pſal. 105.4. There is hope that God will own men, when they take the directions of his word. Though natural men when they ſeek converſion, always do it with a ſelfiſh and hypocritical Spirit, and God does not accept it as ſervice to himſelf; yet it is not ſtrange he ſhould bleſs his own <hi>appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> Indeed the ſeeking of God diligently, reforming men's lives, ſearching into the way of Salvation, has a great tendency to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Salvation; for it takes them off from their ſinful practices, and worldly deſigns that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered them from getting into the way of
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:011873_0108_0F87410B70928260"/>
life. They are ſearching into thoſe things that will conduce to their converſion. Beſides, when men are earneſtly ſeeking after that, it is a ſign that the Spirit of God is at work with them: And the Spirit is promiſed to make the means of Grace effectual. Joh. 16.7, 8. <hi>If I depart, I will ſend the Comforter to you; and when he is come he will reprove the world of Sin, of Righteouſneſs, and of Judgment.</hi> And when he doth intend to Convert, his way is, firſt to convince of ſin; and when he doth convince of ſin, many times it is in order to converſion. And indeed many perſons have had experience that in a way of labouring after converſion, God has ſhewed mercy on them; while others that have been careleſs and ſlighty, have continued in an unconver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted condition. Many that have been ſtriving to enter in at the ſtrait gate have obtained; and it is always ſo, that where there is in any place, an earneſt deſire to be ſeeking after peace with God, many do obtain mercy; and if that ſpirit ſhould continue longer, many more might obtain, according to that, Mat. 11.12. <hi>The kingdom of heaven ſuffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6 If <hi>you ſhould obtain converſion, you would not be in an unconverted eſtate again for all the world.</hi> A man that has a fair eſtate, may be very willing to exchange for another; But if you were converted, you would deſpiſe Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips and Principalities in compariſon thereof. The glory of the world might poſſibly be a temptation to you; but you would never be willing to change a converted eſtate for
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:011873_0109_0F87410B9DA0BB68"/>
the glory of the world. When you called to mind the doleful condition of ſuch men, you would look upon them objects of commiſerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; their jollity, and wealth, and grandure, would not reconcile you to their condition: You would remember the wormwood and the gall: You would think of the vanity of their hopes, the dolefulneſs of their death, and their eternal confuſion; and their ſtate would be matter of horror to you. <hi>Jeremiah</hi> dreaded to <hi>return to the houſe of Jonathan.</hi> What ever enjoyments you had, pedigree, eſtate, honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable offices; upon this account you would call your ſelf happy, that you were conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. When you conſidered what it deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered you from, and what it did intitle you unto, you would ſay as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeaks of peace with God, that it <hi>paſſes all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.</hi> Converſion opens a door to the richeſt treaſures: He thinks with himſelf, What a comfort is it to have peace with God, to be delivered from the fear of death, to be provided for eternity? God is his, and Chriſt is his, and Heaven is his; he wiſhes it was ſo with others: Acts. 26.29. <hi>I wiſh that others were ſuch as I am, except theſe bonds.</hi> Men that obtain great things in the world are never contented; but when they are converted, they ſay, it is enough. You would ſay, others eat the fat, and drink the ſweet; ſome have great incomes, ſome have honourable offices, ſome have glittering attire; but as <hi>David</hi> ſays, Pſal. 17.15. <hi>As for me, I ſhall behold thy face in righteouſneſs, I ſhall be ſatisfied when I awake with thy likeneſs.</hi>

            <p>GODLINESS is a thing of great concernment. The acceptance of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, the hearing of prayers, and the ſalvation of the ſoul doth depend upon it. And becauſe it is of ſuch moment, the comfort of men doth much depend upon the knowledge of it. But there is a great deal of darkneſs in the minds of men about it.

Many times godly men have ſcruples, and ſometimes great fears, that they are not godly: They often ſet in judgment on themſelves, and are at a loſs what ſentence to pronounce. And ſome ungodly men have great hopes that they are in a good eſtate, and ſteal comfort that do not belong to them. Some cannot ſee their way to condemn themſelves, and ſome give judgment for themſelves. But the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle doth here direct the one ſort and the other in the determination of their condition. Firſt, he tells us how a godly man may know his godlineſs: He that ſees the workings of the grace of love in himſelf; he that ſees more or fewer actings of that grace, may conclude for himſelf, that he is born of God, hath had a work of regeneration, the goſpel has had a ſaving efficacy on his heart, he has the ſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual knowledge of God, his eyes have been opened to ſee the glory of God. Secondly, he tells us how hypocrites may know their hypocriſy: He that loveth not, that liveth in the omiſſion of love, that hath nothing of the working of that ſpirit, that lives in the neglect of it, hath not the ſpiritual knowledge of God; whatever pretences he makes, this caſts the caſe againſt him. The like we may ſay with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to every other grace: He that believeth on Jeſus Chriſt, that loveth God, that has god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſorrow, is born of God: But he that doth not believe in Chriſt, that loveth not God, that hath not godly ſorrow, knoweth not God, whatever profeſſions he maketh</p>

                  <p n="1">1. Many <hi>internal acts</hi> of ſin, are no evidence of hypocriſy.

Though it be mortifyed, yet it is full of life, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.1. <hi>Lay aſide every weight, and the ſin that doth ſo eaſily beſet us.</hi> It is like a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, always ſpringing up.

with me.</hi> The choiceſt ſaints do find eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day the ſtirrings of corruption. If they are alone, if they are in company, if they are in the works of their calling, if they are exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing themſelves in the duties of religion, they are always haunted with a corrupt heart. They have a multitude of evil thoughts, deſires, delights, fears, ſorrows. Unbelief is often ſtirring; ſo pride and worldlineſs, frowardneſs and envy. There be many ſtirrings of ſin that they do not perceive; but abundance that falls under their obſervation. A corrupt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple will ſtir upon all occaſions; every thing that occurs will awaken it: Therefore ſaints are warned to keep their hearts with all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.33. And godly men have great occaſion every day to repent, and to ſay as <hi>Paul</hi> Rom. 7.24. <hi>O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the body of this death!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 Many <hi>external acts of Sin</hi> are no evidence of Hypocriſy. Men have much more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of their words and outward actions than of their thoughts, and the inward workings of their hearts: Yet godly men are often guilty of external ſins: They commit many ſins in words, Jam. 3.8. <hi>The tongue is an unruly evil.</hi> Many times their words favour of vanity, pride, unbelief, and uncontentedneſs. And they are often guilty of other external ſins, Pſal, 19.12. <hi>Who can underſtand his errors?</hi> Every corruption is running them into tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion; ſometimes omitting duty, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times committing ſin. They are guilty of many ſins of ignorance. Men that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:011873_0114_0F874110E3855688"/>
general rules, often fail in applying them to particular caſes. There be many proud, worldly, froward carriages that they are not aware of, and are ready to juſtify. And many ſins are committed through inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertency; they are hurried through fear, or paſſion, or pride, and conſider not at the time, but preſently after they ſee it, and are ſorry for it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. An <hi>act of groſs tranſgreſſion</hi> is no evidence. Groſs tranſgreſſions are not the <hi>ordinary ſpots</hi> of God's children; but grace is no certain preſervation from them. Mortified corruption may run a man into ſuch tranſgreſſion as many natural men were never guilty of. Groſs tranſgreſſions are of ſuch a nature that they ſeem to be inconſiſtent with grace: But as a man that has corruption in him may do choice act of holineſs, ſo a man that has grace in him may commit groſs acts of ſin. If a man's nature be much weakned, yet in a fit he may act very ſtrongly: So, if men's corruptions be much weakened, yet they may have fits wherein they may act very powerfully. It is an idle thing to think, that ſuch things are impoſſible as ſeveral time have come to paſs. <hi>Noah</hi>'s intemperance, <hi>Lot</hi>'s inceſt, <hi>David</hi>'s adultery, <hi>Peter</hi>'s denying of Chriſt, are unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable arguments, that groſs tranſgreſſion is no evidence of an Hypocrite. It is no wonder if a groſs tranſgreſſion ſhould make a man ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect his godlineſs, but it is no evidence. If God withdraw from a godly man, his grace will not prevent groſs tranſgreſſion. Natural conſcience doth often preſerve men, but
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:011873_0115_0F874111B1EAFDE0"/>
grace doth not always preſerve men from groſs ſin.</p>
                  <p n="2">II A <hi>courſe of ſin</hi> is an evidence of hypocriſy, If a man makes a profeſſion of religion, and lives in a way of ſin againſt the light of his conſcience, he is an hypocrite. He that makes a profeſſion, and contradicts it in his conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, is an hypocrite. Tit. 1.16. <hi>They pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that they know God, but in works they deny him.</hi> He that pretends to godlineſs, and turns aſide to crooked ways, is an hypocrite; for thoſe that are really godly do live in a way of obedience. Pſal. 119.1, 2, 3. <hi>Bleſſed are the undefiled in the way, that walk in the way of the Lord, they alſo do no iniquity.</hi> Luk. 1.6. <hi>They were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameleſs.</hi> But ſuch as live in ways of ſin are diſſemblers; for all ſuch will be rejected in the day of Judgment: Mat. 7.23. <hi>Depart from me, ye that work iniquity.</hi> The like we have, Luk. 13.27. If Men live in a way of Diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience they do not <hi>love</hi> God; for love will make men keep God's commands. 1 Joh. 5.3 <hi>Herein is love, that we keep his commands, and his commands are not grievous.</hi> If men live in a way of Diſobedience they have not a ſpirit of <hi>Faith;</hi> for faith ſanctifies men: Acts 16.68. <hi>Sanctifyed by faith that is in me.</hi> If men live in a way of diſobedience they are not Chriſt's ſheep; for <hi>his ſheep hear his voice,</hi> Joh. 10.27. Men that live in a way of diſobedience are not born of God; 1 Joh. 3.9. <hi>He that is born of God ſinneth not.</hi> Men that live in a way of
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:011873_0116_0F8741125CFF6E70"/>
diſobedience are the ſervants of ſin; Joh. 8.34. <hi>He that committeth ſin is the ſervant of ſin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. A courſe of <hi>external ſin</hi> is an evidence of Hypocriſy, whether it be a ſin of omiſſion or commiſſion. If men live in the neglect of known duties, or in the practice of known e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, that will be their condemnation. Let the ſin be what it will; let it be Prophaneſs, Drunkenneſs, Uncleanneſs, Lying, or Injuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. Thus it was with the Sons of <hi>Eli, Hophni</hi> and <hi>Phineas,</hi> they are called <hi>ſons of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lial, that knew not the Lord,</hi> 1 Sam. 2.12. The foundation of their cenſure was their profaneſs and uncleanneſs, <hi>v.</hi> 13.14, 22. So it was with <hi>Jehu,</hi> notwithſtanding his zeal in deſtroying <hi>Baal,</hi> becauſe he practiced and tolerated the worſhip of the <hi>Calves</hi> at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> 2 King 10 3<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. <hi>Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the Lord God of Iſrael, with all his heart and with all his ſoul; for he turned aſide after the ſin of Jeroboam.</hi> So many of the Phariſees were wicked, becauſe they devoured widows houſes, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.14. Thus <hi>Judas</hi> appeared to be an hypocrite, becauſe he lived in theft, Joh. 12.6. <hi>He was a thief</hi> That ſhewed the rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the heart of <hi>Demas,</hi> that he was an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtate, 2 Tim. 4.10. <hi>Demas hath forſaken me, having loved this preſent evil world.</hi> To live impenitently in any outward known ſin, will caſt againſt a man, and prove him an hypocrite.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 A courſe of <hi>internal ſin</hi> proves a man to be an hypocrite. Though he waſhes his hands, if he does not cleanſe his heart, he is ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. The external converſation of ſome hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:011873_0117_0F87411600F50A78"/>
may excell the converſation of ſome ſaints; but if there be a way of internal ſin, their pretenſes to godlineſs are vain. There be two ſorts of internal ſins, which men may live in a way of, and is a witneſs againſt them. One is, a way of corrupt thoughts and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections: If men allow themſelves in malice, envy, wanton thoughts, prophane thoughts, that will condemn them.</p>
                  <p>Though thoſe corruptions do not break out in any ſcandalous way, thoſe thoughts are an evidence of a rotten heart Tit. 3.3. <hi>We our ſelves were ſometimes fooliſh, diſobedient, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, ſerving divers luſts and pleaſures, living in malice and enemy, hateful and hating one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> If a man allows himſelf, though he thinks he doth not, in malice or envy, he is an hypocrite; though his conſcience diſallows it, yet if his heart allows it he is no ſaint; if be does not hate and mortify thoſe corrupt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, he is no ſaint. The other way of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in internal ſin is, to live in the omiſſion of ſpiritual duties: Whether a man knows it or knows it not, it is an evidence of hypocriſy. Many men that make a fair ſhew, do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Jeſus Chriſt: They have a perſwaſion of the truth of the goſpel, they hope Chriſt will ſave them, they have had ſome joy in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the goſpel, but they do not believe in Chriſt; either they are carnally confident, or diſcouraged: This doth condemn them. <hi>He that believeth not, the wrath of God abideth on him,</hi> Joh. 3.36. He that is contentious and
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:011873_0118_0F8741172E880878"/>
obeys not the goſpel, will be condemned, Rom. 2.8. So, if a man live in the neglect of love to God; if there be no hearty love to God in his profeſſion, in his obedience, he is not godly: Though there be affection, yet if there be not hearty love, that will condemn him: That was the condemnation of the Jews, Joh. 5.42. <hi>I know you, that you have not the love of God in you.</hi> If men be zealous men, have tenderneſs of conſcience, delight in ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, but are deſtitute of love to God, they are hypocrites. So, if there be not a ſpirit of love to ſaints, 1 Cor. 13.23. <hi>If I ſpeak with the tongue of men and angels, and have not charity, I am become as ſounding braſs, and a tinkling cym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi> So, 1 Joh. 4.8. <hi>He that loveth not, knoweth not God.</hi>

                     <hi>PROP. II.</hi> Sincerity is known by particular acts of Grace.</head>
                  <p>The habits of Grace cannot be ſeen imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately: As no man can ſee his own Soul or any of the faculties of it immediately, ſo he cannot ſee the gracious principles that are there immediately.

                  <p>Conſider,</p>
                  <p n="1">1 <hi>Saints may certainly ſee particular acts of Grace.</hi> Though there be many acts of grace that a man doth not know to be ſuch, yet ſome acts of grace are plain to be ſeen. We find Chriſt enquiring of one whether he did believe, Joh. 9.35. <hi>Doſt thou believe on the Son of God?</hi> and of another whether he loved him, Joh. 21.16. <hi>Simon ſon of Jonas, loveſt thou me?</hi> That ſhews that ſuch things may be known, elſe to what purpoſe would it be to aſk thoſe queſtions. And reaſon ſhews that they may be ſeen, for they do greatly differ from all counterfeit acts, and ſometimes grace acts very ſtrongly and apparently. And we have an account in Scripture of ſaints that have ſpoken very confidently about the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of a ſpirit of grace; ſo <hi>Job,</hi> Job 42.5, 6. <hi>Now mine eye ſeeth thee, wherefore I abhor myſelf in duſt and aſhes.</hi> He ſaw the mighty workings of a ſpirit of repentance, and was at no loſs about it. So <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 116.1. <hi>I love the Lord.</hi> He ſpeaks of it as of a thing he was aſſured of. The like workings of heart he found towards the law, Pſal, 119.97. <hi>O how love I thy law.</hi> So, <hi>Peter</hi> appears
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:011873_0120_0F8741191F67CB80"/>
to Chriſt, who knew his heart, Joh. 21.17. <hi>Lord, thou knoweſt all things, thou knoweſt that I love thee.</hi> And others have had the like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Ordinarily, they do certainly ſee but <hi>few particular acts of grace.</hi> There is a very great difference in godly men upon this account. I take it for granted, that there are not two men in ten thouſand, that have juſt the ſame experience. More generally, godly men do hope and think, that they exerciſe grace many times every day, in their prayers, and in their callings, and in their converſation with men; but it is but now and then that they can cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſpeak up to it. There he great mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of corruption with grace, there be many falſe appearances of grace, which makes them afraid whether they did indeed exerciſe grace; and this makes it evident, that it is thus with Saints, that many of them are for a long time under doubt whether they be indeed godly; thence we have theſe precepts, 2 Pet. 1.10. <hi>Give all diligence to make your calling and election ſure.</hi> 2 Cor. 13.5. <hi>Examine yourſelves, whether you be in the Faith.</hi> Some hypocrites are a great deal more confident than many ſaints. Many godly men are at a loſs whether their faith be any other than what unconverted men may have. And ſo about their other graces; there be ſome ſaints that have aſſurance, but the foundation of it is, that now and then they ſee the plain actings of faith and love, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:011873_0121_0F874119EF0DF1B8"/>
They ſee ſomething of encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from their daily walk. But that which begets aſſurance is, that ſometimes they plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee Grace.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. By theſe viſible actings of grace, <hi>they may conclude there is a courſe of gracious carriages.</hi> Godly men are deſcribed to be men that walk in a courſe of holineſs. Pſal. 119.1. <hi>Bleſſed are the undefiled in the way, that walk in the law of the Lord.</hi> And we find that godly men have been well ſatisfied that they have walked in a way of holineſs. Iſai. 39.3. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, O Lord, I beſeech thee, how I have walked before thee in truth, and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy ſight.</hi> If it be enquired, how they do know that their obedience is not the fruit of natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and common grace, as it is with many others; The Anſwer is, that they ſee now and then the plain exerciſes of grace, and from thence conclude, that they are under the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of a gracious ſpirit in their walk; that though they be guilty of much formality and hypocriſy, yet there is a ſpirit of holineſs working in them, and an hearty care to keep the commandments of God. If a man ſees now and then a ſpirit of love to God, he may ſafely conclude that his religion is not the fruit of oſtentation, or ſlaviſh fear, but that a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſpirit doth ſtir him up to perform his duty, and that his walk his holy.</p>
                  <p>USE I. Is of awaking to thoſe that live in a courſe of ſin. Some make pretences to god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, whereby they do not only deceive
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:011873_0122_0F87411AA4EE77C0"/>
others, but which is a great deal worſe, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive themſelves alſo. But this will condemn them, that they live in a courſe of ſin; and ſuch muſt go with ungodly men: Pſal. 125, 5. <hi>As for ſuch as turn aſide unto their crooked ways, the Lord will lead them forth with the workers of iniquity.</hi> If there be a great change in a man's Carriage, and he be reformed in ſeveral particulars, yet if there be one evil way, the man is an ungodly man. If he doth choice ſervice for the church of God, yet he is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly man. If there are twenty hopeful things that may be alledged for him, yet he will not paſs for a godly man. Where their is piety, there is univerſal obedience. A man may have great infirmities, yet be a godly man; ſo it was with <hi>Lot</hi> and <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Peter;</hi> but if he lives in a way of ſin, he does not render his godlineſs only ſuſpicious, but it is full evidence againſt him. Men that are godly, have a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to all God's commandments, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.1. There be a great many commands, and if there be one of them that a man has not a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect unto, he will be put to ſhame another day. If a man lives in one evil way, he is not ſubject to God's authority; but then he lives in rebellion, and that will take off all his pleas, and at once cut off all his pretences, and he will be condemned in the day of Judgment; Luk. 13 27. <hi>Depart from me, all ye that work iniquity.</hi> One way of ſin is exception enough againſt the man's ſalvation.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Though the ſin that he lives in be ſmall
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:011873_0123_0F87411B5DCA1170"/>
ſuch perſons will not be guilty of perjury, ſtealing, drunkeneſs, fornication; they look upon them to be heinous things, and they are afraid of them, but they do not much matter it if they oppreſs a little in a bargain, if they commend a thing too much which they are about to ſell, if they break a promiſe, if they ſpend the ſabbath unprofitably, if they neglect ſecret prayer, if they talk rudely, and reproach others; they think theſe things are but ſmall things: If they can keep clear of great tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, they hope that God will not inſiſt upon ſmall things; but indeed all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God are eſtabliſhed by divine autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and that man that doth not lay weight upon little commands, keeps none as he ought to do. A ſmall ſhot may kill a man as well as a cannon bullet. A ſmall leak may ſink a ſhip. If a man lives in ſmall ſins, that ſhews that he has no love to God, no ſincere care to pleaſe and honour God. Little ſins are of a damning nature as well as great; if they do not deſerve ſo much puniſhment as greater, yet they do deſerve damnation. There is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of God in ſmall ſins, Mat. 5.19. <hi>He that ſhall break one of the leſt of theſe commandments, and ſhall teach men ſo, ſhall be called the leaſt in the kingdom of God.</hi> There is rebellion in little ſins; Prov. 19.16. <hi>He that keepeth the commandment keepeth his own ſoul, but he that deſpiſeth his ways ſhall die.</hi> If a man ſays, this is a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and ſo lays wait on it, and another is a little commandment, and ſo do not regard it,
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:011873_0124_0F87411CB06196F0"/>
but will not allow himſelf to break it, he is in a periſhing condition.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Though their temptations be great. Some Perſons delight in iniquity, they take pleaſure in rudeneſs, and intemperate practices: But there be others that do not delight in ſin; they can handſomely avoid it, they do not chuſe it: Except they be under ſome great neceſſity they will not do it: They are afraid to ſin, they think it is dangerous, and have ſome care to avoid it. But ſometimes they force themſelves to ſin: They are reduced to difficulties, and cannot tell how well to avoid it. It is a dangerous thing not to do it. If <hi>Naaman</hi> do not bow himſelf in the houſe of <hi>Rimmon,</hi> the king will be in a rage with him, take away his office, it may be take away his life, and ſo he complies; 2 Kings 5.18. <hi>In this thing the Lord pardon thy ſervant, that when my maſter goeth into the houſe of Rimmon to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip there, and he leaneth on my hand, and I bow myſelf in the houſe of Rimmon, when I bow my ſelf in the houſe of Rimmon, the Lord pardon thy ſervant in this.</hi> So <hi>Jeroboam</hi> forced himſelf to ſet up the Calves at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel.</hi> He thought if the people went up to Jeruſalem to worſhip, they would return to <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> and kill him; therefore he muſt think of ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient to deliver himſelf in this ſtrait: 1 King 12.27.28. <hi>Whereupon the king took council, and made too calves of gold; and ſaid to them, it is too much for you to go up to Jeruſalem, behold thy gods O Iſrael, which brought thee up out of the
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:011873_0125_0F87411D55EA2B20"/>
land of Egypt.</hi> He was driven by appearing neceſſity to take this wicked courſe. So the ſtony ground hearers were willing to retain the profeſſion of the true religion, but the caſe was ſuch that they thought they could not well do it; Mat 13.21. <hi>When tribulation or perſecution ariſeth becauſe of the word, by and by he is offended.</hi> They would have choſe to have lived and died in the profeſſion of the truth, but they cannot brook confiſcation, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and death; and ſo they muſt be excuſed if they drop their profeſſion. So <hi>Achan</hi> and <hi>Gehozi</hi> had ſingular opportunities to get an eſtate; if they live twenty years, they are not like to have ſuch an advantage, and they force themſelves to borrow a point, and break the law of God. They lay a neceſſity on eſtate, and liberty, and life, but not upon obedience. If a man be willing to ſerve God in ordinary caſes, but excuſe himſelf when there be great difficulties, he is not godly. It is a ſmall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to ſerve God, when men have no tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but <hi>Lot</hi> was holy in Sodom, <hi>Noah</hi> was righteous in the old world. Temptations try men, but they do not force men to ſin; and grace will eſtabliſh the heart in a day of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. They are bleſſed that do endure temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.12. But they are curſed that fall away in a day of temptation.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Though they be afterwards ſorry for it. Some men fall into great tranſgreſſion, but when they conſider of it they are ſorry for it. They do not juſtify themſelves, neither do they
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:011873_0126_0F87411EAA850A50"/>
excuſe themſelves, and ſay others do ſo as well as they, and if men be left of God who can help it; but they confeſs it, and bewail it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, it is an affliction to them that they were carried away with temptation, they ſee they have acted fooliſhly, that they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed the commandments of God, and they hope they ſhall never do ſo again, be drunk, again, or lie again. Sometimes men take oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to talk with them, and they are ready to own their fault, they are aſhamed, and they ſhed tears; but after a while the temptation returns, and they are as bad again: They are like the dead fiſh, that are carried down the ſtream; but they are ſorry again; and ſo they keep on, ſinning and repenting. Juſt thus it was with <hi>Saul: Jonathan</hi> talks to him and he hearkens, 1 Sam. 19 6. <hi>Saul hearkned to Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, and Saul ſware, as the Lord liveth, he ſhall not be ſlain.</hi> After a while he is perſecuting <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> again; but upon <hi>David</hi>'s ſaving his life, he weeps and makes confeſſion, 1 Sam. 24.16. <hi>Saul lift up his voice and wept.</hi> But upon the Invitation of the <hi>Ziphites</hi> he purſues <hi>David</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and David ſpares his life a ſecond time; and upon that Saul confeſſes and promiſes, I Sam. 26 21. <hi>Then ſaid Saul, I have ſinned, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn my ſon David, for I will no more do thee harm, I have played the fool, and erred exceedingly.</hi> There is no truſting ſuch men; if they live in ways of ſin, they are ungodly. Godly ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row will make men live holily; 2 Cor. 7.10. <hi>Godly ſorrow worketh repentance unto ſalvation, not to be repented of.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="124" facs="unknown:011873_0127_0F87411F1D266ED0"/>USE II. Of encouragement to thoſe that have ſeen gracious actings in their own hearts. I ſuppoſe that there be ſeveral of you that have ſeen the actings of grace in your own hearts. You have ſeen the workings of faith, as <hi>Paul</hi> 2 Tim. 1.12. <hi>I know him whom I have believed.</hi> of love, as <hi>Peter.</hi> Joh, 21.17 <hi>Lord, thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt all things, thou knoweſt that I love thee;</hi> of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, as <hi>Job.</hi> Job 42.6. <hi>I abhor myſelf and repentin duſt and aſhes.</hi> You may conclude from hence that you are godly. You may have ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples upon many account: You may be under difficulties becauſe God hides his face at preſent from you: You may have temptation from ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular afflictions, and becauſe God denies to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer ſome prayers, in things that lie much upon your hearts: You may have difficulties from ſuch workings of corruption as ſeems to be incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with Grace: You may have temptation becauſe you do not ſeem to grow; but if you have certainly ſeen the working of a gracious ſpirit, if an hundred times, if ten times, if one time, you may conclude that you are godly. That which was not in being could not be ſeen that which is not, is inviſible. If there were no ſun, or moon, or ſtars, none could be ſeen: So, if there were no faith, or love, they could not be ſeen. There may be grace where it is not ſeen, but where it is ſeen, there it is; and you may conclude that you are godly. For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. This ſhews that there was at the time a principle of grace. The habits of grace are not immediately to be ſeen, but only by their workings. If there be a gracious act, there
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:011873_0128_0F8741226F9EFAA0"/>
muſt be a gracious principle; if there be not an antecedent one, there muſt be at leaſt a concomitant one; for while a man remains in his natural condition, he cannot act graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly; Rom. 8.7. <hi>The natural mind is enmity to God, and is not ſubject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.</hi> If a man loves God, he is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to love him; if he believes in Chriſt, he is diſpoſed to believe in Chriſt. It is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to do thoſe actions without a diſpoſition to them; and that diſpoſition is a principle or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of grace. Every man that acts graciouſly is a new creature: Until the heart be chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it will not carry graciouſly. Any act of grace is a ſure token of regeneration: If a man believes in Chriſt, he is certainly born of God; Joh. 1.12, 13. <hi>To them that received him gave he power to become the ſons of God, even to them that believe on his name, who were born not of blood, nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</hi> If a man breaths, and ſees, and hears, and walks, he is certainly a living man. Where there is an act of life, there is a principle of life; 1 Joh. 37. <hi>He that doth righteouſneſs is righteous, as he is righteous.</hi> Every effect muſt have a proper cauſe. If the heart were utterly oppoſite to believing, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving or repenting, he would not believe, love or repeat. The heart of a man is always in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to what he chuſes. The mind may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand a thing that he is not inclined to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand; but the Will never chuſes without an inclination ſo to do. If there be a change
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:011873_0129_0F874124234BE768"/>
in the behaviour of the heart, there is a change in the diſpoſition of the heart.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 If a principle of grace were once there, it is always there. It was otherwiſe under the covenant of works; <hi>Adam</hi>'s grace was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect but mutable; for he did not fulfil the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the covenant; if he had once done that, his grace would have been immutable. But under the new covenant, if a man be once godly, he always will be godly; for every one who is godly, has fulfilled the condition of the covenant. Grace may decay, but it never will be loſt: It may wither, but never die. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon grace may be loſt, but ſaving grace can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be loſt: If grace be once begun it will continue; Phil. 6. <hi>I am confident of this very thing, that he that hath begun a good work in you, will perfect it to the day of Chriſt.</hi> The power of God is engaged for the preſervation of grace. Once godly and always godly; 1 Pet. 1.5. <hi>Who are kept by the power of God, through faith unto ſalvation.</hi> Sometimes they are afraid they ſhall fall away, but whether they have more ſtrength or leſs ſtrength, they ſhall never fall away; God's covenant is their ſecurity. Such men may have great temptations; Hereticks may endeavour to ſeduce them, vicious men may ſeek to debauch them, worldly men may entice them, perſecutors may ſeek to fright them out of their religion; but nothing can be too hard for them: <hi>Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it,</hi> Cant. 8.7. They may have temptation to pride, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption,
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:011873_0130_0F8741257A0D7EF8"/>
to diſcouragement; but if they be led into temptation, they will be delivered from evil. A principle of grace is like a liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fountain; Joh. 4.14. <hi>Whoſoever drinketh of the water that I ſhall give him. ſhall never thirſt; but the water that I ſhall give him, ſhallbe in him a well of water ſpringing up into everlaſting life.</hi> Falſe hearted men may fall away, but thoſe that are ſincere will be more than Conquerors. If <hi>Abraham</hi> be once godly, he will continue ſo, though he lives an hundred and ſeventy years. If grace be begun here, it will be perfected in heaven.</p>
                  <p>USE 3 Of direction to godly men, how you may know your ſincerity; <hi>viz.</hi> by renewing the viſible actings of grace. Many ſigns are given of holineſs, that will not bear examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and there is danger that many are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived thereby. Some godly, and ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly men that find them in themſevles may be comforted thereby, but they beget no aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: And ſome men that find them in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, remain at a loſs whether they be godly or no. The way to know your godlineſs, is to renew the viſible exerciſes of grace. When a man ſees that he loves God, and believes in Jeſus Chriſt, he will not be unſatisfied about his godlineſs. If he has been in the dark, and in great temptations juſt before, yet this will beget aſſurance.</p>
                  <p>Here you may obſerve,</p>
                  <p n="1">1 If you do not know that you live in ſin, that can be no evidence of your godlineſs: As you cannot condemn your ſelves, ſo you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:011873_0131_0F874125DE51E2F8"/>
juſtify your ſelves. Some perſons examine themſelves whether they live in any known ſin; and upon the ſtricteſt enquiry they do not find that they do. They do not find that they live in the neglect of any duty, or in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of any ſin. Their hearts do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach them: They duly attend prayer, they are careful to ſanctify the Sabbath, they live ſoberly, chaſtly, juſtly, they are true to their word, and faithful in their places, they do not know upon the moſt narrow ſearch that they live in any way of ſin, yet they cannot juſtify themſelves from hence; 1 Cor. 4.4. <hi>I know nothing by my ſelf, yet am I not hereby juſtified:</hi> For men that examines themſelves may be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant that they live in a way of ſin, yet they may live in a way of ſin; men's underſtandings are corrupted, and they may live in pride, worldlineſs and unbelief, and not know it: They may think thoſe corruptions do not reign when indeed they do reign. Many men that do not know that they live in ſin, are fain to ſuſpend their judgment about themſelves; they hope from hence that they are holy, but do not know it. Though men do not know that they live in ſin, yet God may know that they do: Prov. 30.12. <hi>There is a generation that is pure in their own eyes, yet are not cleanſed from their filthineſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 If there be great probability that you live in a way of faith, and love, and repentance, that do not make it evident. There is ſome probability of ſome mens faith, becauſe goſpel promiſes have been a comfort to them; and of
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:011873_0132_0F8741269D9FD8D8"/>
their love, becauſe they are zealous and do delight in ordinances, and in praiſing God; of their repentance, for their ſins are a great burden to them, and they are careful to avoid ſin: but probabilities prove nothing; that may be probable, that may be falſe; there may be ſome probability of a thing, yet the contrary may be certain. Probabilities leave men under uncertainties. If they raiſe hopes, yet they leave room for fears. There may be probabilities one way, and as great probabilities the other way. Men will not content themſelves with a probable title to their land. God will not take men to heaven becauſe there is a proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of their goodneſs. Twenty Probabilities make the thing more probable, but they do not make it certain. Probabilites are no Demonſtration. The hopes that are built on them may be diſappointed, therefore we are directed to <hi>make our Calling and Election ſure.</hi> 2 Pet. 1.10.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. All the viſible exerciſes of grace are evidential. The word of God tells that all that believe in Jeſus Chriſt are Chrildren of God, Joh, 1.12. <hi>To them that received him, gave he power to become the Sons of God.</hi> It tells that all that love God are heirs of heaven. Jam. 1.12. <hi>God has promiſed a Crown of life, to them that love him.</hi> So it tells us that all that have godly Sorrow ſhall be ſaved. 2 Cor. 7.10. <hi>Godly ſorrow worketh repentance unto Salvation.</hi> And that all that love the brethren ſhall have eternal life, 1 Joh. 3.24. <hi>We know that we are tranſlated from death to life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we love the brethren.</hi> Hence if any of theſe workings be clearly ſeen, the man has a ſure evidence of his good eſtate: He has ground to caſt the caſe for himſelf: It is no preſumption for him to conclude his
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:011873_0133_0F87412767384880"/>
Juſtification: He has a divine warrant to give ſentence for himſelf: At ſuch a time when he pronounces him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a ſaint, he goes according to law and evidence: His confidence is aſſurance: For thoſe exerciſes of grace that he is conſcious to are peculiar to godly men, and do aſſuredly diſtinguiſh them from all other men.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The more theſe viſible exerciſes of grace are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed, the more certain you will be: the more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently theſe actings are renewed, the more abiding and confirmed your aſſurance will be. A man that has been aſſured of ſuch viſible exerciſes of grace may quickly after be in doubt whether he was not miſtaken; but when ſuch actings are renewed again and again, he grows more ſettled and eſtabliſhed about his good eſtate. If a man ſee a thing once, that makes him ſure; but if afterwards he fear he was deceived, when he comes to ſee it again, he is more ſure he is not miſtaken. If a man read ſuch paſſages in a Book, he is ſure it is ſo; ſome months after ſome may bear him down, that he was miſtaken, ſo as to make him queſtion it himſelf; but when he looks and reads it again, he is abundantly confirmed. The more mens grace is multiplied, the more their peace is multiplied. 2 Pet. 1.2, <hi>Grace and Peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and Jeſus our Lord.</hi> The third time the queſtion was put to Peter whether he loved Chriſt, he anſwers with greater aſſurance; the very propoſing of the queſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion ſtirred up the working of a ſpirit of love, and he ſpeaks with very great confidence, <hi>Job.</hi> 21.15, 16, 17. The firſt and ſecond time he ſays, <hi>Yea, Lord, thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt that I love thee:</hi> But the third time he ſpeaks with greateſt aſſurance, <hi>Lord thou knoweſt all things, thou knoweſt that I love thee.</hi> It went greatly to his heart that his love ſhould be ſo often queſtioned, and ſo he was more abundantly ſatisfied in the truth of his love.</p>
