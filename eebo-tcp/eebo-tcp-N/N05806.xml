            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>Then the Earth ſhook and trembled; the Foundations alſo of the Hills moved, and were ſhaken, becauſe he was wroth.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>THE Words now read, naturally lead your Thoughts to the awful Providence of the Week paſt; when the Earth ſhook and trembled, and the Foundations alſo of the Hills moved and were ſhaken: When, like the trembling Jaylor, every one was awaken'd out of his ſleep with the Roar of an Earthquake, and threaten'd with immediate Deſtruction. They alſo lead us to the Origin of that awful Event, <hi>viz.</hi> the Wrath of God. He ſhook the Earth becauſe he was wroth, and therein expreſs'd his Indignation at Sin, and Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Affronts that were offer'd to his infinite Majeſty, by a profane and rebellious World.</p>
            <p>Accordingly, in ſpeaking to the Words,
<list>
                  <item>I. I ſhall diſcourſe to you upon Earthquakes.</item>
                  <item>II. Conſider the Wrath of God as the Cauſe of them; and</item>
                  <item>III. Make ſome Application ſuitable to the Occaſion.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. I ſhall diſcourſe to you upon Earthquakes; and ſhall conſider them either as univerſal or particular.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Earthquakes may be univerſal. That God who at the Beginning
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:007374_0003_102B8BD735164560"/>
made the World, can ſhake it at his Pleaſure; and as his Power is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite and irreſiſtible, he can ſhake all and every Part, as well as any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Part of it. Nor is there any Thing in Nature that militates againſt this Principle. The righteous and wiſe Maker and Governor of the Univerſe has planted his Artillery in every Part and Corner of the Earth, to preſerve the Homage, and to ſuppreſs the Rebellion of his Creatures; and the ſame natural Cauſes, by a Commiſſion from God, may as well operate and concur to produce an univerſal, as a particular Earthquake.</p>
            <p>Such an univerſal Earthquake there ſeems to have been, both at the Death and Reſurrection of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. We read in <hi>Matt.</hi> 27.50. <hi>that when Jeſus gave up the Ghoſt, the Vail of the Temple was rent in twain, from the Top to the Bottom, and the Earth did quake, and the Rocks rent.</hi> And <hi>Matt.</hi> 28.2. <hi>That at his Reſurrection from the Dead, there was a great Earthquake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And no wonder that Nature was ſeiz'd with an univerſal Convulſion, when the God of Nature was ſtruggling in the Agonies of Death. When his Soul and Body were violently rending from each other, no wonder that the Rocks rent, and that the Earth trembled. And why ſhould not the whole Earth be equally affected, when the Lord of Glory ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted a Divine Power, and burſt the Doors, and broke the Bars of the Grave aſunder, and came forth? Nature ow'd her Lord that Reſpect, to bear a Sympathy with him, both in the Agonies of his Death, and in the Triumphs of his Reſurrection.</p>
            <p>And the ſecond Coming of our Lord, will be attended with ſuch an univerſal Earthquake, at which the moſt hardy Sinner will be afraid, and trembling will ſurprize the Hypocrite. Hence that Prediction in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 24.17, 18, 19. <hi>Fear, and the Pit, and the Snare are upon thee, O In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant of the Earth. And it ſhall come to paſs, that he who fleeth from the Noiſe of the Fear, ſhall fall into the Pit; and he that cometh up out of the Midſt of the Pit, ſhall be taken in the Snare; for the Windows from on high are open, and the Foundations of the Earth do ſhake. The Earth is utterly broken down, the Earth is clean diſſolved, the Earth is moved exceedingly. The Earth ſhall reel to and fro like a Drunkard, and ſhall be removed like a Cottage, and the Tranſgreſſion thereof ſhall be heavy upon it, and it ſhall fall and not riſe again.</hi> And of the ſame awful Period, we read in <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.15, 18, 19. <hi>Behold, I come as a Thief. Bleſſed is he that watcheth—And there were Voices, and Thunders, and Lightnings; and there was a great
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:007374_0004_102B8BD919538158"/>
Earthquake, ſuch as was not ſince Men were upon the Earth, ſo mighty an Earthquake, and ſo great. And the great City was divided into three Parts, and the Cities of the Nations fell; and great</hi> Babylon <hi>came into Remembrance before God, to give unto her the Cup of the Wine of the Fierceneſs of his Wrath. And every Iſland fled away, and the Mountains were not found.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But (2) Earthquakes may be particular, <hi>i. e.</hi> in particular Places, at particular Times and Seaſons. Before that awful Period, when univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Nature ſhall ſtruggle in its expiring Agonies, our Saviour tells us, in <hi>Matt.</hi> 24.7. <hi>That there ſhall be Earthquakes in divers Places.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now theſe are various in their Duration, Extent, and Degree. And it is ſaid, <note n="†" place="bottom">See Mr. <hi>Prince</hi>'s Sermons after the Earthquake in <hi>1727.</hi>
               </note>
               <q>Sometimes there are threatning Simptoms, and ſometimes they come ſuddenly, and without any previous Notice. Sometimes in dreadful Tempeſts, but oftener in the calmeſt and ſereneſt Seaſons. They are ſometimes of a narrower, at others of a larger Compaſs. Sometimes their Shocks are of a ſhorter, at others, of a longer Dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Some are of a leſſer, others of a greater Violence. Sometimes they quickly ceaſe, and leave the Earth at Reſt; at other Times they ſoon repeat their terrible Efforts, and throw the Earth into new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions. Sometimes they make the Earth to jar and vibrate, and ſometimes to waver like the Waves of the Sea. In ſuch a Manner was the Place ſhaken, where the Apoſtles were aſſembled, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.31. And thus the Foundations of the Priſon where <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> lay bound, were ſhaken by a great and ſudden Earthquake.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And how terrible are the Effects of Earthquakes! Whole Towns and Cities have thereby been deſtroyed as in a Moment; and the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants have either been buried in the Ruins, or gone down alive into the Pit. Whilſt they bleſs'd themſelves in their Security, and were ready to flatter themſelves with an uninterrupted Proſperity, their vain Hopes have been diſmounted, and they have been overtaken with ſwift De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. The Earth has opened her Mouth, and ſwallowed them up quick, and they were no ſooner ſurpriz'd with a Senſe of their Danger, but they deſpair'd of Relief.</p>
            <p>How ſudden and how terrible was the Deſtruction of <hi>Korah,</hi> and his Company, by an Earthquake! <hi>After</hi> Moſes <hi>had made an End of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Ground clave aſunder that was under them, and the Earth opened her Mouth and ſwallowed them up, and their Houſes, and all the Men that appertained unto</hi> Korah, <hi>and all their Goods. They, and all that appertained
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:007374_0005_102B8BDB4F69F7F8"/>
to them, went down alive into the Pit, and the Earth cloſed upon them; and they periſhed from among the Congregation. And all</hi> Iſrael <hi>that were round about them, fled at the Cry of them; for they ſaid, Leſt the Earth ſwallow us up alſo:</hi> Numb. 16.31, and onwards.</p>
            <p>O the Diſtreſs and Anguiſh of the guilty Inhabitants! when the Earth opened her Mouth to ſwallow them up, and Heaven was inexorable to their Cries! When Deſtruction from the Lord was a Terror to them, and they could ſee no Refuge from the Storm of vindictive Juſtice! O the dolorous Shrieks and Outcries of the People, when they ſaw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves going down alive into the Pit, and that there were none that could ſtay them! No wonder that <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when they heard their Cry, were terrify'd and amaz'd, and fled, leſt that they alſo ſhould he overtaken with the Deſtruction which they ſaw came upon <hi>Korah,</hi> and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, from their incenſed Sovereign. I proceed,</p>
            <p n="2">II. To conſider the Wrath of God as the Cauſe of Earthquakes.</p>
            <p>An Inquiry into the natural Cauſes of Earthquakes, would be incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with my deſign'd Brevity, and might divert your Thoughts from the great firſt Cauſe of All; I ſhall therefore only mention them as the Works of God, and the Means he uſes to accompliſh his Pleaſure.</p>
            <p>Without Regard to ſecond Cauſes, God the ſupream Governor of the World, is to be conſidered as the Author of theſe great Events; and they are to be eſteem'd the Tokens of his juſt Diſpleaſure: When God ſhakes the Earth, and cauſes the Foundations of the World to tremble, it is becauſe that he is wroth.</p>
            <p>As Earthquakes are the Works of God, ſo he can produce them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Help of natural Cauſes. He who at firſt commanded the World out of Nothing into Being, by the Liſp of his Pleaſure, can diſſolve its Frame, and make it a Place of Deſolation and Aſtoniſhment. Though he ordinarily makes Uſe of ſecond Cauſes, yet it is as eaſy for Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence to work without them, as by their Co-operation and Aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>If God who made the World at the beginning, ſhould only ſuſpend that Power by which he upholds and preſerves it, it would reel and ſtagger like a Drunkard, and tumble into Ruin. Without exerting any Power for its Deſtruction, it would as effectually anſwer his Deſign, to withdraw the Power by which he ſupports it.</p>
            <p>The Frown of his Countenance, without the Concurrence of natural Cauſes, would inſtantly bury the World in its own Ruins. Hence we read in <hi>Joh</hi> 9.4, 5. <hi>He is wiſe in Heart, and mighty in Strength—which removeth the Mountains and they know not; which overturneth them in his
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:007374_0006_102B8C8493CE5FA0"/>
Anger: Which ſhaketh the Earth out of her Place, and the Pillars thereof tremble.</hi> And in what lofty Expreſſions does the Pſalmiſt ſpeak of the Majeſty and Power of God, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 104.32. <hi>He looketh on the Earth, and it trembleth; he toucheth the Hills, and they ſmoke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if we conſider Earthquakes as the Product of natural Cauſes, of contrary and diſagreeing Elements in the Bowels of the Earth, that meeting, make a moſt violent Concuſſion. I ſay, if we conſider Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes as the Product of natural Cauſes, yet we muſt ultimately reſolve them into the powerful Agency of God, the great Governor of the Univerſe. For, who but he made thoſe Cauſes which produce ſuch Effects, and ſets them a Moving? Who planted that Artillery in the Bowels of the Earth, and diſcharges it in ſo terrible a Manner? Who directs its Courſe, and cauſes it to ſhake ſome Parts of the World, and not others? Who gives it a Commiſſion to deſtroy ſome Places, and at the ſame Time preſerves others? Shall we look upon theſe Things only as the Effects of Nature, or ſhall we not rather aſcribe them to a Divine Almighty Power? To that God who made all Things, and has all Nature under his Command, to ſerve his Purpoſes in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the World.</p>
            <p>Now, as Earthquakes are the Works of a divine and almighty Agent, ſo they are ſome of the terrible Effects of his Wrath. He ſhakes the Earth, and cauſes the Foundations of the Hills to be moved and ſhaken, when he is wroth, He who made the World at firſt <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> his Power, and governs it by an indiſputable Authority, hath placed his Artillery in the Earth and under the Earth, both to chaſtiſe the Inſolence of his rebellious Creatures, and by the commanding Awe of his Judgments, to maintain the Homage and Obedience of his People.</p>
            <p>As God is inviſible, ſo his Diſpleaſure is known by the Judgments which he executeth in the Earth. There is not any Number of his Armies; and from the Magazine of his Fury, he brings out many Judgments to chaſtiſe a ſinful People. <hi>Fire and Hail, Snow and Vapour, ſtormy Wind fulfil his Word.</hi> Pſa. 148.8. <hi>He viſits with Thunder and Earthquake, and great Noiſe, with Storm and Tempeſt, and the Flame of devouring Fire.</hi> Iſa. 29.6.</p>
            <p>Though God is terrible in all the Judgments that he brings upon a ſinful People, yet in nothing does he appear ſo full of Dread and Terror, as when he makes the Earth under us to tremble and quake. The Sword, and Famine, and Peſtilence, are very terrible Judgments, that have no Reſpect to Perſons, that devour one as well as another, and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply

the Slain of the Lord. But then theſe Calamities are gradual in their Progreſs, and either give us Time to eſcape them, or to prepare to meet them. But Earthquakes for the moſt Part come ſuddenly, without any previous Notice, and ſurprize Sinners in the midſt of their Security and Eaſe. Whilſt they are crying Peace to themſelves, ſudden De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction comes upon them, as Travail upon a Woman with Child, and there is no eſcaping.</p>
            <p>To what can we impute ſuch terrible Events, but to incens'd Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence? Judgment is God's ſtrange Work, what he has an Averſion to, and ſeems to proceed in with the greateſt Reluctance. When he is about to bring Ruin upon a ſinful People, his Heart is oftentimes turned within him, and his Repentings are kindled together; ſo that he does not execute the Fierceneſs of his Anger. The Father of Mercies does not grieve and afflict the Children of Men willingly, but for the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Sins, to revenge the Affronts that are offered to his infinite Majeſty, and he ſees that all other Means are ineffectual to reclaim them.</p>
            <p>How dreadful then is the Wrath of God! The Wrath of a King is as the Roaring of a Lion, which ſtrikes with Surprize and Amazement; but what is that to the Anger of an incenſed Deity? who removeth Mountains, and they know not; which overturneth them in his Anger, and at whoſe Reproof the very Pillars of Heaven tremble, and are aſtoniſhed. Hence ſays the Prophet, <hi>Hab.</hi> 3.10. <hi>The Mountains ſaw thee and they trembled: Thou didſt march through the Land in Indignation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> expreſsly mentions (chap. 38.19, 20.) the Anger of God as the Cauſe of this particular Judgment. <hi>For in my Jealouſy, and in the Fire of my Wrath have I ſpoken: Surely in that Day there ſhall be a great Skaking in the Land of</hi> Iſrael; <hi>ſo that the Fiſhes of the Sea, and the Fowls of Heaven, and the Beaſts of the Field, and all creeping Things that creep upon the Earth, and all the Men that are upon the Face of the Earth, ſhall ſhake at my Preſence; and the Mountains ſhall be thrown down, and the ſteep Places ſhall fall, and every Wall ſhall fall to the Ground.</hi> And the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> after ſuch a particular Deſcription of this Judgment, as if he had been an Eye-witneſs of it, aſcribes it to the Anger of an offended Deity. <hi>I beheld the Mountains,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>and lo they trembled, and all the Hills moved lightly. I beheld and lo there was no Man, and all the Birds of Heaven were fled. I beheld, and in the fruitful Place was a Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, and all the Cities thereof were broken down at the Preſence of the Lord, and at his fierce Anger</hi>: Chap. 4.24, 25, 26.</p>
            <p>Having conſidered Earthquakes as the dreadful Effects of God's Wrath, I proceed</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:007374_0008_102B845D4507C010"/>III. To make ſome Application of the Subject, ſuitable to the awful Occaſion. And here,</p>
            <p n="1">1. In Earthquakes, we have a moſt lively and affecting Diſplay of the glorious Majeſty of the Lord our God.</p>
            <p>What more lively Diſplay can there be of the Majeſty of God, than to ſee the inanimate Creation awaken'd out of its ſlumber at his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence! To ſee the Earth tremble, and the Mountains quake at his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke! <hi>The Mountains ſkip like Rams, and the little Hills like Lambs. The Earth trembles at the Preſence of the Lord, at the Preſence of the God of</hi> Iſrael: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 114.4, 7.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We learn the wretched Stupidity of Sinners, who are regardleſs of God, and the Operations of his Hands. If the Heavens are aſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed, and the Earth is afraid at the Anger of the Lord, it may well make Sinners tremble, and cauſe their Hearts to be removed out of their Place. For he that ſhakes the Earth, can ſhake them into Hell in a Moment, and torment them in the Fire of his Jealouſy forever.</p>
            <p>But ſuch is the unaccountable Stupidity and Hardneſs of Sinners, that oftentimes they will provoke God to his Face: They mock the Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of his Judgments, and deſpiſe the glittering Spear of almighty Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance. The Belief of his Juſtice and Power makes the very Devils to tremble; and yet the Judgments of God are oftentimes ineffectual to reclaim obſtinate and incorrigible Sinners, who dare to affront his infinite Majeſty, as if they were a Match for Omnipotence, as if they could reſiſt his Fury, or ſupport his heavy Indignation.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We learn the dreadful Evil of Sin, and the woful Folly of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, which provoke God's Wrath and Indignation.</p>
            <p>Sin conſider'd in itſelf, and abſtracted from its woful Conſequences, is a moſt tremendous Evil. As it is a Tranſgreſſion of the Law, it is an Affront to the ſupream Lawgiver, and obſcures the Glory of his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes, which are exerciſed in the Government of the World. As it ſtrikes at God, and provokes his Jealouſy, ſo it recoils upon the Sinner, and involves him in innumerable Evils. It hath ſtrip'd Man of his ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Purity, and ſtain'd him with an univerſal Pollution. It hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded Man from that Honour and Dignity, in which he was at firſt created; ſo that he is become like the Beaſts that periſh, and expoſes him to Death, in all its fearful and amazing Conſequences.</p>
            <p>The Evil of Sin, ſhews us the woful Folly of Sinners, who daily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke God's Wrath and Fury. Tho' Sin is ſuch an amazing Evil in it ſelf, and ſuch an Indignity to the bleſſed God, as to raiſe his juſt
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:007374_0009_102B845F25E30D08"/>
Reſentment, yet Sinners roll it as a ſweet Morſel under their Tongues; and, if we may judge by their Conduct, they had rather loſe their Souls, than abandon their Luſts. They turn a deaf Ear to all the Warnings of God's Word, and deſpiſe the Grace of God, which teaches them to deny all Ungodlineſs and worldly Luſts, and to live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly, in the preſent World.</p>
            <p>O the amazing Folly of Sinners! to indulge their Luſts at the Hazard of their Souls! and to purſue their Sins with ſuch Greedineſs, which, unleſs almighty Grace prevents, will end in Shame and everlaſting Death.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Is the Wrath of God the Cauſe of the moſt fearful Judgments, then let us ſtand in awe, and not ſin againſt him.</p>
            <p>The Fear of God. and his Judgments, ſhould create an unalterable Divorce between us and our Sins, and we ſhould have nothing more to do with the accurſed Thing which his Soul hates. Becauſe there is Wrath, we ſhould beware of Sin, which an infinitely pure and holy God, cannot behold without the greateſt Indignation and Abhorrence.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Let us reflect with the higheſt Gratitude, upon the Mercy of God, which interpos'd for our Preſervation and Safety, at the very Inſtant of our Danger.</p>
            <p>What a Conſternation and Surprize were we in, when awaken'd out of our Sleep with the Roar of an Earthquake! Every One's Lips ſeem'd to quiver, and their Knees to ſmite one againſt another, when we were apprehenſive of inſtant Deſtruction, and could ſee no Refuge in Nature for our Protection.</p>
            <p>But in the midſt of Judgment, God remember'd Mercy for us, and appear'd as a preſent Help in the Time of our Trouble and Diſtreſs. When the Sorrows of Death compaſſed us about, and the Pains of Hell threaten'd to take hold upon us; before we had Time to call upon the Name of the Lord, he deliver'd us: He rode upon the Heavens for our Help, and in his Excellency upon the Skies, as our great Preſerver. <hi>O that Men would praiſe the Lord for his Goodneſs, and for his wonderful Works to the Children of Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Goodneſs of God in our Preſervation, appears moſt amiable and aſtoniſhing, when we conſider how we have provok'd him by our Sins, and how his Juſtice would have been glorify'd in our Deſtruction. If he had ſent us quick into the Grave, and into Hell, God and his Throne would have been guiltleſs and unſpotted forever, and we ſhould have been juſtly and eternally miſerable: And his Mercy might have been extended to thoſe who would have receiv'd it with the higheſt Gratitude,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:007374_0010_102B8460EF9F7F70"/>
and not abus'd it as we have done. But Mercy interpos'd for us, who were the Objects of avenging Juſtice, and rejoic'd againſt Judgment for our Deliverance. <hi>It is of the Lord's Mercies that we are not utterly conſumed, even becauſe his Compoſſions towards us have not failed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And what enhances the Goodneſs of God, and our Obligations to love and admire it, is the Deſolations that Earthquakes have made in other Places, and to think how often God has appear'd for our Land, when in the like Danger. The moſt rich and flouriſhing Cities have been depopulated as in a Moment, and buried in their own Ruins. And beſides other remarkable Judgments that our Land has been viſited with, this is the <hi>eleventh</hi> or <hi>twelfth</hi> Earthquake that has been perceiv'd ſince the Arrival of our Fathers here, and within 120 Years. Many Shocks indeed have been ſmaller, and leſs extenſive, but this is the <hi>fifth</hi> that has been very awak'ning, and that has juſtly fill'd our Land with Terror and Surprize. <note n="†" place="bottom">For a more particular Account, ſee the Rev. Mr. <hi>Prince</hi>'s Letter on Earthquakes, lately publiſhed.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And now, after ſo many Inſtances of remarkable Danger and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, whilſt we tremble at his Rebukes; what Obligations are we under to love the Lord, and to admire his Goodneſs. When his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments awaken us out of our Security, and deſtroy our vain Confidence, we ſhould be encouraged by his Goodneſs, to make him the ſupream Object of our Hope and Truſt, and devote ourſelves to his Glory, to ſerve him in Righteouſneſs and Holineſs all the Days of our Lives.</p>
            <p n="6">6. When the Earth ſhakes and trembles, it teaches us the Vanity of the World, and the Uncertainty of all its Enjoyments.</p>
            <p>The World is the admir'd Idol that engroſſes the Affections of the unthinking Multitude, and engages them in the eager Purſuit of it. This they make the Object of their ſupream Dependance, their Views and Aims; their Hopes and Deſires are confin'd to the Things that are ſeen, and they vainly imagine that they are ſufficient to compleat their Felicity. But ſure I am, they are under a moſt woful Infatuation; they truſt to Vanity, and their Hope will end in Shame and Diſappointment.</p>
            <p>How vain is the World, which how permanent and durable ſoever, we may imagine it, trembles at the Preſence of the Lord, and is unable to ſupport his heavy Indignation! How empty and uncertain are its Enjoyments, that will afford us no Relief in our greateſt Extremity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The World is fickle and unconſtant, the Faſhion of it paſſes away, anon
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:007374_0011_102B8463AC89E2D0"/>
it will vaniſh in Flame and Smoke; and thoſe that now admire it, will ſee it no more. The Apoſtle aſſures us, <hi>That the Heavens and Earth which now are, are kept in Store, reſerved unto Fire, againſt the Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Perdition of ungodly Men:</hi> 2 Pet. 3.7.</p>
            <p>What an indelible Reproach is it then to the human Nature, that Men who are endow'd with reaſonable Souls, ſhould ſuffer themſelves to be deluded and impos'd upon by a World, ſo falſe and uncertain, ſo empty and unſatisfying; that they ſhould embrace it as their ſupream Good, and loſe their Souls for the Sake of gaining the World! If Men would take as much Pains for heavenly, as they do for earthly Treaſure, they would have a greater Probability of Succeſs, their Gains would be infinitely preferable, and their Rewards eternally glorious; they would then be rich in Grace, and Heirs of a Kingdom, Heirs of God, and joint Heirs with Jeſus Chriſt, to an Inheritance which is incorruptible, and undefiled, and which fadeth not away. But thoſe who devote them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Service of the World, and are engag'd in the eager Purſuit of it, labour in vain, and ſpend their Strength for nought, and in vain. For, what Profit will the Gains of this World be to a Soul which is ſpiritual, and of an immortal Duration, which will ſurvive the Ruins of Nature, and be unſpeakably bleſſed in the Enjoyment of God forever, or eternally miſerable, under the Weight of his dreadful Diſpleaſure.</p>
            <p n="7">7. How happy are all thoſe who have the everlaſting God for their Refuge, and are in a State of Peace and Favour with him.</p>
            <p>They are happy in the moſt perilous Times, the Favour of God is their Protection, and they are ſafe under the Shadow of the Almighty. They poſſeſs their Souls in Peace, when all Nature is in Convulſions; and are fearleſs and ſecure amidſt
<q>the Wars of Elements and Cruſh of Worlds.</q>
They may ſay, as in <hi>Pſa.</hi> 46. beg. <hi>God is our Refuge and Strength, a very preſent Help in Trouble; therefore will we not fear, tho' the Earth be removed, and tho' the Mountains be carried into the midſt of the Sea, tho the Waters thereof roar, and be troubled, tho' the Mountains ſhake with the Swelling thereof.</hi> They know that if their earthly Tabernacles be diſſolved, they have a Building of God, an Houſe not made with Hands, eternal in the Heavens: Or, that if the Earth ſhould open her Mouth, and ſwallow them up, it would afford them a quick and eaſy Paſſage to a World of immortal Light and Love: Or, ſhould ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main alive at the Coming of our Lord, when he ſhall come in the Clouds of Heaven, with Power and great Glory, they will welcome the Day of his Appearance, as the Day of the unſpeakable Joy and Gladneſs of their
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:007374_0012_102B8BDD2F9D83A0"/>
Hearts. They will not be diſmay'd at the Flames of a diſſolving World, when the Heavens ſhall paſs away with a great Noiſe, and the Elements ſhall melt with fervent Heat, and the Earth alſo, and the Works that are therein, ſhall be burnt up.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Let us, from what has been ſaid, enquire wherefore it is, that God is angry with us, and endeavour by a ſpeedy Repentance to appeaſe his Wrath, and prevent further Tokens of his Diſpleaſure.</p>
            <p>The Judgments of God, with which our Land is viſited, are to be eſteem'd ſo many Tokens of his Diſpleaſure: Particularly, that he is calling us to draw the Sword in our own Defence, and to maintain our Rights againſt the Encroachments of a potent, ſubtle, and malicious Enemy: That, notwithſtanding the Victory and Succeſs that have crown'd ſome of our Forces, others have been frown'd upon and diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed: That we have been call'd to lament the Fall of the Mighty, and that ſo much of the Beauty and Glory of our <hi>Iſrael,</hi> have been ſlain in the high Places of the Field: That moſt of our Attempts have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto prov'd abortive: That the Sword of the Wilderneſs is unſheath'd againſt us: That the unhappy People upon our Frontiers, are in Jeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardy every Hour, and expos'd to bloody and deceitful Men, whoſe tender Mercies are cruel; and that we ſo frequently hear of the Deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations that are made among them, of ſome butcher'd and ſcalp'd, and of others carried into a doleful Captivity.</p>
            <p>And now, as if all theſe Calamities were inſufficient to awaken us out of our Security, and to humble us for our Sins, God has been viſiting with Earthquake, and thereby ſummoned us to dread and reverence. He march'd thro' the Land in Indignation, and his Preſence ſtruck us with Terror and Surprize.</p>
            <p>It becomes us then to enquire, wherefore it is that God is contending with us, and to be humbled before him for our Sins, the Cauſe of his righteous Diſpleaſure. Inſtead of complaining of the Severity of his Judgments, we have Reaſon to admire at the Patience and Forbearance of the moſt High towards us; for our Iniquities are increaſed over our Heads, and our Treſpaſſes are grown up to the very Heavens, and cry for Vengeance againſt us. Should I attempt to draw up a black Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of the Crimes that prevail among us, I ſhould ſcarce know where to begin and when to end; and therefore, inſtead of enumerating Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, I ſhall only mention two Things, as Aggravations of all our other Abominations, and which threaten to deluge our Land in Miſery
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:007374_0013_102B8BDEC0ED6570"/>
and Woe, namely, The Means of Grace that we enjoy, and our Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Shameleſneſs in Sin.</p>
            <p>The Means of Grace, if they are not effectual to reform a ſinful Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſerve only to enhance their Guilt, and expoſe them a more fearful Prey to the Judgments of God. The Light of the Goſpel renders their Guilt inexcuſable, and their Contempt of his Grace, provokes God's dreadful Jealouſy. As we are a diſtinguiſhed People, ſo, if we think that the Privileges we enjoy, and our Relation to God, as his People, will ſkreen us from his Wrath, whilſt we continue to provoke him by our Sins, we deceive ourſelves with a vain Imagination. The People of the <hi>Jews</hi> gloried in their having the Temple, and Temple-worſhip among them, as that which they thought would effectually ſecure the Preſence of God with them; but the Prophet tells them, That they deceiv'd themſelves, and truſted in lying Words, whilſt they cried, <hi>The Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord are we</hi>; as if that alone would ſecure his Favour, and keep off his Judgments from them. If our Fruitfulneſs is not in Proportion to what God hath done for us, we may expect that he will do by us, as he did by his Vineyard of old; that he will pluck us up, and pull us down; that he will lay us waſte and deſtroy us.</p>
            <p>Shameleſsneſs in Sin, is another Thing that has a very threatning Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect upon a People. Thus we read, <hi>Jer.</hi> 6.15. <hi>Were they aſhamed when they had committed Abominations? Nay, they were not at all aſhamed, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could they bluſh: Therefore they ſhall fall among them that fall: At the Time that I viſit them, they ſhall be caſt down, ſaith the Lord.</hi> That this is very much our Caſe, is too evident to need any Proof. Vice and Immorality are grown barefac'd and impudent, and ſo degenerate is the Age in which we live, that he that departeth from Evil, ſeems to make himſelf a Prey, by expoſing himſelf to the Scoff and Ridicule of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane and licentious Tongues. Many there are who declare their Sin as <hi>Sodom,</hi> and hide it not, and even glory in their Shame. Now when Sinners grow ſhameleſs and impudent in Sin, it looks as if no Laws were ſufficient to curb their Luſts, and reſtrain their Inſolence; and the Cauſe of Virtue then makes its Appeal to the righteous Judge and Governor of the World, to chaſtiſe thoſe Enormities which are too ſtrong for the Laws of Men to correct and reſtrain.</p>
            <p>God ſeems to have taken us into his own Hands, to chaſtiſe us for our Rebellion and Diſobedience; and we have Reaſon to fear that the
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:007374_0014_102B8BE07A0C8110"/>
Earthquake with which he has viſited us, will be but the Beginning of our Sorrows, unleſs we hearken to his Voice, and turn at his Rebuke.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, let us all be perſuaded to improve that awful Diſpenſation, as a Motive to Repentance and Reformation. Like <hi>Saul</hi> in the midſt of his Aſtoniſhment, when he fell down trembling to the Earth, let us cry out, <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have us to do?</hi> And like the Jaylor, when he was ſurpriz'd with an Earthquake, let us make it our great Concern and Enquiry, <hi>What we ſhall do to be ſaved?</hi> Let us all hear the Rod, and him that appointed it: Let us ſearch our Ways, and our Hearts: Let us conſider what we have done to provoke the Holy One to Anger againſt us, and how much we have contributed to the public Flames and Judgments; and let us break off our Sins by Righteouſneſs, and our Iniquities by turning to the Lord. Let us all return unto the Lord as one Man, and then we may depend upon it, that the Lord will have Mercy upon us, and that our God will abundantly pardon us: <hi>As he hath torn, be will heal us; as he hath ſmitten, he will bind us up.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us look to God, that he would ſanctify this Diſpenſation to us, and that his Holy Spirit may be poured out upon us, as it was when the Place was ſhaken, where the primitive Chriſtians were aſſembled; as we read <hi>Acts</hi> 4.31. <hi>And when they had prayed, the Place was ſhaken where they were aſſembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghoſt, and they ſpake the Word of God with Boldneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What an happy Effect had the Earthquake in 1727, to awaken the Secure, to reform the Vicious, and to make all ſolicitous about their ſpiritual and everlaſting Concerns, as the Account is tranſmitted to us by a Perſon <note n="†" place="bottom">See an Appendix to the Rev. Mr. <hi>Prince</hi>'s Sermons after the Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake in <hi>1727.</hi>
               </note> of Obſervation and Integrity. Says he,
<q>The People are thereby thrown into the utmoſt Conſternation; and ſo mightily are many awakened, with the Senſe of their Danger, and the Divine Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, as has produc'd a wonderful Reformation. Profaneneſs, Drunkenneſs, and other Vices are abandoned, the earneſt Purſuits of the World diſcarded, the Places of public Religion throng'd, the Worſhip of God ſet up in prayerleſs Families, and great Numbers continually added to the flouriſhing Churches.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>What a Joy is there, even as the Joy of Harveſt, and as Men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice when they divide the Spoil! What an happy Effuſion of the Holy Spirit! And O! how ſhould this excite us, not only to glorify
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:007374_0015_102B8BE25DA658E8"/>
God for his Goodneſs among them, but alſo to deſire and pray that the ſame Grace may likewiſe be ſhewed to us, the ſame Spirit poured out upon us and ours, in the ſame glorious Meaſures. And how ſhould their Examples ſtir us up to a wiſe and happy Imitation! For the Fear of the Lord is the Beginning of Wiſdom, and a good Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding have all they that do his Commandments.</q>
Thus he.</p>
            <p>If the late Earthquake has the ſame Effect upon us and our Land, it will eventually prove an ineſtimable Bleſſing, as it will turn away the Anger of the Lord, and prevent further Tokens of his Diſpleaſure.</p>
            <p>Let us all then take the Alarm, and next to reforming ourſelves, let us exert ourſelves in our reſpective Capacities, for the Suppreſſion of Vice and Immorality, and for the Encouragement of Virtue and Religion.</p>
            <p>Thus, let thoſe who are clothed with Authority, be perſuaded to uſe it for the Suppreſſion of Vice and Immorality, and for the Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Virtue and good Order among us. As you are the Miniſters of God, ſo it is for the Good of the People; and what greater Good can you do, than to puniſh Vice and Immorality, which are a Reproach to a People, and involves them in the foreſt Calamities.</p>
            <p>Says the preſent Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> in a Letter about <hi>five</hi> Years ago upon a like Occaſion,
<q>I ſhould be wanting in the Duty I owe to the Higheſt as well as the Loweſt, ſhould I omit on this Occaſion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mind thoſe who are entruſted by their Country with Government, how much the Welfare of the People depends upon the faithful Execution of the Law. I pretend not to accuſe them particularly of Neglect, a general Neglect of this Kind, is one of the worſt Symptoms of the Times. Surely it is high Time to awake, and to let People once more know, what ſeems to be almoſt forgotten, that Laws were made for the Puniſhment of Wickedneſs and Vice, and for the Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of true Religion.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Government is a great Truſt, and the Powers of it are not intended meerly to do Honour to thoſe who have them, but muſt be uſed for the Good of the Community—If a Regard for the Public is not a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſtrong enough in this Caſe, let every Magiſtrate conſider that there is another of infinite Importance to himſelf; for if all Power be the Ordinance of God, he will undoubtedly demand an Account of the Exerciſe of it. And who is he that has ſo little to anſwer for up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his own Account, as willingly to ſubject himſelf to be anſwerable for the Sins of others, which either by his Encouragement, or his Connivance, he makes his own.</q>
Thus he</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:007374_0016_102B8BE47342F878"/>And not only ſhould Rulers, by a faithful Diſcharge of the Truſts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd in them, be a Terror to evil Doers, but by their Examples, they ſhould be a Praiſe and Encouragement to them that do well. If Rulers are not Examples of Virtue, it can never be expected that they will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage Vice. With what Face can he puniſh Vice, who is a Man of known Immorality, and of a moſt infamous and abandoned Character? Rulers are called <hi>Gods,</hi> and therefore ſhould endeavour to imitate the bleſſed God in his moral Perfections. An unholy God is a Contradiction in Terms: And how incongruous would it be, to ſee thoſe who are <hi>God's</hi> by Vicegerency and Deputation, live like Devils in the Indulgence of their Luſts.</p>
            <p>And thus alſo, let Parents and Heads of Families exert themſelves in their proper Places, and endeavour by their Example and Inſtruction, to recommend Religion and Virtue to thoſe under their Care. Great are the Obligations you are under hereunto, and great are the Expectations of God, and his People from you. If Youth are corrupted in their Religion and Morals, before they come into the World, there is but little Hopes that ever the World will reform them.</p>

            <p n="9">9. Let what we have heard, lead our Thoughts to that terrible Day of the Lord, which will come as a Thief in the Night, in the which the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens ſhall paſs away with a great Noiſe, and the Elements ſhall melt with fervent Heat, and the World, and all Things in it, ſhall be burnt up. Our bleſſed Saviour has given us frequent Warnings of that Day, and tells us, That when we hear of Wars, and Rumours of Wars, and of Earthquakes, that theſe Things are but the Beginning of Sorrows.</p>
            <p>And now, Brethren, <hi>ſeeing that all theſe Things ſhall be diſſolved, what Manner of Perſons ought ye to be in all holy Converſation and Godlineſs. Looking for and haſtening unto the Day of the Coming of God; wherein the Heavens being on Fire ſhall be diſſolved, and the Elements ſhall melt with fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Heat—Seeing that ye look for ſuch Things, be diligent, that ye may be found of him in Peace, without Spot, and blameleſs,</hi> AMEN.</p>
