            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT was in <hi>Compliance</hi> with the Deſire of an Honourable Friend that I <hi>Wrote</hi> both, &amp; <hi>Preach'd</hi> One, of thoſe ESSAYS which I now preſent unto his, and the Publick Acceptance. I did it from a perfect Concurrence I had with him, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Good men, in the Opinion, That a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Engines of Piety,</hi> wherewith our Good God has accommodated us, the <hi>Rainbow</hi> is one too much neglected with the Profeſſors of our Holy Religion. To Recover the <hi>Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow</hi> unto the Uſe of our <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Hope,</hi> and <hi>Joy,</hi> and thus to teach the <hi>Praiſing</hi> Tribe, the <hi>Uſe of the Bow,</hi> I ſaw to be ſo ſenſible a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice unto the <hi>Deſigns of Piety,</hi> that I could not but chearfully Embrace it. A very few Hours, and not many more, than the Modern Inſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion finds <hi>Colours</hi> in the <hi>Rainbow,</hi> made me an<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Owner of ſuch <hi>Thoughts</hi> upon my <hi>bright Theme,</hi> that I began to imagine, I had honeſt Old <hi>Bernards</hi> Imprimatur for them; <hi>Si metu forte, aut Segnitie, aut minus diſcreta Humilitat, Verbum bonum, quod poſſit prodeſſe multis, inutili, imo et damnabili Ligas Silentio, certe maledictus eris, qui Frumenta abſcondis in Populis.</hi> Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly

they are now offered unto the <hi>Children of the Covenant</hi> And One of the Things wanting in the <hi>Chriſtian Aſceticks</hi> is thus brought in to the Churches Treaſury.</p>
            <p>The Readers for whoſe Edification theſe <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayes</hi> are chiefly Calculated, are for the moſt part Plain men, <hi>Dwelling in Tents.</hi> It would rather <hi>puzzle</hi> ſuch Readers, than <hi>Inſtruct</hi> them, to give them a Lecture on the <hi>Mathematicks</hi> of the <hi>Rainbow</hi> Nor does the Author profeſs himſelf to be ſo much of a <hi>Mathematician,</hi> as to do it with the Exactneſs, wherewith it ought to be done, or to be any more than a <hi>Well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willer to ſuch Mathematicks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Famous Clergy-man of <hi>Spalato,</hi> in a Book <hi>De Radijs Viſus et Lucis,</hi> Written before the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the former Century, began <hi>Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matically</hi> to deſcribe how the <hi>Interior Bow</hi> of the <hi>Iris,</hi> is made in Round Drops of <hi>Rain,</hi> by a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraction of the Suns Light, and One Reflection between them; and the <hi>Exterior,</hi> by Two Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractions, and Two ſorts of Reflections between them, in each Drop of Water.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Deſcartes,</hi> (who don't uſe to betray his Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,) took the Hints from <hi>Antonius De Dominis,</hi> and went on <hi>Mathematically,</hi> and with much Demonſtration, to give us a Theory of the <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> from the Laws of <hi>Refraction,</hi> which <hi>Lucid Rayes</hi> do ſuffer in paſſing thro' Diaphanous Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. He clearly demonſtrated the <hi>primary I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> to be only, <hi>The Suns Image, reflected from the Concave Surfaces, of an Innumerable Quantity of

ſmall Sphaerical Drops of falling Rain, with this Neceſſary Circumſtance, that thoſe Rays which fell on the Objects, parallel to each other, ſhould not after One Reflection, and Two Refractions,</hi> (viz. <hi>At going into the Drop and coming out again</hi>) <hi>be Diſperſed, or made to diverge, but come back again alſo to the Eye, parallel to each other.</hi> The <hi>Secondary Iris</hi> he ſuppoſes <hi>produced by thoſe Rays of the Sun, which fall more obliquely, but after the ſame manner as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, only in theſe there are Two Reflections before the Suns Rays refracted a ſecond time, and tending towards his Eye, in a parallel Poſition, can get out from the Aqueous Globules.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Acute and Accurate Mr. <hi>Halley</hi> comes after the <hi>French</hi> Philoſopher, and ſhows how the <hi>Carteſian</hi> Problems were more eaſily ſolved than the Author himſelf imagined, He ſhows how to determine the Angle, by which the <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> is diſtant from the oppoſite Point of the Sun, and the <hi>Ratio</hi> of the Refraction being given Geometrically, or, <hi>Vice Verſa,</hi> the <hi>Iris</hi> being given, to determine the Refractive Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Liquor. And he goes on to Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate the Subject, with the Ingenuity pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to that accompliſhed Gentleman.</p>
            <p>But then comes the Admirable Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton;</hi> One whom I may venture to call The <hi>Perpetual Dictator</hi> of the Learned World in the <hi>Principles of Natural Philoſophy;</hi> and the moſt Sagacious Reaſoner upon the <hi>Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> that has yet Shone among Mankind; and which is the Crown of all, The moſt Vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious

Aſſertor of an Infinite GOD, that hath appeared in the bright Army of them that have driven the baffled Herd of <hi>Atheiſts</hi> away from the Tents of Humanity. This Rare Perſon, in his Incomparable Treatiſe of <hi>Opticks,</hi> has yet further Explained the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of the <hi>Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow;</hi> &amp; has not only ſhown how the <hi>Bow</hi> is made, but alſo how the COLOURS are form'd; How the Rays do ſtrike the Senſes, with the <hi>Colours,</hi> in the Order which is required by their Degrees of <hi>Refrangibility,</hi> in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs from the Inſide of the <hi>Bow</hi> to the <hi>Outſide;</hi> the <hi>Violet,</hi> the <hi>Indico,</hi> the <hi>Blue,</hi> the <hi>Green,</hi> the <hi>Yellow,</hi> the <hi>Orange,</hi> and the <hi>Red.</hi>

            <p>But if all my Countrymen could Read <hi>Ough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treds</hi> Characters, or ken the Terms &amp; Rules of <hi>Trigonometry,</hi> with the Doctrine of <hi>Fluxions;</hi> yet my Printer could not eaſily accommodate us, with the <hi>Schemes</hi> that would be needful for <hi>Dilucidation.</hi> The very few that would be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified with ſuch things, I leave to Conſult the Authors themſelves, &amp; ſhall proceed unto more <hi>Theological</hi> and <hi>Agreeable</hi> Contemplations.</p>

            <p>A Mind commonly forming of <hi>Good Thoughts,</hi> &amp; filled with them on all Occaſions is thereby really Ennobled and Enriched: And <hi>Thoughts</hi> do not more prove the <hi>Exiſtence</hi> of it, than <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Wiſe</hi> Ones will contribute unto its <hi>Felicity.</hi> Such a <hi>Mind</hi> makes a juſt claim, to the <hi>Dignity,</hi> which in REASON belongs unto it; and it <hi>has,</hi> yea, it <hi>makes,</hi> a ſort of <hi>Heaven</hi> for it ſelf, with an Holy Anticipation of the more Local Flight, it is e're long to take into the <hi>Heavenly World.</hi> It follows, that One of the beſt Kindneſſes that can be done unto the Children of Men, is to <hi>Supply</hi> them with <hi>Good Thoughts:</hi> One of the Kindeſt Offices that we can do for our Neighbours, is to awaken in them the <hi>Thought</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:001559_0009_0FB3B0DD6F5ABDE0"/>
of the <hi>Rational</hi> and <hi>Religious;</hi> and help them in <hi>Thinking</hi> on the Things wherein they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned. <hi>Of Writing many Books</hi> for this End, our <hi>Eccleſiaſtes</hi> long ſince adviſed, <hi>Let there be no End!</hi> Tho' the <hi>Study</hi> of Writing them ſhould be <hi>never ſuch a Wearineſs to the Fleſh,</hi> yet we will not be <hi>Weary of Well-doing</hi> in this way, nor count it a <hi>Vanity,</hi> in this way to go on with Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayes to cure <hi>Vanity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We are ſurrounded with the Preachers of Truth unto us; All the Elements are full of them: In all <hi>Creatures</hi> we have the Faithful <hi>Preachers;</hi> if we have but <hi>Ears to hear them.</hi> To put the <hi>Creatures</hi> unto ſuch an Uſe, as that of being Led by them unto <hi>Good Thoughts,</hi> and unto the due Acknowledgments of Their and Our Maker and Saviour; 'tis, to do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing towards the <hi>Reſtitution of all Things,</hi> unto the Primitive and Paradiſian State; yea, O <hi>Sons of God,</hi> it is a little to bring on the State, for <hi>which the whole Creation groaneth!</hi> Of our <hi>Duties,</hi> and of His <hi>Praiſes</hi> to whom we owe our Duties, I will ſay, <hi>Great is the Army that Publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them!</hi> And the Kingdom of METEORS has raiſed for us a particular Army of <hi>Monitors;</hi> among which there is none that makes a more Illuſtrious Figure, than <hi>One</hi> which I am go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to reſcue from the Neglect, with which it has been too much diſregarded &amp; overlooked in a World, which owes more pious Regards unto it.</p>

            </p>
            <p>'Tis a <hi>Theological</hi> Conſideration of this <hi>Meteor</hi> that is now propoſed. <hi>The Goſpel of the Rainbow,</hi> is the Theme I have undertaken very briefly to treat upon. I take the <hi>Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow</hi> to be intended, when we read of <hi>Bright Clouds.</hi> The Glorious One, directed His Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to <hi>Ask Rain</hi> of Him; <hi>a moderate Rain</hi> in
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:001559_0011_0FB3B0E0953E9940"/>
the Time that ſhould render it Seaſonable and Serviceable. It is hereupon promiſed, <hi>So the Lord ſhall make Bright Clouds:</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>Clouds brightned with the Rainbow;</hi> and ſuch as a <hi>Moderate Rain,</hi> uſes to be diſtilled from. Compare <hi>Job</hi> XXVII. 11. We often enjoy this Favour of Heaven; but I am now to bring you the <hi>Goſpel</hi> of it. And my Treatiſe muſt begin with a Complaint, That the <hi>Chriſtian World</hi> have taken ſo little Notice of a <hi>Meteor,</hi> upon which the <hi>Great God that formed all things,</hi> has put ſuch a Stamp of peculiar Excellency. It has pleaſed His Infinite Majeſty, to Stamp a <hi>Sacramental Character</hi> upon it, and make it as a <hi>Sacrament</hi> of His <hi>Covenant</hi> with the Children of Men. We all know, that when the Patriarch <hi>Noah,</hi> with his Family, came out of the <hi>Ark,</hi> the Glorious GOD <hi>comforted</hi> him, and his Poſterity, with ſuch an Advice as this; Gen. IX. 13.— 17. <hi>I ſet my Bow in the Cloud, and it ſhall be for a To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of a Covenant, between Me, and the Earth. And it ſhall come to paſs, when I bring a Cloud over the Earth, that the Bow ſhall be ſeen in the Cloud; and I will Look upon it, that I may Remember the Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Covenant between God, and every living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of all Fleſh that is upon the Earth. And God ſaid unto</hi> Noah, <hi>This is the Token of the Covenant which I have Eſtabliſhed between Me and all Fleſh that is upon the Earth.</hi> I believe the Biſhop of <hi>Milain</hi> is the only Author in the World, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver underſtood this <hi>Bow</hi> of any other than the <hi>Rainbow.</hi> Now, certainly after this, When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:001559_0012_0FB3B0E2CFD7DCC8"/>
a <hi>Rainbow</hi> is Exhibited, there is a Sett of <hi>Good Thoughts,</hi> with which it ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be Look'd upon. But God is not Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied upon the view of the <hi>Rainbow</hi> ſo Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly, ſo Devoutly, and with ſuch <hi>Good Thoughts,</hi> as ought to be: nor does it gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally put us upon ſuch <hi>Reflections</hi> of Chriſtianity, as might be expected from a People of our Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminations in the <hi>Covenant</hi> of the Glorious Lord. I muſt not make a <hi>Fruitleſs Complaint;</hi> and therefore my Deſign is, now to fit ſome <hi>Arrows</hi> for the <hi>Bow</hi> of God, and make ready a <hi>Quiver</hi> of <hi>Good Thoughts,</hi> Which are to be ſhot from that <hi>Bow</hi> into the Minds of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, as often as it appears unto us.</p>
            <p>Indeed the <hi>Firſt Uſe</hi> that we unavoidably make of the <hi>Rainbow,</hi> will be in a way of <hi>Admiration.</hi> Tis truly an <hi>Admirable</hi> Spectacle. The Spectator of it, is to be called forth in thoſe Terms; Job XXXVII. 14. <hi>Stand ſtill, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Wondrous Works of God.</hi> And this the more Emphatically, becauſe the <hi>Rainbow</hi> appears in the very next words of <hi>Elihu;</hi> for the <hi>Rainbow</hi> is meant in thoſe words, <hi>He cauſes the Light of His Cloud to ſhine.</hi> The Pagan Theology makes the <hi>Rainbow,</hi> to be the <hi>Daughter</hi> of <hi>Thaumas</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] becauſe of the <hi>Wonderment</hi> wherewith we behold it; It is to us, we would rather ſay, The <hi>Mother of Wonderment.</hi> But the <hi>Wonders</hi> which it raiſes in our Minds, ought to be tuned into <hi>Praiſes</hi> of the <hi>Great God,</hi> whoſe <hi>Strength is in the Clouds,</hi> &amp;
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:001559_0013_0FB3B0E461AF5638"/>
who diſplays His Power there. HE is to be Admired &amp; Adored, &amp; with Devout Souls, we are to Look through the <hi>Bright Clouds,</hi> &amp; ſhoot up our <hi>Hallelujahs. Glorious LORD, How Various and how Beauteous are thy Works! With what Wiſdom and what Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty haſt thou made them all!</hi> The Leſſon is <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocryphal,</hi> but Agreeable, which was long ſince given by the Son of <hi>Sirach;</hi> [Eccleſ. XLIII. 11, 12.] <hi>Look upon the Rainbow, and praiſe Him that made it; very beautiful it is in the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs thereof; It compaſſes the Heaven above with a Glorious Circle, and the Hands of the moſt High have bended it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But we may not, we will not flop here. We will go on to ſuch an <hi>Uſeful Contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of the <hi>Rainbow</hi> as may render it a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Inſtrument of Piety,</hi> in our whole Converſation. I ſhall not Enquire <hi>into</hi> the old Opinion, that the Spots of <hi>Earth,</hi> where the <hi>Feet</hi> of the <hi>Rainbow</hi> ſtrike, are made ſingularly <hi>Fruitful</hi> by the Influences or it. But I am ſure, the <hi>Rainbow</hi> ſtriking on our Minds, may produce many Sweet <hi>Fruits</hi> of Pious <hi>Meditation.</hi> When it pleaſes the Holy One to bring out His <hi>Rainbow</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our View, Let us Glorify Him, and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate</hi> ſuch things as theſe upon it.</p>

               <p>There is no room to doubt the Relation which the <hi>Moſaic Records</hi> have given us, of that aſtoniſhing Revolution, The FLOOD, wherein all Mankind, except the One Family of a Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous <hi>Noah,</hi> periſhed.

It was acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the moſt Ancient Writers among the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, quoted by <hi>Joſephus,</hi> and by <hi>Euſebius,</hi> and by <hi>Cyril,</hi> and others. <hi>Plutarch</hi> alſo has the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the <hi>Dove</hi> in the <hi>Flood</hi> ſent out of the <hi>Ark.</hi> Tis demonſtrated likewiſe by <hi>Kirker</hi> in his <hi>Arca Noae,</hi> that the <hi>Deucalion</hi> of Antiquity was our <hi>Noah.</hi> Yea, The Tradition of a General <hi>Flood,</hi> was every where Currant for Thouſands of years

The Fancies and Fictions which <hi>Burnet</hi> has offered us in his <hi>Theory,</hi> (proved by <hi>Ramazzini,</hi> to be no other, than what <hi>Patritius</hi> an <hi>Italian,</hi> Publiſhed as a part of the <hi>Abyſſertian</hi> Philoſophy, an hundred and fifty years ago,) have met with ſharp caſtigations, from them, who have had at heart, the cauſe &amp; credit of the Sacred Scriptures. But, As of old, a <hi>Muſician</hi> being asked, a Definition of the <hi>Soul,</hi> his anſwer was, Tis an <hi>Harmony!</hi> An anſwer that had a Tincture of his own Profeſſion in it: So, I do not wonder, when I obſerve, what the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations of Some Gentlemen on this Noble Subject, are tinged withal. A Profeſſor of the <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> brings in a <hi>Comet,</hi> as producing all
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:001559_0017_0FB3B0EA72A25B48"/>
the hideous hurly burly of the <hi>Flood,</hi> by approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too near our Globe, in its Elliptick Motion. A Nation (of <hi>Whiſtons</hi>) that is not without its Probabilities: And agreeably to it, ſome Learned Men, foretel the Appearance of another <hi>Comet,</hi> [For old <hi>Seneca's</hi> Prediction about ſuch Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions is now accompliſhed!] which may bring our Globe, under the other Deſtruction, for which, we know, it is reſerved. Nor am I with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Suſpicions, That a <hi>Comet</hi> may be intended by the <hi>Vapour of Smoke,</hi> which is to bring on the <hi>Great and Notable Day of the Lord;</hi> which alſo is moſt Literally, <hi>A Star falling from Heaven:</hi> And ſome think, A World in a <hi>State of Puniſhment!</hi> A Profeſſor of <hi>Chymiſtry,</hi> from what he had ſeen in the Efferveſcence between an <hi>Acid</hi> and an <hi>Alcali,</hi> concludes, that there are great <hi>Cavities</hi> in the Bowels of the Earth, full of <hi>Water;</hi> that <hi>Minerals</hi> are generated in theſe <hi>Cavities;</hi> that by the colluctation of ſeveral Salts meeting toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther here, an Air was generated, which cauſed horrendous <hi>Earthquakes;</hi> that ſome of the Exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation Eſcaping into our open Air, it produced vaſt <hi>Rains,</hi> with ſuch Thunder and Lightning, as filled the Ungodly Men with a moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding Amazement; and that by the Air ſtill Encloſed under ground, the <hi>Water</hi> of the <hi>Abyſs,</hi> raged and ſwelled, and broke out, &amp; overflow'd the higheſt Mountains. This (of <hi>St. Clairs</hi>) as probably conjectured as the other, I will paſs over Mr. <hi>Delaprymes</hi> Imagination, That God broke the Foundations, Pillars, and Hollows, of the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:001559_0018_0FB3B0EBDE06EB90"/>
Earth, which till then had ſtood above the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The continual <hi>Rains</hi> help'd forward the Diſſolution; the Earth yielded, and ſunk down; it and all the wicked Burden of it, Subſided, and was abſorb'd in the Sea, which now covers it; As this <hi>Old Earth</hi> fell in, our <hi>New Earth</hi> roſe up; This was lifted up, to ballance the other; and as it Roſe, the Waters rolled off, and left it at length to be what it is. This conjecture, ſeems liable to more objections than the former; and will have little but <hi>Plato's</hi> Tradition of the vaſt Iſland Swallow'd up in the <hi>Atlantick Ocean,</hi> to Support it. Our <hi>Warren</hi> takes the Account of the Flood given in the Sacred Scriptures, to be Sufficiently Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, by Saying; That there were vaſt <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns,</hi> filled with <hi>Waters,</hi> in the <hi>Antediluvian</hi> Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains. The Great GOD <hi>broke them open,</hi> and they came rolling down, and over-turning all that was in the way of the Mighty Inundation. At the ſame time, there fell prodigious <hi>Rains</hi> for Forty Dayes together. It was impoſſible for People to aſcend theſe Mountains, when the Waters were iſſuing out from them, with ſuch an impetuous Power &amp; Plenty: and the Loaden <hi>Clouds,</hi> hanging &amp; bagging about them, Empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves there, like preſſed Spunges, and ran down in irreſiſtible Torrents. Doubtleſs, the <hi>Air</hi> was full of <hi>Water-ſpouts,</hi> like the <hi>Exhydriae,</hi> which are at Sea ſometimes met withal; and the Hills were full of <hi>Cataracts</hi> Poured out by the Vengeance of God. This Gentleman, finds e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough here to drown the World; and thinks
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:001559_0019_0FB3B0EE55E57030"/>
there is no Neceſſity of underſtanding the Bible, as if the <hi>Waters</hi> of the <hi>Flood,</hi> were <hi>Fifteen Cubits</hi> above the <hi>Tops</hi> of the <hi>Higheſt Mountains.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is an Excellent <hi>Ray,</hi> who will bring us yet more <hi>Light,</hi> concerning this wondrous Revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. According to <hi>him,</hi> the <hi>Windows of Heaven</hi> were now <hi>Opened,</hi> by the Quantities of <hi>Water,</hi> deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from thence; all the <hi>Water</hi> Suſpended in the <hi>Air</hi> deſcending on the <hi>Earth.</hi> The <hi>Fountains of the Great Deep</hi> were now alſo <hi>broken up,</hi> in that the <hi>Subterraneous Waters</hi> which communicate with the <hi>Sea,</hi> did thro' great Apertures ruſh out upon the World. But for the cauſe of all this, he Suppoſes, that the Glorious God, now changed the <hi>Center</hi> of the <hi>Earth,</hi> and ſet it nearer to the Middle of that <hi>Haemiſphere,</hi> which was then prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally inhabited! Here-upon the <hi>Atlantick</hi> and <hi>Pacifick</hi> Oceans, muſt needs preſs upon the <hi>Subterraneous Abyſs.</hi> By the Mediation thereof, they muſt force the Water upward, and compel it to run out at thoſe <hi>Wide Mouthes,</hi> which the Indignation of God had made for it. The <hi>Water</hi> poured out from theſe direful Orifices, upon the Earth, muſt needs overflow it; until the Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent God reſtored the former Center of the World Finally; The Incomparable Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton,</hi> judges the Univerſal <hi>Flood,</hi> cannot have better, and fairer Account given of it, than this, To Suppoſe the <hi>Center</hi> of <hi>Gravitation</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved for a Time, towards the Middle of the then inhabited Parts of the World: And a change of its Place, but the Two Thouſandth

part of the <hi>Radius</hi> of this Globe, were enough to bury the <hi>Tops</hi> of the <hi>Higheſt Mountains</hi> under <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> But we have notorious Proofs, in our <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneous Occurrences,</hi> that the <hi>Flood</hi> reached unto <hi>America</hi> too. I add therefore, the ſame cauſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perating a little further, would over-whelm <hi>this,</hi> as well as the other <hi>Haemiſphere.</hi> After all, we may truly ſay, that there was a concurrence of <hi>many Cauſes,</hi> to bring on the Deluge. It is admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, that <hi>Seneca,</hi> treating of that <hi>Fatal Day,</hi> (which he dreamt of, as being ſtill to come,) <hi>when a Deluge is to come;</hi> He joyns together <hi>many Cauſes</hi> for ſuch a thing; but all concurring, <hi>Uno agmine ad Exitium humani generis.</hi> But he does it in ſuch Terms, that the Acute <hi>Heidegger</hi> cryes out; <hi>Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio ita concepta eſt, ut de induſtria Explicare voluiſſe</hi> Moſen <hi>videri Poſſet.</hi> And <hi>Patrick</hi> after him; <hi>His Words are written, as if he had been directed to make a Commentary upon</hi> Moſes.</p>

               <p>But, my moſt Honour'd BLACKMORE, Do thou take this Theme into thy Maſterly hand. Let thy Matchleſs, and Immortal, and Envied Pen, adorn ſo Stupendous a Subject.

               <p>What remains, is, That the view of the <hi>Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow</hi> calls us to look back upon the Deſolation which the <hi>Flood</hi> once brought upon a <hi>Well-peopled</hi> World. <hi>Well-peopled,</hi> I may ſay; For conſidering the <hi>Longevity</hi> of the <hi>Antediluvians,</hi> it is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely, <hi>That more People Periſhed in the Flood, than there be now alive in the World.</hi> Suppoſe a Man to have Children, at ſixty years of Age, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the next forty years to have Twenty Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.

filled with Violence. God Looked upon the Earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all Fleſh had corrupted His way upon the Earth.</hi> Behold then, to what our <hi>Meditation</hi> ſhall carry us, on this occaſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>O Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty. The Sin of Mankind once Provoked thee, to deſtroy a World of Men, with a dreadful Flood of thy Wrath; and with them, to deſtroy all the works of their Hands; to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Creatures alſo, which by their Sin were Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted and Polluted unto other Purpoſes, than thoſe for which thou hadst created them. I ſee, I ſee, Thou art of Purer Eyes, than to behold Evil, and thou canſt not Look upon Iniquity. Oh! the Evil of Sin! Oh! what a Deſtroying Evil! My God, Affect me with deep Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of that Monſtrous Evil. Oh! let me not be one of the Fools, that ſhall make Light of ſuch a Match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Evil. Make me moſt Particularly afraid of the Sins, which were moſt reigning among the Antediluvian Sinners; Afraid of that Intemperance, that Unchaſtity, that Oppreſſion and Injuſtice, for which the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Sinners before the Flood, are branded in thine Oracles. Oh! Do not leave me to do thoſe abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Things, which are hated by thy Soul, O my God!</hi>

as we ſee the <hi>Rainbow,</hi> and Say; <hi>Bleſſed be our Gracious and Merciful and Long-ſuffering Lord, who hath Swarn, that the Waters of Noah ſhall go over the Earth no more!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before I go any further, I Suppoſe, it will be Expected; that we a little Conſider that noted Queſtion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whether there were any <hi>Rainbow</hi> before the Flood?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer two things. Firſt; There is nothing in <hi>Scripture,</hi> no, nor <hi>Nature</hi> neither, to aſſure us, that <hi>there was.</hi> We are not ſure, that the Conſtitution of the <hi>Air,</hi> and of the <hi>Clouds,</hi> before the <hi>Flood,</hi> was the ſame, that it was afterwards. We are ſure, that the <hi>Flood</hi> brought a Marvellous Alteration on the World; probably on the <hi>Air,</hi> as well as on the <hi>Earth.</hi> Doubtleſs the New Conſtitution of the <hi>Air,</hi> was that which had a Share in changing the Conſtitution of our <hi>Bodies,</hi> till there came on that <hi>Abbrevation</hi> of Humane Life, which we are now brought unto. Dr. <hi>Jackſon</hi> argues, That if other <hi>Natural Cauſes</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the <hi>Final,</hi> which we are taught in the <hi>Scriptural Philoſophy,</hi> we may well think, that the <hi>Air</hi> before the <hi>Flood,</hi> had not the peculiar Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, which is required unto the Production of the <hi>Rainbow;</hi> which then had not ſuch an <hi>End,</hi> as that for which it is now Employ'd by the Glorious God. It is now a <hi>Meſſenger,</hi> that Reports and Confirms unto the <hi>New World,</hi> the <hi>Covenant</hi> of God, for the Preſervation of it. If it had been a common appearance unto the <hi>Old
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:001559_0024_0FB3B0F9634BBC70"/>
World,</hi> it would ſcarce have appeared now with ſo Confirming and Comforting an Efficacy, to <hi>Noah</hi> and his timerous Poſterity.</p>
               <p>But then, Secondly; Tho' <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> thinks there was no <hi>Rainbow</hi> before the <hi>Flood,</hi> and many Chriſtians alſo deny the <hi>Antediluvian</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence of it; yet very many will ſay with my Learned <hi>Helvetian, Oppido falluntur;</hi> They are very much miſtaken. The Army of them, who Engage on this ſide, will have no leſs than a Great <hi>Calvin,</hi> for a <hi>Standard-bearer.</hi> The Lord ſpeaks not of the <hi>Rainbow</hi> as a <hi>New Thing;</hi> He ſeems to ſpeak of it, as a Thing that had been already placed in the <hi>Clouds; I have ſet my Bow in the Cloud.</hi> He invites us rather to Look on the <hi>New Uſe</hi> which He aſſigns unto it. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a <hi>Rainbow</hi> before the <hi>Flood.</hi> Why, ſo 'tis in all our <hi>Sacramental Elements.</hi> The <hi>Water,</hi> the <hi>Bread,</hi> the <hi>Wine,</hi> that are uſed in our <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> did Exiſt before; This is no prejudice to the <hi>Sacramental Importance,</hi> which they carry with them, after a <hi>Conſecration</hi> from Heaven for that purpoſe on them.

               <p>But then, I propoſe, that our Thoughts go on to Conſider, on <hi>whoſe,</hi> and on <hi>what</hi> Account the World comes to be ſo ſpared by the Lord.</p>
               <p>When the Lord ſays unto <hi>Noah, With thee will I eſtabliſh my Covenant,</hi> it is a Remark of <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> upon it; That this refers to the <hi>Covenant</hi> made at the Beginning, about the <hi>Promiſed Seed,</hi> that was to break the <hi>Old Serpents Head.</hi> This <hi>Covenant</hi> is now Renewed and Aſſured unto <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah;</hi> who now being ſatisfied, That the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> was to deſcend from him, he could no longer doubt, that God would have a <hi>Church</hi> continued among his Poſterity. Accordingly, When we think on the <hi>Preſervation</hi> of the World, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with the <hi>Rainbow,</hi> it ſhould be with ſuch Thoughts as theſe; <hi>Tis for thy ſake, O our
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:001559_0027_0FB3B0FDB76FF888"/>
Saviour, that ſuch a Sinful World is preſerved. O Juſt One, Thou art the Everlaſting Foundation that the World ſtands upon! Oh! What ſhall we do for thee, and for thy Service, Thou Preſerver of Men!</hi> The Name of <hi>Nazarene,</hi> ſignifies, <hi>A Preſerver.</hi> Our JESUS of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> is our Glorious <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarene.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And then, as it is well remark'd by <hi>Hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>degger;</hi> The CHURCH of God has a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, a peculiar Concernment, in this <hi>Covenant</hi> of the <hi>Rainbow.</hi> The <hi>Churches</hi> coming to <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> by the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and ſo the <hi>Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> of the <hi>Righteous,</hi> lies Enwrapped in it. And that paſſage, <hi>Neither ſhall all Fleſh be cut off,</hi> carries an Intimation, that God will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the God of <hi>All Nations,</hi> and bring ſome of <hi>All Nations</hi> into His Kingdom. Indeed, the <hi>Preſervation</hi> of all <hi>Creatures,</hi> is for the ſake of the <hi>Church. All is yours!</hi> It was no miſtake in <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus; Pactum cum Noe Prefiguravit Faedus Chriſti cum Eccleſia.</hi> But he might have ſaid more than ſo. Indeed, The Signification of the <hi>Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow</hi> is to be ſo Summed up; <q>That there ſhall not come another <hi>Univerſal Flood</hi> upon the World; but that God will preſerve a <hi>Church</hi> in the World; and make it <hi>Righteous,</hi> &amp; bring it to <hi>Inherit the World;</hi> and all this, for the ſake of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> whom we find afterwards ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing with a <hi>Rainbow</hi> about Him.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Our Saviour has a <hi>People</hi> in the World; A <hi>People,</hi> that believe in Him; that follow His Conduct; that in the way of Obedience to
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:001559_0028_0FB3B0FF51D77970"/>
Him, Look for a Reſurrection from the Dead, unto the Bleſſedneſs of a Better World. He will always have ſuch a <hi>People.</hi> All the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Darkneſs have been always carrying on a Deſign to Extinguiſh this <hi>People,</hi> and Leave no true <hi>Church</hi> of our Saviour in the World. This <hi>Catholick Church</hi> has been the Torment of the <hi>Devil,</hi> the Envy and Eye-ſore of his <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;</hi> both his Inviſible and his Incarnate <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions.</hi> Horrible <hi>Floods of the Ungodly</hi> have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten threatned the Ruine of the <hi>Church; Floods</hi> of <hi>Corruptions; Floods</hi> of <hi>Haereſies; Floods</hi> of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions.</hi> If our Great Saviour had not laid a ſtrange Reſtraint upon them, there had not been Left any true <hi>Church</hi> upon Earth. <hi>If the Lord had not been on our ſide,</hi> may the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful now ſay, <hi>If the Lord had not been on our ſide, the Waters had overwhelmed us, the Streams had gone over our Soul.</hi> There are marvellous Repetitions of that Obſervation; <hi>The Wrath of Hell does but Praiſe the Lord, and the Remainder of that Wrath does He Reſtrain!</hi> Hence, When the <hi>Church-ſtate</hi> has been Deſerted, Betrayed, Quite gone, in one place; and the <hi>Children of the Kingdom</hi> have Sinned it away, and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned themſelves into <hi>Outer Darkneſs,</hi> it has been produced immediately in another place; the <hi>Kingdom</hi> has been tranſlated unto <hi>Other People,</hi> that have <hi>brought forth the Fruits thereof.</hi> This, This is the Voice of the <hi>Rainbow</hi> unto us, <hi>Be Encouraged, O People of God: Let things Look never ſo diſmally, your Saviour will have a
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:001559_0029_0FB3B100A384D988"/>
Faithful People in the World: He will come down from the Machin of Heaven where you now ſee this Rainbow, and reſcue His Church, when things come to an Extremity, and it Looks as if its Help were gone; and as if there were none ſhut up or left.</hi> Sirs, What can we now do, but return that Joyful Echo; <hi>Lord, I believe thy Promiſe for thy People; Oh! Let me be one of that Holy People.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It may be Enquired, How far this Faith may be Exerciſed, with Relation to any <hi>Particular Church,</hi> which may have any <hi>Floods</hi> aſſaulting and hazarding of it; How far the <hi>Promiſe</hi> may be applied unto this or that <hi>Particular Church</hi> in the Dangers of it? It muſt be ſadly confeſſed; Some <hi>Churches</hi> are utterly Drown'd in the <hi>Floods</hi> which the Divine Indignation pours in upon them. <hi>Every one</hi> of thoſe that are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in our Bible, alas, <hi>Every one</hi> of them have been ſo. All of thoſe many Thouſands that once were in <hi>Aſia,</hi> and in <hi>Africa,</hi> have been ſo. Several Thouſands in <hi>Europe,</hi> even in our Dayes have been ſo. But we may ſay, Never, until the <hi>Covenant</hi> of God has been grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly neglected, ſhamefully deſpiſed in them. Let there be a Godly People in a <hi>Church,</hi> and let theſe Humbly plead with God, His <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> and repreſent His <hi>Rainbow</hi> before Him, in the Diſtreſſes of that <hi>Church;</hi> and let the <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> of the <hi>Covenant</hi> then be Livelily Proſecuted there. <hi>Then!</hi> That Church will be that <hi>Houſe,</hi> whereof we read, <hi>The Rain deſcends, the Floods come, and the Winds blow, and beat upon the Houſe; and it falls not, for it is founded on a Rock.</hi>

                  <hi>A Glorious CHRIST! How can I Look to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven at any Time, and eſpecially NOW! without ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhing Thoughts of Him and of His Glories!</hi> The <hi>Rainbow</hi> will many wayes put us in mind of our Admirable Saviour. He would not have appeared with a <hi>Rainbow</hi> about Him, as He did in the Viſions both of <hi>Ezekiel</hi> and of <hi>John,</hi> if He did not intend that the <hi>Rainbow</hi> ſhould Lead us to think of Him. Shall we ſay, That the <hi>Covenant</hi> on which our Eternal Safety depends, is made with our <hi>Saviour?</hi> Tis verily ſo; The Agreement is between God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and our <hi>Saviour.</hi> He is <hi>our Head;</hi> We are nothing but what we are <hi>in Him.</hi> Shall we go on to ſay, That all the <hi>Good</hi> Engaged unto us in the <hi>Covenant</hi> of our Safety, is owing to our <hi>Saviour?</hi> Tis verily ſo; Our <hi>Saviour</hi> is the <hi>Purchaſer</hi> of it all; the <hi>Diſpenſer</hi> of it all.

               </p>
               <p>I will proceed; There are ſome, who would find in the <hi>Rainbow</hi> it ſelf, ſome Intimations of

                  <hi>Tho' a Watery Flood that may drown the World, is no more to be fear'd, yet there is a Fiery Flood, for the depredations whereof a miſerable World is grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing horribly combuſtible.</hi> There is a Deſolation to come on this Lower World, which the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings

of the Ancients mention under the Name of, <hi>Diluvium Ignis;</hi> a <hi>Fiery Flood.</hi> Some think, the Heathen themſelves had ſome Notion of this, Lying under the <hi>Embers</hi> of their Fable, that made <hi>Pyrrha,</hi> (a Name that carries, <hi>Fire</hi> in it,) the Wife of their <hi>Deucalion.</hi> Tis well-known, that their Philoſophers tell of, an, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or, <hi>Conflagration,</hi> which the World is one day to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo. The Oracles of the Sacred Scripture have poſitively declared it; 2 Pet. III. 7. <hi>The Heavens and Earth which are now, be reſerved unto Fire, againſt the Day of Judgment, and Perdition of Ungodly Men.</hi> And ſome read it, in the very <hi>Colours</hi> of the <hi>Rainbow;</hi> as plainly Legible there as ever it could be upon <hi>Seths</hi> Pillars of old: The <hi>Watery</hi> Colour Leads them, to think on the <hi>Water</hi> which once deſtroy'd the World. The <hi>Graſſy</hi> Colour Leads them, to think on the <hi>Day of Patience</hi> which God now allows unto the World, to bring forth <hi>Fruit</hi> unto Him: The <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery</hi> Colour Leads them to think, on that <hi>Fire</hi> which is e're long to conſume the World. Be that as it will; It is moſt certain from our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies of a Divine Inſpiration, (and there can be no <hi>Colour</hi> for the Infidelity that queſtions it,) That the World which was once <hi>Drowned,</hi> is e're long to be <hi>Burned. By Fire will the Lord plead with all Fleſh, and the Slain of the Lord ſhall be many.</hi> 'Tis true, In the Circumſtances of the <hi>Conflagration</hi> to be Expected, there are <hi>Some things hard to be underſtood.</hi> It ſeems that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent of our Saviour, at, and for the Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and the Beginning of the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Millennium,</hi> will not be without a <hi>Conflagrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> Then, <hi>Our God ſhall come, and a Fire ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour before Him, and it ſhall be very Tempeſtuous round about Him.</hi> Then a <hi>Fire ſhall go before the Lord, that ſhall burn up His Enemies round about, and Lightnings will Enlighten the World, and the Earth ſhall tremble, and the Hills melt like Wax, at the preſence of the Lord.</hi> But it looks as if this <hi>Conflagration</hi> would be <hi>Partial</hi> &amp; <hi>Progreſſive.</hi> The firſt and main Effects of it, will be on the <hi>Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Territories. And a <hi>Total Conſumption</hi> of the whole world is not as yet to be accompliſhed. The Things then to come on, are thoſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we have thoſe Acclamations; <hi>Let the Earth be Glad, Let the Field be Joyful, Let all the Trees of the Wood Rejoyce.</hi> A <hi>Total Conſumption</hi> of them, could not be propoſed as that wherein they might <hi>be Glad,</hi> and <hi>be Joyful,</hi> and <hi>Rejoyce.</hi> No; the <hi>Earneſt expectation of the Creature, waiting for the manifeſtation of the Sons of God,</hi> is now to be accompliſhed. That for which the <hi>Whole Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion groaneth,</hi> even to be <hi>brought into the glorious Liberty of the Children of God,</hi> is now to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed. The worſt that can then be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, is what <hi>Salonius</hi> of old, Expreſs'd as the Senſe of many more; <hi>Caelum et Terra tranſibunt per Meliorationem, non per Oblationem.

               <p>Nor Secondly, was it intended for a Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of our Three Graces; <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Hope,</hi> and <hi>Love.</hi> Yet I find ſome, drawn from the <hi>Three Colours</hi> which were all that Antiquity di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed in the <hi>Rainbow</hi> into a <hi>Tropological</hi> Meditation on the <hi>Three Graces.</hi> And it will do us no Hurt on this Occaſion, to lift up our
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:001559_0038_0FB3B10FAB8BB868"/>
Hearts unto the <hi>God of all Grace,</hi> with our Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications; <hi>Lord, Let me have an Holy Faith, and Hope, and Love, ever ſhining in my Soul!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It has been on all hands agreed, That in the <hi>Rainbow,</hi> we have, the <hi>Mercy</hi> of our God, in Lively Colours Painted out unto us. And ſome will more Particularly have the <hi>Three Colours</hi> of <hi>Red,</hi> and <hi>Green,</hi> and <hi>Blue,</hi> in the <hi>Rainbow,</hi> to intimate the ſweet Mixture of <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Mercy,</hi> accompliſhed by the <hi>Blood</hi> of the <hi>Covenant.</hi> But it is a Prejudice to thoſe <hi>Niceties,</hi> that the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours of the <hi>Rainbow</hi> are more than <hi>Three,</hi> This however, may, Thirdly, be a very Proper Meditation on the Sight of the <hi>Rainbow.</hi> It Proclames the <hi>Mercy</hi> of God unto a Sinful World. Yea, how <hi>Emblematically!</hi> It was noted by <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi> of old; That our God ſayes, <hi>I will put my Bow in the Cloud.</hi> He ſayes nothing of any <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows.</hi> Tis a <hi>Bow</hi> without <hi>Arrows.</hi> When we ſee this <hi>Bow,</hi> let us then call to mind the <hi>Mercy</hi> of our God; and with a Grateful Soul acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, Lam. III. 22. <hi>It is of the Lord's Mercies, that we are not Conſumed; becauſe His Compaſſions fail not.</hi> Indeed as the <hi>Rainbow</hi> is formed in a <hi>Cloud,</hi> (which <hi>Commenius</hi> obſerves,) <hi>a Luce in millies millenis diffluentu Nubis Guttulis div<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rſimode reflexa:</hi> the <hi>Mercies</hi> of our God unto us, are far more than the <hi>Drops</hi> in that <hi>Cloud. Lord, How great is the Sum of them!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Mercy</hi> of God, holds out the <hi>Rainbow,</hi> like the <hi>Scepter</hi> of old, and invites the worſt of men, to come in unto Him, with an Exerciſe of
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:001559_0039_0FB3B11125EAC1B0"/>
true Repentance. He ſayes to the <hi>Rainbow,</hi> as in Jer. III. 12, 13. <hi>Go, and Proclaim theſe words, and ſay, Return, and I will not cauſe my Anger to fall upon you, for I am Merciful, ſaith the Lord: Only acknowledge thine Iniquity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But then, there are two Circumſtances of the <hi>Rainbow,</hi> that carry much Admonition in them. And there alſo, are to be taken into your Meditation.</p>
               <p>Firſt. The <hi>Bow</hi> is only to be ſeen <hi>above the Earth.</hi> Accordingly, tis only in this Life, and while we are yet <hi>above the Earth,</hi> that we have our Opportunity to lay Hold on the <hi>Offered Mercy</hi> of God. <hi>Lord, They that go down into the Pit, cannot hope for thy Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Tho' the <hi>Bow</hi> has no <hi>Arrows</hi> upon it, yet the <hi>Impenitent</hi> will find, the Great GOD, has His <hi>Quiver full</hi> of them. The Great God has Treaſures of Wrath, and fearful Reſerves of Plagues for the <hi>Impenitent.</hi> He ſayes, <hi>I will heap Miſchiefs upon them, I will ſpend my Arrows upon them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I paſs on, to take notice, in the Fourth place; of ſome <hi>Leſſons</hi> which the <hi>Rainbow</hi> may give us, concerning the <hi>Covenant</hi> and the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of our Saviour. Some of the moſt <hi>Judicious</hi> Men in the World, and ſuch as have been the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt from indulging and humouring a roving <hi>Fancy,</hi> have ye noted ſuch Things as theſe. The <hi>Rainbow</hi> never fills a <hi>Circle,</hi> nor makes more than a <hi>Semicircle.</hi> The Kingdom of our Lord in His Church, has in this thing a Picture
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:001559_0040_0FB3B112A3565F18"/>
of it. It is part <hi>on Earth;</hi> part <hi>Above.</hi> Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour was <hi>on Earth</hi> when He Suffered for us, and began His Kingdom; He went up from <hi>Earth</hi> to <hi>Heaven;</hi> and will come down from <hi>Heaven</hi> to <hi>Earth</hi> again. The <hi>Afflictions</hi> attending the Kingdom of our Lord in the World, and the <hi>Enemies</hi> not yet all wholly ſubdued, make the Condition of a <hi>Semicircle</hi> too agreeable unto it. The <hi>Circle</hi> will not be filled up, till the Kingdom ſhall be <hi>delivered up unto the Father,</hi> and <hi>God</hi> ſhall become <hi>All in All.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſince the <hi>Rainbow</hi> is not a <hi>Perfect Circle,</hi> if <hi>Moreover the Servants</hi> of God are <hi>Warned</hi> from thence, of the <hi>Imperfection,</hi> which will at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend all <hi>Sublunary</hi> Things, we ſhall but go on to make an Improvement thereof, that ſome Wiſe Men have made before us. Look upon the <hi>Rainbow</hi> that wants <hi>Perfection,</hi> [its near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the <hi>Earth</hi> allows it not!] and ſay, <hi>I have Seen an End of all Perfection!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, Finally, Let our <hi>Meditation</hi> carry us over, to another World, that has <hi>it.</hi> The Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent <hi>Alſted</hi> adviſes us, from the <hi>Rainbow,</hi> to form a <hi>Meditation,</hi> of the <hi>Glory</hi> that ſhall be imparted by our Saviour, to our <hi>Bodies,</hi> at the <hi>Reſurrection of the Dead.</hi> After this manner he gives us the Noble Reflection. <hi>Si Deus per Solem in Nubibus Excitat tam Splendidum Meteorum, multo magis ipſe tanquam <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

            <p>IT is the <hi>Head</hi> of your admirable Saviour, which, O Diſtreſſed People of God, now appears before you. Oh! Behold it, with ſweet Encouragements; with juſt Aſtoniſhments! The <hi>Head</hi> about which we now ſee the comfortable <hi>Rainbow,</hi> is <hi>thy Head,</hi> O thou Church of the Living God; It is HE, whom God has Placed as <hi>thy Head,</hi> and thou thy Self haſt choſen Him, haſt owned Him.</p>
            <p>When you ſee what it is that this <hi>Mighty Angel</hi> comes down from Heaven to do; That He comes with a loud Voice to proclame the End of the <hi>Time</hi> for the Reign of Sin and Satan in the World, and make a Demand of this Lower World, for the Kingdom of the Great Redeemer, how, how can you forbear a loud Voice of Supplications<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>The Servant of God had ſeen the Face of the
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:001559_0045_0FB3B11C99B14D10"/>
               <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> down as Low as the concluſion of the <hi>Saracen</hi> Oppreſſions, and the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Hoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities; the very Period unto which we are now certainly arrived. Then there appears unto him, a <hi>Mighty Angel,</hi> in ſo Stately and ſo Splendid a Pomp, that many Interpreters can hardly allow Him to be any leſs a Perſon than our Great <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi> Himſelf. He appears to Exhibit a <hi>New Scene</hi> of things Marvellous and very Amazing. And if <hi>this</hi> be the Period for the Appearance of ſuch an Angel, I do a very <hi>Seaſonable</hi> Thing this Day, in Showing Him among you. I diſpute not, whether this <hi>Angel</hi> be our <hi>Saviour</hi> Himſelf, becauſe He deſcends with a Glory too big and bright for any Creature; Or, whether He be a <hi>Created</hi> Angel; For, if He be <hi>ſo,</hi> yet He comes in the <hi>Name</hi> of our <hi>Saviour;</hi> and He comes with a Repreſentation of that <hi>Glory,</hi> which belongs to none but our <hi>Saviour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Deſign of the Deſcent made by this <hi>Migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Angel,</hi> is, to foretel, and bring on, a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Reformation</hi> of the World. If he appears in a <hi>Cloud,</hi> this muſt not be wondred at. There is a Super-celeſtial <hi>Cloud,</hi> which from the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning has been Employ'd as a <hi>Symbol,</hi> and a <hi>Cover</hi> for the Majeſty of our God, in His Appearance. Not only the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> who were favoured ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with an actual view of ſomething that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd unto that vaſt <hi>Cloud;</hi> but even the <hi>Pagans</hi> alſo, and their <hi>Poets,</hi> had ſome Tradition of it.</p>
            <p>There is an Intimation in it, that there will be <hi>Unſearchable</hi> Circumſtances, <hi>Unſearchable</hi> Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations,
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:001559_0046_0FB3B11DE69B1650"/>
in His Appearances. And if thou wilt come unto us in <hi>Cloudy Times,</hi> O Glorious Lord, Thy will be done: Yet, <hi>Even ſo come unto us!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The only Thing that we now Single out for conſideration, is that <hi>Particular Glory</hi> of our Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing Saviour; <hi>A Rainbow was upon his Head.</hi> The <hi>Rainbow</hi> is a well-known <hi>Meteor,</hi> often beheld, but not with Eyes Devout enough, among us in the <hi>Day of Rain.</hi> Perhaps, there is nothing in all the <hi>Meteorous Kingdom</hi> ſo very Beautiful. Such is the <hi>Beauty</hi> of the <hi>Meteor,</hi> that while the Heathen <hi>Mythology</hi> made it, <hi>The Daughter of Wonderment, Cicero</hi> makes it a matter of Wonderment that it was not Lifted in the Number of their Gods. Let thoſe declaim on this <hi>Beauty,</hi> who can fetch a Text from the Son of <hi>Sirach,</hi> that ſayes, <hi>Look on the Rainbow, and Praiſe Him that made it; very Beautiful it is in the Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs thereof.</hi> That which it becomes us moſt of all to Ponder, is, That the Sovereign Creator of the World, has in His Wiſdom Stamp'd a <hi>Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Character</hi> on the <hi>Rainbow;</hi> He has Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted the <hi>Rainbow,</hi> for a <hi>Sign,</hi> and <hi>Seal,</hi> of His <hi>Covenant</hi> with the World. All Chriſtians are appriſed of the Signification which the <hi>Ninth Chapter of Geneſis,</hi> has left upon the <hi>Rainbow,</hi> for our perpetual Conſolation; and as our Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, that the World ſhall no more be <hi>Drown'd,</hi> as it was in the Days of <hi>Noah.</hi> Wherefore, our Saviour appearing to us, <hi>with a Rainbow,</hi> about His <hi>Head,</hi> Propoſes to Preach this Joyful <hi>Doctrine</hi> unto us.</p>

               <hi>I.</hi> In the firſt Place, I will ſhow the <hi>Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow about the Head of a Saviour,</hi> unto every <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Believer</hi> on that Faithful Saviour. My Friend, Apply the Glorious <hi>Rainbow,</hi> to thy own <hi>Particular Condition;</hi> Thy Saviour invites thee to do ſo.

welcome to make uſe of them, as far as ever he can find his own <hi>Caſe</hi> adapted in them.</q> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this <hi>Golden Rule</hi> of Faith, and of Fellowſhip, I now ſay; Believer; Doſt thou not ſee <hi>Cloudy Times?</hi> I know, thou doſt: There is no Believer, but what has his Times of <hi>Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:</hi> No <hi>Child of Light,</hi> but what ſometimes <hi>Walks in Darkneſs, and ſees no Light.</hi> 'Tis often, often the Caſe of every Believer; Lam. III. 1, 2. <hi>I am the man that hath ſeen Affliction; He hath brought me into Darkneſs.</hi> He cannot underſtand the meaning of the Divine Dealings with him; he cannot ſee the Face of God favourably Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning on him; he cannot but fear a ſad Iſſue of the Things which are breaking of him. His Temptations make it the <hi>Hour</hi> and <hi>Power of Darkneſs</hi> with him. He knows not what to do, nor what God intends to do. Perhaps it comes to that Extremity; <hi>Lord, Thou haſt covered thy ſelf with a Cloud, that my Prayer ſhould not paſs through.</hi> In ſo <hi>dark</hi> a Time, the afflicted Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is afraid of a <hi>Flood</hi> that will totally over pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er him; that he ſhall <hi>periſh in his Affliction.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>Firſt. Have you a <hi>Flood</hi> of <hi>Adverſity</hi> beating on you?

            </p>
            <p>Again; Does a <hi>Flood</hi> of <hi>Corruption</hi> riſe in your Souls? Perhaps, the power of <hi>Corruption</hi> in you may be ſuch, that you may think, <hi>I ſhall one day periſh by the Hand of ſuch or ſuch a Sin!

            </p>
            <p>Furthermore; In the <hi>Aſſaults of Hell</hi> upon your Souls, does the <hi>Enemy come in like a Flood</hi> upon you? It may be the <hi>Powers of Darkneſs</hi> are pouring in upon you.

            <p>Once more; We read concerning <hi>The Floods of the Ungodly.</hi> Sometimes the Servants of God, are uneaſy at the <hi>Power,</hi> the <hi>Number,</hi> the <hi>Malice</hi> of Men that are diſaffected unto them.

They repair humbly, with Repentance, with Prayers, and with Tears, to their Compaſſionate <hi>Saviour.</hi> All their <hi>Opportunities</hi> to <hi>Do Good,</hi> they put into His Gracious Hands. Lo then, <hi>then!</hi> they ſee the <hi>Rainbow</hi> about the Head of their Strong Friend in the Heavens concerned for them.

            <p>Finally; The Fate of <hi>Mankind,</hi> under the <hi>Law of Mortality,</hi> is thus deſcribed unto us; Pſal.

And there are Eſpecially <hi>Two</hi> ſuch <hi>Seaſons,</hi> that I will commend unto you. I ſhall ſenſibly Serve the cauſe of Piety, by commending of them.</p>
            <p>Firſt. On the Sight of the <hi>Natural <hi>Rainbow,</hi>
               </hi> theſe comfortable Meditations on the <hi>Covenant</hi> of God, and of Grace, will be very Seaſonable. It is a real <hi>Fault</hi> in the People of God, that they can be Spectators of the <hi>Rainbow,</hi> with no more Proper, Holy, Heavenly Thoughts, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in their Souls; A very Faulty <hi>Unthankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> to our Great Saviour, who has placed it as His <hi>Bow</hi> in the <hi>Clouds,</hi> and ſaid unto us, <hi>O my dear People, Do you Look upon that, as the Memorial of my Covenant!</hi> The <hi>Goſpel of the Rainbow,</hi> is truly, One of the <hi>Deſiderata,</hi> among the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects that ſhould be cultivated in the Church of God. At preſent, I will only ſay; The <hi>Covenant</hi> with our Father <hi>Noah,</hi> whereof we have the <hi>Rainbow,</hi> for an Obſignation, had ſuch an Aſpect upon the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> that we may fairly be led by the <hi>Rainbow,</hi> to Remember the whole <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> in all the <hi>Very Great and Precious Promiſes</hi> of it. Concerning the <hi>Covenant</hi> which God has made with our Saviour, for the Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of His People; we read, Pſal. LXXXIX 37. <hi>It ſhall be Eſtabliſhed, as the Faithful Witneſs in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> By the <hi>Faithful Witneſs in Heaven,</hi> is meant, The <hi>Rainbow.</hi> Well then; when we have that <hi>Comely Work</hi> of God before our Eyes, Let us
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:001559_0054_0FB3B12D01FC1E20"/>
Entertain ſuch Thoughts as theſe; <q>May a Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious CHRIST be my <hi>Saviour,</hi> and my <hi>Surety,</hi> how Happy, how Happy, am I! My Sins will be caſt into the <hi>Depths of the Sea;</hi> I ſhall not my ſelf be caſt thither for them. O my Soul, Be not thou <hi>caſt down.</hi> Be not <hi>afraid of all thy Sorrows;</hi> Thy Lord will not leave thee to <hi>Sink</hi> in any of thy Sorrows. Tho' the <hi>Grave</hi> do Swallow me up, Oh! Let me not <hi>Fear to go down</hi> into the Grave; My Lord will <hi>Bring me up again!</hi> I ſee a <hi>Faithful Witneſs in Heaven,</hi> that puts me in Mind of an <hi>Eſtabliſhed Covenant</hi> for ſuch Bleſſings of Goodneſs.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly. When we ſee the <hi>Baptiſm</hi> of the Lord adminiſtred, theſe Meditations may be very Seaſonably awakened. It is no ſmall Advantage, to be minded of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> which our God has made with our JESUS for us, and with us, in our JESUS. We are minded of this <hi>Covenant</hi> after an Excellent Manner, by the Adminiſtration of <hi>Baptiſm</hi> in our Congregations. God Sanctifies the Sight of this Adminiſtration, as well as the other <hi>Ordinances</hi> in the Aſſembles of <hi>Zion;</hi> and it is a Profane Folly to make light of a thing which God uſes for an <hi>Inſtrument</hi> of ſo much Good unto the Souls of Men. As in any <hi>Sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Water,</hi> the <hi>Light</hi> eaſily cauſes a ſort of a <hi>Rainbow,</hi> ſo in the <hi>Baptiſmal Water,</hi> we ſee the <hi>Rainbow</hi> about our Saviour; He there and thence calls to the Beholders; <hi>O my People, I will be ever mindful of my Covenant!</hi> Let our Glad Souls be Senſible of this. I mention it the
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:001559_0055_0FB3B12E6F821430"/>
rather, becauſe I find, 1 Pet. III. 19. <hi>Baptiſm</hi> is made the Antitype of the <hi>Flood;</hi> unto which the <hi>Rainbow</hi> has Relation. The <hi>Old Man</hi> in us, is like the <hi>Old World;</hi> under a Curſe. The <hi>Blood</hi> of our Saviour waſhing away the Guilt of our Sin; and the <hi>Spirit</hi> of our Saviour taking away the Life of our Sin; are both of 'em compared unto <hi>Waters.</hi> By theſe <hi>Waters,</hi> the <hi>Old Man</hi> is deſtroy'd in our Souls, as the <hi>Old World</hi> was by the Flood. The <hi>New Man,</hi> like <hi>Noah</hi> in the <hi>Ark,</hi> is by theſe Waters, <hi>Raiſed up,</hi> and brought nearer to God. In this Way tis, that the Bleſſings of the <hi>Covenant</hi> become our Portion. Sirs; When you ſee a Perſon <hi>Baptiſed</hi> in our Congregations; then think! <q>O that Bleſſed <hi>Covenant!</hi> According to that, only my <hi>Sin</hi> ſhall be drowned; But I my ſelf ſhall be <hi>Raiſed</hi> unto the neareſt communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Heaven. Yea, a <hi>Reſurrection from the Dead</hi> will be beſtowed upon me!</q>
            </p>
            <p>But thus I Leave every <hi>Particular Believer</hi> to his own Meditations, on his own ſhare in the <hi>Covenant</hi> of God.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>II.</hi> I am now to tell you, What a <hi>Meſſenger</hi> [Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe and Indulge me if I make Repriſals of the Term, A <hi>Meſſenger</hi>] of Happy Tidings, the <hi>
                  <hi>Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow</hi> about the Head</hi> of the Saviour, is unto the <hi>Church in general,</hi> unto the whole <hi>Church of the Living God</hi> upon Earth.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Covenant</hi> of God, for the <hi>Continuance of His Church in this World,</hi> and its Fruition of Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs in a <hi>New World;</hi> this was included in
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:001559_0056_0FB3B12FE341D548"/>
the <hi>Covenant</hi> made with our Patriarch after the <hi>Flood.</hi> Our Holy God never gave the <hi>Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow</hi> for a Token, that He would preſerve a World, only to be a Rendezvouz of <hi>Traitors</hi> &amp; <hi>Rebels:</hi> a Field for none but <hi>Wicked People</hi> to graze upon. The Preſervation of the World, is, that ſo our Saviour may have an <hi>Elect Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> here Prepared for Him, and that anon there may come on a Revolution wherein the <hi>Whole Earth</hi> ſhall be filled with that People, and His Kingdom. You ſhould Read this Glorious Thing written on the <hi>Rainbow</hi> with Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals! And hence this <hi>Covenant</hi> of God, is En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſed in thoſe Terms; Iſa. LIV. 9, 10. <hi>This is as the Waters of Noah unto me; for as I have ſworn, that the Waters of Noah ſhould no more go ever the Earth, ſo— my Kindneſs ſhall not depart from thee, neither ſhall the Covenant of my Peace be removed, ſaith the Lord that hath mercy on thee.</hi> We are fallen into <hi>Cloudy Times;</hi> and, The <hi>Floods have Lifted up, O Lord, the Floods have Lifted up their <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

            <q>
               <l>Becauſe thy Promiſes O Lord,</l>
               <l>are very firm and ſure;</l>
               <l>Thy Beautiful and Holy Church</l>

               <pb n="50" facs="unknown:001559_0057_0FB3B132E09FAF40"/>O People of God, and you that have <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> coming into your Minds; Look up, Look up; ſee a <hi>Rainbow</hi> about the Head of your Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; and hear that raviſhing Voice come out of His Mouth; <hi>I will take a ſufficient Care of my Church in the World. My Covenant for my Church, there ſhall be no breaking, no failing of it!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And is not this the meaning of that Exibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Rev. IV. 3. <hi>There was a <hi>Rainbow</hi> round about the Throne.</hi> Our JESUS is <hi>Enthroned</hi> in the Heavens; The Scepter of God is in His Hands; But He will ſo manage every thing, that His <hi>Covenant</hi> for the preſervation of His Church in the World, ſhall be moſt punctually accompliſhed.</p>
            <p>Firſt. I will give you ſome <hi>Reaſons</hi> why the <hi>Rainbow</hi> about the Head of our Saviour will not prove an <hi>Empty Show;</hi> but He will fulfil to His Church, the <hi>Covenant</hi> of His Mercy. Tis for ſuch Reaſons as theſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt. The Bleſſed God, is a moſt <hi>Faithful God:</hi> The <hi>God of Truth.</hi> Oh! Let our God <hi>be True,</hi> in our Praiſes of Him, and <hi>Every man a Lyar,</hi> that has the leaſt Murmur of His being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other. In the midſt of our deepeſt <hi>Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,</hi> we muſt own that thing; Lam. III. 23. <hi>Great is thy Faithfulneſs.</hi> He is the <hi>Unchangeable</hi> One. He makes a <hi>Covenant,</hi> and He <hi>Changes not;</hi> Therefore the Church to be preſerved ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to His Covenant ſhall <hi>not be conſumed.</hi> His Nature, and His Glory is that; Pſal.

               <pb n="51" facs="unknown:001559_0058_0FB3B133AD1D5100"/>Again; Our Saviour with the <hi>Rainbow <hi>about His Head,</hi>
               </hi> appears before His <hi>Father,</hi> as well as unto His <hi>People.</hi> The Eternal Father is the <hi>God of our JESUS,</hi> He is in <hi>Covenant</hi> with Him. Our JESUS, is the <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Covenant</hi> which is made for the People of God; it is made with Him. Our Saviour preſents Himſelf before God, as the <hi>Mediator</hi> of the <hi>Covenant.</hi> He pleads the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of His Church; He pleads for its Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. We are ſure of that; Heb.

            </p>
            <p>Laſtly. The <hi>People</hi> of God, they Mind Him of His <hi>Covenant;</hi> they point Him to His own <hi>Rainbow.</hi> They are a <hi>Praying</hi> People. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſee a <hi>Rainbow <hi>about the Throne</hi>

            <p>They are ſuch as theſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt. The <hi>Church cannot be drown'd.</hi> The Church of God may read that Motto on the <hi>Rainbow;</hi> Jer.

But, O <hi>Church</hi> of our Bleſſed JESUS, Thou art that <hi>Mount Zion.</hi> The moſt <hi>Ancient</hi> of all the Mountains, the moſt <hi>Laſting</hi> of all the Hills; Eternally Impregnable! No <hi>Flood</hi> can roll over the Top of the <hi>Holy Hill of Zion.</hi> There is a word in the BIBLE, which has been as an <hi>Ark</hi> for the Church of God, in the moſt <hi>Cloudy</hi> and Stormy Ages of it; That word, <hi>Mat.</hi> XVI. 18. <hi>I will build my Church, and the Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt it.</hi> I Incline to think, that our Saviour alludes to what occurred in the <hi>Flood</hi> which once <hi>Overthrew the Foundations of the Wicked.</hi> In that <hi>Flood,</hi> we read, <hi>The Fountains of the Great Deep were broken up;</hi> and, <hi>The Waters prevailed exceedingly upon the Earth; they prevailed, and the Mountains were covered.</hi> Yet the <hi>Family</hi> of the Juſt One periſhed not. Sirs, It will be ſo! Tho' the Bars of the Bottomleſs Pit ſhould be <hi>broken up,</hi> and ſhould pour out a <hi>Flood</hi> of Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs on the Church, yet there ſhall not iſſue out ſuch a <hi>Flood</hi> from thence, as to drown the <hi>Family</hi> of our Saviour. The <hi>Flood</hi> ſhall not <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail</hi> ſo far as to <hi>drown</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> in the World. Our Lord <hi>Sits King on the Floods,</hi> and ſets Bounds to them; they ſhall not <hi>prevail</hi> to carry all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them. <hi>Had it not been for this Word,</hi> the Church had been <hi>drown'd</hi> in the Days of <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſian,</hi>

when he ſet up his Pillars, with this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription on them, <hi>Chriſtiana Superſtitione Deleta.</hi> Wretch, The Inſcription on the <hi>Rainbow <hi>about the Head</hi>
               </hi> of our Saviour, confounded thine! <hi>Had it not been for this Word,</hi> the Church had been drown'd by the <hi>Flood,</hi> which the <hi>Dragon caſt out</hi> of his Mouth in the <hi>Arian</hi> Haereſies; when, <hi>The World Sigh'd, that it ſaw it ſelf become al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt entirely Arian. Had it not been for this Word,</hi> the Church had been drown'd in the <hi>Flood</hi> of the <hi>Romiſh Apoſtaſy,</hi> at the Latter end of the <hi>Fifteenth Century;</hi> when there were left One Little Flock of <hi>Taborites</hi> in their <hi>Caves;</hi> and theſe poor <hi>Speculani</hi> ſent four Agents to the ſeveral points of the Compaſs, to find, if it were poſſible, any pure Church in the World; and they all return'd with a Sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Report, That there was none to be met withal.

But O thou <hi>Monſter of Baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> The <hi>Daughter of Zion</hi> deſpiſes thee. And, O thou <hi>Troubler of the Nations,</hi> A Few Months more ſhall bring thee down to the <hi>Sides of the Pit,</hi> and it ſhall be ſaid by them that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider thee, <hi>Is this the man that ſhook the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of the Earth!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In ſhort<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Church of our Saviour muſt <hi>Our live</hi> all the Attempts of Earth and Hell againſt it. The <hi>Story</hi> of the Church Surviv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:001559_0062_0FB3B139DE51A478"/>
all the Attempts of its Adverſaries in the former Ages, is a wonderful Story. The <hi>Threed</hi> of the Story ſhall never be broken off! Our JESUS will have <hi>Subjects,</hi> His <hi>Bible</hi> will have <hi>Students,</hi> His <hi>Spirit</hi> will have <hi>Temples,</hi> let all the Devils in Hell do what they can to defeat ſuch In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of Heaven. The Saviour with the <hi>Rainbow <hi>about His Head,</hi>
               </hi> will tread on the <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Old Serpent;</hi> All the Plots in that <hi>Bruiſed Head,</hi> ſhall come to nothing!</p>
            <p>Secondly. The moſt <hi>Cloudy Times</hi> that paſs over the Church of God, have their <hi>Mixtures</hi> of Mercy, and of Moderation in them. There's a <hi>Rainbow;</hi> The <hi>Clouds</hi> of Wrath are not ſo thick, not ſo ſpread, but there is a <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine</hi> of Mercy with them. If the <hi>Floods</hi> riſe high; yet not ſo high, that <hi>all</hi> ſhall be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered; <hi>all</hi> overcome. It was a thing propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; Hab. III 2. <hi>O Lord, Revive thy Work in the midſt of the years; In wrath remember Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</hi> His <hi>Church</hi> is His <hi>Work.</hi> In the midſt of the Seventy Years aſſign'd for the Captivity of the <hi>Jews,</hi> they found a Remarkable ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour from the Court of <hi>Babylon,</hi> in what was done to one who repreſented them there. This <hi>Revived</hi> them in the <hi>midſt of the years;</hi> This was <hi>Mercy in the midſt of Wrath<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Indeed things may go very bad, with the Church; yet never ſo <hi>Bad,</hi> but they might be <hi>Worſe.</hi> O the amazing <hi>Supplies of Grace</hi> which are ſent in unto the Church, under its greateſt Languiſhments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> There will be at leaſt a <hi>bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle

Reviving.</hi> What <hi>Ezra</hi> of old called, <hi>A Little Reviving to ſet up the Houſe of our God.</hi> The Church will find that thing; Pſalm LXXVIII. 38. <hi>He does not ſtir up all His wrath.</hi> The Church will find, the <hi>Saviour</hi> with His <hi>Rainbow,</hi> dealing according to that word; <hi>I am with thee, I will correct thee in meaſure.</hi> That word; <hi>He ſtays His Rough Wind, in the Day of the Eaſt Wind.</hi> The Calamities of the Church, have Glorious <hi>Mitigations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly. The <hi>Church</hi> can't be totally <hi>Drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:</hi> The <hi>World is;</hi> But the <hi>Flood of Wickedneſs,</hi> which overſpreads the <hi>Whole World,</hi> is going off. We have a ſad Account of this wretched World, 1 Joh. V. 19. <hi>The whole World lies in Wickedneſs.</hi> Alas, the <hi>Whole World</hi> is under that <hi>Flood,</hi> which we find before the <hi>Old Flood,</hi> and the Cauſe of it; we ought with unutterable Anguiſh, to make the Complaint, <hi>Behold, the Earth is corrupt before God, and all Fleſh has corrupted his way upon the Earth.</hi> A <hi>Flood</hi> of wickedneſs, has laid Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind <hi>groaning under the Waters.</hi> The <hi>Exceptions</hi> to the Epidemical, the Univerſal Wickedneſs of Mankind, are ſo very few, that we may ſtill Complain, <hi>They are all gone aſide; they are together become filthy!</hi> But, my Brethren; It ſhall <hi>not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be ſo.</hi> The Saviour of Mankind ſhows Himſelf unto us with a <hi>
                  <hi>Rainbow</hi> about His Head.</hi> It is to inform us, That the <hi>Flood of Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs</hi> in which the World is at this Day buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſhall one day be rolled off. Of the <hi>Angel</hi> coming down from Heaven with a <hi>Rainbow</hi>
               <pb n="57" facs="unknown:001559_0064_0FB3B13DA62AB8B0"/>
               <hi>on His Head,</hi> we read, <hi>He ſets His Right Foot on the Sea, and His Left Foot on the Earth.</hi> Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour will come to take poſſeſſion both of the <hi>Sea,</hi> and of the <hi>Earth.</hi> He will poſſeſs Himſelf of Mankind, both on the <hi>Sea,</hi> and on the <hi>Earth.</hi> He will aſſert His Dominion both on the <hi>Sea,</hi> and on the <hi>Earth.</hi> He will <hi>Chain</hi> up the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver</hi> of the Nations. But, <hi>How Long, O Lord, Holy and True, How Long ere thou So come down unto us!</hi> There is a Day a coming in which, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ancient Prophecies; Pſal. XXII. 27. <hi>All the Ends of the World ſhall turn unto the Lord.</hi> And, Pſal. LXXXVI. 9. <hi>All Nations whom thou haſt made, ſhall come and Worſhip before thee, O Lord, and ſhall Glorify thy Name.</hi> Moſt certainly, There will come a Day when there ſhall be more <hi>Godly People,</hi> than there are now <hi>Wicked People</hi> in the World. I am certain, God will one day <hi>deſtroy them that Corrupt the Earth;</hi> We ſhall ſee an <hi>Earth</hi> wherein ſhall <hi>dwell Righteouſneſs;</hi> it ſhall be filled with <hi>Righteous</hi> ones. The very firſt Time, that an <hi>Hallelujah</hi> occurs in the Sacred Scriptures, it is on this occaſion; Pſal. CIV. 35. <hi>Let the Sinners be conſumed out of the Earth, and let the wicked be no more. Hallelujah.</hi> There will come a Time, when that <hi>Great Hallelujah</hi> ſhall be heard in the World!</p>
            <p>Fourthly. Our Great Saviour, the <hi>Ruler</hi> of the World, aims at the <hi>Good of His Church,</hi> in all the <hi>Changes</hi> which He brings upon the World. This, is a very <hi>Turneable</hi> World; very <hi>Changeable.</hi> Others beſides that King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> the Great <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtrys,</hi> whom our Bible calls by the Name of <hi>Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhak,</hi>

have ſeen a <hi>Wheel Turning about.</hi> Tis a moſt Elegant and Expreſſive <hi>Hieroglyphick,</hi> which our Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> had of it, in his Viſion of the <hi>Wheels.</hi> There is a Tradition, that <hi>Pythagoras</hi> invented his, from his Acquaintance with <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiels,</hi> who was his contemporary. He ſaw <hi>four Wheels.</hi> Will you give me leave to Say, That here is a <hi>Wheel</hi> for each of the <hi>Four Great Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies.</hi> The <hi>Laſt</hi> of them is now Turning apace. Our Immortal <hi>King</hi> is <hi>bringing the Wheel over that wicked Empire.</hi> Will you give me leave alſo to Say, That here is a <hi>Wheel</hi> for each of the <hi>Four Quarters</hi> of the World? Then beſure <hi>America</hi> muſt be concerned in the Turning of the Laſt <hi>Wheel;</hi> and verily, we find it ſo to our Wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Well, but who has the Management of all theſe <hi>Wheels?</hi> Truly, Our Saviour with a <hi>Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow</hi> about Him? All the <hi>Angels</hi> in Heaven, who have their uncontroleable Influences on Humane affairs, are but the <hi>Officers</hi> of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; they Execute His Orders; they are the <hi>Miniſters which do His Pleaſure.</hi> We read how the <hi>Wheels</hi> are managed; Ezek. I. 26, 28. <hi>On the Throne, there was the Appearance of a MAN above upon it:</hi> [That MAN, tis our JESUS, tis our JESUS! We know, tis He!] It followes; <hi>As the Appearance of the Bow that is in the Cloud in the Day of Rain;</hi> [The RAINBOW!] <hi>So was the Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Brightneſs round about.</hi> From our JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS on the Throne we are now ſo advertiſed; <q>O my dear People, I remember my Covenant for you: And in all the Turns which I bring upon the World, I am fulfilling of it!</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="unknown:001559_0066_0FB3B14132002008"/>This is HE, whom the <hi>Diſciple that Jeſus Loved,</hi> had His Allowance to Look upon!</p>
            <p>But may <hi>We</hi> alſo at this Day, be allowed and advanced unto a View of that Glorious One! Yea, O People Highly favoured of the Lord; unto <hi>You</hi> does the Saviour with a <hi>Rainbow <hi>about His Head</hi>
               </hi> give that Glorious Call; <q>Behold me, Behold me, O my People; Behold, and Believe my Remembrance of my Covenant, in all the Cloudy Times that are paſſing over you.</q>
            </p>
            <p>We are fallen into a Day, whereof we may ſay, what we read; Zech. I. 15. <hi>It is a Day of Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and of Diſtreſs, a Day of Clouds and of Thick Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> Yea, tis a Day wherein the People of God have their Fears, <hi>Leſt the Waters overwhelm us, leſt the Proud Waters go over our Soul.</hi> In the midſt of theſe <hi>Clouds</hi> our Saviour appears to us, with a <hi>Rainbow <hi>about His Head.</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the <hi>firſt</hi> thing, with which I would ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate my Brethren, is; That He is <hi>Our Head,</hi> and we may ſafely truſt Him with <hi>Our All.</hi> On that Paſſage; Eccl. II. 14. <hi>A wiſe mans Eyes are in his head,</hi> I remember two of the Ancient <hi>Gregories,</hi> both a <hi>Greek</hi> one, and a <hi>Latin</hi> one, have a devout Gloſs, which is rather an Alluſion than an Expoſition; Our Glorious <hi>Chriſt</hi> is our <hi>Head;</hi> and ſay they, in <hi>Him</hi> we have our <hi>Eyes.</hi> This I may very Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably ſay; O <hi>Church</hi> of the Lord; Thy <hi>Eyes</hi> are in thy <hi>Head;</hi> Even in that <hi>Head</hi> which has the <hi>Rainbow</hi> about it. His <hi>Eyes</hi> will be on the <hi>Look-out</hi> for thy welfare: He will <hi>See</hi> to the fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of all that His <hi>Covenant</hi> has engaged for thee.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="unknown:001559_0067_0FB3B142B05EA8F0"/>What tho' there be diſmal <hi>Clouds!</hi> The <hi>Clouds</hi> ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; Look very diſmally; tis true. But, of thy Saviour, thou haſt been told, <hi>Behold, He cometh with Clouds!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will go on to ſay; Tis a dreadful thing unto Good Men, to ſee ſuch a <hi>Death</hi> upon all that is <hi>Good</hi> in the World. Every thing lies <hi>Dead: Zeal,</hi> tis Dead; <hi>Love,</hi> tis Cold &amp; Dead; The <hi>Life of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> is gone. A <hi>Publick Spirit,</hi> its Dead; The <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of the Goſpel,</hi> ſeems Dead. <hi>Churches,</hi> Oh! how <hi>Cadaverous</hi> are they! What Putrefactions in them! O ye <hi>Witneſſes</hi> of the Lord, you alſo, are either <hi>Dead,</hi> or at leaſt have not got off your <hi>Grave-Cloathes.</hi> And yet, <hi>this</hi> may the rather be <hi>the Time</hi> for a Speedy Appearance of our Saviour. It was a Prediction; Mat. XXIV. 28. <hi>Whereſoever the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe is, there will the Eagles be gathered together.</hi> I take it for a Prediction of our Lords coming, with His Goſpel, as the <hi>Lightning,</hi> to Ruine <hi>Antechriſt,</hi> &amp; Reform His People. The Church at this Time; is to be like a <hi>Dead Carcaſe;</hi> partly ſo, by <hi>Sufferings:</hi> much more ſo, by <hi>Corruptions.</hi> Our Saviour will now come as a Glorious <hi>Eagle;</hi> ſo He did, when He brought His <hi>Dead People</hi> from <hi>Egypt</hi> of old. And, becauſe He will uſe His <hi>Mighty Angels</hi> in what He is to do, marvel not, that you hear of <hi>Eagles,</hi> in the Plural Number for it.</p>
            <p>And, yet; I judge it not amiſs to acquaint you, That there is of late, within theſe few years, a moſt Surprizing <hi>Revival of Good Things</hi> in the World. Should I ſpeak of but One <hi>Country;</hi> There are ſome ſtrict obſervers of the Signs of the Times,
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:001559_0068_0FB3B1442723BAC8"/>
who have lately Publiſhed a <hi>Collection</hi> of Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Things, wherein the Kingdom of God has been more ſenſibly opening it ſelf in the Heart of <hi>Germany;</hi> Things of an Holy &amp; Hopeful Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, to bring on a more ample Reign of <hi>Piety;</hi> The Collection contains no fewer than <hi>Fourſcore and Four Articles.</hi> In many other places, there are ſome Excellent Things a doing. <hi>Eſſayes to do Good,</hi> begin to be in requeſt. They grow more Faſhionable, and Reputable. <hi>North-Britain</hi> will become a peculiar Seat, and Example of them. Among the reſt, there is this to be obſerved; A <hi>Spirit of Aſſociation</hi> for Noble &amp; Pious Purpoſes, has of late begun Strangely to Viſit the World; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to do Wondrouſly. Some <hi>Societies</hi> perhaps are yet only laying <hi>Foundations,</hi> for purpoſes of a more Exact Regulation hereafter to be built upon. But as far off as in <hi>Switzerland</hi> they Prognoſticate upon them; <q>They annunciate a more Illuſtrious State of the Church of God, that is Expected, in the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Jews &amp; Gentiles.</q> Theſe Things are the <hi>Rainbow <hi>of the Day!</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the next Place; I will freely confeſs to you, that there is not any One thing at this day a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which I have my Eye more upon, than the <hi>Fate,</hi> &amp; I hope, the approaching <hi>Fall,</hi> of the <hi>Ottoman Empire.</hi> There is a Coincidence of more than as many things, to perſwade us, That the <hi>Threchun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred &amp; ninety odd years</hi> allotted for the <hi>Turks</hi> to be the Plagues of the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> Expired at the late Peace of <hi>Carlowitz.</hi> If that Empire ſhould once fall, what a <hi>Jubilee</hi> would arrive to the poor
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:001559_0069_0FB3B1467580FDB0"/>
               <hi>Greek Churches!</hi> Oh! Let us Pray more for them! Yea, the <hi>Jews</hi> as well as the <hi>Greeks</hi> would feel a quickening Energy upon it. Now, a mighty ſhake ſeems to be giving unto the <hi>Ottoman Empire.</hi> There are Millions of Oppreſſed Chriſtians, who begin to ſee a <hi>Rainbow</hi> in that Thing, if God will pleaſe to give the Word. If it ſhould be ſo, that the <hi>Ottoman Empire</hi> be falling, Then, Then, that <hi>Great Trumpet is going to be blown,</hi> which brings on the Kingdoms of this World, to be the <hi>Kingdoms of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have one thing more to ſay. The Grandeur of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> is plainly on a Decline. Yea, the <hi>Clouds</hi> of this day, are big with deſolating <hi>Thunder-bolts,</hi> to be diſcharg'd upon him. The <hi>Twelve hundred &amp; Sixty years</hi> of the Papacy, could not commence much later than the year Four hundred &amp; fifty, or ſixty. All Rational computations conſpire to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clame this; <hi>A Great &amp; Notable Day of the Lord is at hand;</hi> The Day is <hi>near, it is near, &amp; it haſteth greatly!</hi> The <hi>Papal Authority</hi> now Suffers a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous Diminution; it is Irrecoverably diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Its <hi>Bulls</hi> roar very inſignificately. Let it <hi>ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate</hi> what it will, People do but <hi>Squib</hi> at it. The <hi>Spirit of Perſecution,</hi> which where-ever tis found, is the <hi>Spirit of Antichriſt,</hi> it is wondrous to ſee, how tis going out of the World; men grow Aſhamed of it; They that would fain be at it, yet <hi>they</hi> alſo <hi>Occaſionally</hi> acknowledge, That it is <hi>Contrary to the Spirit of Chriſtianity.</hi> Some that have been moſt noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious for it, Labour mightily to ſhift off the charge.</p>
            <p>I greatly ſuſpect, that we are fallen into the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod,
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:001559_0070_0FB3B149577ABA18"/>
for the Effuſion of the <hi>Vials,</hi> which brings the <hi>Laſt Plagues</hi> on the <hi>Papal Empire:</hi> It looks, as if the <hi>firſt</hi> of them, were newly diſpenſed; <hi>A Boyl on the Earth;</hi> A <hi>Peſtilence</hi> on the <hi>Inland Parts</hi> of that Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. I tremble at the <hi>Second.</hi> — But they will all be <hi>Rainbowes of Hope,</hi> for the pure Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers &amp; Followers of the Holy JESUS.</p>
            <p>Finally; But muſt my poor NEW-ENGLAND, have no part in the <hi>Rainbow,</hi> about Him, that has hitherto been the <hi>Hope</hi> of NEW-ENGLAND, and the <hi>Saviour thereof in the Time of Trouble!</hi> Yea; And tho' there is no <hi>Particular Church,</hi> but what may be <hi>drown'd,</hi> yet I Suppoſe, tis not until it neglect the <hi>Rainbow,</hi> and by overgrown Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety &amp; Impenitency forget the <hi>Everlaſting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> And, O poor Flocks in the Wilderneſs; will you do ſo? I confeſs, we are very criminal; and all out crimes have peculiar Aggravations. Yea, there are ſome very <hi>Baſe People</hi> among us; People who do things that <hi>Pagans</hi> would abhor to do; People who bring a Blemiſh on all the Country. But yet, firſt, the Body of the People, are a <hi>Sober, Honeſt, Well-inſtructed</hi> People. All <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Travellers</hi> who do them Juſtice give them this Teſtimony. Then, there is alſo Scattered all over the Country, a Generation of Serious, Prayerful, Watchful <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> many that make no Noiſe, are the Humble Favourites of Heaven; the <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots &amp; Horſemen of the Land,</hi> &amp; yet by their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty almoſt <hi>Inviſible.</hi> The <hi>Charities</hi> of theſe Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, eſpecially in this Town, they are going up as <hi>Memorials before God</hi> continually. There is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:001559_0071_0FB3B14A25216EA0"/>
a Set of <hi>Young Miniſters,</hi> and Candidates for the Miniſtry, who are full of Goodneſs; Lovely Young Men; <hi>Sons of Zion, comparable to fine Gold; Nazarites, Purer than Snow, brighter</hi> than Pearl; <hi>their Poliſhing that of Sapphire.</hi> God grant the <hi>Rainbowes</hi> may Multiply! O Multiply our <hi>Tokens for Good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will Conclude with Saying this thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, A <hi>Saviour with a <hi>Rainbow</hi> about His Head,</hi> ſhould moſt movingly. Invite every Sinner to come in unto Him.
