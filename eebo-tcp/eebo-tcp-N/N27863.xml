            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE SHEPHERD OF SALISBURY-PLAIN.</head>
            <p>MR. JOHNSON, a very worthy chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Gentleman, was travelling ſome time ago acroſs one of thoſe vaſt Plains which are well known in Wilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire. It was a fine ſummer's evening, and he rode ſlowly that he might have leiſure to admire God in the works of his creation. For this Gentleman was of opinion, that a walk or a ride, was as proper a time as any to think about good things, for which reaſon, on ſuch occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons he ſeldom thought ſo much about his money, or his trade, or public news, as at other times, that he might with more eaſe and ſatisfaction enjoy the pious thoughts which the viſible works of the great Maker of heaven and earth are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to raiſe in the mind.</p>
            <p>His attention was all of a ſudden called off by the barking of a Shepherd's dog,
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:037128_0003_100C8334B7DF8720"/>
and looking up he ſpied one of thoſe little huts, which are here and there to be ſeen on theſe great Downs; and near it was the Shepherd himſelf buſily employed with his dog in collecting together his vaſt flock of ſheep. As he drew nearer he perceived him to be a clean, well-looking, poor man, near fifty years of age. His coat, though at firſt it had pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bably been of one dark colour, had been in a long courſe of years ſo often patched with different ſorts of cloth, that it was now become hard to ſay which had been the original colour. But this, while it gave a plain proof of the Shepherd's po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, equally proved the exceeding neat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, induſtry, and good management of his wife. His ſtockings no leſs proved her good houſewifery, for they were entirely covered with darns of different coloured worſted, but had not a hole in them; and his ſhirt, though nearly as coarſe as the ſails of a ſhip, was as white as the drifted ſnow, and neatly mended where time had either made a re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

ſtockings and ſhirt tight and whole, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever mean and bad his other garments are, I have ſeldom failed, on viſiting his cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, to find that alſo clean and well or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and his wife notable, and worthy of encouragement. Whereas a poor wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who will be lying a-bed, or goſſip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping with her neighbours when ſhe ought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> be fitting out her huſband in a cleanly manner, will ſeldom be found to be very good in other reſpects.</p>
            <p>This was not the caſe with our Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd: And Mr. Johnſon was not more ſtruck with the decency of his mean and frugal dreſs, than with his open honeſt countenance, which bore ſtrong marks of health, cheerfulneſs, and ſpirit.</p>
            <p>Mr. Johnſon, who was on a journey, and ſomewhat fearful from the appearance of the ſky, that rain was at no great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, accoſted the Shepherd with aſking what ſort of weather he thought it would be on the morrow.—"It will be ſuch wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as pleaſes me," anſwered the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd. Though the anſwer was delivered in the mildeſt and civileſt tone that could be imagined, the Gentleman thought the words themſelves rather rude and ſurly, and aſked him how that could be, "Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,"
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:037128_0005_100C833A1B371250"/>
replied the Shepherd, "it will be ſuch weather as ſhall pleaſe God, and whatever pleaſes him always pleaſes me."</p>
            <p>Mr. Johnſon, who delighted in good <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> and good things, was very well ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with his reply. For he juſtly thought that though an hypocrite may eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive to appear better than he really is to a ſtranger; and that no one ſhould be too ſoon truſted, merely for having a few good words in his mouth; yet as he knew that "out of the abundance of the heart the mouth ſpeaketh," he always accuſtomed himſelf to judge favourably of thoſe who had a ſerious deportment and ſolid man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſpeaking. "It looks as if it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from a good habit," ſaid he, "and though I may now and then be deceived by it, yet it has not often happened to me to be ſo. Whereas, if a man accoſts me with an idle, diſſolute, vulgar, indecent, or prophane expreſſion, I have never been deceived in him, but have generally on inquiry found his character to be as bad as his language gave me room to expect."</p>
            <p>He entered into converſation with the Shepherd in the following manner. Yours is a troubleſome life, honeſt friend, ſaid he. To be ſure, Sir, replied the Shepherd,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:037128_0006_100C833C5DBD01B0"/>
'tis not a very lazy life; but tis not near ſo toilſome as that which my GREAT MAS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TER led for my ſake and he had every ſtate and condition of life at his choice, and choſe a hard one—while I only ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the lot that is appointed me.—You are expoſed to great cold and heat, ſaid the Gentleman:—true, Sir, ſaid the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd; but then I am not expoſed to great temptations; and ſo throwing one thing againſt another, God is pleaſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive to make things more equal than we poor, ignorant, ſhort ſighted creatures are apt to think. David was happier when he kept his father's ſheep on ſuch a plain as this, and ſinging ſome of his own Pſalms perhaps, than ever he was when he became king of Iſrael and Judah. And I dare ſay we ſhould never have had ſome of the moſt beautiful texts in all thoſe fine Pſalms, if he had not been a Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd, which enabled him to make ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fine compariſons and ſimilitudes, as one may ſay, from a country life, flocks of ſheep, hills, and vallies, and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of water.</p>
            <p>You think then, ſaid the Gentleman, that a laborious life is a happy one. I do, Sir, and more ſo eſpecially, as it expoſes
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:037128_0007_100C833E843AE2C0"/>
a man to fewer ſins. If King Saul had continued a poor laborious man to the end of his days, he might have lived happy and honeſt, and died a natural death in his bed at laſt, which you know, Sir, was more than he did. But I ſpeak with reverence, for it was divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence overruled all that, you know, Sir, and I do not preſume to make compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. Beſides, Sir, my employment has been particularly honoured—Moſes was a Shepherd in the plains of Midian.—I was to "Shepherds keeping their flocks by night," that the angels appeared in Bethlehem, to tell the beſt news, the gladdeſt tidings, that ever were revealed to poor ſinful men: often, and often has the thought warmed my poor heart in the coldeſt night, and filled me with more joy and thankfulneſs than the beſt ſupper could have done.</p>
            <p>Here the Shepherd ſtopped, for he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to feel that he had made too free, and had talked too long. But Mr. Johnſon was ſo well pleaſed with what he ſaid, and with the cheerful contented manner in which he ſaid it, that he deſired him to go on freely, for that it was a pleaſure to him to meet with a plain man, who
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:037128_0008_100C83415D68F9F8"/>
without any kind of learning but what he had got from the Bible, was able to talk ſo well on a ſubject in which all men, high and low, rich and poor, are equally concerned.</p>
            <p>Indeed I am afraid I make too bold, Sir, for it better becomes me to liſten to ſuch a Gentleman as you ſeem to be, than to talk in my poor way; but as I was ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Sir, I wonder all working men do not derive as great joy and delight as I do from thinking how God has honoured poverty! Oh! Sir, what great, or rich, or mighty men have had ſuch honour put on them, or their condition, as Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds, Tent-makers, Fiſhermen, and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters have had?</p>
            <p>My honeſt friend, ſaid the Gentleman, I perceive you are well acquainted with ſcripture. Yes, Sir, pretty well, bleſſed be God! through his mercy I learnt to read when I was a little boy; though read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was not ſo common when I was a child, as, I am told, through the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Providence, and the generoſity of the rich, it is likely to become now a-days. I believe there is no day for the laſt thirty years, that I have not peeped at my Bible<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:037128_0009_100C834377C2FA88"/>
I defy any man to ſay he can't find time to read a verſe; and a ſingle text Sir, well followed and put in practice every day, would make no bad figure at the year's end; three hundred and ſixty-five texts, without the loſs of a moment's time, would make a pretty ſtock, a little golden treaſury, as one may ſay, from new-year's day to new-year's day; and if children were brought up to it, they would look for their text as naturally as they do for their breakfaſt. No labouring man, 'tis true, has ſo much leiſure as a Shepherd, for while the flock is feeding, I am oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> at ſuch times I can now and then tap a ſhoe for my children or myſelf, which is a great ſaving to us, and while I am doing that I repeat a bit of a chapter, which makes the time paſs plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly in this wild ſolitary place. I can ſay the beſt part of the Bible by heart, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve I ſhould not ſay the beſt part, for every part is good, but I mean the greateſt part. I have led but a lonely life, and have often had but little to eat, but my Bible has been meat, drink and company to me, as I may ſay, and when want and trouble have come upon me. I dont know what I ſhould have done indeed, Sir, if I
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:037128_0010_100C834500FE68E8"/>
had not had the promiſes of this book for my ſtay and ſupport.</p>
            <p>You have had great difficulties then? ſaid Mr. Johnſon. Why, as to that, Sir, not more than neighbours fare, I have but little cauſe to complain, and much to be thankful; but I have had ſome little ſtruggles, as I will leave you to judge. I have a wife and eight children, whom I bred up in that little cottage which you ſee under the hill about half a mile off. What, that with the ſmoke coming out of the chimney, ſaid the Gentleman. O no, Sir, replied the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd ſmiling, we have ſeldom ſmoke in the evening, for we have little to cook, and fireing is very dear in theſe parts. 'Tis that cottage which you ſee on the left hand of the Church, near that little tuft of haw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorns. What that hovel with only one room above and one below, with ſcarcely any chimney, how is it poſſible you can live there with ſuch a family! O! it is very poſſible and very certain too, cried the Shepherd. How many better men have been worſe lodged! how many good chriſtians have periſhed in priſons and dungeons, in compariſon of which my cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage is a palace. The houſe is very well,

Sir, and if the rain did not ſometimes beat down upon us through the thatch when we are a-bed, I ſhould not deſire a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; for I have health, peace, and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and no man maketh me afraid.</p>
            <p>Well, I will certainly call on you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it be long; but how can you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive to lodge ſo many children? We do the beſt we can, Sir. My poor wife is a very ſickly woman, or we ſhould always have done tolerably well. There are no gentry in the pariſh, ſo that ſhe has not met with any great aſſiſtance in her ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>he good curate of the pariſh who lives in that pretty parſonage in the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, is very willing, but not very able to aſſiſt us on theſe trying occaſions, for he has little enough for himſelf and a large family into the bargain. Yet he does what he can, and more than many richer men do, and more than he can well af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford. Beſides that, his prayers and good advice we are always ſure of, and we are truly thankful for that, for a man muſt give, you know, Sir, according to what he hath, and not according to what he hath not.</p>
            <p>Are you in any diſtreſs at preſent? ſaid Mr. Johnſon. No, Sir, thank God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied

the Shepherd. I get my ſhilling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, and moſt of my children will ſoon be able to earn ſomething; for we have only three under five years of age. Only! ſaid the Gentleman, that is a heavy burden. Not at all; God fits the back to it. Tho' my wife is not able to do any out of door work, yet ſhe breeds up our children to ſuch habits of induſtry, that our little maids before they are ſix years old can firſt get a halfpenny, and then a penny a-day by knitting. The boys who are too little to do hard work, get a trifle by keeping the birds off the corn; for this the farmers will give them a penny or two-pence, and now and then a bit of bread and cheeſe into the bargain. When the ſeaſon of crow keeping is over, then they glean or pick ſtones; any thing is better than idleneſs, Sir, and if they do not get a farthing by it, I would make them do it juſt the ſame, for the ſake of giving them early habits of labour.</p>
            <p>So you ſee, Sir, I am not ſo badly off as many are; nay, if it were not that it coſts me ſo much in Potecary's ſtuff for my poor wife, I ſhould reckon myſelf well off. Nay, I do reckon myſelf well off, for bleſſed be God, he has granted her life to
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:037128_0013_100C90C4ED4C67B0"/>
my prayers, and I would work myſelf to a 'natomy, and live on one meal a-day to add any comfort to her valuable life; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I have often done the laſt, and thought it no great matter neither.</p>
            <p>While they were on this part of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, a fine plump cherry-cheek little girl ran up out of breath, with a ſmile on her young happy face, and without taking any notice of the Gentleman, cried out with great joy—Look here, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, only ſee how much I have got to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day! Mr. Johnſon was much ſtruck with her ſimplicity, but puzzled to know what was the occaſion of this great joy. On looking at her he perceived a ſmall quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of coarſe wool, ſome of which had found it's way through the holes of her clean, but ſcanty and ragged woollen apron. The father ſaid, this has been a ſucceſsful day indeed, Molly, but don't you ſee the Gentleman? Molly now made a curtſey down to the very ground; while Mr. Johnſon enquired into the cauſe of the mutual ſatisfaction which both father and daughter had expreſſed, at the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual good fortune of the day.</p>
            <p>Sir, ſaid the Shepherd, poverty is a great ſharpener of wits.—My wife and I
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:037128_0014_100C90C6DAF04550"/>
cannot endure to ſee our children (poor as they are) without ſhoes and ſtockings, not only on account of the pinching cold which cramps their poor little limbs, but becauſe it degrades and debaſes them; and poor people who have but little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to appearances will ſeldom be found to have any great regard for honeſty and goodneſs; I don't ſay this is always the caſe; but I am ſure it is ſo too often. Now ſhoes and ſtockings being very dear we could never afford to get them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a little contrivance. I muſt ſhew you how I manage about the ſhoes when you condeſcend to call at our cottage, Sir; as to ſtockings, this is one way we take to help get them. My young ones who are too little to do much work, ſometimes wander at odd hours over the hills for the chance of finding what little wool the ſheep may drop when they rub them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as they are apt to do, in the buſhes.<note n="*" place="bottom">This piece of fru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>al induſtry is not imaginary, but a real fact, as is the character of the Shepherd, and his uncommon knowledge of the ſcriptures.</note> Theſe ſcattered bits of wool the children pick out of the brambles, which I ſee, have torn ſad holes in Molly's apron to-day; they carry this
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:037128_0015_100C90C8739575A8"/>
wool home, and when they have got a pretty parcel together, their mother cards it; for ſhe can ſit and card in the chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney corner, when ſhe is not able to waſh, or work about houſe. The biggeſt girl then ſpins it; it does very well for us without dying, for poor people muſt not ſtand for the colour of their ſtockings. After this our little boys knit it for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, while they are employed in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing crows in the fields, and after they get home at night. As for the knitting the girls and their mother do, that is chiefly for ſale, which helps to pay our rent.</p>
            <p>Mr. Johnſon lifted up his eyes in ſilent aſtoniſhment at the ſhifts which honeſt poverty can make rather than beg or ſteal; and was ſurpriſed to think how many ways of ſubſiſting there are which thoſe who live at their eaſe little ſuſpect. He ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſolved to be more attentive to his own petty expences than he had hitherto been; and to be more watchful that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was waſted in his family.</p>
            <p>But to return to the Shepherd. Mr. Johnſon told him that as he muſt needs be at his friend's houſe, who lived many miles off that night, he could not as he wiſhed to do, make a viſit to his cottage
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:037128_0016_100C90CAADB29008"/>
at preſent. But I will certainly do it, ſaid he on my return, for I long to ſee your wife and her nice little family, and to be an eye witneſs of her neatneſs and good management. The poor man's tears ſtarted into his eyes on hearing the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation beſtowed on his wife; and wiping them off with the ſleeve of his coat, for he was not worth a handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief in the world, he ſaid—Oh! Sir, you juſt now, I am afraid, called me an humble man, but indeed I am a very proud one. Proud! exclaimed Mr. John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, I hope not—Pride is a great ſin, and as the poor are liable to it as well as the rich, ſo good a man as you ſeem to be, ought to guard againſt it. Sir, ſaid he, you are right, but I am not proud of myſelf, God knows, I have nothing to be proud of. I am a poor ſinner, but indeed Sir, I am proud of my wife: She is not only the moſt tidy, notable wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man on the Plain, but ſhe is the kindeſt wiſe and mother, and the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, thankful chriſtian that I know. Laſt year I thought I ſhould have loſt her in a violent fit of the rheumatiſm, caught by going to work too ſoon after her lying-in, I fear; for 'tis but a bleak
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:037128_0017_100C90CD64C74C68"/>
coldiſh place, as you may ſee, Sir, in winter, and ſometimes the ſnow lies ſo long under the hill, that I can hardly make myſelf a path to get out and buy a few neceſſaries in the next village; and we are afraid to ſend out the children, for fear they ſhould be loſt when the ſnow is deep. So, as I was ſaying, the poor ſoul was very bad indeed, and for ſeveral weeks loſt the uſe of all her limbs except her hands; a merciful Providence ſpared her the uſe of theſe, ſo that when ſhe could not turn in her bed, ſhe could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive to patch a rag or two for her family. She was always ſaying, had it not been for the great goodneſs of God, ſhe might have had the palſy inſtead of the rheu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiſm, and then ſhe could have done nothing—but nobody had ſo many mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies as ſhe had.</p>
            <p>I will not tell you what we ſuffered during that bitter weather, Sir, but my wife's faith and patience during that try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing time, were as good a leſſon to me as any Sermon I could hear, and yet Mr. Jenkins gave us very comfortable ones too, that helped to keep up my ſpirits.</p>
            <p>One Sunday afternoon when my wife
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:037128_0018_100C90CEF5B54C50"/>
was at the worſt, as I was coming out of Church, for I went one part of the day, and my eldeſt daughter the other, ſo my poor wife was never left alone. As I was coming out of Church, I ſay, Mr. Jenkins the miniſter called out to me, and aſked me how my wife did, ſaying he had been kept from coming to ſee her by the deep fall of ſnow, and indeed from the parſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age-houſe to my hovel it was quite im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſible. I gave him all the particulars he aſked, and I am afraid a good many more, for my heart was quite full. He kindly gave me a ſhilling, and ſaid he would certainly try to pick out his way and come and ſee her in a day or two.</p>
            <p>While he was talking to me, a plain farmer-looking Gentleman in boots, who ſtood by, liſtened to all I ſaid, but ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to take no notice. It was Mr. Jenkins's wife's father, who was come to paſs the Chriſtmas holidays at the parſonage-houſe. I had always heard him ſpoken of as a plain frugal man, who lived cloſe himſelf, but was remarked to give away more than any of his ſhow-away neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</p>
            <p>Well! I went home with great ſpirits at this ſeaſonable and unexpected ſupply
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:037128_0019_100C90D087ACD418"/>
for we had tapped our laſt ſix-pence, and there was little work to be had on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the weather. I told my wife I was not come back empty handed. No, I dare ſay not, ſays ſhe, you have been ſerving a maſter "who filleth the hungry with good things, though he ſendeth the rich empty away." True, Mary, ſays I: we ſeldom fail to get good ſpiritual food from Mr. Jenkins, but to day he has kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſupplied our bodily wants. She was more thankful when I ſhewed her the ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, than I dare ſay, ſome of your great people are when they get an hundred pounds.</p>
            <p>Mr. Johnſon's heart ſmote him when he heard ſuch a value ſet upon a ſhilling; ſurely, ſaid he to himſelf, I will never waſte another; but he ſaid nothing to the Shepherd, who thus purſued his ſtory.</p>
            <p>Next morning before I went out, I ſent part of the money to buy a little ale and brown ſugar to put into her water gruel; which you know, Sir, made it nice and nouriſhing. I went out to cleave wood in a farm yard, for there was no ſtanding out on the plain, after ſuch a ſnow as had fallen in the night. I went with a lighter heart than uſual, becauſe I had left my
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:037128_0020_100C90D2A4A0F7E8"/>
poor wife a little better; and comfortably ſupplied for this day, and I now reſolved more than ever to truſt in God for the ſupplies of the next. When I came back at night, my wife fell a crying as ſoon as ſhe ſaw me. This, I own I thought but a bad return for the bleſſings ſhe had ſo lately received, and ſo I told her. O, ſaid ſhe, it is too much, we are too rich; I am now frightened, not leſt we ſhould have no portion in this world, but for fear we ſhould have our whole portion in it. Look here, John! So ſaying ſhe uncovered the bed whereon ſhe lay, and ſhewed me two warm, thick, new blank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets. I could not believe my own eyes, Sir, becauſe when I went out in the morning, I had left her with no other covering than our little old thin blue rug. I was ſtill more amazed when ſhe put half a crown into my hand, telling me ſhe had had a viſit from Mr. Jenkins, and Mr. Jones, the latter of whom had beſtowed all theſe good things upon us. Thus, Sir, have our lives been crowned with mercies. My wife got about again, and I do believe, under Providence, it was owing to theſe comforts; for the rheumatiſm, Sir, without blankets by
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:037128_0021_100C90D49D0703D8"/>
night and flannel by day, is but a bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh job, eſpecially to people who have little or no fire. She will always be a weakly body; but thank God her ſoul proſpers and is in health. But I beg your pardon, Sir, for talking on at this rate. Not at all, not at all, ſaid Mr. Johnſon; you ſhall certainly ſee me in a few days, Good night. So ſaying, he ſlipped a crown into his hand, and rode off. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſaid the Shepherd, <hi>goodness and mercy have followed me all the days of my life,</hi> as he gave the money to his wife when he got home at night.</p>
            <p>As to Mr. Johnſon, he found abundant matter for his thoughts during the reſt of his journey. On the whole he was more diſpoſed to envy than to pity the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd. I have ſeldom ſeen, ſaid he, ſo happy a man. It is a ſort of happineſs which the world could not give, and which I plainly ſee, it has not been able to take away. This muſt be the true ſpirit of Religion. I ſee more and more, that true goodneſs is not merely a thing of words and opinions, but a Living Principle brought into every common ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a man's life. What elſe could have ſupported this poor couple under
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:037128_0022_100C90D62D8434D8"/>
every bitter trial of want, and ſickneſs? No, my honeſt Shepherd, I do not pity, but I reſpect and even honour thee; and I will viſit thy poor hovel on my return to Saliſbury with as much pleaſure as I am now going to the houſe of my friend.</p>
            <p>If Mr. Johnſon keeps his word in ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me the account of his viſit to the Shepherd's cottage, I ſhall be very glad to entertain my readers with it, and ſhall conclude this firſt part.</p>

            <head>The Lancaſhire Collier Cirl. A TRUE STORY.</head>
            <figure/>
            <p>IN a ſmall village in Lancaſhire there li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a few years ago, an induſtrious man and his wife, who had ſix children. The man himſelf uſed to work in a neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing colliery, while the wiſe took care of the family, attended alſo to their little farm, and minded the dairy, and when all her other work was done, ſhe uſed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

not ſuffered to be idle. The eldeſt daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter worked with the mother at the ſpinning-wheel, which ſhe learnt to think a very pleaſant employment, and ſhe ſometimes accompanied her work with a cheerful hymn, or a good moral ſong, which her parents had taken care to teach her.</p>
            <p>But the ſecond daughter of the name of <hi>Mary</hi> is the chief ſubject of the preſent ſtory: when this girl was nine years old, the honeſt collier finding that he had but little employment for her above ground, took her to work with him down in the coal-pit together with one of his boys, who was then no more than ſeven years of age. Theſe two children readily put their ſtrength to the baſket; dragging the coals from the workmen to the mouth of the pit; and by their joint labours they did the duty of one of thoſe men, who are commonly called "the drawers," clearing thereby no leſs than ſeven ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings a week for their parents. It muſt be owned to be not impoſſible, that they may have ſometimes exerted themſelves even beyond their ſtrength; which is now and then the caſe with little children, through the fault of thoſe who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> act the work from them; but ſince in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>his caſe
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:037128_0025_100C90DE1A182D00"/>
the father had an eye to them during the hours of labour, while they had a prudent and tender mother alſo, to look after them at home, there is no particular reaſon to ſuppoſe, that at the time of which we are now ſpeaking, they were ever much o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-worked.</p>
            <p>Here then let us ſtop to remark how different was the caſe of this numerous family from that of many others, in the ſame humble ſituation of life. <hi>Mary</hi> and her brother, ſo far from being a burthen, were bringing a little fortune to their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, even when they were eight or ten years old; all the family were getting forward by the help of theſe little crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and their worldly comforts were now increaſing on every ſide.</p>
            <p>But alas! in the midſt of this cheerful and contented diligence, on one fatal day, while the good man was in the act of fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a baſket, in order to its being wound up, the children ſtanding near him in the coal-pit, ſome ſtones fell from the top of the pit, one of which fell on the father's head, and killed him on the ſpot. What a melancholy event was this! ſome diſmal circumſtances alſo remain to be told, which were the conſequences of it; but in order
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:037128_0026_100C90DFCD915F98"/>
to relieve the pain of my reader, I will here remark, that the moſt grievous afflictions are often appointed by providence, to be the means, in one way or other, of calling ſome extraordinary virtue into exerciſe; and accordingly we ſhall ſee that the calamity which is now ſpoken of, will introduce <hi>Mary,</hi> the young collier girl, to the farther good opinion of the reader.</p>
            <p>The mother, on hearing the news of her huſband's death, together with the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſad accident which gave occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to it, received ſuch a ſhock, that her mind was not able to bear up under it; ſhe became diſordered in her underſtanding, nor did ſhe to the end of her life recover her ſenſes. Being now rendered extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly helpleſs, ſhe was ſeparated from her children by the pariſh officers, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to take the charge of her for the ſpace of five years. A ſhort time after the father's death, the eldeſt daughter, (the ſpinner) married, and went from home; two of the brothers, (of the ages of nine and ſeven,) were bound apprentices by the pariſh, which alſo took the charge of two others, (one three years old, the other an infant) until they ſhould be ſufficiently grown up to be bound out alſo.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="unknown:037128_0027_100C90E170D06A08"/>In this place I cannot avoid obſerving, what a bleſſing it is to poor people in this country, that pariſh officers are obliged, in all ſuch caſes of neceſſity as that of which I am now ſpeaking, to give maintainance to thoſe, who apply to them, and what a pity it is that this wiſe and merciful proviſion of our laws ſhould ever be abuſed. <hi>Mary,</hi> the girl of whom we are giving the hiſtory, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been already trained to induſtry, was by no means diſpoſed to ſeek any unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary help from the pariſh, and being now between eleven and twelve years old, ſhe determined to maintain herſelf, like a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle independent woman, by her uſual work in the coal pit, where ſhe was generally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble after this time to earn at leaſt a ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling a day; in three or four years after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards earning no leſs than two ſhillings. And now I would aſk my young female readers, what they think was the manner in which ſhe employed all this fruit of her induſtry? Do you imagine that ſhe laid it out in vanity of dreſs, in nice eating and drinking, or other needleſs expence? or do you ſuppoſe that ſhe would now indulge herſelf in idleneſs on one or two days in the week, becauſe ſhe had got enough for
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:037128_0028_100C90E54D9BF688"/>
herſelf to live upon during the four or five working days? no: I truſt you will have formed no ſuch expectation: I hope you will be well aware what <hi>Mary</hi> did with her money, by having already reflected what you would have done with it in the like caſe. She in the firſt place releaſed the pariſh from the burthen of maintaining her mother, which ſhe did as ſoon as ſhe was arrived at the age of ſixteen, being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely anxious to take this poor diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed helpleſs parent home to live with her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: ſhe then relieved the pariſh officers from the charge of one of her brothers, and ſhe continued to provide for him, until he died. Having been taught never to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider her duty as done, while any part of it ſeemed to be left undone, ſhe afterwards undertook the maintainance of one of her other brothers, who remained with her du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſixteen weeks illneſs, at the end of which period ſhe followed him to the grave, burying him at her own expence. After a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſeven years the mother died alſo, and was buried in like manner by this dutiful child, without any aſſiſtance from the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh.</p>
            <p>If any of my readers ſhould here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire how it could be poſſible for ſo young
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:037128_0029_100C90E801F2E6C0"/>
a child to ſupport all theſe relations, many of them being alſo occaſionally very bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenſome through their ſickneſs? the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is, that in the caſe of theſe extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary calls upon her, ſhe uſed to betake herſelf to extraordinary labour, ſometimes earning no leſs than three ſhillings and ſix-pence in the four and twenty hours, by taking what is called "a double turn" in the coal-pits.</p>
            <p>The ready ſubmiſſion of <hi>Mary</hi> to her parents when ſhe was in early life, is ſo pleaſing a part of her character, that it may be proper in this place again, to make a remark upon it. Let my young readers recollect that in ſubmiſſion to the command of her father, or rather to that law of God which enjoins parental obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſhe cheerfully followed him down into the coal-pit, burying herſelf in the bowels of the earth, and there at a tender age, without excuſing herſelf on account of her ſex, ſhe joined in the ſame work with the miners, a race of men rough in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but highly uſeful to the community, of whom I am alſo happy to ſay that they have the character of being honeſt and faithful, as well as remarkably courageous, and that they have given moreover ſome
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:037128_0030_100C90EA2E88E338"/>
ſtriking inſtances of their readineſs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive religious inſtruction, when offered to them. Among theſe men to their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor be it ſpoken, <hi>Mary's</hi> virtue was ſafe, and after the death of her father, ſhe is even ſaid to have received protection, as well as aſſiſtance from them; her fatigue having been ſometimes leſſened, through their lending her a helping hand, with great feeling and kindneſs.</p>
            <p>But though <hi>Mary's</hi> mind was naturally ſtrong, and her conſtitution of body was very ſtout alſo, yet towards the end of the period which has been ſpoken of, ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be bowed down in ſome meaſure, by the afflictions and labors which ſhe had endured. It was evident that ſhe had now been led to exert herſelf beyond her ſtrength. How lamentable is it, that while ſo many people in the world are idle, and are contracting diſeaſes both of body and mind, from the abundance of their riches, and from want of ſome wholeſome and uſeful exerciſe, there ſhould be any bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like <hi>Mary,</hi> under their work, hidden in coal-pits, or from ſome cauſe or other removed from obſervation! what a pity is it I ſay, that the former ſhould not employ a little of their time and money in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:037128_0031_100C90EC70886870"/>
to find theſe diſtreſſed objects! And I may alſo add, how lamentable a thing is it, that while ſo many poor peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are ſeen, who are apt to complain too ſoon, there ſhould be any, who do not tell their diſtreſſes to thoſe who can help them (which I truſt however does not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten happen) till it is almoſt too late!</p>
            <p>I was obſerving that <hi>Mary</hi> began about this time evidently to loſe her ſtrength, and her head was alſo troubled by ſome of thoſe ſtrange and unpleaſant imaginations, which are known by perſons converſant with the diſeaſes of the poor, to be no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual conſequence of bad food, and great bodily fatigue, joined with exceſſive grief. At firſt ſhe was not aware that ſhe labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under any diſorder, for ſhe had ſeldom experienced ill health, while her relations were alive; and it ſeems probable that the comfort which ſhe derived from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection of affording them ſupport, and the pleaſing ſenſations which aroſe during the exerciſe of her attention to them had ſerved both to keep up her ſpirits, and to prevent her conſtitution from breaking down.</p>
            <p>I truſt it is not ſuperſtitious to ſuppoſe that when ſincere chriſtians come, as Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:037128_0032_100C90EE19CD7BE8"/>
now did, into very trying circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, they may hope, notwithſtanding any appearances to the contrary, to experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſtill in one way or other, the peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar bleſſing of Heaven; I do not expect that ſuch perſons will be free from pain, pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or ſickneſs, or other worldly evils, for it is often quite the contrary, but then I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that theſe very afflictions will be made the means of encreaſing their truſt in God, and prove in the end, (I mean ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther here or hereafter) to have been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely deſigned for their good. The cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of <hi>Mary</hi> were now riſen to ſuch a height, that thoſe who are not accuſtomed to view things in this religious and moſt comforting light, might be ready to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that the Almighty had forſaken her, and that there is little uſe in ſerving him. Let us here number up her afflictions. She had ſeen with her own eyes the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful death of her father, ſhe had for a long time witneſſed the affecting condition of her mother, who uſed to follow her about the houſe, without knowing the hand by which ſhe was ſupported; <hi>Mary,</hi> beſides this, had attended the long and drooping ſickneſs of her two brothers; and now ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving fallen ſick herſelf, being both weak in
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:037128_0033_100C90F143546EA8"/>
body, and ſadly enfeebled in her mind, ſhe was dwelling all alone in a little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortleſs habitation, having been deprived by death of every one of thoſe dear rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, the ſight of whom had many a time cheered her ſpirits, while the idea of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying them with a comfortable ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, had been uſed to ſweeten her em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, and lighten the ſeverity of her toil.</p>
            <p>It was at this period of her extremity that it pleaſed God to raiſe up for her ſome kind friends, in the manner which I ſhall now deſcribe.</p>
            <p>A lady of the ſame village heard that a ſervant's place was vacant in a neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing family, and adviſed <hi>Mary,</hi> feeble as ſhe was, to preſent herſelf there, as a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didate to fill this comparatively eaſy and comfortable ſituation. Accordingly the poor girl, with an anxious heart, went to offer her ſervices; ſhe mentioned with her uſual honeſty, what had been the habits of her former life, and what was the ſtate of her health alſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               </gap>t ſeemed undoubtedly much againſt her intereſt to do ſo, but it was perfectly right; and how can any of us hope for the bleſſing of God, or expect any true comfort in our minds when we
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:037128_0034_100C90F2D252C3F0"/>
fall into affliction, if we fly to unfair means of reſcuing ourſelves out of it; and inſtead of truſting in God, truſt to our own little frauds, and crooked contrivan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
            <p>The anſwer made to <hi>Mary's</hi> application was unfavourable, for it was thought, and indeed it was gently hinted, that a young woman, hitherto ſo much expoſed as ſhe had been, was not likely to prove a very fit inmate in a ſober private family.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mary</hi> felt very keenly this unhappy ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion againſt her character; but what could ſhe do? ſhe walked very quietly away, with a down-caſt look, and with a mind quite broken down by this freſh af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction and diſaſter. The owners of the manſion happened however to obſerve her countenance, and the peculiar modeſty of her manner, as ſhe was taking her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, for her patient and ſilent grief touched them far more ſenſibly than any loud complaints could have done and they therefore determined to make ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries concerning her. The gentleman went himſelf on the ſame day to the colli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery, where the maſter of the pit replied to his queſtions, nearly in the following terms. "Sir, ſaid he, ſhe is a poor girl
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:037128_0035_100C90F4636E6388"/>
that has over-worked herſelf, for ſhe has undertaken what we call taſk work, which is very hard labour; ſhe is one of the beſt girls that ever I knew, and is reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by all the colliers, and though (added he) I cannot deny that now and then my men take a cup too much, which is apt to make the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> ſometimes quarrelſome, yet they never ſuffer a bad <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to be ſpoken or an affront to be offered to a girl in the pit, without puniſhing the fellow who may be guilty, and making him heartily aſhamed of himſelf."</p>
            <p>This rule of decency and propriety towards young women, eſtabliſhed by a ſet of coarſe miners, is here recorded for the benefit of ſome of thoſe perſons, who are pleaſed to call themſelves their betters.</p>
            <p>The Gentleman, after a very minute and full exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, was ſo well ſatisfied of the good character of <hi>Mary,</hi> that ſhe was received into his ſervice, in which ſhe has now been living comfortably for about the ſpace of ſix years. Her health is recovered, her habits of diligence are ſtill very great, and ſhe is ſaid to be of a remarkably modeſt, humble and contented ſpirit. It may not be improper to mention, that the maſter of the houſe in which ſhe is, has furniſhed all the materials of this ſtory.</p>
            <p>I will now take leave of my readers, by remarking, that the little tale which I have been reciting, ſeems to me to hold out the following uſeful leſſons.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place, I think it may teach the poor, that they can ſeldom be in any condition of life ſo low, as to prevent their riſing to ſome degree of independence, if they chuſe to exert themſelves, and that there can be no ſituation whatever ſo mean, as to forbid the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of many noble virtues. It may inſtruct the rich not to turn the poor from their doors, merely on account of firſt appearances, but rather to examine into their character, expecting ſometimes to find peculiar modeſty and merit, even in the moſt expoſed ſituations. This
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:037128_0036_100C90F6A4AB9E78"/>
ſtory alſo may encourage the afflicted to ſerve and truſt God in every extremity: and finally, it may teach all deſcriptions of perſons, who may have to paſs through dangerous and trying circumſtances, that they may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the divine protection and bleſſing, provided they are not needleſsly throwing themſelves in the way of temptation, but are endeav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>ng like <hi>Mary</hi>
               <q>to learn and labour truly to get their own living, and to do their duty in that ſtate of life, unto which it hath pleaſed God to call them.</q>
