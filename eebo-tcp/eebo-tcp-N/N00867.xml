            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

The <hi>Commandment is exceeding broad,</hi> &amp; preſcribes you <hi>Rules</hi> for your whole man, &amp; for the right behaving of your ſelves in every part of your Converſation; Oh hide the word in your hearts; lay up the <hi>Rules</hi> you are to work by, the <hi>Rules</hi> that you are to give by, the <hi>Rules</hi> that you are to ſpeak by, to hear by; be ſure there be no part of your Converſation but that

you have ſome <hi>Rules</hi> that you ſet to your ſelves about it.

                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Rule.</hi> You muſt have the whole <hi>Lump</hi> of the heart leavened &amp; ſeaſoned with <hi>Religion.</hi> Mat. 13.33. <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven is like unto leaven which a woman hid, &amp;c.</hi> The <hi>Word</hi> is this <hi>Leaven,</hi> the <hi>Heart</hi> is this <hi>Lump,</hi> in which this <hi>Leaven</hi> is hid; now when the whole Lump is throughly Leavened, there will be ſuch a ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs betwixt the heart and the work, that <hi>Religion</hi> will become a pleaſure.

Pſal. 40.8. <hi>I delight to do thy Will, thy Law is within my heart.</hi> Where Religion hath taken deep root in the heart, the concerns of Chriſt will become its natural care, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.20. now that which is natural is delightful; and when a man loves his work, he will be much in it. Again, that which is natural is conſtant, ſo
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:001044_0004_0FAEEB178A469998"/>
that when the heart is naturalized &amp; habituated to <hi>Religion,</hi> the man will conſtantly follow it. To a heart throughly Sanctified, Religion is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Element it lives in, <hi>when the heart is renewed and made ſpiritual, 't will naturally mind the things of the Spirit,</hi> Rom. 8.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Rule.</hi> You muſt have theſe <hi>Six Principles</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrought and deeply engraven in your Souls.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>That Religion is the very end of your being, that you were made and maintained for.</hi> This is the end and uſe of all your powers and faculties, that you may ſerve and glorify the God that made you; He made you for himſelf, Prov. 16.4. <hi>For His pleaſure you are &amp; were Created. Rev.</hi> 4.11. Oh man, look upon thy ſelf; think, whence thou art, what a little while ſince thou waſt not, how cameſt thou to be? Hath not the hand of God framed thee? Think with thy ſelf, wherefore ſerve all theſe powers and faculties? To what end were they given me? What to Eat, and Drink, &amp; Sleep, and Sport? If I had been a Bruit, I could have done this; wherefore have I reaſon above the reſt of the Creatures, but that I ſhould anſwer the Law of my Creation, and the end of my being, and know my Makers end, and <hi>do His pleaſure?</hi> Better I had never been Born, than not to anſwer my end; better I had been a Bruit than a Man, unleſs I Glorify God with
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:001044_0005_0FAEEB18A2AC2CC8"/>
my underſtanding, and employ my powers &amp; faculties in his ſervice. Oh let theſe thoughts live daily upon your hearts. Fix it upon your Souls that you are of no uſe nor worth in the world, except you ſerve your Makers ends.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>That look as you do manage the great buſineſs of Religion, ſo you are made or marr'd to all Eternity.</hi> Settle it upon your hearts, that if this buſineſs miſcarry, you are undone for evermore; You may miſcarry in any other bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, and yet do well enough at laſt, but if you don't go through with the buſineſs of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, you are undone men. Believe it, <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is no trifling matter;</hi> if thou be careleſs and idle, and remiſs here, thou art a <hi>Damned man.</hi> The reaſon why Religion is minded with ſo little care, is, becauſe men do not conſider the Conſequence of Religion. <hi>Can you Dy? Can you Burn?</hi> If not, take heed of trifling in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and of ſelling Heaven for want of a little pains taking. Oh, wherever you be unſerious, be ſure you be ſerious and in earneſt in the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of Religion. And that you may be ſo, let this ever dwell upon hearts, that halving and trifling will undoe all.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>That nothing is well done, except it be Religiouſly done.</hi> Do all in the Name of the Lord Jeſus. Col. 3.17. <hi>Do all to the glory of God.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. Remember the Rules of <hi>Religion</hi>
                     <pb n="7" facs="unknown:001044_0006_0FAEEB19ECED9258"/>
don't only reach your Praying, Hearing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but your Eating, Drinking, Trading, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Count that hour loſt, that is not ſpent Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly; Your lying down, and riſing up, muſt be managed Religiouſly, or elſe they are not well managed; and you muſt impoſe it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your ſelves, to be ſerving God, not only on your knees, but in your Shops, in the Field, at your Tables, in your Journeys, <hi>that God may be Glorified by you in all things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>That the trade of Religion, of all others, yields the ſweeteſt pleaſure, and ſureſt gain.</hi> A Religious Holy life is a Spiritual trading. <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.16. Now there is no trade to this. A Chriſtian is a <hi>Merchant</hi> that deals for no ſmall matters, but for <hi>goodly Pearls. Mat.</hi> 13.5. A believer trades for Grace and Glory. Oh how Glorious is the prize, and how excellent and unvaluable is the income of Religion! <hi>Wiſdom is more precious than Rubies; all the things thou canſt deſire are not to be compared to her, the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe of it is better then the merchandiſe of ſilver, and the gain thereof then fine gold.</hi> Read <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.11. &amp; <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. to 19. Every man will be dealing in that Commodity that yields great profit. The reaſon why men have ſo little heart for Religion is, becauſe they have ſecretly an opinion that there is little to be got by it. They ſay in their hearts <hi>it is vain
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:001044_0007_0FAEEB1B1449E0D0"/>
to ſerve God,</hi> Mal. 3.14. and, <hi>what profit ſhall we have if we pray unto Him?</hi> Job 21.15. But when a man taſts the pleaſure, &amp; finds the gain of Religion, then he will ſet to it to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and like the wiſe merchant, employ all his ſtock here. <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.44. As ever then you would wake Religion your buſineſs, get your hearts throughly poſſeſſed with the advantage and profit, the pleaſure &amp; the gain, that comes in by Religion. There are two great pillars upon which Religion ſtands the one is, <hi>A belief that God is:</hi> and the other is, <hi>That he is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder of them that diligently ſeek him.</hi> Heb. 11.6. Then let this dwell upon your hearts, that you cannot better your ſtate, nor promote your happineſs any way in all the world ſo much as by Religion, no pleaſure nor profit to that of Religion: <hi>Riches and Honour are with her, all her wayes are pleaſantneſs; Shee is a tree of Life to them that lay hold upon her, and happy is every one that retaineth her,</hi> Prov. 3.17.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>That your time is ſhort, your work great, and muſt be done now or never.</hi> Remember with Chriſt, that now you have a day to work in, and it but a <hi>Day,</hi> and the <hi>Night</hi> is haſtning upon you when there is no work to be done; no more <hi>Praying,</hi> no more <hi>Hearing</hi> &amp;c. Let it ever dwell upon you, <hi>that there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wiſdom in the Grave
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:001044_0008_0FAEEB1BD334FA18"/>
whither thou art going.</hi> And this will put you upon doing the work of <hi>Religion</hi> with all your might: Be convinced of the weight of your work, remember of what dreadful Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence it is, your Salvation is at ſtake, and therefore you muſt <hi>work it out with fear and trembling.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly. <hi>That except you make it your buſineſs, all your Religion is in vain.</hi> While you halt &amp; halve it in <hi>Religion,</hi> you come but half way to heaven. Settle it upon your hearts, that except you are throughout Religious, you are Religious to no purpoſe. Be ſure you ſhall never come to heaven, except you ſeek it in Gods order. Mat. 6.33. <hi>Seek firſt,</hi> &amp;c. It were not ſuitable to the wiſdom of God, ſo to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalue His Chriſt and Glory, as to throw them away upon thoſe that account other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters better worth their pains and care.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Rule.</hi> You muſt have <hi>the Love of God,</hi> &amp; <hi>Religion,</hi> lying next your hearts; Love is a buſy Grace, 1 Theſ. 1.3. <hi>Your labour of love.</hi> Love will conſtrain you, and put you upon a willing and diligent keeping Gods Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Get your hearts in love with the Laws and Ways of God; who more buſy then <hi>David,</hi> thinking and talking of God and his wayes all the day, and all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Store up in Heaven apace,</hi> and ſee that you be rich <hi>towards God.</hi> Give your ſelves to <hi>Prayer,</hi> let <hi>Reading</hi> the Word, <hi>Meditation, ſelf-Examination</hi> be your daily Exerciſes: <hi>Do good to all men,</hi> ſerve your Generation with dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, ſtudy to be <hi>

Let ſomewhat be mended <hi>every day;</hi> forget not that holy Counſel to meditate <hi>every Evening,</hi> that ſeeing thy days are numbred, there is <hi>one more</hi> of thy number ſpent, and thou art now nearer to thy end <hi>by a Day.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. Be always about your <hi>Fathers buſineſs,</hi> your Lord &amp; Maſters work, that Death may not be able to find you <hi>doing evil,</hi> or <hi>doing nothing. Bleſſed is that Servant whom his Lord when He cometh ſhall find ſo doing.</hi> Remember in what you undertake that <hi>Death</hi> may overtake you before you have ended; therefore ſee you go about no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without <hi>Gods warrant;</hi> carry this with you, and you need not fear Deaths ſurprizal; Wo unto you if Death find you with your <hi>work to do:</hi> This was <hi>Pauls</hi> joy, <hi>I have fought a good fight, I have finiſhed my courſe, I have kept the Faith, henceforth is laid up for me a Crown of Righteouſneſs.</hi>

You muſt never be ſecure: You muſt pray, and ſet a watch, &amp; be always upon your guard; walk e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day ſome ſerious turns with <hi>Death.</hi> Let it never come unlookt for; <hi>Conſider your latter end,</hi> learn to <hi>number your dayes;</hi> God doth number them why ſhould not you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If <hi>the man of the houſe had known what hour of the night the Thief would have come, he would have watched, and not have ſuffered his houſe to be broken up;</hi> but it is too late to think of it when the houſe is ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled. Be not of them that <hi>put far off the evil day;</hi> it is the remembrance of of Death puts life in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our Prayers, &amp; into all our motions; he that remembers not his end, remembers nothing as he ſhould.</p>

But if you give up your ſelves entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beforehand to Jeſus Chriſt, and accept him by believing on his own terms, this will ſecure you in him, then the danger of this is over.
