            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <q>WHATEVER we find Bitter to us in our Travel thro' the Wilderneſs of this World; there is a TREE, the Application whereof will take away all the Bitterneſs.</q>
            <p>THE firſt Thing which we have now to be ſenſible of, is a Thing which we all cannot but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

But, alas, They are <hi>Bitter Waters,</hi> which we meet withal: Such <hi>Diſappointments</hi> do our <hi>Thirſty Souls,</hi> relying upon <hi>Creatures,</hi> meet withal. In the old Records of the Church, we find a Godly Woman, among the Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers thro' the Wilderneſs of this World; who ſaid, Ruth I. 20. <hi>Call me, Marah; Becauſe the Almighty has greatly cauſed bitterneſs unto me.</hi> Truly, The <hi>bitter Waters</hi> of <hi>Marah,</hi> are ſo diſpenſed unto them who Travel thro' the Wilderneſs, that the Travellers themſelves claim the Name of <hi>Marah</hi> too. Our <hi>Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> will anon Terminate in a <hi>Pleaſant Land.</hi> The <hi>Promis'd Land</hi> will be found a <hi>pleaſant Land;</hi> verily, in that Land, there will be found <hi>Fulneſs of Joy,</hi> and <hi>Pleaſures forever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</hi> The <hi>bitter Waters</hi> of the <hi>Wilderneſs</hi> are moſt <hi>W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Alluding unto this, my Obſervation ſhall be, That <hi>Sin, Sin,</hi> ſhall be conſidered as the <hi>Star</hi> that falls upon the <hi>Fountains</hi> of our <hi>Waters:</hi> This, as a <hi>Comet</hi> bears down upon us, and its Influences reach to the <hi>bottom</hi> of our Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the World.

            <p>BUT can we come at nothing to <hi>ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en</hi> the <hi>bitter Waters?</hi> Yes, there is a Second Thing to be now Remarkable with us.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First.</hi> THE <hi>Bitter Waters</hi> of <hi>Repentance</hi> will be wonderfully <hi>Sweetened,</hi> when a CHRIST is well-applied unto us.

There will hereupon come unto thee that Meſſage from GOD; 2 Sam.

AND now, What is become of the <hi>Bitter Waters?</hi> They are ſtrangely <hi>Sweetened.</hi> The Sweet <hi>Hope</hi> &amp; <hi>Joy</hi> of the <hi>Salvation of GOD;</hi> This gives to the Soul, the <hi>Conſolations</hi> that are <hi>not ſmall.</hi> The Soul cannot but be <hi>of good Cheer,</hi> when that Voice comes from GOD un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, <hi>Child, Thy Sins are Forgiven thee!</hi> The <hi>bitter Herbs</hi> of the <hi>Paſsover,</hi> did they not loſe their <hi>bitterneſs</hi> by the <hi>Paſchal Lamb,</hi> which they were annex'd unto! <hi>Repentance</hi> is a Diet of <hi>bitter Herbs;</hi> But there is this to <hi>ſweeten</hi> it; CHRIST <hi>our Paſſover has been Sacrificed for us.</hi> Yea, more than This. A Soul thus <hi>Justified,</hi> will now be ſo <hi>Sanctified,</hi> that the very Exerciſe of <hi>Repentance</hi> itſelf, ſhall be beyond all expreſſion <hi>ſweet</hi> unto it. The <hi>Paſt</hi> of the Renewed Soul will be ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, that it will find a Thouſand times more <hi>ſweetneſs</hi> in the <hi>Repenting</hi> of Sin, than ever it found in the <hi>Committing</hi> of Sin. Of <hi>Religion</hi> they that have tried it, bear this Teſtimony, <hi>All the ways of Wiſdom are pleaſant ways. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> is the moſt <hi>bitter</hi> Thing in <hi>Religion.</hi> But it is now found, that there is more <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi> in <hi>Mourning</hi> for Sin, than there is in <hi>Acting</hi> of it. Tis a <hi>ſweeter</hi> Thing by far, to <hi>Mortify</hi> a Luſt, than it can be to <hi>Gratify</hi> it. <hi>Regeneration</hi> will bring ſuch a change upon the <hi>woful Reliſh</hi> which we have had, when we have put <hi>ſweet for bitter, and bitter for

            <p>
               <hi>Secondly.</hi> THE <hi>Bitter Waters</hi> of <hi>Affliction</hi> will be wonderfully <hi>Sweetened,</hi> when a CHRIST is well-applied unto us. <hi>O Thou Afflicted and not Comforted,</hi> Converſe much with a CHRIST, under thy <hi>Affliction,</hi> and thou wilt ſoon be <hi>Comforted.</hi> Thy <hi>Affliction</hi> comes to drive thee unto thy SAVIOUR.

Thy <hi>Affliction</hi> is the <hi>Croſs</hi> which thy SAVIOUR has aſſign'd unto thee. Go with it unto the <hi>Croſs</hi> which thy SAVIOUR has endured for thee. Throw as much as thou canſt of this <hi>Tree</hi> into thy <hi>bitter Waters.</hi> 'Twill ſo <hi>ſweeten</hi> them, that all the <hi>bitterneſs</hi> thereof ſhall be to thee, but <hi>as Waters that paſs away.</hi> One very deeply concerned with <hi>bitter Waters,</hi> being able to ſay, <hi>I have poured out my Soul unto the Lord;</hi> It is Reported, <hi>She was no more ſad.</hi> Going to the Lord with the <hi>Out-pourings of thy Soul,</hi> thou wilt put that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>bitter Waters,</hi> by the means whereof, thou mayeſt be <hi>no more ſad.</hi> Thou mayſt now

            </p>
            <p>WHAT we have now to do, is to ſhew, How the <hi>Bitter Waters</hi> of <hi>Marah,</hi> will be <hi>Sweetened,</hi> by a CHRIST Converſed withal? The followers of <hi>Gid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

in this War, a very Particular Commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is due, to Captain JOSIAH WINSLOW; a Young Gentleman, who was the Flowre and Hope of an Honourable Family; and has fallen Univerſally Lamented.</p>

               <p>AS he was a Young Man of a Beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Countenance; of an Hail and Firm Conſtitution of Body, which enabled him to act with much Vigour, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go the Hardſhips of the War; So he was of a Pleaſant and Spritely Witt; of a Sweet Diſpoſition; Of a Free and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Temper; Modeſt and Baſhful in his Behaviour, Full of Life; and full of Love to every One: Of ſo Condeſcending a Spirit, that it ſometimes drew him into Inconveniences: Obedient and Reſpectful to his Superiors; Kind to all; Far from Inſulting over his Inferiors; which gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him great Reſpect from thoſe that were Acquainted with him; and eſpecially of the Souldiers that were under him; He was ſo far from taking any Advantage, that in their Streights and Difficulties, he has given ſometimes to Poor Fellows

Here they lay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcovered by ours, as ours were by them, until they put off in their Boats from the Iſland. After they had come ſome Diſtance
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:002668_0036_0FE5F6954149BE10"/>
from the Iſland, Capt. <hi>Winſlow</hi> being in the foremoſt Boat, and Sergeant <hi>Harvy</hi> in the other, there came a Flock of Fowl within Shot of <hi>Harvy'</hi>s, at which one of the Men Imprudently made a Shot, and knock'd down a Fowl in the Water. <hi>Harvy</hi> turning to take up the <hi>Fowl,</hi> Capt. <hi>Winſlow</hi> adviſed him, that it was beſt he ſhould not follow the Fowl, but that they ſhould keep together; for, ſaid he, <hi>We know not what we may meet with, before we reach the Fort. Harvy</hi> replied, <hi>Syr, If you will go eaſy upon your Oars, I will be preſently up with you:</hi> But following the Fowl too long, and going too near one ſide of the River, the <hi>Indians</hi> let fly from the ſhore upon <hi>Harvy</hi> and killed Three of his Men. Sergeant <hi>Harvy</hi> found himſelf obliged imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to land; where he was quickly kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and all the Men with him, except Three of our <hi>Chriſtian Indians</hi> that were with him in this Expedition, who found their way to eſcape, and got ſafe unto the Fort. <hi>Harvy</hi> fought with abundance of Courage; and ſo did the Men that were with him; The <hi>Wolves</hi> found that they had <hi>Lions</hi> to engage withal. When the <hi>Indians</hi> Fired upon <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,</hi> Capt. <hi>Winſlow,</hi> though he had gone ſlowly on his Oars, was got near half a Mile a head. But ſeeing the <hi>Indians</hi> Fire upon <hi>Harvy,</hi> his Manly, Friendly, Ingenuous &amp; Courageous

Heart could not bear to leave them in their Diſtreſs; but immediately put about his Boat, that he might haſten to their Succour. Before he could get near them, he found himſelf Surrounded with between Thirty and Forty Canoes; whereof ſeveral had four or ſix Men a piece aboard; which came off from both ſides of the River, and attack'd him with great Fury. They ſet up an hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Yelling &amp; Howling, expecting thereby ſo to have daunted them, as to have taken our ſmall Handful without much Reſiſtance: But in this their expectation failed them; for Capt. <hi>Winſlow</hi> and his Brave Handful, notwithſtanding the Horror of their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, and tho' ſo out-numbered, and like to be Over-powered, by ſuch a Multitude of the <hi>Dragons of the Wilderneſs,</hi> made ready to give them a warm Reception. The <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> encloſing of him with their Canoes, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended at once to have him aboard: But when they were almoſt come aboard him, he Fired upon them; Notwithſtanding which, they came up to the ſides of his Boat where he and his few men defended themſelves, and beat off the <hi>Indians</hi> with the Butt-ends of their Muskets<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This they did with ſuch Magnanimity and Reſolution, that the <hi>Indians</hi> recoiled, retired, and fell off, and fought at a diſtance. They were

ſo ſtruck with Admiration at Young WINS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LOW'S Courage, that they offered him Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, if he would Surrender himſelf &amp; Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; But he refuſed it: Knowing their <hi>Tender Mercies</hi> to be <hi>Cruelties,</hi> and chuſing rather to lay down his Life in the Service of his Country, than fall into the Hands of ſuch Faithleſs and Cruel and Bloody Salvages. Thus he kept Fighting in his Boat, until the Dusk of Evening; when, the moſt of his Men being Slain, he put aſhore with Two or Three that were left; where being way-laid by the <hi>Indians,</hi> they were all cut off.</p>
            <p>WE are told, that he being ſhot down, and having his Thigh broken, the <hi>Indians,</hi> when they ſaw him fall, ran towards him: And yet then he recovered on his other knee, and ſhot down another <hi>Indian.</hi>
