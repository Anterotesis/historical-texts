            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A Conciſe Refutation, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THIS government, Aſtoniſhed at the late extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary claims of New-Hampſhire and Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſetts-Bay to the territory of Vermont, and the following remarks having been omitted in any piece heretofore publiſhed on the ſubject, find themſelves under the diſagreeable neceſſity of publicly expoſing the imbecility, and depravity of thoſe governments, whoſe candour, on the very firſt attempt, ſhould have ſuggeſted to them, that in proſecuting ſuch claims, they would unavoidably become accomplices with the government of New-York, in their many aggravated and long continued oppressions of the people of this State. This government ſenſible of the devices of certain leading gentlemen of the government of New-York againſt them, and being appriſed that they had ſometime ſince propoſed to certain leading gentlemen in the States of New-Hampſhire and Maſſachuſetts-Bay, to divide this State among the three States a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid, which are now actually claiming it ſeveral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſenſible likewiſe of our danger from the fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier ſituation to the Province of Quebec, and of the
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:016694_0003_0F9D7830335382D8"/>influence which the government of New-York (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if corrobarated by thoſe of New-Hampſhire and Maſſachuſetts-Bay) might have in the Congreſs of the United States, in which we have not been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented. Theſe apprehenſions excited this govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to remonſtrate at the General Courts of New Hampſhire and Maſſachuſetts-Bay, againſt their making and proſecuting ſuch claims, which, in their nature and tendency, are cruel, unjuſtifiable and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any reaſonable foundation for their ſupport:—And having received ſeveral acts of Congreſs of the 24th of September laſt, among which is contained a recommendation to the ſeveral States of New Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, Maſſachuſetts-Bay and New-York, to paſs laws expreſsly authorizing the Grand Council of America to hear and determine the differences which have ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted between them, on one part, and the inhabitants of a diſtrict of country called the New Hampſhire Grants (as they are pleaſed to term them) on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, on the firſt day of February next; and a cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (only) to the inhabitants of the latter to chooſe Agents and otherwiſe prepare for the hearing aforeſaid; have therefore thought it expedient to exhibit to the world, and to the honorable Congreſs, as a very reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectable part of it, the apparent impropriety of thoſe claims.</p>
            <p>AND firſtly, we ſhall conſider the pretenſion; of Maſſachuſetts-Bay. It is admitted that previous to the adjudication of the boundary line in 1739, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween New-Hampſhire and Maſſachuſetts-Bay, the latter had claimed a conſiderable part of the preſent juriſdiction of New-Hampſhire, from the atlantic ocean on the eaſt part, (which claim did equally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfere with the territory now in diſpute) and in lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:016694_0004_0F9D7830E1C5B4C8"/>through the main land to the ſouth ſea, on the weſt part, as deſcribed in the charter of the Colony of Maſſachuſetts Bay. This antiquated claim of Maſſachuſetts-Bay was refered to the King and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, by an appeal from a Court of Commiſſioners previouſly authorized by the ſame authority to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, and mark out the boundaries between the ſaid two Provinces; as may appear from the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing extract of the ſettlement of that line, viz.</p>
            <p>
               <q>AND whereas appeals from the determination of the ſaid Commiſſioners, have been ſaid before his Majeſty, by the Agents for the reſpective Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Maſſachuſetts-Bay and New-Hampſhire; which ſaid appeals have been heard before the Committee of Council for hearing appeals, from the plantations, who, after having conſidered the whole matter, and heard all parties concerned therein, did report unto his Majeſty as their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the northern boundary of the ſaid Province of Maſſachuſetts-Bay are, and be, a ſimilar curve line, purſuing the courſe of Merimack River at three miles diſtance on the north ſide thereof, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning at the Atlantic ocean, and ending at a point due north of a place (in a plan returned by ſaid Commiſſioners) called Pantucket Falls; and a ſtraight line drawn from thence due weſt croſs the ſaid river till it meets with his Majeſty's other governments; which ſaid report of the Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee of Council, his Majeſty hath been pleaſed with the advice of his Privy Council to approve, and to declare, adjudge and order, that the northern boundary of the ſaid Province of the Maſſachuſetts-Bay are and be a ſimilar curve line, purſuing the courſe of Merimack River at three miles diſtance,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:016694_0005_0F9D7831A28280D0"/>on the north ſide thereof, beginning at the atlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic ocean, and ending at a point due north of a place in the plan returned by the ſaid Commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers called Pantucket-Falls; and a ſtrait line drawn from thence due weſt croſs the ſaid river, till it meets his Majeſty's other governments.</q> This adjudication was made in 1739, which was forty years ago, and the government of the Maſſachuſetts-Bay have regulated their juriſdiction accordingly ever ſince; which is too notorious to be diſputed, and may be further illuſtrated by a variety of acts of their own, as well as of the Britiſh government; one of them reſpects Fort-Dummer, which was built by the Maſſachuſetts-Bay Province in 1724, and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſoned at their expence a number of years; but upon its being excluded from their juriſdiction by the ſettlement of the boundary line aforeſaid, the Bay Province repreſented to the government at home, that the ſaid diſtrict of land claimed as aforeſaid, and Fort-Dummer, having been determired to be the property of New-Hampſhire, they were no longer obliged to garriſon and maintain it; and praying, that as it was neceſſary for the defence of that part of the country, that New-Hampſhire might be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to ſupport it. In conſequence of which, an order paſſed the King and Council in 1744, as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, viz. <q>That the Governor and Commander in Chief of New Hampſhire ſhould forthwith move the Aſſembly, in his Majeſty's name, to make a proviſion for that ſervice;</q> and at the ſame time informing them, <q>that in caſe they refuſed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with ſo reaſonable and neceſſary a propoſal, his Majeſty would find himſelf under the neceſſity of reſtoring that fort, with a proper diſtrict of land contiguous to it, to the province of the Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſetts-Bay,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:016694_0006_0F9D7832633B2270"/>who cannot (with juſtice) be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to maintain a fort no longer within their boundary.</q> In conſequence of this requiſition New-Hampſhire did actually maintain Fort Dum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and paid a demand of arrears for its previous ſupport, to Maſſachuſetts-Bay; and the receipt thereof remains in the Secretary's office of New-Hampſhire to this day.</p>
            <p>AFTER theſe ſolemn governmental tranſactions, and actual compliance of Maſſachuſetts-Bay to the ſaid royal adjudication, their pretenſions to the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction of Vermont appears to be not only imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent but arbitrary; and ſhould ſuch a precedent take place, would make an end to all juriſdictional limitations through the United States, as well as thoſe of Vermont; as in this caſe no antient ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of boundary lines reſpecting them could be valid, and conſequently, the greateſt confuſions and diſorders would neceſſarily enſue. Furthermore, if there be any thing in thoſe pretenſions of Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts-Bay, they equally affect the actual juriſdiction of New Hampſhire to the eaſtward of Connecticut river, over which eaſtern part, when Maſſachuſetts-Bay ſhall exerciſe their juriſdiction, it will be early enough for them to do the ſame over an equal width of the juriſdiction of Vermont. After all, provided there be any reality in thoſe pretenſions, there is a great deal in them, as they are founded on a charter right, and conſequently challenge the right of ſoil. This the principal gentlemen of their court gave our Agent to underſtand, that they demanded, with juriſdiction; which opens another ſcene of expence to the inhabitants (provided their pretended claim takes place). This will undoubtedly be diſpleaſing
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:016694_0007_0F9D78332208C4C0"/>to the preſent occupents, their lands having been (the greater part of them) already granted by New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire and New-York; but there is no probability of ſatisfying the many unwarrantable and avaricious claims of the ſeveral contending governments, the citizens of Vermont, therefore judge it reaſonable to reject them.</p>
            <p>THIS government have ſuch a ſacred regard to the occupency of land within their juriſdiction, that they would not wiſh to have the poſſeſſors and occupents diſturbed in their poſſeſſions: notwithſtanding ſuch lands may have been appropriated by either of the contending governments (New-York not excepted).</p>
            <p>WE come now to the conſideration of the pretenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of New-Hampſhire to the juriſdiction of Vermont, by introducing the ſettlement of the boundary line between them and New-York, as follows, viz.</p>

His Majeſty taking the ſame into conſideration, was pleaſed, with the advice of his Privy Council, to approve of what is herein propoſed, and doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly hereby order and declare, the weſt bank of the river Connecticut, from where it enters the province of the Maſſachuſetts-Bay, as far north as the forty-fifth degree of northern latitude, to be the boundary line between the ſaid two pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of New-Hampſhire and New-York, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the reſpective Governors and Commanders in Chief of his Majeſty's ſaid provinces of New-Hampſhire and New-York, for the time being, and all others whom it may concern, are to take notice of his Majeſty's pleaſure hereby ſignified, and govern themſelves accordingly.</p>

The attention of
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:016694_0009_0F9D7834A190F4E0"/>the reader is requeſted very particularly to the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing obſervations, viz. The territory of Vermont, until the people's declaration of independence, was extra-provincial land, and the governments of New-Hampſhire and New-York claimed the juriſdiction of it by turns, merely <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               </gap> the ſovereign will and pleaſure of the King, as neither of theſe govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were poſſeſſed of any charter right, as a body politic, which they could call their own, or challenge in their own right. Had New-Hampſhire been poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of ſuch a charter-right, their claim would have been more reſpectable and permanent, and would have operated againſt the adjudication of 1764 afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, provided ſuch boundaries had been previouſly aſcertained: But this diſputed territory being in thoſe times crown lands, and without the limits of any of the (then) colonies or plantations, the King's autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over it was therefore abſolute; and while this power remained in being, the laſt royal decree was valid and binding, which was that of 1764 aforeſaid, which extended the juriſdiction of New-York over the ſaid territory; at which time the claim of New-Hampſhire to the premiſes became extinct and finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; nor is it in their power to renew their claim to this government, being wholly deſtitute of any char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter right thereto, and having loſt it by the ſame ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary power by which alone they acquired it, and therefore ought to be finally ſilent about it, as well as on account of their own relinquiſhing of ſuch claim, and not affording the inhabitants any protection or juriſdictional ſupport for a ſucceſſion of years; but ſince the declaration of the independence of this State, have not only relinquiſhed their ſaid claim by their governmental tranſactions, explicitly acknowledging the independence of this State: The proper creden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:016694_0010_0F9D7835632D2468"/>of this laſt fact will be exhibited in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſheets, with ſome further illuſtration:—Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at preſent impatient to obſerve, that as the claim of New-Hampſhire to this territory was nullified, and became extinct, in conſequence of the royal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of 1764 aforeſaid, as before argued; and as the claim of New-York to this territory was equally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient as that of New-Hampſhire, to any charter right as a body politic, or inherent conſtitutional juriſdiction; the claim of New-York therefore only ſurvived that of New-Hampſhire from the arbitrary decree of 1764, to the glorious aera of AMERICAN LIBERTY and INDEPENDENCE, which was declared the fourth day of July 1776, and then expired alſo, to the inexpreſſible joy of the free citizens of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont, who, in conſequence thereof, reverted to a ſtate of nature, and have ſince formed government on the true principles of liberty.</p>
            <p>THIS royal arbitrary line in the time of the kingly power was in the nature of it incompatible with the rights of a free people as they were thereby diveſted of the ineſtimable privilege of chooſing their own form of government, and of electing their chief ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates; nor were they in ſuch circumſtances, in any condition, to know what form or alteration of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment might next take place, as the King and his creatures were the ſole arbitrators of it. In fine, this people have ſuffered every indignity and oppreſſion, that prodigal and lucrative governors, and their ſwarm of hungry dependants could invent, and carry into execution; and it is ſurpriſing, that any perſons that live in theſe days of liberty, ſtill entertain any idea that the ſaid boundary line ſhould operate in favour of the claim of New-York. From this ſhort
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:016694_0011_0F9D783621B322E0"/>review of the claims of Maſſachuſetts-Bay and New-Hampſhire, they cannot effect the claim of Vermont to independence; which may be further illuſtrated by a two fold argument, viz. provided thoſe adju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated boundary lines of 1739 and 1764 aforeſaid, be deemed authentic and valid, their claims to Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont muſt be conſidered as nugatory and abortive; but on the other hand, if thoſe adjudicated lines, be conſidered as null and void, in this caſe the claim of Vermont to the juriſdiction of this territory, would be much better grounded, than theſe of Maſſachuſetts-Bay or New-Hampſhire, inaſmuch as their govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath for a long time been formed by the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the people at large, or their legal repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, who under God have a natural and indiſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble right to form their own governments; ſo that the claims of Maſſachuſetts Bay and New-Hampſhire to this territory, are bar'd either by the aforeſaid ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judication, or in conſequence of the legal eſtabliſhment of the government of Vermont, nor is it poſſible for any one, or both of thoſe governments, to ſet up a third principle, whereby they can deduce a legal or juſt claim to any part of this government; for if their claims are not founded on the lines formerly aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the Britiſh government, or the free conſent and mutual aſſociation of the people of this territory, their pretenſions are frivolous, or tyrannical. This two fold argument is not viewed as being abſolutely neceſſary in order to defeat the claims of thoſe go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments to the ſaid premiſes; but was introduced by way of ſupererogation, ſufficient it is in order to vindicate the claim of independence of the State of Vermont, againſt thoſe of Maſſachuſetts Bay and New-Hampſhire; that theſe governments have for a ſeries of years conformed to thoſe ſettlements of 1733
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:016694_0012_0F9D783769B229F0"/>and 1764 in their legiſlative and executive capacities, and acted uniformly agreeable to thoſe limitations, till within a few months laſt paſt. Sundry years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the commencement of the preſent Britiſh war with the colonies, the people of this territory repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly ſolicited both of thoſe governments, at different times, to extend their governmental protection to them, and prevent the ruin with which they were threatned by the oppreſſive iron rod of the government of New-York, but could obtain none. But it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by their late claims, that they have ſince alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their minds, altho' their motives herein (it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed) are far from being honorable—for it is a great fundamental and univerſal principle in all free go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, that government and protection are inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perably connected together; ſo that without protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or at leaſt an attempt to extend it when earneſtly ſolicited as aforeſaid, government naturally and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily ceaſes to be; or in other words, ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal of protection implicitly diſavows any right of juriſdiction, or forfeits any ſuppoſed right either by neglecting ſuch claim, or refuſing ſuch protection: From whence we may infer, that all pretenders to government, which have not ultimately the good of the governed in view, and do not afford, or endeavour to afford protection to thoſe over whom they pretend ſuch claims, ſhould inſtead of the reſpects due to le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlatures, courts and the like, be eſteemed and treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as enemies to ſociety and the rights of mankind. Thus it appears from the great and moſt univerſally received maxim in all free governments, that the citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of Vermont are and ought to be independent of the three governments which lay claim to them; and that every of their ſaid pretenſions are dating uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and inſults on the liberty of an independent,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:016694_0013_0F9D7837A219FB00"/>brave and free people, who have never received any governmental protection or benefit from either of them; but inſtead thereof, have every thing to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend from their venality and uſurpation.</p>
            <p>HAD New-York ſucceeded in their various and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiduous attempts to ſubjugate the people of Vermont, the recent claims of thoſe other governments would never have been mentioned, and the juriſdiction of New-York over this territory would, at this day, have been indiſputable; ſo that Maſſachuſetts-Bay and New-Hampſhire have taken advantage of the controverſy between New-York and Vermont, and even of the bravery of the latter in defending their natural rights and liberties, as the only poſſible ground of laying their frivilous claims. They have furthermore taken the advantage of the bravery of the United States in general, and Vermont likewiſe, in bringing about the preſent revolution, by which means they dare extend their pretended claims, which it is preſumed they would not have had the hardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to do under the Britiſh government, over the head of thoſe royal adjudications of 1739 and 1764 aforeſaid; and it is worthy a remark, that theſe claims have been ſtarted about three years ſince the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Independence of the United States. Still the people of Vermont, legally ſpeaking, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained under the Britiſh government (over which Governor Philip Skeene was commiſſioned chief ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, and next to this government, has the beſt claim to the juriſdiction of Vermont,) from the 4th day of July 1776, to the 15th day of January next following, and then in a ſolemn manner diſavowed the Britiſh government, and rejected the pretenſions of Mr. Skeene, and all other pretenders to the juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:016694_0014_0F9D7838616CAFB8"/>of this territory, and declared themſelves a FREE and INDEPENDENT STATE; and have, as they humbly conceive in their various ſtruggles for liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, fairly merited the enjoyment of it. This they conſider as the ultimate reward of their many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences, labours, toils, battles, victories and hazards, and for the attainment of which they have chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuffered ſuch an uncommon ſeries of concommi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant evils.</p>
            <p>THE following exhibits will ſet the pretenſions of the claim of New-Hampſhire in a true light. Not long after the ſettlement of the juriſdictional line in 1764, between New-York and New-Hampſhire, Governor Benning Wentworth, who then preſided over the latter, iſſued his proclamation, the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal import of which is, <q>That whereas it was the King's pleaſure that this territory ſhould be under the juriſdiction of New-York—That New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire paid a ready obedience; furthermore adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſing ſuch perſons as held either civil or military commiſſions (in this diſtrict) under the authority of New Hampſhire, to ſurceaſe from any further adminiſtration. At the ſame time directing the inhabitants to conform to the government of New-York.</q> We likewiſe find the following ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, in a letter from the governor of New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire to governor Tryon, of the 19th of October 1771, viz. "That he had invariably recommended" to thoſe inhabitants, <q>implicit obedience to the law of the province of New-York, and upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions poſitively diſavowed any connections with thoſe people.</q>

                        <p>HIS Excellency the Governor having laid before the Council for their advice, two letters from his Excellency Governor Tryon, of New-York, dated October 1771, and December 23, 1771, the latter encloſing a proclamation, alſo a copy of his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency's anſwer to the firſt letter. The premiſes being read, it is conſidered, that by his Majeſty's order in Council of the 20th of July, 1764, the weſtern banks of Connecticut River was then commanded to be the weſt bounds of this Province; and that this government has been, and is entirely obedient thereto. Therefore, the ſaid proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on relating wholly to matters and things without the boundaries of this province, it is adviſed that the publication therefore, by the authority of this province, is extra provincial, and therefore in our opinion improper, and that his Excellency is further adviſed not to iſſue any proclamation relating to the premiſes. Secondly, that it is not expedient for the government in any wiſe to interfere with, or concern in runing the lines between his Majeſty's
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:016694_0016_0F9D7839E176ECD0"/>Province of New-York and Canada, which, by His Excellency Governor Tryon's letter of the 23d December 1771, is already begun, by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners appointed for that ſervice, agreeable to his Majeſty's inſtructions, wherein it does not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that this province is referred to or mentioned.</p>

The town of Boſton in the Maſſachuſetts-Bay, or Hartford in Connecticut (if diſpoſed) might as rationally evince their being unconnected with their reſpective States, as thoſe ſixteen towns their not being connected with New Hampſhire.</p>
                  <p>WERE not thoſe towns ſettled and cultivated under the grant of the governor of New Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire? Are they not in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

<pb n="19" facs="unknown:016694_0018_0F9D783B63D67428"/>I am ſure there is not. Did not the moſt of thoſe towns ſend delegates to the Convention of this State in the year 1775? Have they not from the commencement of the preſent war applied to the State of New Hampſhire for aſſiſtance and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection? It is well known they did; and that New-Hampſhire, at their own expence, hath ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied them with arms, ammunition, &amp;c. to a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great amount, as well as paid ſoldiers for their particular defence and at their requeſt, as members of this State: Whence then could this new doctrine that they were unconnected with us originate? I earneſtly deſire that this matter may be ſeriouſly attended to, and I am perſuaded that the tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy thereof will be to anarchy and confuſion.</p>
                  <p>WHEN I conſider the circumſtances of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple weſt of Connecticut river; the difficulties they encountered in their firſt ſettlement; their late endeavour to organize government among themſelves, and the uncertainty of their being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted as a ſeperate ſtate into the confederacy of the United States; I am aſtoniſhed they ſhould ſupply their enemies with arguments againſt them, by their connecting themſelves with people whoſe circumſtances are wholly different from their own, and who are actually members of the State of New-Hampſhire.</p>

                        <p>WHEREAS in conſequence of a repreſentation made to the General Aſſembly of this State, at their ſeſſion held at Windſor in March 1778, by a committee, conſiſting of ſeven perſons, inhabiting ſeveral towns lying contiguous to the eaſt ſide of Connecticut river, that a number of inhabited towns eaſt of ſaid river were then unconnected with any State, in regard to their internal police;
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:016694_0020_0F9D783CE39DC470"/>and on ſaid committees application to the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Aſſembly that the ſaid towns might be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into union with this State, orders were iſſued by the General Aſſembly to the repreſentatives conſtituents, for inſtructions in the premiſes.</p>
                        <p>AND whereas in conſequence of ſuch inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the repreſentatives of ſaid conſtituents (when met at their adjourned ſeſſion at Bennington, on the eleventh day of June laſt,) did receive into union with ſaid State, ſixteen towns eaſt of ſaid Connecticut river, and grant leave for other towns to unite if they ſhould chooſe.</p>
                        <p>AND whereas the General Aſſembly of this State did, at their ſeſſion at <hi>Windſor,</hi> in October laſt, agree on certain methods (contained in the report of the grand committee of both houſes) to ſettle and adjuſt the diſpute with New-Hampſhire.</p>
                        <p>AND whereas your committee have juſt grounds to apprehend that the ſaid ſixteen towns are of right included within the juriſdiction of New-Hampſhire; they are therefore of opinion, that the ſaid union ought to be conſidered as being null from the beginning.</p>

IT is preſumed that from the ſettlement of the boundary line between New-York and New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire in 1764, to the date of Preſident <hi>Weare's</hi> letter of the 22d Auguſt aforeſaid, which is more than four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years, that New-Hampſhire (during this period) had given up, in the moſt explicit and public man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, all pretenſions to the juriſdiction of any and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part of the lands comprehended in this State.—Governor <hi>Benning Wentworth's</hi> proclamation afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, ſets this matter in a clear light, ſoon after the alteration of juriſdiction, directing the ſettlers under New-Hampſhire to conform to the laws of New-York. The letter from the Governor of New-Hampſhire to Governor Tryon, of the 19th of Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tober 1771, ſpeaks the ſame language, viz. <q>That he had invariably recommended implicit obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the laws of New York, and upon all occaſions poſitively diſavowed any connection with thoſe people.</q> The Governor and Council of New-Hampſhire the 8th day of January 17, 2, wholly renounced their claim to the premiſes: <q>It is conſidered that by his Majeſty's order in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of the 20th of July 1764, the weſtern banks of Connecticut river was then commanded to be the weſt bounds of this province; and that this government has been entirely obedient thereto.</q> Preſident Weare's letter to Ira Allen, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> proceeds ſtill further, and poſitively conceeds to the indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of this State. It appears that the Court of the State of New-Hampſhire, by their Preſident, addreſs him in his official character, viz. as <q>Secretary of the State of Vermont;</q> and in the contents of the letter, when writing to the Secretary of this State, not leſs than three times gives it the appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or ſtile of "your State;" and obſerves in the
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:016694_0022_0F9D783ED5FBF5D0"/>finiſhing clauſe of the letter, <q>In behalf of the Council and Aſſembly, I am,</q> &amp;c. From all which it appears, that the ſaid letter has the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the General Court of that State for its ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port; and which, in the moſt expreſs terms, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth the independence of this State, which is of itſelf a final bar to the claim of New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire: For, if governments can relinquiſh their claim of juriſdiction when they pleaſe, and aſſume it again at pleaſure, the whole notion of governmental juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction is reduced to a mere romance, and nothing permanent, obligatory or binding in it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch a precedent is inadmiſſible, as it would, if admitted to become general, deſtroy all order and decorum in the univerſe.</p>
            <p>IT ſhould be acknowledged that the court of New-Hampſhire, through the channel of their Preſident's letter to Governor Chittenden, before inſerted, offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a number of reaſons relative to the impropriety of this State's taking into union ſixteen towns eaſt of Connecticut river; which reaſons are equally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive againſt the claim of New Hampſhire to the weſtward of the ſame river. Says Mr. <hi>Weare,</hi> their Preſident, <q>Is there any aſcertaining the bounda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries between any of the United States of America, but by the lines formerly eſtabliſhed by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Great-Britain? I am ſure there is not.</q> This being admitted, we are equally ſure New-Hampſhire has no right to any territorial juriſdiction to the weſtward of ſaid river. Notwithſtanding it appears that the court of New Hampſhire, in the firſt place, plead the ſettlement of the line in 1764, as the main ground of their title to thoſe ſixteen towns aforeſaid, (weſt of the Maſon line) by which
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:016694_0023_0F9D783F23886F80"/>means they are included in their juriſdiction, and in a few months afterward break over the ſaid line or 1764, and lay claim to the State of Vermont; when at the ſame time nothing can be more apparent than that the ſame arguments by which they eſtabliſh their claim to thoſe ſaid ſixteen towns eaſt of the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, effectually bass their claim to the weſtward of the ſame river, and leaves the conteſted territory to be diſputed between New-York and Vermont. <q>I am ſurpriſed,</q> ſays the Preſident, that "they," ſpeaking of the inhabitants of this State, <q>ſhould ſupply their enemies with arguments againſt them, by their connecting themſelves with people (hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reference to thoſe ſixteen towns) whoſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances are wholly different from their own, and who are actually members of the State of New-Hampſhire.</q> This laſt clauſe affirming that the inhabitants of thoſe ſixteen towns were actually members of the State of New-Hampſhire; at the ſame time implicitly affirms that the inhabitants on the weſt ſide of the ſaid river were not; which is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly explained in the preceeding part of the ſame pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph, viz <q>whoſe circumſtances are wholly dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from their own,</q> that is, the members of the State of Vermont; which is ſtill further explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from another paragraph of the ſame letter, when, after ſtating the facts relative to the aforeſaid union with thoſe ſixteen towns before frequently mentioned, ſays, <q>on which I am directed to repreſent to you, and to deſire it may be laid before the repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of your people.</q> As this was addreſſed to the Governor of Vermont, from the court of New-Hampſhire, to be laid before their repreſentative bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, or General Aſſembly, in which the claim of New-Hampſhire is clearly ſet up, and their right vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:016694_0024_0F9D783FE1588B78"/>to a number of towns, over which Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont on a miſtaken and wrong repreſentation had encroached; upon the repreſentation whereof, the General Court of the State of Vermont diſſolved the union as aforeſaid; and agreeable to the claim and requeſt of the Court of the State of New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, relinquiſhed every connection, as a political body, with thoſe ſixteen towns eaſt of Connecticut river: And thus the reſpective governments of New-Hampſhire and Vermont, having mutually ſettled their boundary line on the weſt banks of Connecticut river, agreeable to the adjudication thereof in 1764, between New-York and New-Hampſhire, cannot fail of operating as a final bar againſt any ſubſequent claim of New Hampſhire to any part of the State of Vermont: For, New Hampſhire madetheir claim, and Vermont very readily cloſed with them, and gave them their whole demand, in which the minds of both governments met, and the diſpute naturally and neceſſarily ended; and it is but chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens play for New-Hampſhire to make a ſecond demand on the State of Vermont; for if one ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not deciſive and binding, neither would a ſecond, or a third, and ſo on <hi>ad infinitum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>PREVIOUS to the claims of Maſſachuſetts Bay and New Hampſhire to Vermont, the ſimplicity of the inhabitants of this government, and their veneration for Congreſs was ſo great, that it is highly probable that they would have very frankly ſubmitted the long controverſy between them and New-York, to the final deciſion of the Congreſs of the United States; though at the ſame time they were far from an opinion that Congreſs had any legal, inherent or conſtitutional right (excluſive of their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:016694_0025_0F9D7840ABE296B0"/>and approbation) ſo to do: But, the recent claims of Maſſachuſetts-Bay and New-Hampſhire, in concert with New-York, and it is ſuſpected in confederacy with each other to divide this State among thoſe three governments, has excited their apprehenſions; for though it may not prove a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple league as is imagined, it is at leaſt a ſtrong com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination of intereſts, which will undoubtedly agree in the ruin of this State, whatever diſputes may happen between themſelves relative to the juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof. And as to the States of Virginia, North-Carolina and South-Carolina, whoſe territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are immenſely large, and whoſe intereſts it is to maintain their reſpective ſovereignty's over their extenſive claims, which may in natural probability influence their delegates in Congreſs to oppoſe the independence of Vermont; as it may in future ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate as a precedent to divide thoſe large territories into different States, (not that it is apprehended by us that there are any ſimilarity in the circumſtances of this tract of country to any other part of Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca;) and thus from views of their own particular intereſts, be very partial and biaſſed judges of the right of Vermont to independence; and inſtead of judging on the principles of juſtice and equity which reſpects Vermont, as oppoſed to the claims of Maſſachuſetts Bay, New Hampſhire and New-York, may rather determine the matter agreeable to their own ambition and intereſt; ſo that were Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont to calmly ſubmit their indubitable claim of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence to Congreſs, though they are as reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectable a body as the world ever produced, it would be by no means certain that Vermont could have an impartial tryal; as there may be many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nections of intereſts very prejudicial to them, which
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:016694_0026_0F9D7841DE77CE00"/>at preſent we cannot conceive of, and which is out of our power to come at the knowledge of, as this State is not repreſented in Congreſs. Theſe things being premiſed, and as the freemen of this State have never had any voice in electing, forming or creating Congreſs, as a political body, or had any repreſentation therein; but have been rather miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſented. And whereas this State hold their charter of liberty from heaven, and not <q>of man, or of the will of man,</q> have upon a full and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did examination and conſideration determined not to ſubmit HEAVEN-BORN FREEDOM to the arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any tribunal below the ſtars, which through infirmity might deprive them of it: But, as they have cloſely embraced it in the moſt critical and hazardous times, are determined to hold it faſt, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be torn from them by the hand of power; which reſolution we truſt will be juſtified by the court of heaven and commended by all true friends to the liberty and happineſs of mankind.</p>
