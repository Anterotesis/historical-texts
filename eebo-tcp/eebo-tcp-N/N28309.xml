            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               </gap>try, it may be highly uſeful to conſider in the</p>
            <p>FIRST PLACE, That in concordance with our text, we are prompted to this duty by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of GOD's children on ſimilar occaſions—as well as by the contemplation of our loſs; whether we conſider it in the light of an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced Commander, noble Patriot, enlightened Politician, or worthy Citizen—</p>
            <p>But previouſly to mentioning the obligations to the duty before us, it may be neceſſary to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, that while we indulge the natural feelings of grief, for the loſs of an eminent Friend and Benefactor, theſe feelings are to be regulated by an holy ſorrow for <hi>sin,</hi> which is the real ground of all our calamities. While our natural paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are under the control and abſorbed by a godly ſorrow for ſin, we may be ſaid to comply with the duty of mourning with thoſe that mourn, and weeping with thoſe that weep—or the religious ſorrow of this day. This kind of mourning is all which can render true honor to the dead—mend our own ſouls—or meet the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine approbation.—The obligations to this duty ſhall now be hinted,</p>
            <p>Firſt—From the examples of GOD's children on ſimilar occaſions—</p>
            <p>When the high Prieſt of GOD's ancient Church, fell a victim to the ſtroke of death up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on mount Hor, all Iſrael grieved and lamented <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> him. It is ſaid, "When all the congregation ſaw that Aaron was dead, <hi>they mourned for him thirty days."</hi> This great and good man, having
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:037734_0006_1011C3EB68552260"/>
repeatedly ſaved the lives of his brethren from immediate death, and being conſtituted the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium though whom their public prayers aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to GOD, became greatly eſteemed and belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—On his removal, the heart of every Iſraelite melted with gratitude, at the remembrance of his ſervices—and the tender ties of nature and friendſhip bled in lengthy ſtreams when they were ſeparated—</p>
            <p>In like manner when the Mighty Law-giver reſigned his breath, on Piſgah's top, it is written, "All the children of Iſrael wept for him thirty days."—By this univerſal expreſſion of grief, they manifeſted that they remembered, that <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses was the man,</hi> who in the face of death, in every terrific form, delivered them from the iron furnace—their bitter ſlavery in Egypt—who led them through the mighty deep on dry land; and gave them to triumph over their haughty foes—who endured, and huſhed their murmurings in the wilderneſs—aſcended the fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming mount, and delivered them the law—Who fed them with angel's food, and gave them water from the rock—Whoſe interceſſions a multitude of times warded off the ſtroke of vengeance from their guilty heads—and whoſe hand had conduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them to the verge of their temporal Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe.—But now, the mighty Moſes is no more! How diſtreſſing the thought, to thoſe who knew his worth, and ſhared his kindneſſes! <hi>They Wept</hi>—Their deep and lengthy ſorrow, proved how much they loved him—how much they reſpected him—how grateful they felt for what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> had done—and how wide was the breach in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval. And all this naturally led them, to their
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:037734_0007_1011C3ECF0247680"/>
own ill deſert of ſuch an eminent bleſſing, and to that godly ſorrow for ſin, which in its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences might excite them to imitate their il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious Benefactor, and hereby honor him for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever—</p>
            <p>To paſs many inſtances; the lamentation inſtituted at the death of Saul and Jonathan is very impreſſive. David, the man after GOD's own heart, compoſed a ſacred elegy to be ſung in their ſolemn humiliations before GOD on this occaſion. They faſted ſeven days, and lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as in our context—"The beauty of Iſrael is ſlain upon the high places: how are the mighty fallen! Tell it not in Gath, publiſh it not in the ſtreets of Aſkelon; left the daughters of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtines rejoice, leſt the daughters of the uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed triumph.—Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there be rain upon you, nor fields of offering: for there the ſhield of the mighty is vilely caſt away, the ſhield of Saul, as though he had not been anointed with oil. From the blood of the ſlain, from the fat of the mighty the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the ſword of Saul returned not emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleaſant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided: they were ſwifter than Eagles, they were ſtronger than lions. Ye daughters of Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el weep over Saul, who clothed you in ſcarlet, with other delights, who put on ornaments of Gold upon your apparel. How are the mighty fallen in the midſt of the battle: O Jonathan, thou waſt ſlain in thy high places. I am diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for thee my brother Jonathan: very pleaſant haſt thou been unto me: thy love to me was

wonderful, paſſing the love of women—How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war periſhed!!"</p>
            <p>In this divine elegy, as well as in the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples already brought, we are taught the ſtrict pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety which there is, in a people's uniting in manifeſting their heartfelt ſorrow, at the fall of their greateſt temporal Benefactors.—Saul and Jonathan, were princes over Iſrael; the former was the Lord's anointed and King in Jeſhurun—Theſe men poſſeſſed commendable qualities in their high ſtations—But now, when all their glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is ſtained by death: and all their enſigns of honor buried in the duſt of humiliation—pity, tenderneſs, gratitude and friendſhip, all ſpring up at once, in the people's breaſts and they mourn over them.—They dwell with the ſofteſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion on every commendable deed or accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment they poſſeſſed.—Ye daughters of Iſrael weep over Saul, who <hi>clothed you in scarlet and other delights, who put ornaments of gold upon your apparel</hi>—How are the mighty fallen! Their valour and heroiſm are mentioned—<hi>From the blood of the slain, the bow of Jonathan retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not back: and the sword of Saul returned not empty.</hi> Likewiſe their agility of body—<hi>They were swifter than Eagles; they were stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than Lions.</hi> Their pleaſant ſociety as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions—<hi>They were lovely and pleasant in their lives.</hi> But when they ſpeak of their deaths, the ſcene is too tender for expreſſion—the very ground is forbid to receive its natural refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the ſpot where they fell, condemned to perpetual barrenneſs—<hi>Ye mountains of Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boa Let there be no dew, neither rain upon you,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:037734_0009_1011C3F6DE5E98E0"/>
nor fields of offerings: for there the shields of the mighty were vilely cast away</hi>—That is, Let the very ground mourn to all generations; for there the ſtrength and glory of man periſhed. Finally, The calamity was too affecting to be touched by the profane bands of the wicked, or told where enemies might rejoice and triumph. <hi>Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Askelon, lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.</hi>—Theſe expreſſions of ſorrow, very forcibly evince how tenderly affected the people of GOD have been, at the deceaſe of their temporal ſovereigns, who have in any degree merited their affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions—</p>
            <p>But one inſtance more ſhall be mentioned—It is recorded, that when the great and good Prince Joſiah fell, "he was buried in one of the ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chres of his Fathers, and all Judah and Jeruſalem mourned for Joſiah. And Jeremiah lamented for Joſiah: and all the ſinging men and ſinging women ſpake of Joſiah in their lamentations to this day—and made them an ordinance in Iſrael and behold they are written in the lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions." This mourning was ſo exceedingly deep and affecting, that ever afterward it was prover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bial. It is obſerved by the Prophet Zechariah, ſpeaking of a time of affliction; "That in that day, there ſhall be in Jeruſalem a great mourning as the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iddon"—This was the time and place were Joſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah was ſlain.—All the millions of Judah wept with a ſore lamentation—Jeremiah compoſed an elegy upon his death: and all the ſinging men, and ſinging women ſpake of Joſiah, and told of

In addition to this it may be remarked, that the people of GOD inſtituted a regiſter, in which were recorded the elegies and lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which were made upon the deaths of good men. Theſe ſeveral inſtances, ſelected from a multitude, unite in placing before us the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of GOD's children, and demonſtrate the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and perfect propriety there is, in a people's unitedly expreſſing the grief they feel upon the deceaſe of their greateſt temporal benefactors and princes—That hereby they may expreſs their affection by pouring their tears upon their graves—call up into lively remembrance their virtues for imitation—attend to the voice of GOD in their removal—and prepare to follow them—</p>
            <p>But my Friends, We did not need the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of primitive ſaints to prompt us to a reluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant duty: but only to give us liberty to vent the ſorrows we feel when the <hi>Death of a Wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington swells our breasts.</hi> But pauſe a moment!

mourning; can there any thing be more natural than to contemplate a few particulars in Juſtice to the memory of him whom we lament, and</p>
            <p>Firſt—We cannot but remember the time when the chains of ſlavery were forged and ſhook over us by the cruel and haughty hand of our Mother country—at this moment every heart meditated terror. But the Lord of Hoſts inſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us as a people to riſe up boldly and repel the bondage—By one mighty effort of manly reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we were born anew, and Declared our IN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DEPENDENCE. Now commenced the bloody<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> conteſt for every thing we held dear—The ſame Almighty Being, by whoſe guidance we were hitherto conducted, beheld us with compaſſion, and ſaw what we needed; a PILOT, a LEAD<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ER in the perilious enterprize we had undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en—He called for his Waſhington already pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared; anointed him as his ſervant with regal dignity, and put into his hands, the control of all our defenſive operations. But here admiration ſuppreſſes utterance—Your own minds muſt fill out the active character of the man—A deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the warlike ſkill—the profound wiſdom—the prudence—the heroiſm—and integrity which he diſplayed, in character of Commander in Chief, would ſuffer materially in hands like mine. But this I may ſay, the eyes of all our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican Iſrael were placed upon him, as their Saviour, under the direction of Heaven—and they were not diſappointed—He endured the mighty conflict for a long ſeries of years—He faced death in ten thouſand forms—the Lord preſerved him—He perſevered—He conquered—He made us FREE—This was the mighty Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:037734_0012_1011C403579A9E28"/>
—raiſed by the God of Armies to be the <hi>Father and Protector of his Country—a Defence of rational Liberty—and a Friend of Man.</hi> At the riſk of his own blood, he purchaſed all we hold dear, "with his <hi>Sword</hi> and with his <hi>Bow"</hi>—But where is he now! Pale death has diſrobed him of all his outward beauty—his armor, and manly accompliſhments, and laid him in the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent duſt!! Saith the Scriptures "I have ſaid ye are Gods but ye ſhall die like men, and fall as one of the Princes"—O how are the mighty fallen and the weapons of war periſhed!—Ye <hi>Daughters</hi> of America weep over Waſhington, who clothed you with <hi>Freedom</hi> and other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights—who put ornaments of gold upon your apparel—</p>
            <p>But again, The tender and afflicted mind roves back, to view its object in brighter ſcenes—When the man who had earned the love and eſteem of every American <hi>and the world,</hi> return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the great theatre of action; clothed with the laurels of victory and triumph; the next thing which ſtrikes our admiration is, <hi>His Great Soul conquered Himself!</hi>—In ſtead of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving his ſucceſſes to exalt and aggrandize his own perſon and name like other conquerors, he appeared before the grand Council of the nation—acknowledged all his ſucceſſes and glory, to be aſcribed to GOD; put up his earneſt prayer for his deareſt country and all to whom its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts were intruſted—reſigned his commiſſion and took his leave of all public life. This act ſo far demonſtrated the diſintereſtedneſs of his views, in the immenſe ſervices he had rendered his country, that it could hardly be thought to be the conduct of a mortal man. The affections
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:037734_0013_1011C40A6E0B5698"/>
of the people glowed on him more than ever, and the world ſtood aſtoniſhed!—</p>
            <p>But the Lord of Hoſts had ſervices for him ſtill. While our political body was in its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, and its limbs unnerved by any civil com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact, and almoſt ſevered by her late conflict; a council is called to form a band of political Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion and Government—Into this auguſt <hi>Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> Waſhington is invited, and preſides—A Conſtitution is formed—It is accepted by the States—A ſeat in the government preſiding over the whole, is to be filled. Now United Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, have an opportunity of teſtifying their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in the man they love—They erred not, Waſhington again by the voice of GOD in the univerſal voice of the people is called from his retirement<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and being placed, as the <hi>"Head of Gold"</hi> over theſe States, launched into operation, our happy political ſyſtem. But here, be it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated—Your imagination muſt ſupply the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiences I feel in giving the portrait of that Conſtellation of political virtues which irradiat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his eminent ſtation—which warmed and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened every heart of his brethren, and darted their beams to diſtant climes. Sufficient is it to ſay, <hi>No man uninspired</hi> could do better. His deep penetration—undeviating prudence and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible integrity cemented our general intereſt, and rebuked oppoſition. A teſtimony of the complete ſatisfaction which the people felt in his adminiſtration, appeared in a ſecond election to the ſame important office. Thus ſeeming to take us by the hand and ſet us out in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our dear bought privileges, confident of our ſafety, he reſigned the helm of government
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:037734_0014_1011C411E0760B18"/>
and retired a ſecond time to his own happy man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. This was the mighty Waſhington who was lovely and pleaſant in his life, and in his death triumphant!! In his delightful retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he anticipated the evening of life, enjoying the calmneſs and ſerenity of a bright ſetting ſun after a tempeſtuous day—But alas how ſhort is human felicity. No ſooner had he left his high ſtation, than theſe States are coveted, as a boon by a perfidious ally—Secret intrigues, breach of faith, contempt and ſpoliations are practiſed upon us—We addreſs Heaven, and ſeek an adjuſtment of difficulties—All efforts of this kind fail—To whom then muſt we look for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, but to a righteous GOD, and the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced ſword of our <hi>victorious Chief?</hi>—Once more, impelled by the aggreſſions of our foes, by the love of his country, by the deſire of his brethren, and the call of GOD; he accepts the Commiſſion of Commander in Chief of the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican forces. This laſt token of his love crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the reſt—Willing now to confirm all he had done before—willing to leave his earthly Paradiſe with all its ſweets—put to riſk his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſullied character, and ſpill his laſt drop of blood, if called, to ſerve his GOD and his dear coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try!!—This is the man whom we lament this day—Encircled with a cloud of human glory; peaceful and calm he meets the ſummons of his GOD, and ſleeps in duſt.—O Waſhington, let thy name be written with gold, and laid in the adamant for ever—Let unborn millions read, and pay their tribute to thy virtue—O may the children of America, to the lateſt ages, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> thy name and call thee their Friend.—O Columbia, let thy preſent Sons and Daughters individually
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:037734_0015_1011C41718CD4DE0"/>
weep over thy Friend and ſay—We are diſtreſſed for thee O my brother, thy love to us was won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful!!!</p>
            <p>But hark again—Imagination ſeems to hear the departing ſpirit of the Hero ſay—"Adieu Ye kindred <hi>Souls,</hi> who have ſhared with me the toils of war, and its trophies—Adieu Ye miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Juſtice, whoſe counſels have adorned your ſtations, and bleſt your country—Adieu My Dear Brethren, the People of America—Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well!!"</p>
            <p>Let all rejoin, We thank thee, for all thy love and toil, Adieu My Brother!!—</p>
            <p>Excited by motives like theſe, we cannot be wanting in the duty of this day to humble our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves before GOD—teſtify our high regard for our deceaſed Friend, and leave our tears on his grave—</p>
            <p>Now he is gone, it remains that we make a ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table improvement of his exit—and</p>
            <p>Firſt—Looking round us we find a breach, a wide chaſm in creation; eſpecially in our own land which no man can fill. In this we learn the loſs, we have ſuſtained. Tell it not our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, nor publiſh it in the ſtreets of Infidels, leſt the daughters of the uncircumciſed triumph. America never ſuſtained ſo great a loſs in a man. In this likewiſe we may ſee the diſpleaſure of Heaven—One of our "ſtrongeſt rods" is broken—our defence is ſo far weakened: Hence in the ſame proportion we are expoſed to calamities from abroad. The very name of our late Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:037734_0016_1011C41AA7B3A688"/>
was of more uſe than an army of no ſmall magnitude—</p>
            <p>While we mourn the loſs of ſo great a Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor, it becomes us to look inwardly, and view the ſins of our own hearts and land; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs them before GOD with deep penitence and humiliation. This will prove that we eye the hand of GOD in this afflictive ſtroke—are diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to glorify him in it, and cleave to him ſtill—</p>
            <p>Secondly—Being ſo ſenſibly ſtruck with the loſs of our Political Parent, let it excite us to put our truſt in GOD more than ever. It would be infinitely criminal to loſe ſight of the <hi>Source</hi> of all our comforts, and expectations—It was the <hi>Lord of Hosts,</hi> who raiſed up our late Protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor—gave him all his accompliſhments and made him ſucceſsful in all the enterpriſes he performed—The ſame Being who raiſed up Moſes, Joſhua, David, Cyrus and others. While we do honor to the man, and commend him for his public and private virtues, we are ſtill to remember he was only GOD's inſtrument to do his work—The GOD of Iſrael girded him, ſupported him, and carried him through his momentous labors—We are obligated to bleſs and praiſe GOD infinitely more, than his inſtrument. But as GOD has raiſed up one Benefactor; Yea many; he can raiſe up others juſt when he pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es—He can fill them with any degree of talents which his wiſdom dictates, and make them even ſurpaſs their predeceſſors. To this ſource we are to look and pray, with the greateſt ſincerity for the beſtowment of all temporal and ſpiritual
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:037734_0017_1011C41C2BF15038"/>
bleſſings. Truſting in GOD, we have nothing to fear—</p>
            <p>Thirdly—If we would really honor the mighty ſubject of our lamentations we muſt go farther than outward ceremony. We muſt imitate him, in all things wherein he complied with the word of GOD—Could we now hear him addreſſing us from the world of ſpirits, what would he ſay? <hi>"Obey GOD"</hi> would be his language—"Love and ſerve him with all thy heart, and ſoul and ſtrength and mind"—We are fond of thinking the gates of Heaven were ſet open, to receive his departing ſpirit: <hi>Be it so;</hi> In this caſe his exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to his Friends here below, would be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely <hi>the language of angels, or the word of GOD.</hi> Were he to ſpeak with an audible voice and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort in the language of Paradiſe he would ſay, "Repent and believe in Chriſt: there is none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther name given under Heaven whereby ye can be ſaved—Fly to the Lord Jeſus, the captain of your ſalvation and take hold on eternal life. If you ever mean to be my company, you muſt <hi>become holy,</hi> for without holineſs no man can ſee GOD—Break off your iniquities—fly from the wrath which is coming—make your calling and election ſure—Serve GOD and your generation with your whole heart—And if you would honor me and mourn my abſence, <hi>so live</hi> as to come and dwell where I am"—Now, if we would honor Him, in his death, who was ſo dear to us in life, let us hear his addreſs from the Heavenly manſion, where we hope his ſpirit lives—Let us practice it; and this will prove we reſpect him, and hold him in everlaſting remembrance—This will be joining in the religious ſorrow of this day, and gain ſpiritual advantage to our ſouls.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:037734_0018_1011C420D7545210"/>
Fourthly—The event we contemplate teaches us, that Death, is our certain lot—If a Waſhing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington is dead—if the King of terrors would not be bribed when ſuch a victim ſtood before him, then we muſt die—O Let the light and trifling, the buſy and the gay, think of <hi>this,</hi> and feel that they are dead men—The devout know it already. But ſince this is our certain end, can there be a wiſer courſe than to prepare for it? Do we wiſh for Heaven? Do we wiſh, when we cloſe our eyes on earth, to be gathered with angels and ſaints, and all the honorable and mighty who have died in faith—if ſo, to devote our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the ſervice of GOD will carry us thith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er? But any other courſe will land us without end, with hypocrites and unbelievers.—Shall we laviſh our praiſes on the righteous—mourn their deaths—accompany them with our wiſhes to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven's gate, and yet by our daily practice prove we have no ſerious meaning in all this? Shall we look upon death juſt as certain, as our exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, yet make no preparation to meet it! O Let it not be—but let it be our ſole buſineſs to acquire a temper of mind ſuited to the Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly world, and to follow the footſteps of thoſe who through faith and patience inherit the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes—Then, when the moment of diſſolution arrives, the tranſition will be glorious, and the ſociety we ſhall enter will be pure and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome beyond all our preſent conceptions.—</p>
            <p>Finally—This day, My Friends, finds a ſable cloud ſpread over our whole country, and ſuch gloomy veſtments as never ſhadowed it before—and all this for the fall of one man, a fellow mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal!—But how ſtrikingly ought this to remind us
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:037734_0019_1011C424813EB9C0"/>
of that awful period; and what ſolemn enſigns of diſtreſs nature herſelf put on, when the SAV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>IOUR of men expired!—So great the Perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, ſo important his fall, <hi>the sun himself hid his face—the Temple rent—and nature groaned with convulsions!—Darkness shrouded the world and hung it in mourning!!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This event called the attention of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, and was important beyond all imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.—By it an atonement was made for ſinners, by which through repentance and faith, they might be delivered from eternal miſery, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to eternal felicity in Heaven—And now, ſhall we make ſuch great "lamentation, mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and woe" when a mortal like ourſelves dies; and yet neglect to notice and celebrate the Death of Him, who conquered death, and purchaſed eternal life for his Friends!—Human nature, <hi>blush!</hi>—Angels, <hi>stand aghast!!

            <p>Are we Friends to the great Waſhington? And are we no Friends to Chriſt!—Where is the proof of friendſhip to the latter? Do we in general celebrate his death? No—Do we expect eternal life from him—the purchaſe of his blood—Yet forbear to commemorate his death—remain <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved</hi> at his command <hi>do this in remembrance of me</hi>
               <note n="§" place="bottom">The Sacrament was to be attended at the cloſe of public ſervice—</note>—O my Friends, Think how the Saviour views the indignity caſt upon him, when he ſees the <hi>Dust of his feet</hi> preferred before him!—O may this thought beget conviction in every breaſt where the cenſure falls—Now is the only time

to correct the infinite error, and to honor Chriſt—His long ſuffering waits upon you: but it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not always wait—Seize the moment leſt it be too late, and your miſery be ſealed—Remember Chriſt ſuffered not to put on ornaments of Gold upon your apparel: but the ornament of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon you: And if you are truly diſpoſed to wear the garments he has prepared, and obey him; You will ſoon exchange theſe gloomy em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems of ſin and death, for robes of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and crowns of eternal life.—You will now find comfort ſpringing up in the midſt of tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſorrows—While you are called to mourn the loſs of the moſt excellent of the earth, you will have a glorious proſpect of ſoon paſſing through this ſcene of trial, and joining them in manſions of eternal Joy and Triumph—Then will you ſing the ſong of Moſes and the Lamb—You will join the throng of Angels, and with Prophets—Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles—and all the redeemed will ſay—<hi>Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood, and hath made us Kings and Priests unto GOD and his Father, To him be glory and dominion forever—</hi>
