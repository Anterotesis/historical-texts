            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>JOSHUA xxiv. 15.</bibl>
               <q>
                  <hi>As for Me and my Houſe, we will ſerve the Lord.</hi>

            <p>THESE Words contain the Holy Reſolution of pious <hi>Joſhua,</hi> who having in a moſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, affectionate Diſcourſe recounted to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> what great Things GOD had done for them, in the Verſe immediately foregoing the Text, comes to draw a proper Inference from what He had been delivering; and acquaints them, in the moſt preſſing Terms, that ſince GOD had been ſo exceeding Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious unto them, they could do no leſs than, out of Gratitude for ſuch uncommon Favours and Mercies dedicate both themſelves and Families to his Service. <hi>Now therefore,</hi> ſays he, Verſe 14. <hi>Fear the Lord, and ſerve him in Sincerity and Truth, and put away the Gods which your Fathers ſerved on the other Side of the Flood.</hi> And by the ſame engaging Motives does the Prophet <hi>Samuel</hi> afterwards enforce their Obedience to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:004450_0004_100D9DF95D18DA40"/>
of GOD, I <hi>Sam.</hi> xii. 24. <hi>Only fear the LORD, and ſerve him in Truth, with all your Heart: For conſider</hi> (ſays he) <hi>how great Things. He hath done for you.</hi> But then, that they might not excuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves (as too many might be apt to do) by his giving them a bad Example, or think he was laying heavy Burdens upon them, whilſt he himſelf touched them not with one of his Fingers, he tells them in the Verſe out of which the Text is taken, that whatever Regard they might pay to the Doctrine he had been Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, yet He (as all Miniſters ought to do) was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to live up to and Practice it himſelf; <hi>Chuſe you</hi> therefore, ſays he, <hi>whom you will ſerve, whether the Gods which your Fathers ſerved, or the Gods of the Amorites in whoſe Land ye dwell: But as for me and my Houſe, we will ſerve the LORD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Reſolution this worthy of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> and no leſs becoming, no leſs neceſſary for every true Son of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> that is intruſted with the Care and Government of a Family in our Day: And, if it was ever ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for Miniſters to preach up, or People to put in Practice Family Religion, it was never more ſo than in the preſent Age; ſince it is greatly to be feared, that out of thoſe many Houſholds that call themſelves <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> there are but few that ſerve GOD in their reſpective Families as they ought.</p>
            <p>IT is true indeed, viſit our Churches, and you may perhaps ſee ſomething of the <hi>Form of Godlineſs</hi> ſtill ſubſiſting among us; but even <hi>that</hi> is ſcarcely to be met with in private Houſes. So that were the Bleſſed Angels to come, as in the Patriarchal Age, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve our Spiritual OEconomy at Home, would they not be tempted to ſay, as <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaid to <hi>Abime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lech,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:004450_0005_100D9DFAEF05E338"/>
Surely the Fear of GOD is not in this Place?</hi> Gen. XX. II.</p>
            <p>How ſuch a general Neglect of <hi>Family Religion</hi> firſt began to over-ſpread the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> World, is difficult to determine. As for the Primitive <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> I am poſitive it was not ſo with them: No, they had not ſo learned CHRIST, as falſely to imagine Religion was to be confined ſolely to their Aſſemblies for Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Worſhip; but on the contrary behaved with ſuch Piety and exemplary Holineſs in their private Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> often ſtyles their Houſe a Church: <hi>Salute ſuch a one,</hi> ſays he, <hi>and the Church which is in his Houſe.</hi> And, I believe, we muſt for ever deſpair of ſeeing a Primitive Spirit of Piety, revived in the World, till we are ſo happy as to ſee a Revival of Primitive Family Religion; and Perſons unanimouſly reſolving with Good Old <hi>Joſhua,</hi> in the Words of the Text.—<hi>As for Me and my Houſe, we will ſerve the LORD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>FROM which Words I ſhall beg Leave to inſiſt on theſe three Things:
<list>
                  <item>I. <hi>Firſt,</hi> That it is the Duty of every Governour of a Family to take care, that not only He himſelf, but alſo that thoſe committed to his Charge <hi>ſerve the LORD.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>II. <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ſhall endeavour to ſhew after what Manner a Governour and his Houſhold ought to <hi>ſerve the LORD.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>III. <hi>Thirdly</hi> and laſtly, I ſhall offer ſome Motives in order to excite all Governours, with their reſpective
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:004450_0006_100D9DFCD598EA58"/>
Houſholds, to <hi>ſerve the LORD</hi> in the Manner that ſhall be recommended.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>I. AND <hi>Firſt,</hi> I am to ſhew that it is the Duty of every Governour of a Family to take care, that not only He himſelf, but alſo that thoſe committed to his Charge ſhould <hi>ſerve the LORD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND this will appear, if we conſider that every Governour of a Family ought to look upon himſelf as obliged to act in three Capacities; as a Prophet, to inſtruct; as a Prieſt to pray for and with; as a King to govern, direct, and provide for them. It is true indeed the latter of theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> their Kingly Office, they are not ſo frequently deficient in, (nay in this they are generally too ſollicitous;) but as for the two former, <hi>viz.</hi> their Prieſtly and Prophetick Offices, like <hi>Gallio,</hi> they care for no ſuch Things. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever indifferent ſome Governours may be about it, yet they may be aſſured, that GOD will require a due Diſcharge of theſe Offices at their Hands. For if, as the Apoſtle argues, <hi>He that does not provide for his own Houſe,</hi> in temporal Things, <hi>has denied the Faith, and is worſe than an Infidel;</hi> to what greater Degree of Apoſtacy muſt he have arrived, who takes no Thought to provide for the Spiritual Welfare of his Family!</p>
            <p>BUT farther, Perſons are generally very liberal of their Invectives againſt the Clergy, and think they juſtly blame the Conduct of that Miniſter who does not take heed to and watch over the Flock, of which the Holy Ghoſt has made him Overſeer: But may not every Governour of a Family be in a lower Degree liable to the ſame Cenſure, who takes no thought for
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:004450_0007_100D9DFF67F343B0"/>
thoſe Souls that are committed to his Charge? For e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Houſe is, as it were a little Pariſh, every Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour (as was before obſerved) a Prieſt, every Family a Flock; and if any of them periſh through the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour's Neglect, their Blood will GOD require at their Hands.</p>
            <p>WAS a Miniſter to diſregard Teaching his People publickly and from Houſe to Houſe, and to excuſe himſelf by ſaying, that He had enough to do to work out his own Salvation with Fear and Trembling, without concerning himſelf with that of Others: Would not any one be apt to think ſuch a Miniſter to be like the unjuſt Judge, <hi>One that neither feared GOD or regarded Man?</hi> And yet, odious as ſuch a Character would be, it is no worſe than that Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of a Family deſerves, who thinks himſelf obliged only to ſave his own Soul, without paying any regard to the Souls of his Houſhold. For (as was above hinted) every Houſe is, as it were, a Pariſh, and every Maſter is concern'd to ſecure, as much as in him lies, the Spiritual Proſperity of every one under his Roof, as any Miniſter whatever is obliged to look to the Spiritual Welfare of every individual Perſon under his Charge.</p>
            <p>WHAT Precedents Men, who neglect their Duty in this Particular, can plead for ſuch Omiſſion, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell: Doubtleſs not the Example of Holy <hi>Job,</hi> who was ſo far from imagining that He had no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, as Governour of a Family, with any one's Soul but his Own, that the Scripture acquaints us, <hi>When the Days of his Children's Feaſting were gone about, that Job ſent and ſanctified them, and offered Burnt Offerings according to the Number of them all; For Job ſaid, It
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:004450_0008_100D9E027A8F2278"/>
may be that my Sons have ſinned and curſed GOD in their Hearts: Thus did Job continually.</hi> Nor can they plead the Practice of Good Old <hi>Joſhua,</hi> whom in the Text we find as much concerned for his Houſhold's Welfare as his own. Nor laſtly, that of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> who <hi>feared GOD,</hi> not only himſelf, but with <hi>all his Houſe:</hi> And were <hi>Chriſtians</hi> but of the ſame Spirit of <hi>Job, Joſhua,</hi> and the <hi>Gentile</hi> Centurion, they would act as <hi>Job, Joſhua,</hi> and <hi>Cornelius</hi> did.</p>
            <p>BUT, alas! if this be the Caſe, and all Governours of Families ought not only to ſerve the LORD themſelves, but likewiſe to ſee that their reſpective Houſholds do ſo too: What will then become of thoſe who not only neglect ſerving GOD themſelves, but alſo make it their Buſineſs to ridicule and ſcoff at any of their Houſe that do? Who are not content with <hi>not entering into the Kingdom of Heaven themſelves; but thoſe alſo that are willing to enter in they hinder.</hi> Surely ſuch Men are Factors for the Devil indeed. Surely their Damnation ſlumbereth not: For although GOD, in his Good Providence, may ſuffer ſuch Stumbling-blocks to be put in his Children's Ways, and ſuffer their greateſt Enemies to be thoſe of their own Houſholds, for a Trial of their Sincerity, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of their Faith; yet we cannot but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce a <hi>Wo</hi> againſt thoſe Maſters <hi>by whom ſuch Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces come.</hi> For if thoſe that only take care of their own Souls can ſcarcely be ſaved, where will ſuch mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrouſly profane and wicked Governours appear?</p>
            <p>BUT hoping there is but few of this unhappy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>

II. <hi>Second</hi> Thing propoſed, <hi>viz.</hi> To ſhew after what Manner a Governour and his Houſhold ought to <hi>ſerve the LORD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. AND the Firſt Thing I ſhall mention is Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Word of GOD. This is a Duty incumbent on every private Perſon. <hi>Search the Scriptures, for in them ye think ye have Eternal Life,</hi> is a Precept given by our bleſſed LORD indifferently to all: But much more ſo ought every Governour of a Family to think it in a peculiar Manner ſpoken to himſelf, becauſe (as hath been already proved) he ought t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> his Charge in the Knowledge of the Word of GOD.</p>
            <p>THIS we find was the Order GOD gave his pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar People of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> For thus ſpeaks his Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative <hi>Moſes, Deuteronomy</hi> vi. 6, 7. <hi>Theſe Words,</hi> that is the Scripture Words, <hi>which I command thee this Day, ſhall be in thy Heart, and thou ſhalt teach them diligently unto thy Children,</hi> that is, as it is generally explained, <hi>Servants,</hi> as well as Children, <hi>and ſhalt talk of them when thou ſitteſt in thy Houſe.</hi> From whence we may infer, that the only Reaſon why ſo many neglect to read the Words of Scripture diligently to their Children is, becauſe the Words of Scripture are not in their Hearts; for if they were, out of the Abundance of the Heart their Mouths would ſpeak.</p>
            <p>BESIDES, Servants as well as Children are, for the generality, very ignorant, and mere Novices in the Laws of GOD: And how ſhall they know, unleſs ſome one teach them? And what more proper to teach them by, than the lively Oracles of GOD,<hi>
                  <pb n="12" facs="unknown:004450_0010_100D9E0734CD1ED0"/>
which are able to make them wiſe unto Salvation?</hi> And who more proper to inſtruct them by theſe Lively Oracles, than Parents and Maſters, who (as hath been more than once before obſerved) are as much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to feed them with Spiritural as with Bodily Bread, Day by Day.</p>
            <p>BUT if theſe Things be ſo, What a miſerable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition are thoſe unhappy Governours in, who are ſo far from feeding thoſe committed to their Care with the ſincere Milk of the Word, to the intent they may grow thereby, that they neither ſearch the Scriptures themſelves, nor are careful to explain them to Others? Such Bamilies muſt be in a happy Way indeed to do their Maſter's Will, who take ſuch prodigious Pains to know it! Would not one imagine that they had turned Converts to the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> that they thought <hi>Ignorance</hi> the Mother of <hi>Devotion;</hi> that thoſe were to be condemned as Hereticks, who read their BIBLES? And yet how few Families are there amongſt us, who do not act after this unſeemly Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner! But, <hi>ſhall I praiſe them in this? I praiſe them not: Brethren, this Thing ought not ſo to be.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. PASS we on now to the Second Means whereby every Governour and his Houſhold ought to ſerve the LORD, <hi>viz. Family Prayer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS is a Duty though as much neglected, yet as abſolutely neceſſary as the former. <hi>Reading</hi> is a good Preparative for <hi>Prayer,</hi> as <hi>Prayer</hi> is an excellent Means to render <hi>Reading</hi> effectual. And the Reaſon why every Governour of a Family ſhould join both theſe Exerciſes together is plain, becauſe a Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of a Family cannot perform his <hi>Prieſtly</hi> Office
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:004450_0011_100D9E08DD303AA0"/>
(which we before obſerved he is in ſome Degree in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with) without performing this Duty of <hi>Family Prayer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WE find it therefore remarked, when mention is made of <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel'</hi>s offering Sacrifices, that they <hi>brought</hi> them. But to whom did they bring them? Why, in all probability to their Father <hi>Adam,</hi> who, as Prieſt of the Family, was to offer Sacrifice in their Names. And ſo likewiſe ought every ſpiritual Son of the Second <hi>Adam,</hi> who is intruſted with the Care of an Houſhold, to offer up the Spiritual Sacrifices of Supplications and Thankſgivings acceptable to GOD through JESUS CHRIST, in the Preſence and Name of all who wait upon or eat Meat at his Table.</p>
            <p>THUS we read our Bleſſed Lord behaved, when he tabernacled amongſt us: For it is ſaid often, that <hi>He was alone</hi> praying with his Twelve Diſciples, which was then his little Family. And He himſelf has promiſed a particular Bleſſing to joint Supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: <hi>For whereſoever,</hi> ſays he, <hi>two or three are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together in my Name, there am I in the midſt of them.</hi> And again, <hi>If two or three are agreed touching any Thing they ſhall aſk, it ſhall be given them.</hi> Add to this, that we are commanded by the Apoſtle to <hi>pray always, with all Manner of Supplication,</hi> which doubtleſs includes <hi>Family Prayer.</hi> And Holy <hi>Joſhua,</hi> when he ſet up the Good Reſolution in the Text, that He and his Houſhold would <hi>ſerve the LORD,</hi> certainly reſolved withal to pray with his Family, which is one of the beſt Teſtimonies they could give of their ſerving Him.</p>
            <p>BESIDES, there are no Families, but what have ſome common Bleſſings, of which they have been all
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:004450_0012_100D9E0BEEB1C7F8"/>
Partakers, to give Thanks for; ſome common Croſſes and Afflictions, which they are to pray againſt; ſome common Sins which they are all bound to lament and bewail: But how this can be done without joining together in one common Act of Humiliation, Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and Thankſgiving, is difficult to deviſe.</p>
            <p>FROM all which Conſiderations put together, it is evident, that <hi>Family Prayer</hi> is a great and neceſſary Duty; and conſequently thoſe Governours that neglect it are certainly without Excuſe. And it is much to be feared, if they live without <hi>Family Prayer,</hi> they live <hi>without GOD in the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND yet ſuch an hateful Character as this is, it is to be feared, that, was GOD to ſend out an Angel to deſtroy us as he did once deſtroy the <hi>Egyptians</hi> Firſt-born, and withal give him a Commiſſion, <hi>as then,</hi> to ſpare no Houſes but where they ſaw the Blood of the Lintel ſprinkled on the Door-poſt, ſo <hi>now</hi> to let no Families eſcape but thoſe that called upon him in Morning and Evening Prayer; few would remain unhurt by his avenging Sword. <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> ſhall I term ſuch Families, or <hi>Heathens?</hi> Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they deſerve not the Name of <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> and <hi>Heathens</hi> will ſurely riſe up in Judgment againſt ſuch profane Families of this Generation: For they had always their Houſhold GODS whom they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped, and whoſe Aſſiſtance they frequently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked. And a pretty paſs thoſe Families ſurely are arrived at, who muſt be ſent to School to <hi>Pagans.</hi> But will not the LORD be avenged on ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane Houſholds as theſe? Will he not pour out his Fury upon thoſe that call not upon his Name?</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:004450_0013_100D9E0E5D563160"/>
3. BUT it is Time for me to haſten to the Third and laſt Means I ſhall recommend, whereby every Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour ought with his Houſhold to <hi>ſerve the LORD, viz.</hi> by <hi>Catechizing</hi> and <hi>Inſtructing</hi> their Children and Servants, and bringing them up in the Nurture and Admonition of the LORD.</p>
            <p>THAT this, as well as the two former, is a Duty incumbent on every Governour of an Houſe, appears from that famous Encomium or Commendation GOD gives of <hi>Abraham. I know,</hi> ſays the Moſt High, <hi>that He will command his Children and his Houſhold after him to keep the Way of the LORD, to do Juſtice and Judgment.</hi> And indeed ſcarce any Thing is more frequently preſſed upon us in Holy Writ than this Duty of <hi>Catechizing.</hi> Thus ſays GOD in a Paſſage before cited, <hi>Thou ſhalt teach theſe Words diligently unto thy Children.</hi> And Parents are commanded in the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> to <hi>breed up their Children in the Nurture and Admonition of the LORD.</hi> The Holy Pſalmiſt acquaints us, that one great End why GOD did ſo great Wonders for his People was, <hi>to the Intent that when they grew up they ſhould ſhew their Children or Servants, the ſame.</hi> And in <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> Chap. vi. at the 20th and following Verſes, GOD ſtrictly commands his People to inſtruct their Children in the true Nature of the Ceremonial Worſhip, when they ſhould enquire about it, as he ſuppoſed they would do in Time to come. And if Servants and Children were to be inſtructed in the Nature of <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Rites, much more ought they <hi>now</hi> to be initiated and ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Doctrines and firſt Principles of the Goſpel of CHRIST: Not only becauſe it is a Revelation, which has brought Life and Immortality to a fuller
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:004450_0014_100D9E0FF19A16F0"/>
and clearer Light, but alſo becauſe many Seducers are gone abroad into the World, who do their utmoſt Endeavour to deſtroy not only the Superſtructure, but likewiſe to ſap the very Foundation of our moſt Holy Religion.</p>
            <p>WOULD, then, the preſent Generation have their Poſterity be true Lovers and Honourers of GOD, Maſters and Parents muſt take <hi>Solomon'</hi>s good Advice, and train up and catechize their reſpective Houſholds in the Way wherein they ſhould go.</p>
            <p>I AM aware but of one Objection that can, with any Shew of Reaſon, be urged againſt what has been advanced; which is, That ſuch a Procedure as this will take up too much Time, and hinder Families too long from their Worldly Buſineſs. But it is much to be queſtioned whether Perſons that ſtart ſuch an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection are not of the ſame hypocritical Spirit as the Traytor <hi>Judas,</hi> who had Indignation againſt Devout <hi>Mary,</hi> who being ſo profuſe of her Ointment, in anointing our Bleſſed Lord, and aſked Why it might not be ſold for Two Hundred Pence, and given to the Poor. For has GOD given us ſo much Time to work for Ourſelves, and ſhall we not allow ſome ſmall Pittance of it, Morning and Evening, to be devoted to his more immediate Worſhip and Service? Have not People read, That it is GOD who gives Men Power to get Wealth, and therefore that the beſt Way to proſper in the World is to ſecure his Favour? And has not our Bleſſed Lord himſelf promiſed, that if we ſeek firſt the Kingdom of GOD and his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, all outward Neceſſaries ſhall be added unto us?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:004450_0015_100D9E13BB0A6CF8"/>
               <hi>Abraham,</hi> no doubt, was a Man of as great Buſineſs as ſuch Objectors may be; but yet He would find Time, to command his Houſhold to <hi>ſerve the LORD.</hi> Nay, <hi>David,</hi> was a King, and conſequently had a great deal of Buſineſs upon his Hands; yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, He profeſſes that he would Walk in his Houſe with a perfect Heart. And, to inſtance but one more, Holy <hi>Joſhua</hi> was a Perſon certainly engaged very much in Temporal Affairs; and yet He ſolemnly declares before all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> That, as for him and his Houſhold, they would <hi>ſerve the LORD.</hi> And did Perſons but redeem their Time, as <hi>Abraham, David,</hi> or <hi>Joſhua</hi> did, they would no longer complain that Family Duties kept them too long from the Buſineſs of the World.</p>
            <p>III. BUT my <hi>Third</hi> and laſt General Head, under which I was to offer ſome Motives, in order to excite all Governours, with their reſpective Houſholds, to <hi>ſerve-the LORD</hi> in the Manner before recommended, I hope, will ſerve inſtead of a Thouſand Arguments, to prove the Weakneſs and Folly of any ſuch Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</p>
            <p n="1">1. AND the firſt Motive I ſhall mention is the Duty of Gratitude, you that are Governours of Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies owe to GOD.—Your Lot, every one muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, is caſt into a fair Ground: Providence hath given you a goodly Heritage, above many of your Fellow Creatures, and therefore, out of a Principle of Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, you ought to endeavour, as much as in you lies, to make every Perſon of your reſpective Houſholds to call upon him as long as they live: (Not to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:004450_0016_100D9E16AEEFBF40"/>
that the Authority, with which GOD has inveſted you as Parents and Governours of Families, is a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent committed to your Truſt, and which you are bound to improve to your Maſter's Honour. In other Things we find Governours and Parents can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe Lordſhip over their Children and Servants, and frequently enough can ſay to one <hi>Go,</hi> and he goeth; to another <hi>Come,</hi> and he cometh; to a third, <hi>Do this,</hi> and he doeth it. And ſhall this Power be ſo often em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in your own Affairs, and never exerted in the Things of GOD? Be aſtoniſhed, O Heavens, at this.</p>
            <p>THUS did not faithful <hi>Abraham;</hi> No, GOD ſays, that He knew <hi>Abraham</hi> would <hi>command his Servants and Children after him.</hi> Thus did not <hi>Joſhua:</hi> No, He was reſolved not only to walk with GOD himſelf, but to improve his Authority in making all about him do ſo too: <hi>As for me and my Houſhold, we will ſerve the LORD.</hi> Let us go and do likewiſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. BUT, Secondly, If <hi>Gratitude</hi> to GOD will not, methinks <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Pity</hi> to your Children ſhould move you, with your reſpective Families, to <hi>ſerve the LORD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>MOST People expreſs a great Fondneſs for their Children; nay ſo great, that very often their own Lives are wrapped up in thoſe of their Offspring. <hi>Can a Woman forget her ſucking Child, that ſhe ſhould not have Compaſſion on the Son of her Womb?</hi> ſays GOD by his Prophet <hi>Iſaiah.</hi> He ſpeaks of it as a monſtrous Thing, and ſcarce credible. But the Words immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately following affirm it to be poſſible, <hi>Yea They may forget;</hi> and Experience alſo aſſures us they may.
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:004450_0017_100D9E19E03B09A0"/>
               <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Mother</hi> may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>th <hi>forſake their Children:</hi> For what greater Degree of Forgetfulneſs can they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs towards them, than to neglect the Improvement of their better Part, and not bring them up in the Knowledge and Fear of GOD.</p>
            <p>IT is true, indeed, Parents ſeldom forget to provide for their Children's Bodies, (though, it is to be feared, ſome Men are ſo far ſunk beneath the Beaſts that periſh, as to neglect even that;) but then how often do they forget, or rather when do they remember, to ſecure the Salvation of their immortal Souls: But is this their Way of expreſſing their Fondneſs for the Fruit of their Bodies? Is this the beſt Teſtimony they can give of their Affection to the Darling of their Hearts? Then was <hi>Dalilah</hi> fond of <hi>Sampſon,</hi> when ſhe delivered him up into the Hands of the <hi>Philiſtines.</hi> Then were thoſe Ruffians well affected to <hi>Daniel,</hi> when they threw him into a Den of Lions.</p>
            <p n="3">3. BUT, Thirdly, if neither <hi>Gratitude</hi> to GOD, nor <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Pity</hi> to your Children, will prevail on you; yet let a Principle of common <hi>Honeſty</hi> and <hi>Juſtice</hi> move you to ſet up the holy Reſolution in the Text.</p>
            <p>THIS is a Principle which all Men would be thought to act upon. But certainly, if any may be truly cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured for their Injuſtice, none can be more liable to ſuch Cenſure than thoſe who think themſelves injured if their Servants withdraw themſelves from their bodily Work, and yet they in return take no care of their ineſtimable Souls. For is it juſt that Servants ſhould ſpend their Time and Strength in their Maſter's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and Maſters not at the ſame Time give them what is juſt and equal for their Service?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:004450_0018_100D9E184774A160"/>
IT is true, ſome Men may think they have done enough when they give unto their Servants Food and Rayment, and ſay, Did not I bargain with thee for ſo much a Year? But if they give them no other Reward than this, What do they do leſs for their very Beaſts? But are not Servants better than they? Doubtleſs they are: And however Maſters may put off their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions for the preſent, they will find a Time will come, when they ſhall know they ought to have given them ſome Spiritual, as well as Temporal Wages; and the Cry of thoſe that have mowed down their Fields will enter into the Ears of the LORD of <hi>Sabaoth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. BUT, Fourthly, If neither <hi>Gratitude</hi> to GOD, <hi>Pity</hi> to Children, nor a Principle of common <hi>Juſtice</hi> to Servants, are ſufficient to balance all Objections; yet let that darling, that prevailing Motive of <hi>Self-Intereſt</hi> turn the Scale, and engage you with your reſpective Houſholds to <hi>ſerve the LORD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS weights greatly with you in other Matters: Be then perſuaded to let it have a due and full Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence on you in this; and if it has, if you have but Faith as a Grain of Muſtard-Seed, how can you avoid believing that promoting <hi>Family Religion</hi> would be the beſt Means to promote your own temporal as well as eternal Welfare? For <hi>Godlineſs has the Promiſe of the Life that now is, as well as that which is to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BESIDES, you all, doubtleſs, wiſh for honeſt Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and pious Children; and to have them prove otherwiſe, would be as great a Grief to you as it was to <hi>Elijah</hi> to have a treacherous <hi>Gahazi,</hi> or <hi>David</hi> to be troubled with a rebellious <hi>Abſalom.</hi> But how can it be
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:004450_0019_100D9E1CA8D65C68"/>
expected they ſhould learn their Duty, except thoſe ſet over them take care to teach it them? Is it not as reaſonable to expect you ſhould reap where you had not ſown, or gather where you had not ſtrawed?</p>
            <p>DID Chriſtianity, indeed, give any Countenance to Children and Servants to diſregard their <hi>Parents and Maſters according to the Fleſh,</hi> or repreſent their Duty to them as inconſiſtent with their entire Obedience to their <hi>Father and Maſter which is in Heaven,</hi> there might then be ſome Pretence to neglect inſtructing them in the Principles of ſuch a Religion. But ſince the Precepts of this pure and undefiled. Religion are all of them holy, juſt, and good; and the more they are taught their Duty to GOD, the better they will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their Duties to you; methinks then to neglect the Improvement of their Souls, out of a Dread of ſpending too much Time in Religious Duties is act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing quite contrary to your own Intereſt, as well as Duty.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Fifthly and laſtly, If neither <hi>Gratitude</hi> to GOD, <hi>Love</hi> to your Children, common <hi>Juſtice</hi> to your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, nor even that moſt prevailing Motive <hi>Self-Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt,</hi> will excite; yet let a Conſideration of the <hi>Terrors of the LORD</hi> perſuade you to put in Practice the pious Reſolution in the Text. Remember the Time will come, and that perhaps very ſhortly, when we muſt all appear before the Judgment Seat of CHRIST; where we muſt give a ſolemn and ſtrict Account how we have had our Converſation, in our reſpective Families in this World. How will you endure to ſee your Children and Servants (who ought to be your Joy and Crown of Rejoicing in the Day of our Lord JESUS
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:004450_0020_100D9E1E5ABE3100"/>
CHRIST) coming out as ſo many ſwift Witneſſes againſt you; curſing the Father that begat them, the Womb that bare them, the Paps which they have ſucked, and the Day they ever entered into your Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes? Think you not the Damnation which Men muſt endure for their own Sins will be ſufficient, that they need load themſelves with the additional Guilt of being acceſſary to the Damnation of others alſo? Oh conſider this, all ye that forget to ſerve the LORD with your reſpective Houſholds, <hi>leſt he pluck you away and there be none to deliver you!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT GOD forbid, Brethren, that any ſuch Evil ſhould befall you: No, rather will I hope that you have been, in ſome Meaſure, convinced by what has been ſaid of the great Importance of <hi>Family Religion;</hi> and therefore are ready to cry out, in the Words im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately following the Text, <hi>GOD forbid that we ſhould forſake the LORD;</hi> and again, Verſe 21. <hi>Nay but we will,</hi> with our reſpective Houſholds, <hi>ſerve the LORD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND that there may be always ſuch a Heart in you, Let me, to conclude, exhort all Governours of Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, in the Name of our Lord JESUS CHRIST, often to reflect on the ineſtimable Worth of their own Souls, and the infinite Ranſom, even the precious Blood of JESUS CHRIST, which has been paid down for them. Remember, I beſeech you remember, that you are fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len Creatures, that you are by Nature loſt to and eſtranged from GOD; and that you can never be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to your primitive Happineſs, 'till by being born again of the Holy Ghoſt, you arrive at your primitive State of Purity, have the Image of GOD reinſtamped
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:004450_0021_100D9E21ED1F9AF0"/>
upon your Souls, and are thereby made meet to be Partakers of the Inheritance with the Saints in Light. Do, I ſay, but ſeriouſly and frequently reflect on, and act as Perſons that believe ſuch important Truths, and you will no more neglect your Family's ſpiritual Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare than your own. No, the <hi>Love of GOD,</hi> which will then be <hi>ſhed abroad in your Hearts, will conſtrain you</hi> to do your utmoſt to preſerve them: And the deep Senſe of GOD's free Grace, in CHRIST JESUS, (which you will then have,) in calling you, will excite you to do your utmoſt to ſave others, eſpecially thoſe of your own Houſhold, and though, after all your pious Endeavours, ſome may continue unreformed; yet you will have this comfortable Reflection to make, that you did what you could to make your Families <hi>religious;</hi> and therefore may reſt aſſured of ſitting down in the Kingdom of Heaven, with <hi>Abraham, Joſhua,</hi> and <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius,</hi> and all the godly Houſholders, who in their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Generations ſhone forth as ſo many Lights in their reſpective Houſholds upon Earth.</p>
