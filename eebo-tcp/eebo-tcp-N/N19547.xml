            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>WHEN I began the following Poem, my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention was only to commemorate (for my own private ſatisfaction) the different ſcenes and places which I beheld in my travels through America; but, after finiſhing it, I began to think it might be entertaining to the public; and at the requeſt of ſome gentlemen to whom I have ſhewn the manuſcript, have agreed to publiſh it. With reſpect to the poem in general, I ſhall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inform the reader, that I have frequently uſed the <hi>preſent tenſe</hi> inſtead of the <hi>paſt,</hi> in order to keep the action the more alive. The verſes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced into the latter end of the poem, and the ſeparate pieces added to it, were inſerted in hopes of rendering the whole the more entertaining.</p>

               <l>MY native home, and dear companions all,</l>
               <l>Juvenile pleaſures and the ev'ning ball,</l>
               <l>The prancing ſteed, and the quick-ſcenting hound,</l>
               <l>I bade adieu, and thus began my round.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>From fair Hibernia's healthy, verdant plain,</l>
               <l>With Captain Stone, I ruſh'd into the main.</l>
               <l>At th' age of ſeventeen and nine months more,</l>
               <l>I bade adieu unto my native ſhore.</l>
               <l>I ſoon beheld the lofty billows roll,</l>
               <l>And light'ning flaſh, while thunder ſhook the pole;</l>
               <l>Our veſſel toſſed thro' the ſtormy main;</l>
               <l>Then oft I wiſh'd to be at home again.</l>
               <l>Alas! how vain my fruitleſs wiſhes were,</l>
               <l>'Midſt ſeas of trouble, far from parent's care;</l>
               <l>Where thunders claſh'd, and ſeas roll'd mountain high,</l>
               <l>Which made me <hi>heave</hi> 'till I thought I ſhould die.</l>

               <l>Thus imagination on her airy wing,</l>
               <l>Has led me on thro' boundleſs ſpace,</l>
               <l>From theſe diurnal ſcenes.</l>
               <l>And now thoſe orbs ſublime,</l>
               <l>She fain would trace thro' ages back,</l>
               <l>And ſee them ſpring from <hi>Chaos!</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Nor would ſhe then reſt ſatisfied;</l>
               <l>The <hi>cauſe</hi> that made them ſpring,</l>
               <l>And gave them motion,</l>
               <pb n="49" facs="unknown:025490_0046_0FCD488605D2D840"/>
               <l>Next ſhe fain would know;</l>
               <l>And how this <hi>cauſe,</hi> eternal and alone,</l>
               <l>Could <hi>be</hi> without <hi>beginning!</hi>
               </l>
               <l>There's th'aſtounding thought!</l>
               <l>Here again I ſtand amaz'd,</l>
               <l>In admiration loſt,</l>
               <l>Nor can I trace th' eternal cauſe,</l>
               <l>From which all nature ſprang,</l>
               <l>To its beginning.—</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Say then ye wiſer heads,</l>
               <l>Why does the human mind aſpire to know,</l>
               <l>Things beyond her ſphere,</l>
               <l>The greatneſs, eſſence, and primeval ſtate</l>
               <l>Of the ſtupendous whole?</l>
               <l>If nought immortald welt within my frame,</l>
               <l>I, like the brute creation, then could <hi>reſt,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>When the calls of nature were ſupply'd.</l>
               <l>But <hi>this</hi> I cannot do; and hence conclude,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Something immortal</hi> in me dwells,</l>
               <l>Which thus aſpires to view the perfect whole!</l>
               <l>But what this <hi>ſomething</hi> is, he only knows</l>
               <l>Whoſe works no thought can bound;</l>
               <l>Whoſe beginning we cannot trace;</l>
               <l>Whoſe immenſity we can't conceive;</l>
               <l>Who rules the amazing whole;</l>
               <l>Who ſits on heaven's high throne,</l>
               <l>Jehovah, Jove and Lord,</l>
               <l>Eternal, and alone!</l>
