            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THAT my often ſpeaking the ſame things, may not be gravaminous; I humbly offer my Sentiments about ſending a Military Force againſt the <hi>Kennebeck</hi> Indians, in Writing.</p>
            <p>IT is Reſolved that the Government has <gap reason="illegible: torn page" extent="5 letters">

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>r part, to prevent a Rupture.</p>
            <p>AT the Conference of his Excellency with the Sachems, and Chief Men of the <hi>Eaſtern Indians,</hi> at <hi>George-Town</hi> on <hi>Arrowſick</hi> Iſland, <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 9. 1717. The Indians ſhewed a great Reluctancy againſt Erecting Forts higher up the River; and againſt the arrival of a Multitude of New Inhabitants; leſt they ſhould prove unable heartily to embrace them. They alſo deſired the Running of a Line between the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and them; and made ſome Propoſals on their part, which were rejected: but no Propoſals for fixing Boundaries, were offered to them.</p>
            <p>WITHOUT doubt, Boundaries are neceſſary for the preſervation of Honeſty and Peace among thoſe that border one upon another. This is evident from the Law made for the Renewing of them between Townſhips once in three Years time, ſucceſſively; and the penalty of Five Pounds inflicted on thoſe, who ſhall neglect their Duty herein.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:002292_0002_0FDB1BF993645EE8"/>THE Royal Charter gives a good Account of the Errand of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Chriſtians into this New World, in the Words following; — <q>And to diſpoſe of matters and things, whereby Our Subjects, Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of Our ſaid Province, may be religiouſly, peaceably, and civilly, governed, protected, and defended; ſo as their good Life, and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly Converſation, may Win the <hi>Indians,</hi> Natives of the Country, to the Knowledge and Obedience of the only True GOD, and Saviour of Mankind, and the Chriſtian Faith: Which His Royal Majeſty, Our Royal Grand-father, King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, in His ſaid Letters Patents, Declared was His Royal Intention, and the adventurers free Profeſſion, to be the principal End of the ſaid <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>.</q>
            </p>
            <p>BY this Momentous clauſe in our Charter, the Government is Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and excited, to doe what in them lyes, to Recover the Aboriginal Natives from their Heatheniſme, and Antichriſtianiſme.</p>
            <p>OUR Bleſſed Saviour's Method of Converſion was, To Heal the Bodies of Men and Women, in order to His entire, and Eternal Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them. This conſtrains me to think, that it is Neceſſary to ſtate and ſettle plain and laſting Bounds between the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and the <hi>Indians;</hi> that ſo the Natives may have a certain and eſtabliſh'd Enjoyment of their O<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> Country: and that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> may have DEUS NOBISCUM Legibly embroidered in their Banners.</p>
            <p>THE Hiſtory of the War between the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and their Brethren the <hi>Benjamites,</hi> is very awfull. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had a vaſt Army: Four Hundred Thouſand Fighting Men; the <hi>Benjamites</hi> had only Twenty Six Thouſand, and Seven Hundred: And yet the <hi>Benjamites</hi> (the Flameable cauſes of the War) Slew Forty Thouſand Men of the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Omne prius tentandum eſt —</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND if, at laſt, we ſhould be provoked to goe againſt our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, the <hi>Kennebeck</hi> Indians; 'twould be convenient for this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment firſt to ſit down, and count the Coſt. Many Thouſands of Pounds have been already expended on this Controverſy. If the War proceed, and be proſpered; the <hi>Engliſh</hi> may, probably, drive
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:002292_0003_0FDB1BFB23FF1E50"/>the <hi>Indians</hi> from their ancient Habitation: Yet 'tis improbable the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhould ſlay them, or take them Captives. In all likelihood, the Survivours will fly away to <hi>Cannada.</hi> And if a War ſhould happen between <hi>Great Britain,</hi> and <hi>France;</hi> theſe Fugitives would ſolicit the Aſſiſtance of the <hi>French,</hi> in returning to their Country (which they are very fond of) though it ſhould be never ſo much to the Loſs and Damage of the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SO that I am humbly of Opinion, 'Twould be moſt Honourable, and moſt Profitable, for this Province, to perſwade the <hi>Kennebeck</hi> Indians to be our Dependents and Friends, by Really convincing them, it is their True Intereſt ſo to be; as indeed it is.</p>
            <p>WHICH is humbly ſubmitted to his Excellency the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, the Honourable Council and Repreſentatives, in General Court aſſembled.</p>

            <p>I am afraid Whether we doe not provoke GOD, by our Neglect of Proſecuting that Deſign.
