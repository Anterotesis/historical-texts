            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>IF one of the moſt celebrated Profeſſors<note n="*" place="bottom">CULLEN in his preface.</note> of the age had reaſon to ſay, that to deliver a ſyſtem of the doctrines and rules proper for directing the practice of Phyſic, was an undertaking attended with ſuch great difficulty, that after an experience of <hi>forty years,</hi> as well as much reading and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, it was with great diffidence he entered upon ſuch a work.—With how much more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence ought one to appear who cannot boaſt of either?</p>
            <p>I always intended to preſent my hearers with a <hi>Synopſis</hi> of my <hi>Courſe</hi> of <hi>Lectures,</hi> when years and more experience ſhould give me ſufficient confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; but ſeveral circumſtances concurring at this time, induce me to offer you the FIRST PART of my deſign, crude and imperfect as it is.</p>
            <p>Prejudices have operated againſt our Medical Inſtitution in general; and although the preli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:020123_0003_0FADED6E2F70BEB0"/>
or auxilliary branches, <hi>Anatomy, Botany, Chymiſtry</hi> and <hi>Natural Philoſophy,</hi> are allowed to be not altogether uſeleſs or void of entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet the THEORY AND PRACTICE OF PHY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SIC, which comprehends and connects them all, is repreſented as neither uſeful nor entertaining, and if neceſſary, eaſier collected from books than lectures. Although every thing in nature hath a reference to the <hi>human perſon,</hi> yet the Phyſician may obſerve that ſome things here treated of, or rather the view in which they are exhibited, can hardly be called medical.—This will be ſufficiently explained when it is known that hitherto far the greateſt part of my hearers mean not to purſue phyſic as a profeſſion; but, in imitation of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral illuſtrious characters, wiſh only to fill up their liberal leiſure in that moſt uſeful of all ſtudies, the knowledge of themſelves. It hath been la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented that thoſe who have ſtudied the philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy of the human mind, have been little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the ſtructure of the human body and the laws of the animal oeconomy; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the mind and the body are ſo intimately connected, and have ſuch a mutual influence on one another, that the conſtitution of either, exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined <hi>a part,</hi> can never be thoroughly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood.<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. Gregory.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="v" facs="unknown:020123_0004_0FADED6E9C72C2B8"/>In conſideration of your various purſuits, we have gone one ſtep further, and encouraged you to ſtudy man in relation to other animals and things; and glancing at the wondrous <hi>chain</hi> of univerſal exiſtence, have called your attention to ſome of its links; and this in order that you might view this "goodly frame" in the light of a large and well regulated family, all ſubſervient to each other in proper <hi>ſubordination,</hi>—all contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting in their proper places to the perfection and happineſs of the whole. In contemplating the <hi>principle of animation</hi> through the innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſpecies of beaſts, birds, fiſhes and inſects, 'till we reached the vegetable, we have been led on to enquire, whether theſe two tribes of orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized beings do not form (inſtead of two diſtinct kingdoms) one <hi>immenſe family</hi>?</p>
            <p>Thus, without neglecting the doctrine of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, and their remedies, have we endeavoured to give you a more pleaſing picture of man and his relations, than what mere medical lectures afford; and I was glad of ſuch an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to combat certain prejudices: for when I reflected how all the ſciences commonly taught in Univerſities were linked together, I felt a repugnance to the idea of phyſic being <hi>inſulated,</hi> and wiſhed to ſuggeſt to you that
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:020123_0005_0FADED6F58DF2830"/>
the art of medicine, when properly purſued, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually comprehended more of the ſciences than any other branch of knowledge you could name,—that man, placed at the head of the viſible ſeries, was an <hi>Epitome</hi> or compendium of the great world, and included within himſelf all the powers and properties of nature, <hi>vegetable, mineral, animal</hi> and <hi>intellectual,</hi>—that ſuch a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him was ſo eſſential to the human race, that without it the great <hi>Linnaeus</hi> ſeems to doubt whether any other characters be ſufficient to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title one to be ranked among mankind; for ſays he, "<hi>Haec ſi noveris</hi> HOMO <hi>es, et a reliquis anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libus diſtinctiſſimum genus.</hi>"</p>
            <p>Natural Hiſtory is not introduced here barely to amuſe, but with a hope that by cultivating a taſte for the works of nature ſome ſolid advantages may ariſe. The American may poſſibly be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded, in his reſearches, that while factitious wealth is dug up from the bowels of the earth, <hi>our</hi> only true and ſolid riches muſt be drawn from its <hi>upper ſtratum,</hi> from thence man receives a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of his honeſt induſtry by a kind of perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual miracle wrought in his favour.</p>
            <p>Should we not, moreover, encourage the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural curioſity of our countrymen to read that <hi>ſacred ſcripture</hi> written by the finger of the DEITY
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:020123_0006_0FADED701EC65F48"/>
himſelf, upon every <hi>animal,</hi> every <hi>plant,</hi> and every <hi>mineral</hi>? An uncorrupted ſcripture this! A kind of ſecond revelation! The GREAT BOOK OF NATURE, which comprehends the objects of every ſcience, is peculiarly inviting in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; its ample pages ſtrike all who have eyes to ſee and hearts to feel!</p>
            <p>SOME have ſaid, theſe ſubjects, though curious, are foreign to the medical profeſſion—but they are miſtaken. Where did HIPPOCRATES, and other Princes of the art, ſtudy? Wherever there were men, and the concomitants of humanity, diſeaſe and death,—AIR, EARTH and WATER,— all that ſurrounded them were the pages they ſtudied.</p>
            <p>The utility of a SYNOPSIS need not be dwelt on. Method is the ſoul of ſcience; by it a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed heap of facts may be ſo ranged and diſpoſed, that the judgment may act with freedom, and perform its office with advantage.<note n="*" place="bottom">See preface to <hi>Novum Organ,</hi>
               </note> After the ſubject of an enquiry is fixed on, and well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, it ſhould be divided into particular heads of enquiry: then the order of the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are to be ranged and digeſted into the form of regular tables, ſo that the mind may act upon them in juſt order and with regularity; <hi>the whole to be ſo conſtructed as to admit of being tranſpoſed, added to, or corrected.</hi>

               <pb n="viii" facs="unknown:020123_0007_0FADED711E138238"/>The SYNOPSIS is divided into <hi>four parts.</hi> The FIRST PART is in your hands.</p>
            <p>Although moſt of the ſubjects here mentioned have been treated of by men of eminence, the Phyſician will however ſee that we have taken a different view of the ſame ſubject from what is found in authors, and as far as I know among lecturers. Whole aphoriſms are inſerted upon ſome ſubjects, where we knew of no book that could ſerve as a guide to the pupil. The apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſms on the <hi>Vis vitalis</hi> may ſerve as an example. The obſcurity in which the proceſs of <hi>digeſtion</hi> was involved till very lately, will ſerve to explain the length of that ſection; the ſame may be ſaid of the <hi>Lymphatic ſyſtem,</hi> while the well eſtabliſhed doctrine of the <hi>circulation</hi> will explain the brevity of that ſubject. Under this head, ſome entire ſentences are taken from <hi>Fordyce</hi> and <hi>Haller</hi> to comment on, and wherever we have taken the ſame liberty with any author, it is mentioned in the margin in general, and in the lectures in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</p>
            <p>The SECOND PART treats of the more obvious cauſes of diſeaſes,—the atmoſphere—the ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—the diet—and then of particular ACUTE DISEASES; which will be treated of according to the plan firſt ſuggeſted by SYDENHAM, namely, arranged like the ſubjects of natural hiſtory into
<pb n="ix" facs="unknown:020123_0008_0FADED724FA3AD68"/>
               <hi>claſſes, orders, genera</hi> and <hi>ſpecies.</hi> By ſuch an aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance the ſtudent of nature is led as it were by an <hi>Ariadne's clue,</hi> through the turnings and laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinths of the <hi>three kingdoms</hi> of nature, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ſimilar one, the ſtudent of medicine could ſcarcely retain the deſcription of diſeaſes, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member how they are treated.</p>
            <p>The THIRD PART treats of CHRONIC DISEASES, beginning with the moſt ſimple, and ending with the moſt complicated.</p>
            <p>The FOURTH PART conſiders the OPERATION OF MEDICINES, and treats of the METHODUS CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CINNANDI FORMULAS MEDICAMENTORUM.</p>
            <p>In the execution of our plan, we wiſh not to hold up what we have to offer to you as our own ſelf-created knowledge, but rather what we have collected from the writings of approved authors, from lectures, and from the communications of eminent men. Neither ſhall we endeavour to ſtamp a dignity on any of our inventions by the triumphs of confutation, the citation of antiquity, or the maſk of obſcurity,<note n="*" place="bottom">

Certain extremities of the nerves (§ II.) ſo framed as to be capable of a peculiar contractility; and in conſequence of their ſituation and attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to be by their contraction capable of mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moſt of the ſolid and fluid parts of the body.

                     <hi>That muſcular fibres are a continuation of the medul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary ſubſtance of the brain and nerves, has not been ſhewn by Anatomiſts, nor univerſally admitted by Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiologiſts; but we now ſuppoſe it, and hope afterwards to render it ſufficiently probable.</hi>

                  <p>Are the <hi>Ganglions</hi> of the nerves to be conſidered as a part of the nervous ſyſtem diſtinguiſhed by a peculiar function?</p>
                  <p>Theſe ſeveral parts of the nervous ſyſtem, are every where the ſame continous medullary ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which we ſuppoſe to be the vital ſolids, ſo conſtituted in living animals, and in living ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tems only, as to admit of motions being readily propagated from one part to every other part of the nervous ſyſtem, ſo long as the continuity and living ſtate of the medullary ſubſtance remains.</p>
                  <p>In the living man there is an immaterial think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſubſtance or MIND; and every phoenomenon of thinking is to be conſidered as an affection or faculty of the mind alone. But this immaterial
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:020123_0051_0FADEDA11292CE78"/>
and thinking part of man, is ſo connected with the material and corporeal part of him, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly with the nervous ſyſtem, that motions ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited in this, give occaſion to thought; and thought, however occaſioned, gives riſe to new motions in the nervous ſyſtem.</p>
                  <p>It is probable that the motions excited by the application of ſtimuli to a moving and irritable part, or to the nerve going to a moving part, <hi>do not ariſe in the brain,</hi> but immediately in the nerves, or in the part; the brain, in this caſe, only keeping up the life of the part, and render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it capable of motion<note n="*" place="bottom">Fordyce.</note>.</p>
                  <p>A ſubſtance may act on one part as a ſtimulant or ſedative, and have a leſs effect, or none at all, when applied to another, although otherwiſe equally irritable. Such ſtimuli are called <hi>ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cific</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>It has been conjectured by ſome, that motion was communicated to parts by a fluid flowing through the nerves as tubes; by others, that it was communicated by vibrations<note n="§" place="bottom">See Hartley, on Man.</note>, and by others, that it ariſes from <hi>electricity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Is a nerve a better conductor of electricity than any other part in the ſame ſtate of moiſture?
