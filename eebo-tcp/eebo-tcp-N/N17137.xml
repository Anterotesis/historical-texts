            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <bibl>DANIEL, ii. 44.</bibl>
               <q>In the days of theſe Kings, ſhall the <hi>GOD</hi> of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſet up a kingdom which ſhall never be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed; and the kingdom ſhall not be left to other people; but it ſhall break in pieces, and conſume all theſe kingdoms, and it ſhall ſtand forever.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>WHEN our LORD JESUS was about to aſcend from earth to heaven, having finiſhed the glorious work for which he came, he gave in charge to his immediate followers, to go forth and <hi>diſciple</hi> all nations. This com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion he was pleaſed to preface with theſe words: <q>
                  <hi>All power in heaven and in earth, is given unto me.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>THIS ſame divine perſon many ages before, appeared to <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Hebrew law-giver, and
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:022118_0005_0FB6D5C563512340"/>
ſpake from the burning buſh, when he gave him commiſſion to go for the redemption of his people from their ſevere bondage, by the name of "I AM THAT I AM:" And told him to ſay "I AM" hath ſent me. It was HE alſo who, many years after, appeared to <hi>Joſhua,</hi> the commander in chief of the Hebrew bands, by the name of the <hi>"Captain of the Lord's hoſt."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN the Proverbs of king <hi>Solomon,</hi> divinely dictated, under the name of <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> this ſame divine Being makes no heſitation to declare, <q>
                  <hi>By</hi> ME <hi>kings reign and princes decree juſtice; by</hi> ME <hi>princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the earth.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>HIS holy apoſtle declares that <q>
                  <hi>God hath exalted him far above all principality and power, and might and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but alſo in that which is to come:</hi>
               </q> that <q>
                  <hi>all things are put under his feet,</hi>
               </q> and that <q>
                  <hi>he is given to be head over all things to the church.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>FROM all which we ſafely conclude, that ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute DOMINION belongs to the LORD JESUS CHRIST. And that all the limited authority, dominion and power, to be found among men, is, either mediately or immediately derived from him.</p>
            <p>
               <q>THE power of thoſe who are exalted to ſeats of government,</q> ſaid a venerable father on a like occaſion, almoſt a century paſt<note n="*" place="bottom">Rev. Mr. Bulkley's Election Sermon.</note> 
               <q>is
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:022118_0006_0FB6D5C6E0813A60"/>
from HIM. Whatever the particular inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or means of conveying this power, and veſting it in theſe and thoſe particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, may be: yet the power itſelf is from GOD, a ray of His. In elective ſtates where perſons are advanced by the ſuffrages of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to places of rule, and veſted with civil power; the perſons chuſing, give not the power, but GOD. They are but the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of conveyance, and do but deſign, i. e. <hi>nominate,</hi> the perſons that ſhall receive it from Him.</q>
            </p>
            <p>HENCE it is HE, who in his holy providence, putteth down one, and ſetteth up another. HE exalted even heathen princes—raiſed up a <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh,</hi> called <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> his ſervant, and <hi>Cyrus</hi> his ſhepherd and his anointed.</p>
            <p>THIS divine IMMANUEL was pleaſed, in the viſions of the night, to give to an heathen <hi>deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pot,</hi> ſome intimations of the glory and ſucceſs of HIS KINGDOM on earth.</p>
            <p>IT is hoped it will not be thought unſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, if the ſpeaker humbly invite the attention of this very reſpectable auditory for a few min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utes, to that KING and KINGDOM which hath no end. Eſpecially when it is remembered that it is his duty and buſineſs, to ſtudy its laws and maxims, to endeavor to proclaim its beauties, and to perſuade his fellow-men, to ſeek firſt its righteouſneſs, proſperity and glory.</p>
            <p>THE context, it is preſumed, is ſo well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:022118_0007_0FB6D5C8627DF8A8"/>
by all who conſult the ſacred pages, that it precludes the neceſſity of any rehearſal. The image that appeared to ſtand before the aſtoniſhed prince, is ſo particularly deſcribed and ſo minutely interpreted, as renders a repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition needleſs. Great numbers in this auditory have, no doubt, received profitable inſtruction, as well as pleaſing entertainment, in reading in antient hiſtory, a more full account of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet's prediction, of which this chapter contains only the out-lines.</p>
            <p>WE may obſerve therefore, from the text, that a glorious kingdom is to be ſet up; and that it is to be ſet up, in the midſt of the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and overturnings of earthly dominion and greatneſs. Agreeably to the prophet <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> who was contemporary with the one who gave us our text. "I will overturn, overturn, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn it, i. e. dominion, and <hi>it</hi> ſhall be no more."</p>
            <p>THUS the <hi>Chaldean</hi> dominion was transferred into the hands of the <hi>Perſians;</hi> thence into the hands of the <hi>Grecian</hi> conqueror, and from the <hi>Greeks</hi> to the <hi>Romans.</hi> This laſt empire arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the higheſt pinnacle of earthly glory: HE, <hi>whoſe right it is,</hi> even the LORD from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven—the LORD JESUS appeared to lay the foundation of this kingdom ſpoken of in our text.</p>
            <p>BE pleaſed further to obſerve, that this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom <hi>ſhall never be deſtroyed.</hi> While the formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable empires and mighty kingdoms of this world, in their turn, riſe and fall, yea, become
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:022118_0008_0FB6D5DFA7A2E578"/>
extinct and forgotten; this kingdom ſhall abide and remain—ſhall out live and be an attendant on the funeral of all the ſhort-lived dominions of the earth. Moreover, that it ſhall <hi>brake in pieces and conſume</hi> all thoſe that are in oppoſition to it; or bring into it, <hi>crowns</hi> and <hi>ſceptres</hi>—ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorb all earthly powers, and make them contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to its progreſs, advancement and glory.</p>
            <p>I HAVE now to aſk your attention, to <hi>the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme</hi> RULER <hi>in this kingdom—The nature of its laws and maxims—and the character of its ſubjects.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE ſupreme ruler in this kingdom is none other than the LORD JESUS CHRIST. He who made all things, and by whom all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt. He who thought it not robbery to be equal with GOD: but made himſelf of no rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utation, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the <hi>croſs.</hi> And this, that he might erect a kingdom on earth, and with ſuch ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects as a lapſed world is compoſed of; even ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and tranſgreſſors againſt their GOD.</p>
            <p>FOR this, it was neceſſary that he ſhould pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe and redeem them, and that with the price of his own BLOOD—That he ſhould aſſert the rectitude of the divine adminiſtration, the equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and goodneſs of his LAW; which could not be, but by his <hi>obedience</hi> and <hi>ſacrifice.</hi> This therefore he chearfully undertook. <q>Behold I come, in the volume of the book it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of me, to do thy will, O GOD.</q> In or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for the accompliſhment of which, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared meek and lowly; ſubmitted to the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:022118_0009_0FB6D5E0611548B8"/>
reproaches and indignities of wicked men—to be accounted mean and contemptible, and when he was reviled, reviled not again. He was full of philanthropy, went about doing good, and was emphatically the ſinner's friend.</p>
            <p>HIS obedience in his threefold character, as a <hi>Man,</hi> a <hi>Jew</hi> and a <hi>Redeemer,</hi> was perfect and perſevering; his ſufferings and death meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and his reſurrection and aſcenſion, certain and triumphant.</p>
            <p>THIS divine Ruler is poſſeſſed of every perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſuited to be the great head of this kingdom. He is now continually operating in the courſe of his all-governing providence, with ſuch wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, power and goodneſs, as to make all things ſubſervient to his grand deſign, in bringing glory to GOD, and happineſs to the ſyſtem of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence. <q>He maketh his angels ſpirits, and his miniſters a flame of fire.</q> He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts the affairs of this world in ſuch a manner, as is beſt calculated to promote, and moſt wiſely adapted to advance, the intereſts of this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom on earth. When <q>the heathen rage and the people imagine a vain thing:</q> He ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in the heavens and laugheth at their folly. When the kings and potentates of the earth take counſel together, and ſet themſelves againſt him; <q>He daſheth them in pieces like a pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's veſſel.</q>
            </p>
            <p>FROM the earlieſt ages, He hath ſo ordered the events of time, that the riſe and fall of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions—the revolutions and changes which have

come to paſs, among the generations of men; have all contributed to bring forward the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atorial plan, and will, in iſſue, produce a large revenue of glory to the LORD JESUS CHRIST.</p>
            <p>NOR is this kingdom propagated by fire and ſword, or by the arts and ſtratagems of war; by which indeed moſt of the kingdoms of this world have been ſet up and eſtabliſhed: but by the ſtill ſmall voice of the <hi>divine ſpirit</hi>—by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly influence on the minds of men; without noiſe, pomp and magnificence: For <q>this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom cometh not with obſervation.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THIS ſupreme King of Zion, not only diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points and confounds the devices of thoſe who are in oppoſition to his kingdom; but rules in the hearts of his people by love. As his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations are all wiſe, juſt and good; ſo the laws, precepts and maxims by which he governs, are excellent and divine. To <hi>theſe</hi> then in the <hi>next place,</hi> I am to aſk your attention.</p>
            <p>THIS is the only abſolute monarchy we know of, that is without its faults. Monarchical go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, we may, perhaps, be allowed to ſay, is the beſt in the univerſe, provided the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch be wiſe, juſt and good. But ſuch are the imperfections and corruptions attendant on lapſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed degenerate men, that it is exceedingly dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to erect ſuch a government in our world; leſt oppreſſion and violence ſhould ſtalk uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouled, and miſery and wretchedneſs be ſtill more accumulated among the children of men.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:022118_0011_0FB6D602E82CA718"/>
THE hiſtory of paſt ages exhibits a hideous portrait of the diſmal effects of abſolute deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potic government. <q>What mighty bleſſings to mankind,</q> remarks a worthy divine<note n="*" place="bottom">Rev. Dr. Williams, of Lebanon.</note> on a ſimilar occaſion, <q>were the famous <hi>Ninus, Nebuchadnezzar, Alexander,</hi> yea even <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and later heroes of that ſort; who have been celebrated in the records of fame? What did they ever do, but butcher mankind? ravage, rob and plunder millions better than themſelves? And to what other end, but to ſerve their own lawleſs and unbridled luſts? What were their moſt celebrated virtues, but the wonderful generoſity of giving thoſe rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, honors and privileges to ſome of their ſlaves, which they had firſt unrighteouſly got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton into their power, and taken from others?</q>
            </p>
            <p>BUT in the government we are contemplat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, although it is abſolute monarchy, it is, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, the moſt wiſe, equitable and mild. The laws in this kingdom are, indeed, calculat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to bring glory and dignity to the prince—to exalt the ſovereign: yet alſo to ſecure the lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty and felicity of the ſubject.</p>
            <p>A FUNDAMENTAL law in this kingdom is LOVE. <q>Thou ſhalt love the LORD thy GOD with all thy heart, and thy neighbor as thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</q> On this, all the rules, ſtatutes and maxims of this kingdom are founded.</p>
            <p>As the glorious Ruler himſelf was full of love
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:022118_0012_0FB6D61DD6028580"/>
to GOD, and benevolence to mankind, ſo he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth the exerciſe of this capital virtue, in all his ſubjects. This conſtitutes order and peace, and lays a foundation for a moſt agreeable and happy ſociety.</p>
            <p>JUSTICE, integrity and uprightneſs, are urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as moſt eſſential requiſites for the conduct of all the ſubjects of this kingdom. It is a moſt important maxim given and inſiſted on, by the glorious Legiſlator, <q>As ye would that men ſhould do to you, do ye alſo to them like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</q> This is that which the LORD requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, "to do juſtly and love mercy."</p>
            <p>IT is an important direction in this kingdom to render to all their dues. Various are the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations and different the offices to be ſuſtained in ſocial connection, whether in civil or religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous life. And hence different duties and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations ariſe; according to the various ſtations among men, in which, by divine Providence, they are placed. Hence rules are preſcribed. He that <hi>ruleth</hi> is required to rule <q>with dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.</q> And to <q>be <hi>juſt,</hi> ruling in the fear of GOD.</q> To be a <q>terror to evil-doers, and a praiſe to ſuch as do well.</q> He is to conſider himſelf as "GOD's miniſter," attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing continually on this very thing.</p>
            <p>OF <hi>ſubjects</hi> it is alſo required, that they "ſubmit to the ordinances of men"—and <q>be ſubject, not only for wrath, but alſo for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſake.</q> And of him that <hi>teacheth,</hi> it is required "that he wait on teaching"—and
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:022118_0013_0FB6D6200BA362A8"/>
               <q>give himſelf wholly to theſe things, that his profiting may appear.</q> In a word, the rule is, <q>let every man abide in the calling where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he is called</q>—and <q>render to all their dues, tribute to whom tribute is due, honor to whom honor, and fear to whom fear.</q>
            </p>
            <p>BENEFICENCE is alſo required of the ſubjects of CHRIST'S kingdom. Not only that benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent affection be exerciſed; but that it be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in beneficent actions and conduct to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our fellow-men. The rule adopted is, <q>look not every man at his own things, but every man alſo, at the things of others.</q> In oppoſition to that narrow and contracted ſelfiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which is ſo incompatible with all moral and ſocial virtue.</p>
            <p>TRUTH and ſincerity, in oppoſition to hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy, and artful diſſimulation is ſtrongly urged, as a neceſſary regulation for the conduct of the ſubjects of this dominion. An open and honeſt frankneſs in communication, with <q>yea, yea, nay, nay,</q> inaſmuch as <q>whatſoever is more than this, cometh of evil.</q> To theſe may be added, ſobriety, temperance and charity, as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhing ornaments of thoſe who belong to a kingdom which is never to have an end.</p>
            <p>I ONLY add here, that cheerful, uniform and perſevering obedience to theſe, and all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of CHRIST JESUS, is ſtrictly enjoined: For it is "he that endureth to the end, that ſhall be ſaved." But the bare mention of all the laws and maxims of this kingdom, would
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:022118_0014_0FB6D620E13A4960"/>
be to copy a conſiderable part of the New-Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament. Give me leave to ſuggeſt one thought more, under this head of diſcourſe and it ſhall be diſmiſſed: and that is, that as the laws in this kingdom are all founded in conſummate wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; ſo they are not too many, nor too few—they need no amendments, nor do they ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire any repeal. Such is the imperfection that attends the human-kind, that the wiſeſt conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution that can be formed by men, and laws and ſtatutes thence ariſing, may, and often are, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with miſchievous and unhappy effects. Nor is it poſſible to foreſee, with preciſion, their operation, ſo as to prevent them. Hence ariſeth the neceſſity of alteration and change, in legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and conſequently in adminiſtring upon it. But inſtability in government, ever diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to diſcontent and faction. Theſe things are in a greater or leſs degree, neceſſary attendants on this imperfect ſtate—ſuch is the ſituation of our world. But in the kingdom of the RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DEEMER, the conſtitution is perfect—the laws and rules conſummately wiſe, and the adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration, of conſequence, perfectly equitable and juſt.</p>
            <p>I HAVE now in the laſt place, to requeſt your attention to <hi>the character of the ſubjects</hi> of this dominion, of which we have been ſpeaking. And if in doing this, we find the principal out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines of the truly virtuous and godly man—the chief characteriſtics of the <hi>real chriſtian;</hi> it is hoped, it will not be deemed a miſpending the time. For I may preſume to aſſert, that it is our higheſt honor, and will be our greateſt feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:022118_0015_0FB6D6226323A6B8"/>
to be truly religious—to be real chriſtians; whatever be our ſtations and employments in this uncertain world. The ſpeaker would be underſtood therefore, by delineating the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, humbly to recommend it.</p>
            <p>THE ſubjects of this kingdom partake of the ſame ſpirit and temper of their glorious Ruler and Lord—and they walk in ſome meaſure even as he walked. They are endued with a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of real virtue, being born from above. This lays a foundation for virtuous conduct, and holy practice, both towards GOD, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and mankind. They exerciſe <q>
                  <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> toward GOD, and <hi>Faith</hi> in the LORD JESUS CHRIST.</q> Senſible they are ſinners, and of conſequence, under a forfeiture of the divine favour: they look to the free mercy of GOD, through the <hi>atonement</hi> of CHRIST, for pardon and acceptance unto eternal life. They are (acting in character, and in this view it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to conſider them) ſtrongly attached to their Prince. They are voluntary in his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice—are not ſubjects by conſtraint; but find that in being obedient, and in <q>keeping his commands there is a great reward</q>—and that "his yoke is eaſy and his burden light."</p>
            <p>SUCH is their love and attachment to their Sovereign and Lord, that they have a tender concern for his honor and intereſt, and his glory ever lies near their hearts: For when they <q>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the tranſgreſſors they are grieved.</q> As they love GOD, ſo they love mankind—they are diſpoſed, as they have opportunity, to do good
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:022118_0016_0FB6D6242876BFD8"/>
to all. They love not only their friends, but their enemies. Their benevolent affection is not bounded by their peculiar connections, nor circumſcribed with their own community or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but their philanthropy extends to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
            <p>ANOTHER characteriſtic of the ſubjects of this kingdom is, they are ſolicitous to approve themſelves faithful in their ſtations. Agreeably to the rule given: <q>Let every man abide in the ſame calling wherein he is called.</q> And are diligent in improving the talents committed to them, be they more or leſs; feeling the weight of that charge, "Occupy until I come."—They keep in mind, that they are amenable to their glorious LORD, for the privileges they enjoy, and betruſtments committed to them. They fear the doom of the ſlothful ſervant, and are anxious to obtain the bleſſed <hi>Euge</hi> pronounced on the faithful ones.</p>
            <p>MOREOVER the ſubjects of this kingdom are quiet and peaceable members of the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to which the providence of GOD hath joined them. They are diſpoſed not to be factious, turbulent and boiſterous; but rather to feel the influence and obligation of true patriotiſm—to ſeek the real proſperity and good of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Hence they feel bound by the precepts and example of their Lord, to diſcharge the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties they owe to their country, and in whoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection they ſhare a part. From this conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation they will not murmur, much leſs refuſe, to contribute their proportion for its ſecurity and
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:022118_0017_0FB6D63BE3E13228"/>
defence: remembring that their bleſſed LORD, even after he had proved an exemption, yet wrought a miracle to pay his <hi>poll-tax.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ADD, the ſubjects of this kingdom are men of <hi>prayer;</hi> and entertain a ſacred regard for the chriſtian inſtitutions. Whether in more exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or in humbler ſtations, they are not aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of JESUS and the croſs of CHRIST. They love his ſabbaths, they attend on his worſhip and ordinances, and ſet a greater eſtimate on the light of his countenance and the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of his grace and love, than they do on gold, yea than much fine gold.</p>
            <p>IN fine, they endeavor to keep a conſcience void of offence, both toward GOD, and toward man. They are influenced, from a ſacred re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to their GOD and their SAVIOUR, to live "ſoberly, righteouſly and godly in the world"—And in their habitual conduct, they are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to act as in ſight of the ſolemn judgement to come—and with a ſerious view to the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and awful retributions of eternity.</p>
            <p>THUS having an unſhaken truſt and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in GOD, and abiding under the ſhadow of his wings; they can be calm and ſedate, in the midſt of the boiſterous tumults, and ſhaking per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities of a tempeſtuous world—ſoar above its frowns—deſpiſe its flatteries—look with becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing indifference on its ſublunary vanities—wait for a comfortable diſmiſſion from its vexations and evils—and hope and look, through grace, for the approbation of their LORD, and an
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:022118_0018_0FB6D63D93BEEA98"/>
open and abundant entrance into his kingdom of glory.</p>
            <p>WITH pleaſing contemplation we remark; <hi>how glorious is the King of Zion.</hi> Who will not fear, who will not love, this ſupreme Ruler. How glorious his perſon, how exalted his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, how excellent his laws—how wiſe his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations, and how happy his ſubjects. Is all power in heaven and earth given unto Him? Is it by Him, kings reign and princes decree juſtice? By Him, do princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the earth—and doth his kingdom extend over and abſorb all others?—Then it is eaſy and natural to conclude, that all authority and power, ſhort of Him, when view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on a large ſcale, is only executive. By Him, and under Him they rule and govern, are exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting his purpoſes, and bringing about the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely benevolent deſigns of his heart.</p>
            <p>THE chriſtian ruler, the really virtuous, who are in authority, will rejoice to ſubſerve the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of his kingdom. They will contribute all in their power, to promote the greateſt good—the honor of the REDEEMER and the beſt good of mankind. They will feel that it is a privilege, as well as an honor, to be by Him furniſhed with ſuperior abilities, and placed in circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, to imitate their divine LORD in <hi>doing good</hi>—in ſeeking to diffuſe happineſs around them. And thus the LORD JESUS makes them happy inſtruments to promote his glorious pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:022118_0019_0FB6D63ED87B9BD0"/>
AND indeed, this divine Ruler, in the courſe of his wiſe providence, doth ſo diſpoſe and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der events, that thoſe who are not virtuous ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, not friendly to his kingdom; but rather ſeek to oppoſe and hinder its progreſs, ſhall yet be under his controul; ſo that they ſhall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve his pleaſure. For <q>the wrath of man ſhall praiſe him, and the remainder of wrath will he reſtrain.</q>
            </p>
            <p>NOT the moſt bloody tyrant that ever ſwayed a ſceptre, or diſgraced a diadem, can go a ſtep beyond his divine permiſſion: nor a wicked <hi>Hazael</hi> be king over <hi>Syria,</hi> but by his deſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. How animating the thought that the LORD JESUS reigns—that he hath a kingdom which ſhall know no end—and that he is ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering ſubjects into it, all around our world!</p>
            <p>NOTWITHSTANDING all the oppoſition that hath taken place, and the many efforts which have been made to overthrow this kingdom, it ſtill abides. It hath withſtood the ſhock of its enemies for ages, and will ſtill withſtand them.</p>
            <p>GREAT indeed, hath been the oppoſition to this kingdom in the world. Beſides the <hi>pagan</hi> darkneſs which hath, for ages, brooded over the greater part of the earth—beſides the awful <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion</hi> of that grand <hi>Impoſtor,</hi> the falſe prophet in the <hi>Eaſt</hi>—beſides the tyranny and ſuperſtitions of the <hi>Roman Pontiff</hi> and his zealous votaries: there have been ſwarms of errors, wild enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſm and ſuperſtition, with a kind of religious phrenſy and madneſs, which have prevailed in</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:022118_0020_0FB6D6405A1C0178"/>
AND when we ſee men impatient under pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per government, diſpoſed to diſcontent and fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to diſſeminate a ſpirit of contention—to "ſpeak evil of dignities," and deſpiſe their ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers: if the character of the ſubjects of CHRIST's kingdom hath been juſtly drawn; it is indeed difficult, if not impoſſible to reconcile this cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, with that of a real chriſtian; let their profeſſions and pretenſions be what they may.</p>
            <p>"TYRANNY and anarchy," ſaid another of our fathers, many years paſt,<note n="†" place="bottom">Rev. Mr. Hobart, in his Election Sermon.</note> 
               <q>like fire and froſt, though contrary in their natures, are, in many inſtances, much alike in their ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects. A factious and ungovernable diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the people, does as effectually deſtroy the public happineſs, as tyranny in the rulers. And a man has no more ſecurity of his life, or any of the enjoyments of it, when the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the laws is prevented by a mutinous temper of the people; than he would have if the laws were ſuſpended by the arbitrary will of tyrannical governors.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THE maxims of the religion of JESUS, abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly teach and inculcate, nay ſtrictly enjoin, cheerful and ready ſubjection to civil government; and under its happy influence and protection they may hope and expect <q>to lead quiet and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able lives in all godlineſs and honeſty.</q>
            </p>
            <p>IN a view of the glory of the kingdom of the REDEEMER, and the certainty of its ſpread and
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:022118_0021_0FB6D66BC9887DA0"/>
progreſs in the world; permit me once more to remark—<hi>The importance of this new and extended dominion to which we belong</hi>—and which covers no inconſiderable part of this <hi>weſtern continent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>MAY we not anticipate the joy that ſhall ariſe in every truly virtuous and pious mind, from a conſideration that this ſhall be the <hi>Theatre</hi> on which, angels and men, ſhall behold the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plays of the REDEEMER's grace, and the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous enlargement of his kingdom?</p>
            <p>IT is a juſt remark of a truly <hi>great man,</hi> that the viſible kingdom of CHRIST, from its firſt riſe, is making its progreſs towards the <hi>Weſt.</hi> A vaſt, an immenſe, yea in great part, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known territory lies before us in that <hi>direction.</hi> And, ſo far as it hath been explored, for fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of ſoil, mildneſs of climate, and ſuperior advantages of inland navigation, equals, if not ſurpaſſes any other part of the <hi>globe.</hi> Hitherto it hath been occupied, by little more than ſavage beaſts and ſavage men. Shall this be all; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til it ſhall be conſumed with the reſt of the burning world? Surely not.</p>
            <p>THE ſpecial <hi>agency of Heaven</hi> was ſo viſibly manifeſt, in the late American Revolution, as forced the acknowledgment of it, even from the inattentive as well as the attentive mind—from the profane and impious, as well as the virtuous and ſober.</p>
            <p>THE Supreme Ruler, whoſe province it is, to tread out empires, and give them birth; hath,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:022118_0022_0FB6D66CBAA707A8"/>
in his holy providence, laid the foundation of this new and extended empire. Nor is his hand leſs conſpicuous, in opening ſuch a fruitful world before us; ſufficient for the ſupport of many millions of inhabitants; than alſo in inſpiring ſuch a remarkable ſpirit of emigration to the <hi>weſt.</hi> And this, not only from amongſt us on the <hi>eaſtern</hi> ſhore of this <hi>continent:</hi> But alſo from various parts of the <hi>other.</hi> Hardy ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventrous ſouls, quitting the narrow and barren limits that gave them birth, to go and dwell in a more goodly land. And thus lay the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations for immenſe population and increaſe; and open the way for the progreſs of this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and ſpread the praiſes of the great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, in that land of darkneſs and <q>ſhadow of death.</q>
            </p>
            <p>HE muſt be very contracted in his views, who imagines that all theſe preparations, in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, are only for men to act over the buſy ſcenes of a ſhort life, in pleaſure, voluptuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſenſuality: or that earthly <hi>parade</hi> and <hi>ſhow,</hi> is all that is intended. No, ſurely. 'Tis no enthuſiaſm, 'tis no utopian chimera, to hope and <hi>believe,</hi> that this kingdom ſhall there ſpread and prevail, and the LORD JESUS get to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a name and a praiſe in thoſe ends of the earth.</p>
            <p>BUT I may not dwell, any longer on the pleaſing contemplation. The important buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the day forbids; and requires that the diſcourſe be ſhut up with the uſual addreſſes.</p>

I CONGRATULATE my friends, and brethren of this Commonwealth, on the joyful return of this pleaſing anniverſary. Great and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing have been the mercies of the GOD of heaven to our nation and infant empire. And when we were in imminent danger of ſuch inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal convulſions and diviſions, as, had they not been checked, portended our overthrow and ſpeedy ruin; and this notwithſtanding the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite expence of toil, treaſure and blood: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it hath pleaſed HIM, by whoſe ſpecial pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, our empire was founded, to unite a great people, in ſtrengthening the bands of union, in forming and adopting a <hi>Conſtitution,</hi> in a manner unequalled by, nay without a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent among the nations of the earth.</p>
            <p>WITH ineffable pleaſure, the citizens of the <hi>United States,</hi> may once more behold HIM who who is juſtly eſteemed the Father of his country, and, under GOD, the Saviour of a great peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; from the toils of war, taſting the ſweets of his beloved retirement and domeſtic tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility for a ſhort ſeaſon—at the <hi>united</hi> ſolicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a grateful and feeling people; again ſtep forth, and though reluctant, take the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidents' Chair: to head, not the gallant heroes and veteran ſoldiers in the <hi>field;</hi> but the ſage councillors in the <hi>cabinet</hi>—the auguſt legiſlature of America.</p>

            <p>WITH no leſs joy we view the venerable <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators</hi> and <hi>Repreſentatives</hi> of our nation, in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Congreſs aſſembled; with deliberation and firmneſs, unitedly exerting their wiſdom, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity and zeal, to heal the wounds, and cure the diſorders of their diſtreſſed country, and render their fellow citizens both happy at home, and reſpectable abroad. Was the revolution and the eſtabliſhment of our <hi>Independence,</hi> the "LORD's doings?"—Surely <hi>this not leſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>GREAT and diſtinguiſhing have been the mercies of GOD to this State in particular: and this <hi>day</hi> is a witneſs, of the patience and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the <hi>God of our Fathers,</hi> towards us their children; in continuing to us, our civil and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious privileges of ſuch ineſtimable worth.—We behold our fathers and brethren, who are conſtituted by the ſuffrages of a free people, the pillars and ſupporters of this ſtate—the guardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans of our precious immunities. And when in General Aſſembly met, as ſoon as formed, we view them reſorting together, to the houſe of GOD, unitedly to look up to the great Fountain of Wiſdom, "the Father of Lights," and to implore his preſence and direction with them. The weighty concerns before them call for it, and the prayers, and beſt wiſhes, of all good and virtuous citizens, will attend them.</p>

               <pb n="27" facs="unknown:022118_0025_0FB6D67DA2EEB7F0"/>
NOR is it a ſmall part of the joy that appears in the countenances of this numerous throng,—<hi>May it pleaſe your Excellency;</hi> for to you, Sir, I beg leave, with filial confidence, yet humble de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, more particularly to direct my diſcourſe.—It is not one of the leaſt felicities of this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to behold you, Sir, at the head of your nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous brethren and citizens of this common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. Eſpecially when we conſider you as one born and educated among us—as one who hath given early and continued aſſurances of your ſteady attachment to the beſt intereſts of your citizens, by a long ſeries of public and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remitting labors both at home and abroad.</p>
            <p>SHALL we repeat our expreſſions of gratitude, for the eminent ſervices you have rendered to this <hi>State,</hi> and to the <hi>United States?</hi> Although this may be acceptable, yet a conſciouſneſs of your own integrity and fidelity in your various important offices, I know, muſt afford you much greater ſatisfaction. You will permit me, Sir, as one of the miniſters of the LORD JESUS, to requeſt you often to reflect, that the eyes of GOD, and this people, are upon you—that as your office is high and honorable, ſo the duties of it are arduous and difficult. That you are accountable to Him, by whoſe providence, you are raiſed to your exalted ſtation: and that "where much is given much is alſo required."</p>
            <p>You will often contemplate, with divine plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, the glory and importance of that King and Kingdom, which hath been the <hi>theme</hi> of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going diſcourſe. Nor will you be aſhamed to
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:022118_0026_0FB6D67ED70D2750"/>
be, and continue to be, a faithful ſubject of the Prince of Peace. To Him you will ſtill repair, and on his grace you will rely, in all your tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, whether <hi>official</hi> or perſonal—even to Him who hath ſaid, "My grace is ſufficient for you."</p>
            <p>A BECOMING ſenſe of your own inſufficiency without divine aid—the ſweets of an approving conſcience, and the approbation of your Judge at laſt; will often bring you, with a ſpirit of humble dependance, to the throne of grace, with that petition which proceeded from <hi>one</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">King Solomon.</note> who preſided over a greater people than your Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency now doth.—<q>Give, therefore, thy ſervant an underſtanding heart, to judge thy people, that I may diſcern between good and bad: for who is able to judge this thy ſo great peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</q>
            </p>
            <p>YOUR Excellency, will ſuffer me to remind you, that as the LORD JESUS, who is the head of all power, hath, in his holy providence, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed you with ability, and placed you in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, to be eminently uſeful; ſo He will, one day, call you to render an account to Him your glorious Maſter.—Before whoſe tribunal, ſhall you and we ſtand, diveſted of every offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial diſtinction and titles of honor, which are peculiar to this world.</p>
            <p>AND now, That your Excellency may ſtill poſſeſs the fulleſt confidence, and the warmeſt affection of a grateful people—a long and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:022118_0027_0FB6D68EB10C2318"/>
adminiſtration—the teſtimony of an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving conſcience—the ſupports of religion through life—the conſolations of divine grace at death—and the final approbation of your Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Judge; is our devout wiſh and ardent prayer.</p>
            <p>SUCH, my indulgent auditors, is the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection that attends the wiſeſt and beſt men, that they may ſometimes, even in the great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of legiſlation, and in the appointment of executive authority, do that, which on further inſpection, they are convinced is not wiſeſt and beſt. For it is a received maxim, <q>Humanum eſt errare.</q> Therefore we find by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that <hi>two different boards</hi> in the great repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of the people, is exceedingly uſeful and neceſſary: For <q>he that is firſt in his own cauſe ſeemeth juſt; but his neighbor cometh and ſearcheth him</q>—And <q>two are better than one.</q>
            </p>
            <p>IN ſuch a government as ours, that there ſhould be a <hi>check</hi> upon the great body in Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Aſſembly, is found to be peculiarly ſalutary and beneficial.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>upper board</hi> of this great repreſentation, in conjunction with his <hi>Excellency,</hi> and his Honor the <hi>Lieutenant-Governor,</hi> we conſider as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of the people at <hi>large:</hi> and being promoted to that dignified ſtation by the ſuffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the people through all parts of the <hi>State;</hi> they will, of courſe, be free from partial and local feelings, and conſider themſelves equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:022118_0028_0FB6D69D88D3E340"/>
concerned for the whole body of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituents.</p>
            <p>YOU will ſuffer me then, <hi>May it pleaſe your Honor, and you Honorable Counſellors,</hi> juſt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mind you that, great is the confidence this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple repoſe in you, when you are ſelected out from the many thouſands in this common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, to compoſe the circle around the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil-board. Peculiar deference, eſteem and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor is due from us to you, in your high ſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: as alſo fatherly care, love and faithful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertion from you, honored Gentlemen, to us. The many proofs you have given of your ready diſcernment of, and regard for the real intereſts of the people, are not altogether unknown or wholly unnoticed. We requeſt your Honors, ſtill to exert your patriotic zeal and abilities for our good, and wiſh you at all times that <q>wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom which is profitable to direct.</q>
            </p>
            <p>YOU will indulge the freedom of a chriſtian miniſter, when he exhorts you among all the weighty concerns to which you are called; alſo to attend to that <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Kingdom</hi> of which we have been ſpeaking. By His providence, you are raiſed to places of diſtinguiſhed honor and truſt. By Him you "Nobles and Judges rule," as well as "all the Judges of the earth."</p>
            <p>YOU will remember, venerable Fathers, that you have not only to be, and do, that which is right in the ſight of men; but eſpecially to ſee that you approve yourſelves to your own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences and to the LORD JESUS, to whom you
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:022118_0029_0FB6D69EDC4E9500"/>
are accountable. And that it is your higheſt honor, and will be your greateſt felicity, to be found at laſt, the faithful ſubjects of that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom which ſhall outlive all others. Cultivating the ſpirit and temper with which that Supreme Ruler was poſſeſſed; will expand your hearts with <hi>philanthropy,</hi> and diſpoſe you to exert your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the improvement of the talents which, by your accompliſhments and ſituations, GOD hath committed to you. Nor will the dazzle of earthly honors make you forget, that though you are ſtiled <hi>God's</hi> on earth, you muſt die like <hi>men;</hi> and be called to render an account of your ſtewardſhip.</p>
            <p>AND the weight of this ſerious truth, you will the more ſenſibly feel, when you reflect that <hi>one</hi> of your number hath been called away from your <hi>Board</hi> and from our world, the year paſt. Although for a ſeries of years, he adorned his ſeat at the Council-Board—he was not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to continue by reaſon of death.</p>
            <p>HIS ability, integrity and zeal, for his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try's welfare—his fidelity and perſeverance, in the duties of his civil, ſocial and religious life, could not prevent the Honorable JOSEPH SPENCER, Eſquire, from a diſmiſſion from his uſeful offices and employments here: but having ſerved his generation, "he is gathered to his fathers."</p>
            <p>BUT that I be not tedious, we wiſh you, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored Senators, and <hi>thoſe Gentlemen,</hi> who may, this day, be invited, by the providence of GOD
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:022118_0030_0FB6D6A99EA15AB8"/>
and the voice of the freemen, to join your cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, and ſupply the place of him who has ſlept in death; and any or all, the ſeats of thoſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy members of your body who are called away to attend on the intereſting concerns of the foederal government in our national Congreſs: We wiſh you, revered Fathers, heavenly wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and underſtanding in all your conſultations and decrees. And that you may be ſo happy as that having ſerved your generation faithfully by the will of GOD, you may be gathered to your fathers in peace, meet the approbation of your own conſciences and of your final Judge; and by Him, through grace, be admitted to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of the faithful.</p>
            <p>HOW great is the privilege, my candid hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that when our numbers and local circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances will not admit of the great body of the people to meet together, to conſult the general good, and give themſelves <hi>law,</hi> or enact <hi>ſtatutes</hi> by which to be governed: that we may detach a number of our brethren from every part of the community, to repreſent us in General Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly. That they ſhould here convene, and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually communicate and receive, the feelings, the wants, the maladies and complaints of the <hi>great whole.</hi> But alas, how difficult, how ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duous, how embarraſſed oft times and perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is their ſituation? Though their ſtations are reſpectable, and demand our eſteem and rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; yet their ſituation requires our prayers, our beſt wiſhes and every friendly aid.</p>
            <p>IT is not one of the leaſt of our precious pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges,
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:022118_0031_0FB6D6B34121EEA8"/>
Gentlemen <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Repreſentatives</hi> of this whole Corporation, that you, and ſuch as from time to time ſuſtain your offices, may meet twice a year, and oftner if the public exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies require; to look over every part of the community and carefully to ſee; not only <q>ne quid Reſpublica detrimenti caperet</q> as the Roman phraſe was; not only, leſt the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth receive any detriment; but alſo ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to exert yourſelves, as fathers of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple you repreſent, to build them up—promote their tranquility—cement their union, and do all in your power, to advance the public <hi>weal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It belongs not to me, Gentlemen, to dictate to you how to rule—what muſt be done, or what not be done, in your legiſlative or executive de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments. Ye yourſelves know what are the exigencies of, and what the neceſſary proviſions for the commonwealth, and to you, a particular attention to this duty belongs. You will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore make the general welfare your grand ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, in all your conſultations and reſolves.</p>
            <p>INDULGE me, honored Gentlemen, the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to intreat you all to become the willing ſubjects of that kingdom, which ſhall flouriſh when all earthly power and authority, ſhall no more be needed. And to make the laws and maxims of that Supreme Ruler, whoſe character we have deſcribed, the meaſure of your conduct, in your political as well as private capacities. I may not doubt, honored Sirs, you will bear in mind, that you are accountable to him, and that his eye is ever upon you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="unknown:022118_0032_0FB6D6B8269A62A0"/>
YOU are, when in Aſſembly met, acting in a legiſlative capacity, and many, if not moſt of you, when diſperſed, are called to act in judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial and executive departments. In each and in every character you ſuſtain; if you "fear GOD" like <hi>Joſeph</hi> of old, you will indeed be pillars and ſupporters of our republic. Should you keep in mind that you are, not only amena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the public; but that you muſt give an account to that Supreme Judge, whoſe eye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds the ſecret ſprings and motives of every heart; and let this be uppermoſt in your minds; you will then hardly do amiſs: But, deſtitute of benevolence and virtuous principle, as the great <hi>Pole-ſtar</hi> to influence and guide you; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though your knowledge and abilities may be great; you will be in danger of ſhip-wreck—of bringing ruin on yourſelves and thoſe who are embarked with you.</p>
            <p>WORTHY Gentlemen, we ardently deſire and devoutly wiſh you the divine guidance, the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious preſence, and bleſſing of the Supreme Ruler—the LORD JESUS CHRIST—and that by wiſe and judicious precept, and faithful correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondent example, you may be great bleſſings in life, and, through grace, accepted at death, and made happy when your places ſhall no more be found in this uncertain world.</p>
            <p>ALTHOUGH the buſineſs of the day doth not call for the ſpecial attention of the Miniſters of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> any farther than that they ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves friendly and ſolicitous to promote in their <hi>line,</hi> the general good; and meet in convention
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:022118_0033_0FB6D6B91DDF0C88"/>
to cultivate harmony, and ſtrengthen and aſſiſt one another, in the important buſineſs in which they are called to act: yet the ſubject of the foregoing diſcourſe, exhibiting the nature and importance of that divine and glorious king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, in which they are called more immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to labour; will allow a word from one who eſteems it a privilege to be accounted one of their brethren.</p>
            <p>THE conſideration, <hi>My Reverend Fathers and dear Brethren,</hi> that the kingdom of the divine REDEEMER ſhall ſurvive all others, and that by His providence, others ſhall be made ſubſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to its intereſts—The conſideration alſo, of the utility and importance of civil government to promote the intereſts of this kingdom; ſhould fill our hearts with joy and gladneſs, and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate us to a diligent and laborious attention to the work, whereunto we are called.</p>
            <p>To <hi>us,</hi> bleſſed be GOD, even to us, is this grace given, to preach among our fellow-men, our fellow-ſinners, <q>the unſearchable riches of CHRIST.</q>—To exhibit the character of the REDEEMER—to unfold, explain, and enforce the laws and maxims of his kingdom, and to beſeech lapſed men <q>in CHRIST's ſtead, to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to GOD.</q>
            </p>
            <p>IF this employment as the antient divines uſed to ſay, is <q>formidable to the ſhoulders of angels;</q> what muſt it be in our view, when we conſider ourſelves, equally involved in the apoſtacy, guilt and ruin of our fellow-men?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="unknown:022118_0034_0FB6D6BACB12BF50"/>
SHOULD we not ever entertain an abiding ſenſe of our own inſufficiency, and continually look to JESUS our divine Maſter, for needful grace and aid, to enable us to the faithful diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of our important truſts. And while we are favored with the protection and countenance of our civil fathers, we are under better advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages to do good among our people for both worlds. They will readily tell us, that by faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully attending, to the duties of our office—by public and private precept and exhortation, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced by proper and becoming example; we may do much towards the peace and order of ſociety, and good of the commonwealth. This, then ſhould be a powerful ſtimulus to faithful and laborious exertion in our profeſſion. But when we reflect on the exalted glory of the RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DEEMER—the infinite importance of the ſpread of his kingdom—the glorious things ſpoken for the city of our GOD—the periſhing condition mankind are in by ſin—the door of mercy open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the goſpel, and the ſolemn account we ſhall ſoon be required to render of our miniſtry. When we reflect on theſe things, ſurely we ſhall be humble, prayerful, watchful, zealous and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in every branch of our arduous work. We ſhall ſtrive together in love for the faith of the goſpel, and the promotion of that dear cauſe which we have eſpouſed. We ſhall abound in love to our common LORD, in love to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and tender benevolence to mankind. And when one and another of our fathers and brethren are ſummoned off, from the wall of our Jeruſalem, calling on us as they go; to make haſte—to finiſh our miniſtry and follow them;
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:022118_0035_0FB6D6C9E2408E00"/>
ſhall we not hear—ſhall we not <hi>feel!</hi>—ſhall we not be all attention, and look and wait for the coming of our LORD?—<q>Bleſſed is that ſervant whom, his Lord when he cometh, ſhall find ſo doing.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I WILL detain this numerous auditory no longer, than only to beſeech your attention, <hi>My Brethren and Fellow-Citizens,</hi> to that glorious <hi>Ruler</hi> and that bleſſed <hi>Kingdom,</hi> which hath been briefly deſcribed. Suffer me to aſk you, my friends, what think you of CHRIST—what think you of his kingdom—what think you of the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal happy condition of his ſubjects? Permit me to exhort and charge you all, to become the faithful and loyal ſubjects of this Prince of Peace.—In his own words, to <q>ſeek firſt the kingdom of GOD.</q> Your peace and quiet in this world; but eſpecially your comfort in death, and your happineſs in the world to come, depends on your ſpeedy compliance with this, his exhortation.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>day</hi> and <hi>age</hi> in which we live is evil. The preachers have been wont on theſe moſt public occaſions, to ſhew to our <hi>Iſrael</hi> 
               <q>their tranſgreſſions.</q> And may not he who now ſpeaketh be allowed to bear a teſtimony againſt the prevailing evils which threaten our ruin—which preſage the awful diſplays of divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, and call for the uplifting hand of a ſin-revenging GOD. When he dares to make mention of them, he feels the more undaunted, from a conſcious perſuaſion that he hath the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor and countenance, not only of his <hi>Excellency</hi>
               <pb n="38" facs="unknown:022118_0036_0FB6D6CB306E9710"/>
who hath commanded him to ſpeak this day, and the honorable legiſlative body—together with the concurrence of his brethren of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred character and all ſerious men: but alſo the approbation of his GOD. He dares then to ſay, <hi>O Connecticut,</hi> how art thou fallen! Once fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for benevolence, righteouſneſs and the fear of GOD—for the belief and practice of religion—even the religion of JESUS, which alone brings ſinners to heaven. Now abounding with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitence, infidelity and all manner of impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.—The precious word of GOD diſregarded.—The holy ſabbath treated with growing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect.—The ſacred inſtitutions of the LORD JESUS, by many diſpiſed.—Family-prayer aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully out of faſhion. And of conſequence, all manner of violations of the duties we owe to one another. Injuſtice, fraud, violence, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneſs, debauchery, intemperance, deceit, falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and covetouſneſs—theſe and many more evils which are the genuine offspring of theſe; too much mark our towns and communities. Meanwhile the God of our Fathers in anger withdrawn, and the neceſſary influences of the bleſſed ſpirit withheld!—Is it not time to ſtop in our career, and enquire—where are we—and what muſt we expect? Hath not the Moſt High given us a gentle rebuke in cutting ſhort, both the harveſts in the year paſt, and thereby cauſed the cries of the poor to be more than uſually heard for <hi>bread.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WE have heretofore, felt the rod of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, in the deſolations of <hi>war,</hi> and in the deſtructions of the <hi>peſtilence</hi> that walketh in
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:022118_0037_0FB6D6CCAC6EBD98"/>
darkneſs: but have, as yet, GOD be thanked, been ſtrangers to the horrors of <hi>famine.</hi> Have we not reaſon to tremble, and be <q>afraid of his righteous judgments?</q> General and open impieties, are followed with public and ſore judgments. Let us open our eyes and ſee—re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive conviction, repent and reform.</p>
            <p>BRETHREN, the time is ſhort. Religion is a reality. Goſpel truths all-important. The concerns of eternity weighty and momentous. The retributions of the laſt great day, glorious and awful. To leave the paths of ſin—to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the ways of the deſtroyer—to become friends to the LORD JESUS, and lovers of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind: this will ſecure the favor of GOD—will make us a happy people. This will make us good citizens and good ſubjects. This will make it eaſy to rule, and to be ruled; each one attending to the duties of his own proper ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Then ſhall we ſtrive together to promote the general good. So ſhall we behold our <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> built up—this, a land of light, liberty and religion—our country grow and increaſe—our empire enlarge and extend—and that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine kingdom, which ſhall abſorb all others, ſpread and prevail, <q>till the earth ſhall be full of the knowledge of the glory of the LORD.</q> Then <q>
                  <hi>violence ſhall no more be heard in thy land, waſting and deſtruction within thy bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: But thou ſhalt call thy walls ſalvation, and thy gates praiſe.</hi>
