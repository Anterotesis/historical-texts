            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  </bibl>
                  <p>ENTER into his Gates with Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, and into his Courts with Praiſe: be thankful unto him, and bleſs his Name.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>WE are this day called in the good providence of God, and exhorted by our civil rulers, to diſcharge the duty which the royal Pſalmiſt here inculcates on the people of Iſrael: I mean, publickly and ſolemnly to render thanks to almighty God, for his great and undeſerved mercies. It does not indeed appear, that either the pſalm in general, or the words read in particular, were occaſioned by
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:008192_0004_102E49AED0FF9FA0"/>
any ſpecial or remarkable interpoſitions of divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence in favour of the Jews; but rather, that the pſalm has reſpect thro out to the goodneſs of God in general towards his people: So that the admonition in the text may properly be conſidered as a ſtanding, perpetual exhortation to the people of God in all ages and generations, to pay their public united ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments to him for his mercies. However, tho' the exhortation is in itſelf thus general or inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, you are ſenſible that there are ſome particular times and ſeaſons, wherein all ſuch general counſels demand a ſpecial attention; wherein there is a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar propriety in obſerving them; and in which, it would therefore be doubly criminal to diſregard them. And this being conſidered, I humbly conceive, there will at leaſt appear no impropriety in my choice of theſe words, for the ground of my diſcourſes on the preſent joyful occaſion: Eſpecially if it be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſidered, that the mercies and bleſſings, for which we are now entered into the courts of our God with praiſe, are not, all of them, peculiar to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſeaſon; but ſome of them of ſuch long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance, that they may, with reſpect to us, be looked upon as common mercies; tho' not the leſs valuable in themſelves on that account, nor the leſs demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our gratitude and praiſe to the Father of lights, from whom every good and perfect gift deſcendeth.</p>
            <p>IT is therefore propos'd, by divine aſſiſtance,</p>
            <p>FIRST, To repreſent to you, as particularly as the time will well allow, what thoſe bleſſings are, to give thanks to God for which, we are now aſſembled in his houſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:008192_0005_102E4972F6E6CB58"/>SECONDLY, I ſhall explain, and inculcate upon you, the duty of religious thankfulneſs for theſe mercies, And</p>
            <p>LASTLY, I ſhall preſs it upon you to live an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerably to the obligations which God has laid us under by beſtowing them upon us.</p>
            <p n="1">I. LET me repreſent to you, as particularly as is convenient, what thoſe bleſſings are, to give thanks to God for which, we are now aſſembled together. For unleſs we have ſome juſt and proper conception of theſe, it is impoſſible for us to be duly and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally thankful, or to give God the glory due unto his name on account of them.</p>
            <p>IN ſpeaking of theſe mercies, I ſhall not have occaſion, nor indeed would it be altogether proper, to go beyond his Excellency's proclamation, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing this day to be religiouſly obſerved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſpecifying the occaſion, or particular reaſons thereof. Now theſe various bleſſings may eaſily be reduced to, and ranged under, the following heads, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. THOSE which relate to the civil ſtate of the nation in general; as the preſervation of the Britiſh government, and of our rights and liberties; toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the happy proſpect we have of their being long continued to us.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. THOSE which relate particularly to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent war; or the ſucceſſes given to his Majeſty's arms, the laſt year, and to the arms of his royal and illuſtrious ally, the King of Pruſſia. And,</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:008192_0006_102E49B266A54B98"/>3dly. THOSE which relate more eſpecially to this province; as the fruitfulneſs of the paſt ſeaſon, and the general plenty and health, with which we have been favour'd.</p>
            <p>WHATEVER is mentioned in the Governor's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, as a ground for our religious rejoycing and thankfulneſs to God at this time, may, I ſuppoſe, naturally fall under one or the other of theſe heads. Let us proceed to a more diſtinct conſideration of them: tho' it is propoſed to enlarge chiefly on the ſecond.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. LET us conſider thoſe bleſſings which relate to the civil ſtate of the <note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>By</hi> the nation in general, <hi>are here intended,</hi> all Britiſh ſubjects.</note> nation in general; as the preſervation of the Britiſh government, and of our rights and liberties; together with the happy proſpect we have of their being long continued to us.</p>
            <p>THE bleſſings of this claſs are referred to in the former part of his Excellency's proclamation, where it is obſerved, that it <q>hath pleaſed the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of mercies to continue us in the enjoyment of many invaluable bleſſings,—to prolong the important life of our moſt gracious Sovereign; and to continue to us the proſpect of that invalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able bleſſing, the proteſtant ſucceſſion, in his royal houſe; to ſupport us in our civil and religious rights and liberties.</q> Theſe, tho' mentioned as mercies which we have long enjoyed, are neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, truly great; and ought, from time to time to be ſolemnly recognized by us as ſuch, eſpecially upon public occaſions like the preſent. The Britiſh go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and laws, by which the ſubject's life and liberty, his property and religion, are all ſo well
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:008192_0007_102E4976AF8EC248"/>
ſecured to him, are bleſſings, very extenſive in their nature, and will ever be accounted invaluable, by all who have a juſt conception of what the happineſs of civil ſociety conſiſts in; or who have really any religion, which they can reaſonably think themſelves bound in conſcience to practiſe. Indeed ſuch a free and happy form of government as the Britiſh, may poſſibly be diſreliſhed by abject minds, long tutor'd to ſervility, or blinded and infatuated by a horrid ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, the reverſe of all rational piety. However, theſe perſons are not exceptions to the above aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, having neither any proper notion of civil hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, nor any religion which a well-informed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience could poſſibly concern itſelf at all about, unleſs it were ſo far as to diſcard it with indignation. Whatever, ſlaves, and the blind votaries to ſuch a ſuperſtition, falſely called religion, may think; or however evil they may <q>ſpeak of thoſe things which they underſtand not,</q> wiſe, good and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced men, will always venerate ſuch a conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of government, thinking themſelves happy if they live under it, and if they do not, envying to thoſe that do, ſo diſtinguiſhing a priviledge.</p>
            <p>OF this free government, and of theſe laws, which, next to thoſe of the goſpel, may be juſtly termed "the laws of liberty", his preſent Majeſty has all along, from his firſt acceſſion to the throne, been a ſteady defender; being both a true proteſtant, and a friend to the natural rights of mankind, eſpecially to thoſe of his own ſubjects. For which reaſon it ought to be looked on as a great ſmile of heaven upon the nation, that his life has been lengthened out till he is now become old, and full of days. And tho' his good ſubjects cannot, without reluctance, think on that time, now near according to the uſual
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:008192_0008_102E49B3EB760D88"/>
courſe of nature, when their royal benefactor and father muſt ſubmit to the common law of mortality; yet we are in ſome meaſure relieved under the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly apprehenſion, by reflecting on his nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous poſterity, and ſeeing the ſucceſſion to the Britiſh throne, made as ſure as human laws can make it, in his royal and proteſtant houſe. I add proteſtant houſe, not only becauſe, by the act of ſettlement and ſucceſſion, none but a proteſtant can reign upon the Britiſh throne; but alſo, becauſe the happineſs of the nation, under God, eſſentially depends on being govern'd by ſuch a king; and this illuſtrious houſe has long diſtinguiſh'd itſelf by a well-regulated zeal for the proteſtant cauſe, in oppoſition to papal uſurpation.</p>
            <p>IT were next to madneſs to imagine, that the nation could ever be ſafe and happy under a roman catholic prince: Common ſenſe ſhows, that ſuch a one muſt needs think his power too much reſtrained by the laws of Britain; looking on which as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringement of the royal dignity, he would of courſe make frequent infractions on them; at leaſt as often, and perhaps oftener, than he could do it with ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to himſelf. Fact and experience are not wanting to confirm this obſervation. For the nation has formerly had melancholly experience of its truth, in at leaſt two princes of the Stewart race; whoſe arbitrary principles and practices, naturally, if not neceſſarily connected with their religion, plainly ſhew'd that one of the greateſt curſes righteous heaven can ſend upon Great Britain, is a romanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic King. While ſuch a King reigns, the moſt fundamental laws of the kingdom are no ſecurity to the ſubject, either with reſpect to liberty or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, religion or life; unleſs it be to popiſh ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects:
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:008192_0009_102E497A90BB10D8"/>
Who indeed may live, and increaſe, and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh abundantly, under that ſame baleful influence which blaſts all good men. And if God, in his good providence, had not delivered the nation from the contemptible, tho' royal race above-mentioned, it is not improbable, that we might at this very time have groaned under the iron ſcepter of a confirmed, lawleſs deſpotiſm, and the antichriſtian yoke of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious perſecution: Unleſs, perhaps, before this time all good proteſtants had been rooted out and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed; and ſo made a mighty addition to the ſouls which St. John ſaw under the altar; the ſouls of <q>them that were ſlain for the word of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and for the teſtimony which they held:</q> and which he heard <q>crying with a loud voice, ſaying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, doſt thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth<note n="†" place="bottom">Rev. 6.9, 10.</note>!</q>
            </p>
            <p>THESE things being briefly obſerved, I may leave you to judge, how great the bleſſing is, of having the life of a good proteſtant King, the Britiſh govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and with it our rights and liberties, ſecular and ſacred, preſerved to us; and this, while we have had ſo many enemies, at leaſt foreign ones, who would have rejoiced in depriving us of them.</p>
            <p>BUT let us now proceed to thoſe mercies which were above referred to another claſs; <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2dly. THOSE which relate to the preſent war; as the ſucceſſes given, the laſt year, to the arms of his Majeſty, and to the arms of his illuſtrious ally, the King of Pruſſia. Upon theſe, I ſhall be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more particular than on the former. They

hold the ſecond place in his Excellency's proclamation; where it is obſerved, That it hath pleaſed God <q>to give remarkable ſpirit to his Majeſty's counſels and reſolutions; and in divers inſtances to crown his wiſe and vigorous meaſures with ſucceſs; and to proſper the arms of his Majeſty's ally the King of Pruſſia, in ſupport of the proteſtant cauſe,</q> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>IT is manifeſt, notwithſtanding ſome ſtrange delays, defeats and diſgraces; (with a detail of which, the religious joy and gratitude of this day ought not to be damped) It is, I ſay, manifeſt, notwithſtanding theſe delays and diſgraces, that the war has been proſecuted the laſt year, on the part of Great Britain, with uncommon vigour; and that the advantages gained both by ſea and land, have been very conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable: So that, upon the whole, this has been, to us, a ſucceſsful campaign; and, in proportion, diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous, and a weakening to the enemy. Let us take a curſory view of the events of the war this year, and of the loſſes ſuſtained by the enemy, both by land and ſea. But minute circumſtances would not be thought worthy of a place here, tho' there were room for them.</p>
            <p>IF we begin with our ſucceſſes by land; It is to be obſerved, that his Majeſty's hereditary dominions on the continent have been reſcu'd out of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's hands, where they triumphed the year before, and committed ſuch barbarian havock and devaſtation. They have in their turn been beaten and routed there, with conſiderable loſs both of men, and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like ſtores: So that their laurels had but juſt bloomed, when they were ſuddenly withered, and the cypreſs ſucceeded them: Whereby was verified that antient obſervation, <q>That the triumphing of the wicked is ſhort, and the joy of the hypocrite but for a
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:008192_0011_102E497C14FB79A8"/>
moment; tho' his excellency mount up to the heavens, and his head reach unto the clouds<note n="†" place="bottom">Job XX. 5, 6.</note>.</q> And there is ſome reaſon at leaſt to hope, that the enemy will not ſoon be in a capacity to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves again maſters of that country, and repeat their brutal outrages, loudly complained of even by ſome of their own greateſt commanders<note n="*" place="bottom">Marſhal Belleiſle's Speech in Council, is here more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly alluded to.</note>.</p>
            <p>THERE have, moreover, been at leaſt two <note n="§" place="bottom">At St. Maloes and Cherbourg.</note> ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful deſcents made by Great Britain on the coaſts of France. In theſe the enemy have ſuſtained the loſs of ſome conſiderable magazines, ſeveral fortreſſes, many cannon, and military ſtores; all amounting to a large value: And were likewiſe obliged, by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther large ſum, to ranſom one of their cities, or fortified towns. Theſe events are not a little in our favour; to ſay nothing of the conſtant alarms on the French coaſts the laſt year, with the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences thereof; or the ſecurity enjoyed on the coaſts of Britain. It may be added, that theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcents would doubtleſs have proved of ſtill more pernicious conſequence to the enemy than they have, tho' leſs honourable to the Britiſh General, had not his noble breaſt been full of that compaſſion, that humanity and generoſity, to which ſome of the French commanders, under the like circumſtances, have ſhown themſelves ſtrangers<note n="‡" place="bottom">Witneſs, particularly, the Maſſacre after the Surrender of Fort William-Henry to Monſ. Montealm, and the ſigning of the Capitulation.</note>.</p>
            <p>ON the weſtern coaſts of Affrica ſeveral forts have been taken from the enemy, together with one
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:008192_0012_102E49B937529518"/>
of their important ſettlements<note n="†" place="bottom">Senegal.</note>; whereby, it is ſaid, great treaſures have fallen into the hands of the captors. And, by what we have hitherto learn'd, this conqueſt may probably prove eventually of very great advantage to Great Britain, and at leaſt equally detrimental to the commerce and intereſt of France.</p>
            <p>AS to the Eaſt Indies; our accounts from thence, ſeem to be quite vague and uncertain at beſt, if not contradictory. So that we can ſay nothing particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly or poſitively concerning the ſtate of affairs in Aſia, with reſpect to the war; or whether we, or our enemies, have been ſucceſsful in thoſe diſtant parts. Let us therefore come to America.</p>
            <p>AND here the very ſtrong, and at leaſt equally important city and fortreſs of the enemy on Cape Breton, have ſurrender'd to his Majeſty's arms, where a prodigious quantity of artillery, ſmall-arms, and military ſtores of all kinds, fell into our hands. In conſequence of which acquiſition, obtained with an inconſiderable loſs of Britiſh troops, all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendencies of Louisbourg, have been ſurrender'd; and many thouſands of the enemy ſent out of America, where their continuance might have proved of very pernicious conſequence. I might add, that hereby the enemy have in effect loſt, not only their great fiſhery, but the key of Canada; on which ſome of their more ſouthern forts and ſettlements are dependent. It would have been proper to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large on the importance of this acquiſition, and the very favourable circumſtances attending it had I not lately done this ſo particularly, on the day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the government to acknowledge the great goodneſs of God on account hereof.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:008192_0013_102E497EA42A7028"/>HIS majeſty's forces have alſo, the ſummer paſt, taken poſſeſſion of the river, and adjacent country, of St. John's, in the bay of Funda: Of the great conſequence of which to them, and to their views in America, the French were ſo fully appriſed, that according to their wonted policy and good faith, they ſeiſed, and fortified thereon, ſeveral years ago, in a time of profound peace. They were indeed forced by ſome Britiſh troops, about two years ſince, to abandon, and, as ſome ſay, to demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh the fortreſs which they had erected there. But till this year we had not fortified, nor done any thing which could well be called taking poſſeſſion of the place: Both which being now done, it may be reaſonably hoped, that the future poſſeſſion of that important river and fine country, are effectually ſecured to his Britannic majeſty, to whom, of right, they unqueſtionably belonged before.</p>
            <p>IN addition to what has already been mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it muſt be obſerved, that a fortreſs of great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, uſually called Frontinac, at the entrance of the great river St. Lawrence on the lake ſide, has been reduced to ſurrender to a body of his majeſty's troops, chiefly provincial irregulars. This acquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be reckoned very conſiderable in divers reſpects<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in reſpect of the ſtrength of the fortreſs itſelf; of its ſituation; of the vaſt quantity of ſtores, proviſions, arms, and other riches found therein; in reſpect of the little loſs of men in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and laſtly, in reſpect of the critical conjunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture wherein it was made. For we are aſſured, that a conſiderable body of the enemy were at that time actually in motion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to proceed againſt the weſtern part of New-York government; depending wholly upon this place for proviſions, and other ſtores, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:008192_0014_102E49BCD3CB69D0"/>
for the undertaking. So that their whole deſign, which, had they proceeded, might have proved of very bad conſequence to us, was at once fruſtrated, by the very opportune reduction of this fortreſs. Hereby alſo, it is at leaſt probable, the enemy in ſeveral other places to the ſouthward and weſtward, as well as the ſavages in their alliance, were diſappointed of thoſe ſupplies, which they very much needed. How favourable, therefore, was the providence, by which this fortreſs was reduced and diſmantled, if not entirely demoliſhed? eſpecially, when we add, that this was effected almoſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the loſs of any lives on our ſide; or, as ſome confidently affirm, without a ſingle one?</p>
            <p>Theſe, my brethren, are ſome of the ſucceſſes which, by the bleſſing of God on his majeſty's arms, we have had by land, in the courſe of the year paſt. As a ballance to which, the enemy can pretend to none againſt us; I ſay, as a ballance to them; for ſome ſucceſſes they have doubtleſs had. But they have taken none of our fortreſſes, that we know of; they have made no deſcents on our coaſts; they have made a conqueſt of no place; they have obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no conſiderable victory. Though it muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, that they repulſed, by ſome means or other, and with loſs to us, what might be looked on as a very formidable army in America, coming againſt them<note place="bottom">At Lake George, near Ticonderoga.</note>. It muſt likewiſe be confeſſed that, with the aſſiſtance of their good friends and bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, the ſavages, they have cut the throats of ſome men, and of great numbers of poor women and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, on the frontiers of the ſouthern colonies. But how much ſoever they may be diſpoſed to glory and triumph in theſe heroic exploits, it may be
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:008192_0015_102E49859241ACF0"/>
queſtioned whether even they could, without bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, pretend to make them near equivalent to the advantages obtained againſt them; tho' they have foreheads, in ſuch reſpects, inferior to thoſe of no nation under heaven.</p>
            <p>BUT, if you pleaſe, we will now take a brief view of our ſucceſſes by ſea the laſt year; and of what the enemy have ſuffer'd in their naval power and commerce.</p>
            <p>AND, if I miſtake not, it is computed that in the Mediterranean, on the coaſt of Africa, in the bay of Biſcay, in the Engliſh channel, in the Weſt-Indies, and at the ſiege and ſurrender of Louiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg, the royal navy of France has ſuſtained the loſs of about thirty ſhips, greater and leſs, the year paſt: Some of them capital ones, and much the greater part of which, not having been deſtroyed, have been added to the royal navy of Great-Britain. A heavy loſs, indeed, to them, which affects them in the tendereſt point; and of great conſequence to us. And under this head of what the royal navy of France has ſuffered, I may juſt mention the capture and deſtruction of all her armed veſſels on lake Ontario, in the very ſucceſsful expedition againſt Frontinac<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſpoken of above. The enemy's loſs of theſe veſſels of war, and with them, of their uſurped dominion of that lake, is not trivial to them, conſidering the preſent ſituation of their affairs in America; and eſpecially the importance, or rather neceſſity, of their having a free and ſafe communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation between Canada and Niagara, the Ohio, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>BUT what has been already mentioned is by no means the whole, if indeed it may be juſtly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:008192_0016_102E49BF623ED498"/>
the greater part, of our maritime ſucceſs, and of the enemy's loſſes, the laſt year. Their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate ſhips of war, taken and deſtroyed in this time, are vaſtly more numerous, than thoſe of the king; ſo numerous, that I cannot pretend to make any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable conjecture about them.</p>
            <p>AND ſtill vaſtly more numerous than both theſe together, have been the captures made of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's tranſport, ſtore and common merchant-ſhips; eſpecially if we include thoſe taken and deſtroyed in the deſcents made on the coaſt of France; in one of which only, conſiderably more than a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſail fell into our hands; at leaſt, were wholly loſt to the enemy.</p>
            <p>IN theſe, almoſt innumerable captures, the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my have loſt immenſe treaſure and riches, which have been brought into Great-Britain and her colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. The effects of which in France are viſible enough, in the multiplied bankruptcies of her mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants; in the ſcarcity of money, even in the royal funds and coffers; in the height of intereſt and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance; in the ſtagnation of trade and buſineſs, and in the conſequent diſcontent, and murmurs, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of the people. The effects hereof are alſo apparent enough in Great-Britain, and moſt of her colonies and plantations, in the wealth of her mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants; in the plenty of money found for public uſes; in the lowneſs of intereſt and inſurance; in the flouriſhing ſtate of trade and buſineſs; and the conſequent general eaſineſs, contentment, unanimity and ſpirit, of the people of all ranks. It muſt in ſhort be acknowledged by all, who are not ſceptical to a great degree, that the commerce of France, on which depend her chief ſtrength and reſources, is
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:008192_0017_102E498718E2D1B0"/>
reduced to a low ebb, and daily decreaſing. For not being able to ſecure and defend her trade, it is either blocked up in port, or falls into the hands of the royal navy, and private cruiſers, of Great-Britain and her dependencies. On the other hand, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the great ſuperiority of our naval power, and our late maritime ſucceſſes, our trade in general is in a very flouriſhing condition; and both the private merchant, and the public, enjoy almoſt all the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of a free, extenſive and gainful commerce.</p>
            <p>IT is not, however, pretended that Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and her colonies have ſuſtained no loſſes by ſea the year paſt, eſpecially of merchant-men. Many of them have fallen into the enemy's hands; and even two or three of theKing's ſmaller ſhips, I think, have had the ſame deſtiny; which, without a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, could hardly have been otherwiſe. But (which is the only thing inſiſted on, and which will not, I preſume, be denied) our maritime loſſes ſtill bear no proportion, or but a very ſmall one, to thoſe of the enemy. And it is probable that the naval pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Great-Britain, and the number of her mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant-ſhips, are now, both abſolutely and relatively greater, than at the beginning of the year: Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, as their ſtrength and number are increaſed on the whole, inſtead of being leſſened, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding her loſſes: And relatively, as there is now a much greater diſproportion between her ſhipping and navy, and that of France, than there was at that time. The latter is indiſputably true<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And the former is equally certain, at leaſt ſo far as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the royal navy.</p>
            <p>FROM this curſory and imperfect review of the military events of the laſt year, (for it is with events
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:008192_0018_102E49C307A5AC10"/>
that I chiefly concern myſelf) it appears that God, whoſe dominion extends equally over the mighty waters, and the dry land, has proſpered the Britiſh arms on either element; and to ſuch a degree, all circumſtances being conſidered, that our proſpects with regard to the preſent war are now much more favourable and promiſing, than they have ever before been ſince the commencement of it.</p>
            <p>HOWEVER, we cannot ſo well form a judgment reſpecting this point, conſidering the preſent cloſe connexion between the courts of London and Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin, without taking into conſideration the ſucceſſes, with which his <note n="*" place="bottom">However various the opinions of people may be reſpecting the advantage or diſadvantage of continental connexions, to Great-Britain; yet there is certainly one thing wherein they muſt all be united: That while ſuch connexions ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually ſubſiſt, Great-Britain is nearly concerned and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted in all the ſucceſſes of her allies.</note> Pruſſian majeſty has been ſavour'd the laſt year; which, you are ſenſible are partly the occaſion of our preſent rejoicing; ſo that in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, I do not deviate from the proper buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the day; and therefore need make no apology.</p>
            <p>INDEED if we only compared his Pruſſian Majeſty's dominions, and the number of his troops, with thoſe of his confederated enemies, who ſeem to have joint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vowed his deſtruction, it might appear as if he had been ſufficiently happy and ſucceſsful, not to ſay triumphant, meerly by defending himſelf againſt them, and not falling, long ago, a ſacrifice to their reſentment. But not ſo, if we conſider either the character of this Prince, or the righteous cauſe, partly the cauſe of religious liberty, wherein he has drawn
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:008192_0019_102E49889E52F080"/>
his ſword. Theſe things, under the providence and government of God, might ſeem to promiſe other ſucceſſes and triumphs, than merely thoſe of not being ſwallowed up &amp; deſtroyed, even by ſuch numerous and potent enemies. And had we formed very ſanguine hopes of this ſort, we ſee by the event, that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven would not have fruſtrated them. For God has, in divers inſtances proſpered the arms of his Pruſſian Majeſty the laſt year paſt. To paſs over his other leſs conſiderable, tho' not inconſiderable ſucceſſes, you are ſenſible he has obtain'd a very ſignal victory over the Ruſſian army, much ſuperior in number to his own, and commanded by a general, inferior, perhaps, to but few of the preſent age. This conqueſt, according to our lateſt accounts, was ſo deciſive and compleat, and attended with ſuch a prodigious ſlaughter of the mercenary and uncivilized, the rapacious, bloody, and almoſt barbarous enemy, that it is not ſo properly called a victory over the Ruſſian army, as the total ruin and deſtruction of it.</p>
            <p>IN conſequence of this deciſive victory, (if I do not ſeem to leſſen the event by calling it by that name) his majeſty [the King of Pruſſia] was left at liberty and leiſure to turn his arms againſt his other enemies, particularly the French and Auſtrians; and to reinforce his generals with victorious troops, or rather with his own royal preſence, more powerful and efficacious than many thouſands. His enemies ſtill remaining in the field, after this memorable ſucceſs, were indeed very numerous and powerful: Nor do we know how the year's campaign ended with this great Commander, if it be yet ended. For we are ſpeaking of a Commander, to whom all ſeaſons ſeem to be alike, and with whom the beginning and end
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:008192_0020_102E49C69B407890"/>
of a year, and of a campaign, are almoſt the ſame thing. And what may not be reaſonably expected, at leaſt hoped for, from a Monarch ſo truly <hi>Great;</hi> not by the united ſuffrages and ſenſeleſs adorations of 18 million ſlaves, long diſciplin'd to crouch, and annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late themſelves before lawleſs power; but <hi>Great</hi> by his own perſonal actions and virtues? What may not be hoped for from One, who poſſeſſes almoſt all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man accompliſhments, eſpecially the virtues military and heroic, in the higheſt degree of perfection? What may not be hoped for from a Prince, ſo viſibly upheld by providence, to vindicate the rights of mankind againſt the invaſions of tyranny, and the uſurpations of the papal ſee? What, not hoped for from One, by whom heaven has, for a courſe of years, not only wrought wonders, but ſeemed to delight therein, tho' ſtill without miracle? In fine, What not hoped from a Prince, whom God ſeems to have raiſed up, on purpoſe that in him he <q>might make his power known, and that his name might be declared thro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all the earth?</q> tho' in a far different ſenſe than this is ſaid of Pharaoh, the great Egyptian mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, and oppreſſor of the people of God.—Not, that he might ſhew his power in his down-fall and deſtruction; but in his ſalvation, in his victories, and triumphs over ſuch numerous and potent enemies, leagued againſt him, and that righteous cauſe of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the <q>liberty wherewith Chriſt has made us free,</q> which he has aſſerted in oppoſition to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian uſurpation. It would have ſome affinity to infidelity and atheiſm, not to hope from ſuch a Prince, ingaged in ſuch a cauſe, and hitherto ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported and ſucceeded by divine providence in ſuch a wonderful manner, what it might be criminal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, or at beſt fooliſh credulity, to expect from another, of different talents and deſigns, or to whom,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:008192_0021_102E498D61775E18"/>
if I may ſo expreſs it, God had not given ſimilar atteſtations and credentials of his approbation, and preſence with him.</p>
            <p>BUT not to digreſs too far; and to come more directly to the buſineſs of the day, we may juſtly look upon all the ſucceſſes and victories of his Pruſſian Majeſty as our own, conſidering the alliance ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between our own Sovereign and him, and one common cauſe (tho' not the only) wherein they have unſheathed the ſword. The advantage is truly ours, for this good reaſon; his Pruſſian Majeſty's enemies are, in effect, ours. But tho' the benefit redound to us in part, the honour is his own; or rather it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to God, whoſe is the <q>victory and the majeſty.</q> However, the more Heaven favours the deſigns and enterprizes of this illuſtrious Prince, the more cauſe of thankfulneſs we have; and the better proſpect of ſeeing the preſent war brought to a happy concluſion. And if the ſame right hand of the Moſt High, which has hitherto been revealed, and made manifeſt in his protection and conqueſts, ſhould ſtill be made bare for him; and unleſs affairs ſhould take a very different turn from the preſent, with reſpect to the Britiſh councils and arms, we may, I humbly conceive, after another campaign, rationally hope for peace with France on more advantageous terms than we have long enjoyed it, even than we had it by the treaty of Utrecht.</p>
            <p>BUT ſtill I muſt remind you, tho' you are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably aware of it, that there is almoſt infinite uncertainty in all judgments formed on ſuch-like matters, tho' formed on preſent appearances. They are grounded at bottom on precarious hypotheſes; on ſuppoſitions that ſome things will continue as
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:008192_0022_102E49C81F20EAF8"/>
they are, or have been, without any material alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; or that they will be ſo and ſo; which things being quite contingent as to us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all opinions grounded on them, eſpecially reſpecting remote events, muſt of conſequence be infinitely precarious, amounting to ſcarce more than conjectures, or gueſſes in the dark. Many things may intervene, before the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of a peace, which may put another face on affairs, and intirely fruſtrate our hopes reſpecting it, tho' they ſhould not be wholly without foundation. There may poſſibly be a ſudden change in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, as much for the worſe, as a late one was for the better; than which there can ſcarce be a greater or more apparent. The Spaniard may quite forſake his nutrality, of which, by ſome things, he has indeed ſeemed a little weary already. Our old money-loving friends, the Dutch, may perhaps act more openly and avowedly againſt us, tho' they cannot do it more really than they have long done, by ſupplying our French enemies with proviſions and military ſtores, and treacherouſly carrying on their trade for them, in their own bottoms and names: Or other nations may riſe up againſt us, and join our enemies. Famine, or peſtilence, or both, may be ſent to ſcourge us. Our fleets and navies may ſuffer ſhipwreck in a ſtorm of God's indignation, like the formidable Armada. Our armies may be waſted with mortal diſeaſe; and become leſs terrible to the enemy, in reſpect of their ſtrength and valor, than of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion attending them: Or they may poſſibly, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, have traiterous, weak, or puſillanimous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders; by whoſe authority, enforced by the moſt powerful motive, their own example, they may "flee when no man purſueth them". I ſay, there is a poſſibility of this, hereafter; for it might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps give offence to ſome, if I ſaid that any thing
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:008192_0023_102E498FED18EFE8"/>
ſimilar to it had actually happened during the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent war. But I cannot but juſt mention it as an happy omen, that there is a gentleman <note n="†" place="bottom">His Excellency Major General Amherſt.</note> appointed to the chief military command here in America, the chief ſeat and object of the preſent war, whoſe mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary qualifications and character are ſo well eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; partly, by his prudent and ſucceſsful conduct in the late ſiege of Louisbourg. Nor would you, I am perſuaded, think me enthuſiaſtic, if I added—a gentleman who, as fame reports, has merited, and thereby had an opportunity of improving in the art of war, under the heroe and wonder of his age, the King of Pruſſia: For who can help conceiving the higheſt expectations from a great military genius, cultivated in the ſchool, and amid ſcenes of war, under a maſter, on whoſe ſtandards victory has been ſo long accuſtomed to wait? However,</p>
            <p>FROM the hints above you will all ſee, and the moſt would doubtleſs ſee without them, how very uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain all the events of war are, tho' we ſhould ground our opinion and hopes on preſent appearances, and the moſt rational probabilities. And now, leaving future events with Him, who only knows, as He only determines them; and acknowledging with gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude what he has already done for us, reſpecting the preſent war; let us proceed, according to the method propoſed under the firſt general head of diſcourſe,</p>
            <p n="3">3dly and laſtly, TO mention very briefly, thoſe mercies and bleſſings which relate more particularly to this province; the fruitfulneſs of the paſt ſeaſon; the general plenty and health, with which we have been favour'd. For, as it is expreſſed in his Excellency's
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:008192_0024_102E49C9A2DC4548"/>
proclamation, <q>The ſummer paſt has been remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably fruitful, and the productions of the country have been ſo greatly increaſed, that not only our own wants have been ſupplied, but we have been enabled to furniſh his Majeſty's forces, both by ſea and land, with neceſſary proviſions and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: And in moſt parts we have been bleſſed with health.</q>
            </p>
            <p>WE could never with more, probably never with ſo much propriety, as we may at preſent, adopt the language of the Pſalmiſt, ſaying in humble and grateful acknowledgment of the divine goodneſs— <q>Thou haſt viſited the earth, and watered it; thou haſt greatly enriched it with the river of God which is full of water. Thou haſt watered the ridges thereof abundantly: thou haſt ſettled the furrows thereof: thou haſt made it ſoft with ſhowers; thou haſt bleſſed the ſpringing thereof. Thou haſt crowned the year with thy goodneſs, and thy paths have dropped fatneſs. They have dropped upon the paſtures of the wilderneſs; and the little hills rejoiced on every ſide. The paſtures were cloathed with flocks; the valleys alſo were covered over with corn; they ſhouted for joy, they alſo ſung<note n="†" place="bottom">Pſal. 65.9.—</note>.</q>

            <p>THE country, (I mean in contradiſtinction from the maritime towns, and particularly from this capital) The country, I ſay, has not only been ſupplied, but even enriched, by the plentiful pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce of this year. It has enjoyed an abundance with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in itſelf; which, at the ſame time, has overflowed to diſtant places. Great quantities of proviſions have been ſent to his Majeſty's fleet and armies: by which
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:008192_0025_102E4992A349C870"/>
means, we have not only been enabled to help for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the military operations, and common cauſe, in which we have a very particular intereſt; but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable wealth has been brought into the country; I might properly ſay, into the community. Becauſe this is really a common benefit; eſpecially in a time of war, a proportionable part of the expence of which we ought doubtleſs to bear, and have always, to ſay the leaſt, done that. For this purpoſe, to ſay nothing of any others, monies muſt be levied and raiſed from time to time; and what is brought in by the exports of the country's produce, will of courſe circulate; at leaſt a conſiderable part thereof, however deſirous many individuals may be of hoard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. In this reſpect, a plentiful produce of the earth ought to be accounted a common benefit. Beſides; this of courſe cauſeth a plenty, not only of bread, the ſtaff of life; but alſo of animal food, and many other things to the advantage of all in general, and not only of the husbandman. For tho' the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman primarily reaps the benefit hereof, and perhaps principally; yet you know that all others, from the higheſt to the loweſt, are <q>ſerved by the field.</q> The citizen, the merchant and tradeſman, all find the advantage of a plentiful ſeaſon, in the proportionably lower price of proviſions, and the neceſſaries of life. This is at leaſt generally, if not univerſally, true. For tho' the maritime towns, and this in particular, have not, perhaps, ſo fully and clearly perceived this advantage of the laſt year's plenty, by reaſon of the great exports; yet a little reflection would ſhow them, that under the like peculiar circumſtances calling for ſuch exportation, a year of ſcarcity muſt needs have raiſed the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries of life to a price, far beyond what they have been at the ſummer paſt, or are at preſent. So that
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:008192_0026_102E49CC7A274888"/>
it is certain, whether they clearly ſee it or not, that they actually reap the mentioned advantage of a plentiful produce; tho' probably, not in ſo great a degree as the husbandman. All of us therefore, without exception, are bound in reaſon to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the goodneſs of God to us in this reſpect.</p>
            <p>AS to the general health enjoyed thro' the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince; this is ſo evident, and ſo manifeſtly a great bleſſing, that it were needleſs to enlarge upon it. Health is the foundation of all other natural enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in general; ſo neceſſary in order to our tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral felicity, that without it we muſt be unhappy, even in the boſom of plenty. Sickneſs diſqualifies for action; not only for bodily labours, but thoſe of the mind alſo, by reaſon of this ſtrange union and ſympathy between fleſh and ſpirit. It palls every ſenſe and appetite; and if we conſider ourſelves only in our worldly and temporal capacity, leaves a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

            <p>IN the morning I recounted to you, as particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly as the time would well admit, thoſe mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and bleſſings, on account of which we this day enter into the courts of our God with praiſe. Theſe mercies were conſidered in the order follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>FIRST, Thoſe which relate to the civil ſtate of the nation in general.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="unknown:008192_0029_102E4998CFB316B8"/>THEN, Thoſe which relate particularly to the war; or the ſucceſſes granted, the laſt year, to his Majeſty's arms, and alſo to the Pruſſian:</p>
            <p>AND LASTLY, Thoſe mercies which relate more particularly to this Province; as the uncommon fruitfulneſs of the paſt ſeaſon, and the general plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and health, with which we have been favour'd.</p>
            <p>IT doubtleſs becomes us to make a grateful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to almighty God for theſe great and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold expreſſions of his loving-kindneſs: It is a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord, and <q>praiſe is comely for the upright.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I AM now therefore, in the ſecond place, by divine aſſiſtance, and according to the method propoſed,</p>
            <p n="2">II. TO explain, and inculcate upon you, the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of religious thankfulneſs for the mercies which have been repreſented to you. And this preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes and implies in it various things; more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially theſe which follow;</p>
            <p>THAT we have a proper ſenſe of their greatneſs and importance, conſidered in themſelves;</p>
            <p>THAT we acknowledge God, who ruleth in the kingdom of men, and whoſe providence governs all things, as the author of them:</p>
            <p>THAT we are ſenſible, they were undeſerved by us, and therefore flow from His mere favour, or free grace:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="unknown:008192_0030_102E49D30894DA88"/>THAT our hearts are raiſed up to God, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of them, in the exerciſe of devout affection, or internal bleſſing and praiſe: And laſtly,</p>
            <p>THAT we expreſs theſe grateful ſentiments of our hearts, by the external acts of bleſſing the name of the Lord, and ſinging his praiſes.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. RELIGIOUS thankfulneſs for theſe mercies, ſuppoſes that we have ſome proper ſenſe of their greatneſs and importance, conſidered in themſelves. As no perſon can, in the nature of the thing, be thankful, or even joyful, on account of what he does not eſteem as a real good, or benefit; ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can any one be thankful or joyful to the degree which he ought to be, unleſs his ſenſe and eſteem of the ſuppoſed benefit ariſes in proportion to the greatneſs, or is adequate to the true nature thereof. As far as he undervalues any bleſſing; as much as his eſteem thereof falls ſhort of being commenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate to its proper worth; ſo far he muſt neceſſarily fall ſhort of that gratitude which he owes to his benefactor. For that good which is not perceived by us is, to us, as nothing, however great it may be ſuppoſed in itſelf. And of conſequence, the author of it will be defrauded, in part at leaſt, of thoſe grateful returns from us, which are due to him. This will hold equally true, whether we ſpeak of an human, or of our Divine benefactor.</p>
            <p>YOU ought therefore, my brethren, ſeriouſly to revolve in your minds the ſeveral benefits and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings which have been enumerated to you; to conſider how manifold, how great, they are; and to gain a proper idea of their value. Without
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:008192_0031_102E499A53B808E0"/>
thus meditating upon them, till you perceive their true worth and importance, you will at beſt only offer the ſacrifice of a crude, unruminated praiſe; at leaſt as unworthy as "the lame or the blind." And in order to your having a juſt ſenſe of the greatneſs and value of theſe mercies, one of the moſt certain and effectual ways will be, to reflect how unhappy we ſhould have been without them; or if inſtead of enjoying them, the contrary evils had befallen us. Conſider, for example, how mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable we ſhould have been, if inſtead of having the life of a good proteſtant King preſerved to us; if inſtead of having the Britiſh laws and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and our civil and religious liberties, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued as they are; that good King had been taken away, and a bad one ſucceeded him; (eſpecially the worſt, a thorough Roman-catholic, whoſe evil conſcience, whatever he might ſwear to the <hi>contrary,</hi> would ſtill oblige him to diſtreſs, if not to deſtroy, his proteſtant ſubjects — for the good of their ſouls!) if the free and happy government of Great-Britain had been overturned, and arbitrary ſway, and papal tyranny, had been eſtabliſhed in its room. Had this been the caſe, you muſt needs be ſenſible how wretched we ſhould have been. And this reflection will help you to form a juſt idea of the greatneſs of the beforementioned bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, which are ſtill continued to us; and of the future enjoyment of which, we have ſo favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a proſpect in his Majeſty's royal Houſe.</p>
            <p>AGAIN: If we had obtained none of thoſe mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary ſucceſſes by ſea or land, which have been enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merated; but theſe advantages had all been on the ſide of our enemies; if the enemy had made ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſucceſsful deſcents on Britain, and taken divers
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:008192_0032_102E49D491314E60"/>
of our fortreſſes; if our magazines had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed with prodigious ſtores; had we loſt one of our valuable ſettlements, and ſome place of as much importance to us, as Louiſbourg was to France; had his Pruſſian majeſty been ſwallowed up, inſtead of being victorious; had our marine ſuffered as much as the enemy's has done; had the royal navy of Britain ſuſtained ſo great a loſs; had her private ſhips of war been taken and deſtroyed in ſuch numbers; had her merchant-ſhips been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by the ſcore, or the hundred, in her ports, and ſuch vaſt numbers beſides, taken in different parts of the world; had ſuch immenſe treaſure been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from her, as ſhe has taken from the enemy; were near twenty thouſand of her ſeamen priſoners, without any proſpect of a ſpeedy redemption; in fine, had her commerce been almoſt ruined, and that of France in the ſame flouriſhing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition with ours; if theſe events had taken place, I ſay, ſurely you cannot be inſenſible of the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly, diſtreſſed ſituation we ſhould now have been in; and conſequently, cannot but ſee what a great mercy it is to us, that things have been o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe ordered; and that the Britiſh arms have been proſpered to the degree they have.</p>
            <p>AGAIN: If inſtead of ſo fruitful a ſeaſon as the paſt, this had been a year of drought; if inſtead of the great plenty of moſt of the neceſſaries of life among us, there had been ſcarcity and famine; if inſtead of the general health enjoyed, peſtilence, or other mortal diſeaſes had prevailed; if theſe events had taken place, I need not ſay, but only leave you to judge, how unhappy our condition had been. Which reflection, will at the ſame time ſhew you, how great the beforementioned bleſſings are; which
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:008192_0033_102E499BD75A9F58"/>
is the firſt thing neceſſary in order to your being duly thankful for them.</p>
            <p>NOW it is plain, that we might have been left deſtitute of all the mercies which we have enjoyed; and not only ſo, but have experienced all the evils and calamities which are the reverſe of them. And the ultimate, if not the only reaſon, which can be aſſigned why theſe evils, inſtead of thoſe bleſſings, have not come upon us and the nation, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God was pleaſed to order events to be as they are. Which brings me to the ſecond particular mentioned above; namely,</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. THAT in order to our being religiouſly thankful for theſe great bleſſings, we muſt be ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that they are beſtowed on us by God, who ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in the kingdom of men, and whoſe providence ſuperintends all things. That gratitude which is properly called religious, has God alone for its ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and terminates on him in diſtinction from all means and inſtruments, as the ſupreme Author of the good, for which we are thankful. It implies a contradiction to ſuppoſe, that we can be duly thankful for any bleſſings we enjoy, unleſs we firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe the over-ruling providence of God, by which events are brought to paſs; and unleſs, in our thoughts, we refer them ultimately to him. Nor, indeed, is there any reaſon why we ſhould be thankful to him, even for the greateſt bleſſings we enjoy, on any other ſuppoſition than this, that his kingdom ruleth over all; that he is truly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly the author of theſe bleſſings. If he were not, you would be under no more obligation to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for them to Jehovah, than to the Aegyptian bull, or the golden calves ſet up in Dan and Bethel. All religious gratitude ſuppoſes in the very notion
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:008192_0034_102E49D9689DEF18"/>
of it, that the good for which we are thankful, is the effect of God's goodneſs and power, and that it accrues to us by the diſpoſitions of his providence. From hence it is apparent, that tho' you have ever ſo juſt and thorough a ſenſe of the value of thoſe mercies which have been repreſented to you; yet unleſs you are fully perſuaded that God governs the world, and all things that are therein, and that he has beſtowed theſe mercies on us, you can, in no proper ſenſe, be thankful to him for them. You may indeed, without this, be glad, and heartily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiced on account of them, or thankful to thoſe perſons who have been inſtrumental of good to the public, wherein you have a ſhare: But neither of theſe things is religious gratitude; neither thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to man, nor joy on account of any proſperous events; tho' the former of them may, and the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of them neceſſarily muſt, attend it.</p>
            <p>BUT not to digreſs: Let me inculcate it upon you as a moſt certain truth, demonſtrable, if any thing is ſo, by human reaſon, as well as the plain doctrine of divine revelation, and a truth which ſhould ever be in our thoughts; that this world is under the government, not of blind chance, or fate, or men, or good, or evil ſpirits; but of that eternal, infinite, and omnipreſent Spirit, to whom it owes its exiſtence. It is God's world; he upholds, he rules, he controuls it, and in ſome way or other, perhaps inconceivable by us, actually orders and determines the events of it; and that with ſuch preciſion, that neither a "ſparrow falls to the ground, nor a "lot is caſt into the lap," without him. All ſubordinate beings or agents, who are concerned in bringing about any events, any changes or revolutions in this lower world, whether proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous or adverſe to us, are his agents, his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:008192_0035_102E499D60710208"/>
all "fulfilling his pleaſure." He is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be acknowledged as the ſupreme, ultimate cauſe of all theſe events. By him, his power and wiſdom, kings reign, and princes decree juſtice: He pulleth down one kingdom, and ſetteth up another. The horſe is prepared for the battle, but ſafety is of the Lord. He giveth rain from heaven, and fruitful ſeaſons, filling our hearts with food and gladneſs. — <q>Thine, O Lord, is the greatneſs, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majeſty: for all that is in the heaven and in the earth is thine; thine is the kingdom, O Lord, and thou art exalted as head above all. Both riches and honor come of thee, and thou reigneſt over all, and in thine hand is power and might, and in thine hand it is to make great, and to give ſtrength unto all.</q> Unleſs we ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely aſſent to the truth and propriety of theſe words of inſpiration, we cannot, whatever bleſſings we enjoy, properly adopt thoſe which immediately follow, — "Now <hi>therefore,</hi> our God, we <hi>thank Thee,</hi> and praiſe thy glorious name<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Chron. 29.11, 12, 13.</note>." It is mere trifling and impertinence, not piety in us, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in this place upon this occaſion, unleſs we firmly believe the governing providence of God, according to the repreſentations of ſcripture: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is impoſſible we ſhould be religiouſly thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for the mercies we enjoy, however great they are in themſelves, without thus referring them all to Him, "of whom, and thro' whom, and to whom are all things." But</p>
            <p n="3">3dly, IT is requiſite in order to our being duly thankful for theſe mercies, that we are ſenſible we were undeſerving of them, and conſequently that they flow from the free grace, and mere bounty of God towards us. And indeed, if you conſider
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:008192_0036_102E49DD0739BB40"/>
the matter with any attention, you will perceive that gratitude, whether to God, or any other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in the very nature of it, ſuppoſes him to have done a favour to us, ſome act of kindneſs or grace, as diſtinguiſhed from juſtice. For we cannot, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſpeaking, thank any one for doing an act of mere juſtice, however advantageous it may be to us; or be thankful to him any farther than he has dealt by us in a way of bounty, and done what, in point of mere equity, he was under no obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to do. Thus far, and only thus far, we may, in propriety of language, be thankful. So that it is not ſufficient for us to acknowledgeGod as the real, ſupreme author of the before mentioned bleſſings, in order to our being grateful to him; it is more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over neceſſary that we are ſenſible, they flow from his bounty; that we had no claim to them, founded in righteouſneſs and equity, but that they might have been with held from us without injury or injuſtice. And that this is true in fact, cannot be denied on the principles of religion, or even on thoſe of reaſon and common ſenſe: <q>For who hath firſt given unto him? and it ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſed to him again.</q> Not even the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and holy angels of heaven have done ſo; and therefore, are under obligation to thank God for their being, and all the happy circumſtances that have attended it from firſt to laſt.</p>
            <p>BUT WE are in a further and higher ſenſe obliged to acknowledge that all the bleſſings we enjoy, flow from God's free Grace, or undeſerved good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. For we have not only, not merited them by any thing we have done; but were obnoxious to his juſt diſpleaſure, and the effects thereof, by ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning againſt him. So that he might in perfect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence with equity, not only have withheld all
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:008192_0037_102E49A1FA2E1AA0"/>
theſe bleſſings from us, but viſited our iniquities with all the oppoſite evils; yea, with far more terrible ones, not only in this world, but in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Surely, neither we, nor the nation in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, are ſo righteous before God, that he was bound in juſtice to confer theſe bleſſings on us: Would to him! we were not ſo unrighteous, that he might, without any imputation on the equity of his providence, have brought on us the moſt grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous calamities, as he might unqueſtionably have done. Since, therefore, God has not dealt with us according to our ſins, nor rewarded us according to our iniquities; but beſtowed on us ſo many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuable mercies, we are obliged in all ſenſe and reaſon to own, that they are the effects of his mere grace and favour. Nor is it poſſible we ſhould be duly thankful to him for theſe bleſſings, as ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful creatures ought to be, without taking into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration our unworthineſs of them. And in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the ſenſe we have of our unworthineſs, and the grace of God in conferring any mercies on us, will ordinarily at leaſt be the degree of our gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude to him.</p>
            <p>LET me therefore, as a neceſſary means of raiſing your gratitude to a due height, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per fervour, exhort you to reflect ſeriouſly on your own ſins in particular, on the ſins of this land, and of the nation in general; or the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety and infidelity, the prophaneneſs and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuality, the pride and luxury, the ſelfiſhneſs and venality, the injuſtice and oppreſſion, which have been in the midſt of us. Without this, tho' you may poſſibly have a deep ſenſe of the worth and importance of theſe bleſſings, and may firmly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that God is the author of them, yet you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:008192_0038_102E49DE8E697FB8"/>
be ſo thoroughly thankful for them as you ought to be; not having a juſt idea of our unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs of them, and of the goodneſs and grace of God in beſtowing them. But ſuch reflexions will have the moſt direct, and, by God's bleſſing, an effectual tendency, to awaken in you the warmeſt ſentiments of gratitude to him. I ſay, the warmeſt ſentiments of gratitude to him: for you are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that religious thankfulneſs does not conſiſt merely in ſpeculation; in having right notions and conceptions of the bleſſings we enjoy, of their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and value, of our unworthineſs of them, and the mercy of God in beſtowing them; but in correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding operations of the heart and mind towards our almighty, and moſt gracious Benefactor. This intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces the fourth particular mentioned above, <hi>viz<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4thly. THAT religious thankfulneſs implies in it the exerciſe of devout affection towards God, or the internal acts of bleſſing and praiſing him for his goodneſs. Hereby it is intended to aſcertain the true and proper nature of religious gratitude, by diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing it from two things, which may poſſibly be miſtaken for it. Firſt, from the mere ſenſation of joy, or gladneſs of heart, on account of the bleſſings which we enjoy. This is common to good and bad men; atheiſts themſelves may poſſibly rejoice even more than the moſt pious men, in having the means of worldly and temporal happineſs; becauſe their only portion being in this world, they of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence ſet an higher value on theſe worldly goods than they, whoſe chief treaſure, and whoſe hearts are in heaven. Religious gratitude is quite a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent thing from this joy and rejoicing, which ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate in the good things poſſeſſed, or enjoyed by us. God, as was obſerved above, is the object
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:008192_0039_102E49E012CF6248"/>
thereof; and it conſiſts in devout affection towards him; in the emotions of the heart, in bleſſing and praiſing him, as the author of theſe benefits. And both theſe things together, I mean the perception of good, in conjunction with the internal act of bleſſing God as the giver of it, make up the true ſcripture idea of "rejoicing in the Lord." But by the definition above, religious thankfulneſs is diſtinguiſhed, not only from the mere ſenſation of joy on account of the bleſſings received; but alſo from a mere ſpeculative notion in the head, and all the operations of that which is peculiarly and ſtrictly called, the intellectual or rational faculty in man; the heart or affections, as diſtinguiſhed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from, being the proper ſeat of it.</p>
            <p>SOME may perhaps think this, at beſt, a need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs refining, if not an unintelligible ſubtlety, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaning diſtinction, like many others which, firſt and laſt, have darkened religion, under the pretence of explaining it. For it may be aſked, if a man is fully ſenſible of the worth of thoſe bleſſings which he enjoys; if he is fully perſwaded that God is the author of them; if he knows his unworthineſs of them, and therefore is rationally convinced that they flow from the divine grace and bounty, is he not therefore truly thankful to God for them? What is there ſtill wanting to make him religiouſly thankful? I anſwer, nothing—but the thing itſelf; that which is the very eſſence and ſubſtance of this duty, or virtue: ſuch a man has all thoſe juſt and rational conceptions of things, which are neceſſary in order to his being duly thankful, and are a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per foundation for the exerciſe of gratitude towards God. But ſtill no opinion, no judgment which the mind, or rational faculty, forms concerning the
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:008192_0040_102E49E2ECDD4290"/>
goodneſs and mercy of God, however true and juſt, is itſelf religious thankfulneſs. That conſiſts, as before obſerved, in certain operations of the heart, correſponding to theſe rational and juſt conceptions of the head, or intellectual faculty; in devout and warm affection, aſcending to God like incenſe from the altar, in an internal aſcription of bleſſing and praiſe to him on account of thoſe mercies, for which a man was before convinced by his reaſon, that he was indebted to the divine goodneſs and grace.</p>
            <p>THAT religious gratitude implies ſuch affection of the heart, diſtinct from all the operations or judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the intellectual faculty, will appear no myſtery, but plain truth, if you only reflect on what paſſes in your mind when a friend has laid himſelf out to ſerve you, and obliged you in a high degree. On ſuch occaſions you find in yourſelves, not a mere cold aſſent of the mind to the truth of the fact, that your friend has done thus; but a warm affection towards him as your benefactor, in conſequence of your knowing that he is ſo; reſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from that knowledge, or the ſenſe you have of what he has done for you, and therefore diſtinct from it. This will hold equally good, if applied to the caſe in hand. For religious gratitude<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and gratitude to a friend, do not differ in the nature, but only in reſpect of the object, or the degree of them. The object of one is man; the object of the other is God; both of them preſuppoſe a knowledge, or ſenſe of favours received, or ſome obligation laid upon us. And if we are as ſincerely thankful to God, as we uſually are to a generous benefactor, we ſhall experience as much warmth of affection towards him, in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward return of bleſſing and praiſe; or rather, abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:008192_0041_102E49E680A4BFC8"/>
more, in proportion to his greater bounty, and the ſuperior value of the bleſſings which he beſtows upon us.</p>
            <p>IMAGINE not, therefore, my Brethren, that you are this day properly thankful to God for his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold mercies, merely becauſe you highly eſteem, and are rejoiced on account of them; nor yet, merely becauſe you are rationally convinced of your unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs of them, and that they flow from the free grace, or unmerited goodneſs of God. All this you may be ſenſible of, and yet have an ungrateful heart; one that is a ſtranger to all devout affection, to all the internal acts of praiſing and bleſſing God, from whom cometh down every good and perfect gift. Nor is this only poſſible; it may be juſtly feared that many who have juſt ſpeculative notions concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the divine goodneſs, agreeably to what has been ſaid above, are nevertheleſs actually deſtitute of thankful hearts; as diſtitute perhaps, almoſt, as mere ſceptics or atheiſts. God forbid, there ſhould be in any of us, an heart ſo evil; for it is mentioned as one of the blackeſt ſins even of the heathen, whom God had not laid under ſo many obligations as he has us, that <q>when they knew God, they glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified him not as God, <hi>neither were thankful.</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Rom. I. 21.</note>
               </q> But if you are poſſeſſed of truly grateful hearts for the bleſſings conferred on you, be aſſured that this is, in God's account, <q>more than all whole burnt offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and ſacrifices</q>, or <q>the cattle upon a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand hills.</q> But</p>
            <p n="5">5thly. THO' the heart is what is to be primarily and chiefly regarded, our gratitude ought, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times at leaſt, to be expreſſed in the outward exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:008192_0042_102E49EA5201AA38"/>
of piety; in extolling the name of God, and ſinging his praiſes; and this, in a public, ſocial manner agreeably to the text: <q>Enter into his gates with thankſgiving, and into his courts with praiſe; be thankful unto him, and bleſs his name.</q> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, it may be taken for granted, that thoſe of you who are here preſent on this joyful occaſion, do not need any arguments to convince you of the propriety hereof, tho' it is probable that many others need them. I ſhall not, therefore, enlarge upon this point; for it is to you, and not to them, that I am ſpeaking.</p>
            <p>BUT there is one thing more, which it will not be amiſs juſt to remind you of, before we proceed to the laſt general head of diſcourſe. As all the bleſſings which God beſtows on the ſinful children of men, whether temporal or ſpiritual, are beſtowed on the gracious plan of evangelical grace, thro' the great <q>mediator between God and men, the man Chriſt Jeſus;</q> and as all our prayers are to be offered up to God in his name, in order to their acceptance; ſo alſo ought all our thanks and praiſes for bleſſings received, to be rendered thro' him, to the "One God and Father of all"; in conformity to the apoſtolic direction &amp; admonition;— <q>Singing and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing melody in your heart to the Lord, giving thanks always for all things unto God and [or even] the Father, <hi>in the name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Eph. V. 19, 20.</note>.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. LET me now, as was propoſed in the laſt place, exhort you to live anſwerably to the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations which God has laid us under, by beſtowing theſe bleſſings upon us. For ſurely you cannot ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, we ſhall have balanced our accounts with him, or
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:008192_0043_102E49EBD7296D98"/>
made him all the returns which his manifold goodneſs and mercies claim from us, only by the religious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, and the thankſgivings of this day; even tho' we ſhould not be deficient in any of the duties of it, whether internal or external, private or public. If we are properly thankful, and give to God this day "the glory due unto his name", thus far it is well; much better, I fear, than ſome, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps than moſt of us, can pretend to have done. But however this may be, ſtill you are to remember, that all the bleſſings which we receive from God, not only demand our thanks and praiſes for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; but are an additional obligation laid upon us to do, what we were all obliged to do before; I mean, to devote our whole lives to his ſervice and glory. Since therefore he has thus <q>crowned us with his loving-kindneſs and tender mercies,</q> we ſhall be doubly criminal if we do not keep his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments; our ſins will be aggravated to a great degree. We ſhould have been really without excuſe in living wickedly, tho' God had beſtowed none of theſe mercies upon us: For no ſin whatever does, in the nature of it, admit of any excuſe, properly ſpeaking, tho' it may be attended ſometimes with certain alleviating circumſtances. But our guilt is greatly enhanced, when our ſins are committed under the diſtinguiſhing ſmiles of heaven; undet many and great expreſſions of God's goodneſs to us, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtations of his concern both for our temporal and ſpiritual welfare; ſuch as we have been conſidering.</p>
            <p>ALL theſe are deſigned, either to lead ſinners to repentance, or to excite good men to greater fidelity and diligence in the ſervice of God. If therefore there are any preſent, who have hitherto lived in the violation of his holy commandments, let me admoniſh
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:008192_0044_102E49ED5F026E48"/>
them by theſe mercies of God, now to forſake their ſins; to ceaſe to do evil, and learn to do well. For <q>thinkeſt thou this, O man,—that thou ſhalt eſcape the judgment of God? Or deſpiſeſt thou the riches of his goodneſs, and forbearance, and long-ſuffering, not knowing that the goodneſs of God leadeth thee to repentance<note n="†" place="bottom">Rom. II. 3, 4.</note>?</q> Happy will it be for thee now, happy forever, if inſtead of deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſing the goodneſs of God, and counteracting its tendency, thou art awakened thereby to a ſenſe of thy duty, and brought to a thorough compliance with it. But miſerable wilt thou be, both now and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, if ſtill, <q>after thy hardneſs and impenitent heart, thou treaſureſt up unto thyſelf wrath againſt the day of wrath, and revelation of the righteous judgment of God; who will render to every man according to his deeds<note n="*" place="bottom">Ver. 5, 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note>.</q> Yea, on this ſad ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, which I do not make without reluctance, theſe very mercies and bleſſings will, in ſome ſenſe, riſe up againſt thee another day, and aggravate thy condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; and ſo, in the iſſue, be turned into the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vieſt curſes! Flee, therefore, from the wrath to come, and lay hold on the hope ſtill ſet before thee, that ſo iniquity may not be thy ruin!</p>
            <p>BY theſe ſame mercies of God, let good men, his faithful ſervants, be admoniſhed to perſevere in well doing, and to be ſtill <q>followers of God as dear children:</q> and not only to perſevere, but to perfect "holineſs in the fear of God". For doing thus, an entrance ſhall be miniſtred to you abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into that eternal kingdom and glory, to which he has called you by Jeſus Chriſt. God has far greater bleſſings laid up in ſtore for them that love him, than thoſe for which we are this day praſing him; ſuch as
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:008192_0045_102E49F33928FEE0"/>
eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, even to imagine, in this dark eſtate, "this preſent evil world". For <q>God who is rich in mercy, for the great love wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in ſins, hath quickened us together with Chriſt; (by grace ye are ſaved)—that in the ages to come he might ſhew the exceeding riches of his grace, in his kindneſs towards us thro' Jeſus Chriſt<note n="†" place="bottom">Eph. II. 4—7.</note>.</q>
            </p>
            <p>BUT there are divers things, of which I would more particularly remind you all in common, taking occaſion for it from the particular nature of thoſe mercies and bleſſings, which were repreſented to you in the morning under ſeveral heads. Each of theſe will afford ſome remarks and reflections, moſt or all of which, will tend to promote chriſtian piety and virtue. Let us begin</p>
            <p n="1">1. WITH the mercies ſpoken of under the firſt head; ſuch as the preſervation of the life of our gracious King, and of the Britiſh government, of our civil and religious liberties, &amp;c. The conſideration of which bleſſings, naturally ſuggeſts the following re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections. It may ſerve to remind us, in the firſt place, of the duty of loyalty, and of ſubmiſſion to that government under which we have the happineſs to live; not only of ſubmiſſion to the government eſtabliſhed, in general, but to <q>every ordinance of man, for the Lord's ſake: Whether it be to the King as ſupreme; or unto Governors, as unto them that are ſent by him for the puniſhment of evil-doers, and for a praiſe to them that do well<note n="‡" place="bottom">1 Pet. II. 13, 14.</note>.</q> Surely it becomes us, as we may well do under ſo excellent a form of government, and under the
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:008192_0046_102E49F4C1FE2D78"/>
reign of ſo good a King, to <q>lead quiet and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able lives;</q> to obey the laws, and all the legal commands of our civil rulers, not being ſinful. It would be very inconſiſtent and incongruous for us, who pretend to be thankful for the above-mentioned bleſſings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to be turbulent, or ſeditious, or bad ſubjects in any reſpect. Yea, it would be highly criminal, not in us only, but in any other perſons, who have the happineſs of living under ſuch a free, mild go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment as the Britiſh, and a King, with whom the laws are ſo ſacred as they have ever been with his preſent majeſty, either to raiſe or countenance any kind of rebellion, or ſedition in the ſtate. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes us all in general to be, not only peaceable, and content with the privileges we enjoy, but thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for them; to honour the king and pray for him, and for the continuance of ſo good a government.</p>
            <p>ANOTHER reflection, no leſs naturally ariſing here, is, that the privileges we enjoy under the Britiſh go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, being ſo precious and invaluable, we are bound in reaſon and duty, if there ſhould ever be occaſion, to ſtand up in the defence of them againſt any illegal encroachments or uſurpations, whether as to things ſpiritual or temporal: For our legal privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges extend to both. It would be highly criminal in us tamely to ſuffer them to be wreſted from us, if it was in our power to prevent it; or to give place, even "for an hour", to them who ſhould have the hardneſs to attempt it. This would infer a contempt of God's goodneſs in giving, and preſerving to us, theſe privileges, amidſt ſo many perils and dangers as they have been in, firſt and laſt; particularly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſeveral inglorious, not to ſay infamous reigns of the Stewarts. In ſhort, we cannot be true, hearty friends to the free Engliſh government, to the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:008192_0047_102E49F75AB572B8"/>
of the revolution, to the preſent Royal Family, or to the proteſtant religion, without deteſting tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; and oppoſing in our ſeveral places, and to the utmoſt of our power, if ever there ſhould be occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion given for it, all arbitrary, illegal proceedings, whether in church or ſtate, whether of great men or little ones. This is ſcarce leſs the duty of every Britiſh ſubject, than ſubmiſſion to the legal <note n="*" place="bottom">The term legal is preferred here to lawful, becauſe it is leſs equivocal, and ſo leſs liable to be perverted to a wrong ſenſe, to countenance the arbitrary conduct of thoſe that are in pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Lawful is often oppoſed to ſinful, or what God has forbidden: In which ſenſe it is not true, that we are bound in conſcience to obey all the lawful commands of the civil magiſtrate. If the command is not alſo legal, or ſuch as the laws of the land authoriſe him to give, it may be innocently diſregarded. Britiſh ſubjects are to obey the laws, not the capricious will of any magiſtrate, whether ſupreme or ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate.</note> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of their political ſuperiours.</p>
            <p>BUT let me finiſh my reflections under this head, by cautioning all not to abuſe, or pervert the deſign of their religious liberty, by affronting and contemning all religion, and living as without God in the world. A man that "throws firebrands, arrows and death", and thinks to vindicate ſuch deſtructive ſport, by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he is a free-born Briton, you will allow, has no proper idea of Britiſh liberty; but ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be accounted a madman than a civilian. But mad, at leaſt to the ſame degree, is every man who ſports with God and religion under the ſame pretence. I ſay, at leaſt, becauſe the laws forbid ſuch impiety to God, as truly as they do, burning your neighbour's houſe, or murder. So that the great freedom even of the Britiſh government, were that the only thing to be conſidered, is no good excuſe for irreligion
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:008192_0048_102E49FB0E7C9E40"/>
and impiety. But I have no great opinion of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcing religion by human laws, any further than to keep men from hurting and deſtroying one another, (if that may be called religion) it being evident that ſuch laws have, upon the whole, but very little, if any good effect. We will therefore ſuppoſe for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, that there were no ſuch laws in being. Does it from hence follow, that you are <q>without law to God</q>? or that you are not <q>under the law to Chriſt,</q> who came into this world to <q>redeem us from all iniquity, and to purify unto himſelf a peculiar people, zealous of good works?</q> You will not ſay, it does. Take heed then, that you do not abuſe your religious liberty; throw not all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience aſide, becauſe you have liberty of conſcience. For tho' you live under a free government; yea, which is much more, tho' "Chriſt has made us free" from every yoke of bondage, you ought to live in the faith and fear of God, and in obedience to his commands, under a ſenſe of your being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable to him; remembring the apoſtle's admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition,— <q>as free, and not uſing your liberty for a cloke of maliciouſneſs, but as the ſervant of God. Honor all men. Love the brotherhood, Fear God. Honor the king<note n="†" place="bottom">Pet. II. 16, 17.</note>.</q> In ſhort, the true and only uſe we ought to make of our religious liberty, is this: To exerciſe it in a free, impartial and ſerious inquiry into religion, that we may learn <q>what is the good, and acceptable, and perfect will of God;</q> and having found <note n="‡" place="bottom">It is here taken for granted, that every ſuch free and unpreju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced inquirer, will, ſooner or later, be a believer in Jeſus Chriſt, and that religion which bears his name; agreeably to his own words— <q>My doctrine is not mine, but HIS that ſent me. If any man will do</q> [deſires to do] <q>HIS will, he ſhall know of the doctrine, whether it be of GOD, or whether I ſpeak of myſelf.</q> Joh. VII. 16, 17.</note> what that is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:008192_0049_102E49FEAC0FE840"/>
practiſe agreeably to it; to worſhip God, and ſerve him in holineſs and righteouſneſs according to his word, without regarding what are the vulgar, prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing opinions and practices; which, by the way, have generally been wrong, at leaſt in ſome points. But</p>
            <p n="2">2. LET us proceed to thoſe mercies which were referred to a ſecond claſs, in the foregoing diſcourſe; viz. the ſucceſſes given the laſt year to the arms of their Britannic and Pruſſian Majeſties: On which we may make a few brief reflections. It appears from hence, that thoſe who are compelled to engage in a war for their own defence, having a good and juſt cauſe, may reaſonably hope for ſucceſs, even tho' their enemies are far more numerous, and to human appearance much ſtronger than they. The French are generally conſidered, and may perhaps be juſtly looked on, as the moſt potent nation of Europe. They compelled his Britannic Majeſty, by their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated encroachments and hoſtilities, to engage in a war for the ſecurity of his American dominions. But tho', all circumſtances conſidered, they may be the ſtronger, it is manifeſt the battle, the ſucceſs, has not of late been to the ſtrong; nor indeed has it been ſo on the whole, ſince the war began. God in his providence has apparently given ſucceſs to our righteous cauſe againſt ſuperior numbers: For at leaſt as to numbers, there is no diſpute; nor would there be any room for doubt in other reſpects, were it not for the ſuperiority of the royal navy of Britain. But the preſent remark is grounded chiefly on the ſucceſſes and victories of his Pruſſian Majeſty: Who, tho' hemm'd round with many enemies mightier than himſelf, cloſely united and leagued for his deſtruction, has hitherto cut his way thro' them, has baffled their deſigns, and triumphed over them thro' God, who has
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:008192_0050_102E4A003009A738"/>
"taught his hands to war, and his fingers to fight." So great is the diſparity between him and his enemies, and ſo extraordinary his victories and triumphs over them, that we ſeem almoſt to be carried back to the age of Joſhua, wherein <q>one chaſed a thouſand, and two put ten thouſand to flight.</q> And if we ſhould conſider this hero of his age as fighting, in part, for the ſupport of true religion, or chriſtian <note n="*" place="bottom">It muſt be acknowledged that religion is, at moſt, but a ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary motive of the war in which his Pruſſian Majeſty is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged. However, his abhorrence of perſecution, and ſtrong attachment to the principles of religious liberty in their utmoſt extent, appear in part from the following quotation. After ſpeaking of the religious ſects in his dominions, he concludes with theſe words, at once ſo becoming a noble mind, a great prince, and a good chriſtian; "All theſe", ſays he, <q>live here in peace, and contribute alike to the proſperity of the ſtate; for there is never a religion that differs greatly from the reſt, in reſpect of morality. Hence they may be all alike to the government, which of courſe leaves every man at liberty to go to heaven which way he pleaſes. All that is required of them is, to be peaceful and good ſubjects. Falſe zeal is a tyrant that depopulates provinces; tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is a tender mother that makes them flouriſh.</q> Diſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation on <hi>ſuperſtition</hi> and <hi>religion,</hi> added to the <hi>Memoirs of the Houſe of</hi> BRANDENBOURG. By the preſent King of Pruſſia.</note> liberty, againſt the antichriſtian perſecutors of the church of God; we could hardly forbear ranking him among thoſe renowned warriors, <q>Gideon and Barak, and Sampſon, and Jepthae, and David—who thro' faith ſubdued kingdoms, wrought righteouſneſs—ſtopped the mouths of lions—eſcaped the edge of the ſword, out of weakneſs were made ſtrong, waxed valiant in fight, and put to flight the armies of the aliens.</q> The conqueſts and ſucceſſes of this monarch ſhow, in the cleareſt light, the power of God, and the weakneſs of man independently of him. They ſhew us that if God be for us, we need not "fear what man can do againſt us"; and that
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:008192_0051_102E4A01B4D348F0"/>
wherever there is a righteous cauſe, whatever diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, almoſt, there may be in numbers, or appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſtrength, there is ground to hope for ſucceſs: For <q>there is no reſtraint againſt the Lord, to ſave by many or by few.</q>
            </p>
            <p>WE are moreover taught from hence, both where to place our truſt and dependence for a happy iſſue of the preſent war, and where not to place it. "Curſed be the man that truſteth in man", ſaith the prophet, <q>and that maketh fleſh his arm, and whoſe heart departeth from the Lord.</q>
               <q>— It is better to truſt in the Lord, than to put confidence in princes.</q> Tho' we have hitherto been ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful in general the year paſt, we have not yet "put off the harneſs"; the war is not yet brought to a concluſion, and poſſibly may be far from it. Perhaps it may ſoon take as different a turn, as it did about the beginning of the preſent year; a turn, as calamitous to us, as that was favourable. This depends not on any man, or number of men, <q>whoſe breath is in their noſtrils;</q> and who have no wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, nor courage, nor power, independently of Him, who worketh all things according to the counſel of his own will; who governs winds, and waters, and ſeaſons, and health, and diſeaſe, and all things, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his pleaſure; before whom <q>all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the earth are reputed as nothing.</q> We cannot therefore be at any loſs, in whom it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes us to place our hope and dependence, with reſpect to a continuance of our ſucceſſes. If God ariſe, his enemies ſhall be ſcattered: all they that hate him ſhall flee before him; and the eagle of vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, like the martial hawk, <note n="†" place="bottom">Job XXXIX. 26.</note> will "ſtretch her wings" and fly, only by his wiſdom and command, whether
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:008192_0052_102E4A033890D1D8"/>
toward the north or "toward the ſouth", allighting where he has ordained a place for her.</p>
            <p>TO finiſh our reflections on this heard: Since our whole, or, which comes to much the ſame thing, our ultimate dependence, is on almighty God, this admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes us, by humble prayer and ſupplication, to ſeek his farther bleſſing on the Britiſh counſels and arms, and military operations; And, at the ſame time, ſhews us the importance of reforming our ways, and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing righteouſneſs. For tho' the prayer of the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right is God's delight, he heareth not ſinners; but even the prayers of the wicked and hypocritical, tho' the moſt holy and ſacred of any thing which belongs to them, are ſaid to be "ſin", and an <q>abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto the Lord.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3dly. LET us now proceed to the bleſſings which were referred to the laſt head; <hi>viz,</hi> thoſe which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late more particularly and immediately to ourſelves; the fruitfulneſs of the paſt ſeaſon, our plenty, health, &amp;c. On which the following reflections may, I hope, be proper and uſeful—How incongruous would it be for us to conſume upon our luſts, thoſe bounties of divine providence, for which we at leaſt pretend to be religiouſly thankful? Doubtleſs, if we are ſo in reality, we ſhall make conſcience of obſerving the exacteſt rules of reaſon, ſobriety and moderation, in the uſe of them from time to time; and whether we eat or drink, or whatever we do, do all to the glory of God, on whom "all eyes wait, that he may give them their meat in due ſeaſon".</p>
            <p>MOREOVER; from a conſideration of the goodneſs of God to us, thoſe of us who have ability, ſhould be excited to the exerciſe of charity and liberality to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:008192_0053_102E4A0714E169C8"/>
the poor and neceſſitous. For even in times of general plenty, there will be ſome ſuch unhappy perſons. "The poor", ſays our Saviour, <q>you have always with you.</q> Nor is there any better or more ſubſtantial way of outwardly manifeſting our gratitude and love toGod, than that of ſhewing mercy to the proper objects of our charity. <q>If any of you have this world's goods, ſays the Apoſtle, and ſeeth his brother have need, and ſhutteth up his bowels of compaſſion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?</q> Wherefore, while we our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves bleſs God for the care he has taken of us, let <q>the bleſſing of him that is ready to periſh come upon us</q> for our alms, and ſeaſonable relief. This will have a tendency to draw down further bleſſings on ourſelves. <q>He hath diſperſed abroad, he hath given to the poor; his righteouſneſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth forever;</q> and <q>the liberal ſoul ſhall be made fat.</q> We ought to account ourſelves ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured by God in being made, as it were, his al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moners, to diſtribute his bounty to the needy. And, which will be a farther motive to the truly pious, this will cauſe, in many perſons, thankſgiving to God as, the ſupreme author of the reliefs and ſupplies which they receive from us, the inſtruments of his mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence.</p>
            <p>TO conclude: While we bleſs God for our health, let us be admoniſhed to improve it aright, by making preparation in ſeaſon for another world, inſtead of neglecting this preparation till a time of ſickneſs, in many reſpects unſuitable for ſuch buſineſs, at leaſt to begin it. The body being diſorder'd, generally diſorders and enfeebles the mind in ſome degree; and often quite incapacitates it for any rational acts, and moſt of all for religion; which being altogether a
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:008192_0054_102E4A0ADAA5D6A0"/>
"reaſonable ſervice", peculiarly requires the exerciſe of the rational faculties. For I am ſpeaking of the chriſtian religion, not the religion of that antichriſtian church, wherein ignorance is both the mother and nurſe of devotion; and whoſe uſurpations are chiefly ſupported by the blindneſs and infatuation of the people.</p>
            <p>BUT waving this conſideration, you cannot be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible that man, even in his beſt eſtate, <q>is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vanity;</q> and that you may be ſuddenly taken out of the world, without any previous warning, or time for preparation. There have lately been ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral remarkable examples hereof in this town; and one, in a perſon <note n="†" place="bottom">Charles Apthorp <abbr>Eſq</abbr> a merchant of the firſt rank on the continent.</note> of ſuch diſtinction as has naturally attracted a general attention. How loud, how vocal, is ſuch a diſpenſation of providence? How plainly, even like the heavenly ray and words of inſpiration, does it <q>charge them that are rich, not to truſt in uncertain riches?</q> them that are ſtrong and heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, not to truſt in uncertain health; <q>but in the living God, who giveth them all things richly to enjoy?</q> It is like the voice which the prophet heard from heaven, crying, <q>All fleſh is graſs, and all the goodlineſs thereof is as the flower of the field. The graſs withereth, the flower fadeth,— ſurely the people is graſs.</q> It may be juſtly apprehended that many people have been taken out of the world as ſuddenly, tho' far leſs prepared, than the perſon alluded to above; who was generally eſteemed an upright man, and a ſincere friend to religion. However, it is God's prerogative to judge men. My view in reminding you of this inſtance of ſudden death, is to ſhow you how very precarious
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:008192_0055_102E4A0DB4D79298"/>
both your health and lives are; and hereby to excite you, by the bleſſing of God, ſo to number your days, that you may, in ſeaſon, apply your hearts unto wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; not to rely on your preſent health and ſtrength, but to improve them in working out your ſalvation; that ſo, how ſoon or unexpectedly ſoever <q>the earthly houſe of this your tabernacle may be diſſolved, you may have a building of God, an houſe not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.</q> Bleſſed, thrice bleſſed are all the dead, who die in the Lord, whenever they die, and whatever circumſtances may attend their death: "Yea", ſaith the ſpirit, for they reſt <q>from their labors, and their works do follow them.</q> They ſhall ſurely have a part in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the juſt, thro' Him that hath <q>aboliſhed death, and brought life and immortality to light thro' the goſpel;</q> while others, however great or honourable in this world, ſhall ariſe to ſhame and "everlaſting contempt." And He that both died and roſe again, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living, hath ſaid, <q>Behold, I come quickly, and my reward is with me, to give to every man according as his work ſhall be.</q>
               <q>— Bleſſed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in thro' the gate into the city. For without are dogs, and ſorcerers, and whoremongers, and idolaters, and whoſoever loveth and maketh a lie.</q>
