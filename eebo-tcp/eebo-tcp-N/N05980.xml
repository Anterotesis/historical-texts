            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  </gap> and became as Water,</hi> upon their hearing the News; and <hi>Joſhua</hi> himſelf was greatly alarm'd.—But the ſame Day at Evening they had an Anſwer from God, in which <hi>Joſhua</hi> was directed what Method to take, in order to find out the guilty Perſon, who had, by his Theft, procured the Defeat,—The Kind and Degree of his Puniſhment was likewiſe ſpecified by the Divine Oracle at the ſame Time; which was executed the next Day, in the Manner preſcribed, after he had been detected and convicted, 24, 25 ver. <hi>And they raiſed a great Heap of Stones over him,</hi> as a Monument of God's righteous Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure and Severity againſt Sins of ſuch a public Scandal and general Miſchief to the Community, and as a Warning to all others.</p>
            <p>And this was wiſely order'd by God in the Beginning of their new Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire and Settlement in the promiſed Land, to prevent the Death of great Numbers, that took Warning by this awful Example; who, if not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained by the Fear and Love of God, from ſuch deteſtable and deſtructive
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:007583_0004_102D7F40AEF52DE0"/>
Practices, yet, would be, by the Fear of Puniſhment, and the Love of their own, and their dear Childrens Lives.</p>
            <p>I ſhall wave a particular and critical Survey of the Context, which would take up much Time to little Purpoſe, and proceed to the Text; in which it may be noted, That God ſpeaks to <hi>Joſhua</hi> with great Solemnity, and Indications of high Diſpleaſure: <hi>Up, ſanctify the People, and ſay, Sanctify yourſelves</hi>—"Riſe from your Proſtration—Attend the Duty incumbent on you—Put the People upon making ſuitable Preparation to appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God—Summon them to be ready againſt To-morrow, and bid them ſee that they have no ceremonial Pollution upon them, but purify your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from whatever is contrary to the Law in this Caſe, that I may point out, before the whole Congregation, the Perſon that has committed the accurſed Fact; and that you may all ſee his moſt awful and exemplary Puniſhment.—Purify yourſelves, for the whole Congregation is, in ſome Reſpect, polluted by this deteſtable Thing."</p>
            <p>The latter Part of the Text contains a Declaration of the Reaſon, why the Army that was ſent out could not ſtand, and the Neceſſity of their removing the Cauſe, in order to their being able, for the future, to ſtand before, and ſubdue their Enemies: <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, There is an accurſed Thing in the Midſt of thee, O</hi> Iſrael: <hi>Thou canſt not ſtand before thine Enemies, until ye take away the accurſed Thing from among you.</hi> The Sin of <hi>Achan,</hi> conſidered in all its Circumſtances, had put the whole People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of the Divine Protection, and was the Cauſe of God's with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing from them that Spirit of Courage and Reſolution, which are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in War. When that is withheld, no Warriors, tho' their natural Courage and acquired Skill be ever ſo great, can ſtand before the moſt contemptible Foe; eſpecially when it is on the Account of the Violation of their Covenant-Engagements; which was then the Caſe of the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall now attempt, by Divine Aſſiſtance, to offer ſomething agreeable to the Subject, under the following general Heads.</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. When God's profeſſing People go forth to war againſt their Enemies, they ſhould be very careful to put away from among them, all their Sins; eſpecially that, which is emphatically, <hi>The accurſed Thing in the Midſt of them.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>II. In order to this, a diligent Inquiry ought to be made, to find out what it is.</item>
               <item>III. The Reaſon aſſigned for this Duty is, <hi>That unleſs it be taken away, they cannot stand before their Enemies in the Day of Battle.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>
                  <pb n="5" facs="unknown:007583_0005_102D7F424124CD08"/>IV. A particular Application ſhall conclude the Subject.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">I. When God's profeſſing People go forth to war againſt their Enemies, they ſhould be very careful to put away from among them all their Sins; eſpecially that, which is emphatically, <hi>The Accurſed Thing in the Midſt of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That this Duty is <hi>more eſpecially</hi> incumbent on thoſe who are favour'd with the Light of the Goſpel, I need not attempt to prove to a Chriſtian Auditory. And that God's peculiar People are often obliged, by the ill Treatment of ſome of their fellow Men, to go to war with them in a Way of Self-defence (which is a Duty they owe to Him, as the Author of their Being) is evident from undeniable Facts: Otherwiſe they would be driven out of the World by Violence; not called out by the ordinary Way of Providence; or be forced to drag out the moſt miſerable Lives, in the moſt abject Slavery, without taſting the Sweetneſs of <hi>Liberty,</hi> which is common to the <hi>Human Species.</hi> And that <hi>defenſive</hi> War is frequently ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary as well as lawful, and <hi>offenſive</hi> War ſometimes ſo, is conſpicuous, not only from the Oracles of Truth, but even from the Principles of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in its degenerate State. In the Old Teſtament, we have diverſe Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of its being undertaken and engaged in, by the ſpecial Appointment and Command of the Lord of Hoſts. Nor is it any where forbidden in the New Teſtament, either by Chriſt, the Prince of Peace, who conſtituted and preſided over the legal, as well as the evangelical Diſpenſation, or by his Apoſtles; but is implicitly approved of by them: Which it would not have been, if it had been contrary to the Spirit of the Goſpel, but would have been forbidden by them.</p>
            <p>This being ſo evident, I ſhall not attempt a Vindication of it againſt Sophiſters and Bigots; eſpecially as this intereſting, tho' in itſelf, unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Subject, has, of late Years, been ſet in the moſt convincing Light by the cleareſt Pens <note n="†" place="bottom">See Mr. <hi>Tennent</hi>'s and Mr. <hi>Smith</hi>'s Sermons (of <hi>Philadelphia</hi>) on the Subject. And Mr. <hi>William Currie</hi>'s Vindication of the Lawfulneſs of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive War; printed in <hi>Philadelphia.</hi>
               </note>.</p>
            <p>Having premiſed theſe Things, we come to the Point, which is, That when the Lord's People go to war, they ought to put away all their Sins, eſpecially that which is the Accurſed Thing. The Obligation is general and binding upon all Perſons, at all Times, in all Circumſtances, more eſpecially when under the Rebukes and Frowns of Providence for their
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:007583_0006_102D7F441B24D270"/>
Sins, as they are in a Time of War. This Diſpenſation is a ſolemn Call to the Practice of the Duty, which ought to be religiouſly obſerved, eſpecially when there is any Thing particularly ſpecified, as there was in the Caſe of the <hi>Jews</hi> at their Entrance into the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> The revealed Will of God is the only Rule of our Conduct, and his Authority the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of our Compliance.</p>
            <p>Now, by the Accurſed Thing, we are to underſtand the Perſon of <hi>A<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>an,</hi> together with his ſtolen Goods, as in 12 ver. And his taking theſe was Sacrilege, becauſe conſecrated to the Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Joſh.</hi> 6 19.</p>
            <p>But if it be demanded, What <hi>we,</hi> at this Day, are to underſtand by the Accurſed Thing? How it may be taken away? And who ſhall undertake the difficult Taſk?</p>
            <p>The Anſwer to the firſt of theſe Inquiries is, That we are to underſtand Sin in general, eſpecially that which is open and public; or thoſe Sins which are openly committed by Perſons of Note, and by Men in Authority and Office, both Civil and Eccleſiaſtical: And thoſe which are committed by the Encouragement, Approbation, and Connivance of dignified Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. There is an intrinſic moral Evil in <hi>all</hi> Sin, eſpecially the laſt Sort, as contrary to the moſt holy Nature and Law of God: For this Reaſon, every Sin is an Accurſed Thing. For, as the Apoſtle argues, <hi>Sin is the Tranſgreſſion of the Law</hi>; of that Law, which is a Tranſcript of the moral Perfections of God; therefore neceſſarily <hi>holy, juſt, and good.</hi> And every Sin is more or leſs heinous, as Caſes and Circumſtances vary, or may be alter'd for ſpecial, prudential, or public Reaſons. <hi>That Sin,</hi> therefore, which is the moſt detrimental to the public Good, and the moſt diſhonorary to God, is <hi>now,</hi> and <hi>ever,</hi> to be deem'd the Accurſed Thing.</p>
            <p>The next Inquiry is, How this is to be taken away?</p>
            <p>The Anſwer is eaſy, but the Performance difficult: But it may be done by a vigorous and faithful Execution of the Laws of the Country; which is the Magiſtrate's Province. And it ſuppoſes him to be concerned only in ſuch Things as properly come under his Cognizance. For where the legiſlative Body provide a Sect of good Laws, enforcing the Obſervation of the Divine; there the wanton Boughs and rampant Branches may be cut off, tho' the Trunk of the Tree remain, and the Root live. For, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Sins are but overgrown Branches of the accurſed Root of corrupt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which ſhoot out to more open View. And 'tis evident from known Facts, that theſe in general may be lop'd off by a vigorous and faithful
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:007583_0007_102D7F45F1A3B7C8"/>
Exertion of civil Power and Authority. For the <hi>Magiſtracy</hi> was erected among Mankind in their degenerate State, and theſe Powers were ordain'd by God, for this very End. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1. <hi>Let every Soul be ſubject unto the higher Powers. For there is no Power but of God: The Powers that be, are ordain'd of God. Whoſoever therefore reſiſteth the Power, reſiſteth the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of God. For Rulers are not a Terror to good Works, but to evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It follows then, in Anſwer to the laſt Inquiry, that this Work belongs to the Magiſtrate; who, as by his Office, he undertakes it, ſo he is obliged, in Point of Duty to God and the Public, to engage in it, otherwiſe <hi>be bears the Sword in vain.</hi> He ought to do all that in him lies to ſuppreſs whatever Vice and Immortality is cognizable by the Law: This is greatly conducive to the Benefit of Society. <hi>For,</hi> continues the Apoſtle, 4 ver<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>he is the Minister of God for Good to thee</hi> (if thou do that which is good) <hi>But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the Sword in vain: For he is the Miniſter of God, a Revenger to execute Wrath upon him that doth evil.</hi> The civil Magiſtrate may do much toward a Reformation, by ſuppreſſing Vice, if he would dare to magnify his Office, by a vigilant and faithful Diſcharge of it. When this is not wanting on his Part, all needed Aſſiſtance, and a Bleſſing, never ſail on God's Part. This might be exemplified by Inſtances both from ſacred and profane Hiſtory; but I ſhall only recur to our Text and Context for Illuſtration. Here we find <hi>Joſhua,</hi> as a <hi>Judge</hi> and <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> and as <hi>Generaliſſimo</hi> of all the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Forces, expreſly commanded by God to ſearch out and puniſh <hi>the Accurſed Thing</hi>: Which done, God went forth with their Armies and enabled them to ſtand before their Enemies. This Event ſeems in general to be adapted to all Perſons in high Stations, and to have been deſigned for an Example to them. And that Nation that is favour'd with good Laws (ſuch as ſecure the Perſons, Privileges, and Properties of the Subject) and with faithful Magiſtrates, of a generous public Spirit, may be ſtyled <hi>Righteous,</hi> in a forenſic Senſe, agreeable to the Divine Aphoriſm, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.34. <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> encouraged, promoted, and protected, <hi>exalteth a Nation: But Sin,</hi> countenanced, and unpuniſhed by civil Authority, <hi>is a Reproach to any People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When therefore the Rulers of a profeſſing People ſend forth their Armies to war, they ſhould not only be ſatisfied that the <hi>Cauſe</hi> be juſt, but take a religious Care to remove every Thing, eſpecially the <hi>Accurſed,</hi> from among them, that there may be no Obſtacle in the Way of their Succeſs.</p>

And all that are in Authority, both civil and eccleſiaſtical, eſpecially <hi>the Preachers of Righteouſneſs,</hi> ought daily, and forever to recommend and enforce the Obſervation of our ſalutary Laws, by their <hi>own Example,</hi> and by a ſteady, uniform Practice of thoſe Things, which they require by Law, and recommend by Precept and Doctrine: Otherwiſe the Law loſes its Force, Government miſſes its End, and Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is unprofitable.

            <p>Having diſpatch'd the firſt, we proceed to the next general Head.</p>
            <p n="2">II. In order to the Removal of <hi>the accurſed Thing,</hi> a diligent Inquiry ought to be made, to find out what it is.</p>
            <p>Take away the Cauſe and the Effects will ceaſe. In order to this, we muſt uſe ſuch Means as are adapted to the End.—We muſt exerciſe our Faculties as reaſonable Creatures.—Muſt conſider our Ways, and obſerve the Ways of others, eſtimating the latter by Facts and clear Evidences, not by mere Suſpicions.—We muſt <hi>ſearch and try our Ways</hi>; reflect upon our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and Conduct; inſpect our Hearts very minutely; and examine our Actions very accurately, by the Divine Rule.—We muſt learn the Art of <hi>Self-Knowledge</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">See an excellent ſmall Treatiſe on this Subject by <hi>John Maſon, A. M.</hi> which ought to be read by every one who is capable of <hi>Self-Application.</hi>
               </note>; which Kind of Knowledge is, in general, the leaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded and inquired after of many, tho' of all other the moſt neceſſary and uſeful to Mankind, with Reſpect both to their preſent and future Happineſs. Every one ought to learn what are his own reigning Vices;
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:007583_0009_102D7F49B7A9C568"/>
and they that are in public Offices, ought to acquaint themſelves with the prevailing Vices of the Times, in order to expoſe and reſtrain them as much as poſſible.</p>
            <p>We need not enter into a Detail of Particulars, to inform thoſe that are in Office, what Method they ought to take, and what Means to uſe, in order to detect and reſtrain Vice and Immorality: If they know what belongs to their Office, they know the Means; and if ſo, they are inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable, if they uſe them not, in the Sight of the Great LAW-GIVER and JUDGE of all, to whom they will one Day find themſelves ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable for all their Conduct and Procedure, both in the <hi>Legiſlative</hi> and <hi>Executive</hi> Truſt. To whom does it belong, but to the Magiſtrate, to ſearch out, and take away open and public Sins? Is he not ſtyled in Scripture, <hi>The Miniſter of God,</hi> for this End? <hi>Thus</hi> he is to ſanctify the People;— and they alſo muſt ſanctify themſelves, <hi>by conſidering their Ways, and framing their Doings, to turn unto their God.</hi> In doing which, both Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates and People muſt uſe the Means conducive to the End, or they will fail of the deſired Succeſs. But, let it be noted, that the Sanctification here mentioned, is only legal and external, and will not avail to the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Soul, without the internal Sanctification of the Holy Spirit.</p>
            <p>We proceed to the next Propoſition.</p>
            <p n="3">III. To aſſign the Reaſon of the Duty; which is, That unleſs God's People take away the accurſed Thing from among them, they cannot ſtand before their Enemies in Battle.</p>
            <p>For the Evincing of this Point, let us conſider the Nature of Sin in general; the defiling Influence of it upon Mankind; and the deſtructive Tendency and Conſequence of it.</p>
            <p>As to the Nature of Sin, it is deſcribed by an Apoſtle to be, <hi>The Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of the Law of God</hi>: Which Law is a Tranſcript of his moral Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; therefore neceſſarily <hi>holy, juſt, and good.</hi> The intrinſic Turpitude of Sin, as contrary to the Purity of the Divine Nature and Law, is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Reaſon why it ſhould be put away.</p>
            <p>And it has a defiling Influence upon Men, and renders thoſe who are guilty of it, vile and filthy in the Sight of that God, <hi>who is of purer Eyes than to behold Iniquity,</hi> without infinite Deteſtation, at any Time, or in any Place, eſpecially in a Time of War, and a critical Conjuncture of Affairs. Therefore it ſhould be put away from the Courts and Palaces of Kings and Princes; from national Councils, and the higher Courts; and from all the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:007583_0010_102D7F4B99D8BEB8"/>
Courts of Judicature in the Nation and Kingdom, of every Denomination; from the Markets, and all Places of public Commerce and Reſort; and from our Camps, and Fleets, and Fortreſſes: For it is moſt heinous, when practiſed openly by Perſons in high Stations, public Offices, and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Truſts, who ſhould be the moſt virtuous and exemplary Perſons in the World, on Account of the Influence which their Example has upon others.</p>
            <p>As to the Tendency and Conſequence of public Sins, it is to bring De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation and Ruin upon the People, as is evident from the Hiſtory of the Kings of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>—For when the Holy ONE of <hi>Iſrael</hi> looks down upon a People, and ſees the abominable Thing among them, he turns away with Indignation, and withdraws his favourable Preſence and kind Influence.— Then follows Confuſion, and endleſs perplexing Debates in their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, Fruſtration of their Schemes, Diſappointment of their Enterprizes, and Defeat of their Armies, with a <hi>Series</hi> of other Judgments and Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities.</p>
            <p>And <hi>now</hi> they cannot <hi>Stand</hi> before their Enemies; but are ſurprized, intimidated, run, ſtumble, and fall down dead and wounded in Heaps— Juſt like a Flock of the feather'd Kind, that were ſtretching their Courſe, ſecure, over Hills and Mountains, Vallies and Rivers, till they advanced near the Place, where the Fowler lay in Ambuſh, amongſt the Reeds;— then, upon his ſudden and unexpected Diſcharge, fall to the Ground, flutter and expire,—while ſome eſcape affrighted, and others wounded.— And no Wonder they cannot <hi>ſtand</hi>—for God has departed from them, and left them an eaſy Prey to their Enemies. And as He is not for them, He is againſt them, and on the Side of their Adverſaries. And tho' their Number be ever ſo great, and their Military Preparations, Courage, and Skill for War, ever ſo reſpectable; yet if God be not for them, and with them, as their wiſe LEADER and almighty PROTECTOR, they cannot <hi>ſtand</hi>—Read with Reverence the awful appoſite Threatening, <hi>Lev.</hi> 26.15. <hi>If ye will not do all my Commandments, but break my Covenant—I will ſet my Face againſt you, and ye ſhall be ſtain before your Enemies. They that hate you ſhall reign over you; and ye ſhall flee when none purſueth you.</hi> The Lord of Hoſts cannot go forth with our Armies to fight our Battles for us, cannot walk in our Camp to deliver us, when his infinitely holy and penetrating Eyes behold the Accurſed Thing in the Midſt of us. <hi>How can two walk together, except they be agreed?—What Concord hath</hi> CHRIST <hi>with</hi> Belial?— For this very important Reaſon, we ſhould <hi>carefully</hi> take away <hi>Every Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed Thing,</hi> when our Armies go out to war.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:007583_0011_102D7F4D5B1AB498"/>We are now come to the laſt Part deſign'd in the Method; which is,</p>
            <p n="4">IV. A particular Application of the Subject in ſeveral Uſes. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let us humble ourſelves under the mighty Hand of God, that has been ſtretch'd out againſt us, in the late Defeat of our principal Army.</p>
            <p>This is a heavy Blow, juſtly inflicted upon us by the Hand of an angry God—a terrible Evil in itſelf; but may however, by his wiſe and good Providence, prove beneficial in the End. And we <hi>ought</hi> to know that it is for our Sins, highly aggravated, long and obſtinately perſiſted in, after ſolemn Warnings, and ſharp Rebukes, of various Kinds. Let us then juſtify God and take Shame to ourſelves, like the penitent <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Ezra</hi>'s Time. <hi>Thou art righteous, O Lord God; for we remain yet eſcaped, as at this Day. Behold we are before Thee in our Treſpaſſes: For we cannot ſtand before Thee becauſe of this.</hi> If we cannot ſtand before our Enemies in this World, becauſe of our Sins; how much leſs ſhall we be able to ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the juſt JUDGE in the great Day, if they are not pardon'd thro' the Blood of Chriſt!</p>
            <p n="2">2. The next Uſe ſhall be of Information and Examination concerning the <hi>Accurſed Thing,</hi> that has procur'd this Defeat.</p>
            <p>That the World of Mankind is totally corrupt, I need not inform you:— But that Vice and Immorality, Error and Hereſy, prevail more than ever, I muſt tell you: Let the Reader's own <hi>Obſervation</hi> and <hi>Conſcience</hi> be my Witneſſes—<hi>Conſcience,</hi> that Candle of the Lord, that Lamp of Heaven, which lightens every Man that comes into the World; and which cannot be extiguiſhed, till Man almoſt wholly degenerates from the State of his Creation.</p>
            <p>If any ſhould be inquiſitive to know, What is <hi>the particular Accurſed Thing,</hi> in the Caſe of <hi>New-England,</hi> which, above all other, may be juſtly ſuppoſed to be the Cauſe provoking God to fight againſt us, and permit the Enemy to defeat our Army?—I muſt ſay, in Anſwer to this pertinent Query, That there are ſo many Accurſed Things among us, that I have been almoſt at a Loſs which to ſingle out:—However, I will mention ſome of them, and leave the Reader to chuſe and judge for himſelf, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving to myſelf the Liberty of <hi>ſhewing my own Opinion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The abominable accurſed Things that prevail in our Nation and Land, among all <hi>Orders, Ranks,</hi> and <hi>Sexes</hi> of Perſons, eſpecially in the Sea-port Towns, are ſuch as theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> Cuſtomary profane Swearing and Curſing (taking Gods Name in vain, and imprecating Divine Vengeance upon
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:007583_0012_102D7F4F60F410D0"/>
Perſons and Things) as if ſimple Affirmations and Negations had no Weight, without this harſh accurſed Adjunct; or as if the native Flowers of Rhetoric, and a graceful modeſt Addreſs, were unornamental, unleſs intermixt and garniſhed with ſhocking Expreſſions of Impiety;—as tho' <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Politeneſs could not conſiſt with a proper Regard to the DEITY; and this <hi>polite</hi> and <hi>wiſe</hi> Age could reliſh no Converſation, but that which is offenſive to Him!—But <hi>polite,</hi> only in the Eſteem of Perſons of a deprav'd Taſte, degenerate Minds, and diſſolute Morals; and <hi>wiſe,</hi> only among <hi>Fools</hi>!—Another Evil is, the open Profanation of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> by unneceſſary Purſuit of Buſineſs, and by drolling it away in Paſtime and Merriment, either in public Houſes, or open Streets;—Contempt and Neglect of the Goſpel, its Ordinances and Inſtitutions;—profeſſed Infidelity, and prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Hereſy:—Pride and Arrogance:—Gluttony and Drunkenneſs (the Abuſe of Meats and Drinks in a greater or leſs Degree) whereby the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of the Soul, and Organs of the Body, are not only clogged and impeded in their ſeveral Acts and Functions, but even imbruted, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitted for any Service, either human or divine:—Extravagant and immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt Apparel among that Sex, that pretends to the greateſt Modeſty:— Fraud, Injuſtice, and Oppreſſion in Bargains, Dealings and Commerce, and the pernicious Practice of <hi>Clandeſtine Trading</hi> in a Time of War:— Extortion of Uſurers, more eſpecially the deteſtable Crime of Bribery, and Partiality in Courts of Judicature, and general Aſſembles; whereby it comes to paſs, that <hi>the Righteous are rewarded according to the Work of the Wicked, and the Wicked according to the Work of the Righteous,</hi> as the Prophet complains:—Defamation, Slander and Miſchief-making among Neighbours and Friends; eſpecially Falſifying in Witneſs-bearing:— Coveteouſneſs, Theft, and Sacrilege, which was the Sin of <hi>Achan</hi> — And laſtly, <hi>Self-Confidence</hi> in War, at this <hi>critical Conjuncture,</hi> when our <hi>ALL</hi> lies at Stake.—Theſe Things, and many more, which might have been bro't into the Account, have been very obſervable among us for many Years, eſpecially of late:—Let Conſcience ſpeak, and the Guilty ſhall be convinced.</p>
            <p>And now, if there be one Sin rather than another, that may be pitch'd upon, as being the moſt conſiderable procuring Cauſe of the late ſad Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſter, I take it to be <hi>Self-Confidence in War</hi>: This, added to all our other flagrant Crimes, and public Sins, ſeems to have <hi>fill'd up</hi> our Meaſure, and <hi>ripen'd</hi> us for the Melancholy Event.—Did not a Self-confident Spirit begin
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:007583_0013_102D7F5155EB3C90"/>
to act, while we were preparing to ſend out our Armies? Did it not run thro' the Country, like Wild-fire, all the Time the <hi>General</hi> was on his March to <hi>Ohio?</hi> Did it not enflame every Fancy, and catch from Heart to Heart, and kindle up ſome unhallow'd Sparks even in pious Breaſts? Alas, that there was ſo much of this accurſed Thing to be ſeen, where better Things might have been expected!—Did we rightly conſider <hi>JEHOVAH,</hi> as the LORD of <hi>Sabaoth,</hi> or the Armies of his People?—That <hi>the Battle is his,</hi> and that he has an indubitable Right to <hi>give it to whomſoever he pleaſeth?</hi> And to compleat the preſumptuous Scene, did not our Troops go out to war, <hi>boaſting</hi> in themſelves, as if they were not juſt <hi>putting on the Harneſs,</hi> but were <hi>putting it off?</hi> And had we not ſeveral Accounts of the Prevalence of the ſame Spirit among them, while on their March? Does it not then appear, that <hi>Self-Confidence in War</hi> is the <hi>Accurſed Thing,</hi> that prevented their <hi>ſtanding before their Enemies?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. We hence learn, that Self-Confidence in War is, in its Nature, moſt offenſive to the Lord of Hoſts.</p>
            <p>This is a complicate Vice of the Mind, and of an Atheiſtical Complexion: It militates audaciouſly and preſumptuouſly againſt the Being and Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of God; particularly his <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> in ſetting up finite Wiſdom againſt that which is infinite, which alone knows how to govern the World, and diſpoſe of all Events, infinitely better than the beſt Politicians.— Againſt His <hi>Power,</hi> by boaſting in their own Strength, forgetful of the ALMIGHTY; truſting in their Numbers, in their Military Skill and Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture; in the Bravery of their Generals and Admirals, and of their Officers and Men (all which are at beſt but an Arm of Fleſh) whereby they do practically, and in a Senſe, explicitly, deny the ALMIGHTY, and their abſolute Dependence upon Him; as if they, thus equip'd by Human Art, had no Need of Him to <hi>teach their Hands to war, and their Fingers to fight; and to cover their Heads in the Day of Battle:</hi> Or to be their <hi>Sun, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten them in their Way, and their Shield to defend them in their Battles:</hi> And as tho' they had it in their Power, to command Succeſs and Victory by their own conquering Blows.—It is alſo an Impeachment of the <hi>Juſtice</hi> of God, if he ſhould not give them the Victory; allowing they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent on Him therefor.—And, in a Word, it is a ſetting up their Wills againſt the Divine <hi>Sovereignty,</hi> and denying Him the ſole Prerogative of ordering all Events, as he pleaſeth; particularly thoſe relating to guilty Mortals, unworthy of any gracious Notice. It is a determining in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:007583_0014_102D7F52F46EC290"/>
and proudly declaring, That they <hi>will</hi> have the Victory, whether <hi>He</hi> will give it, or not: And ſo by Conſequence, ſetting up themſelves, not only againſt God, but above God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This,</hi> as it is the moſt ſhocking Thought, ſo it is the moſt ready Way to procure ſuch a <hi>remarkable Defeat,</hi> as our Army has lately had.—Thus I have given you a general View of the Nature of Self-Confidence in War, <hi>the Accurſed Thing,</hi> which, <hi>above all other,</hi> or in <hi>Addition to many other,</hi> public Sins, has provoked God to inflict this humbling Stroke.—Let as many of us then, as are conſcious of <hi>this Sin</hi> (and who among us is not guilty?) ſmite upon our Breaſts, ſaying,—"Alas, my Soul, how great a Share haſt thou had in procuring this Calamity!"</p>
            <p n="4">4. We infer likewiſe, that it becomes us to be modeſt and cautious in our Remarks upon this Occaſion.</p>
            <p>People are very apt to make unſuitable Remarks upon ſuch Occaſions.— While ſome find Fault with the Great FIRST CAUSE, and blame the Conduct of his Providence;—others lay the Blame of adverſe Events upon <hi>Second Cauſes,</hi> in ſuch a Manner, as if there was no <hi>Firſt Mover,</hi> and <hi>Sovereign Diſpoſer</hi> of Events; but as tho' all depended upon human Foreſight, Prudence, and Bravery.</p>
            <p>As to the Conduct of Divine Providence towards us, and the Equity of it, in the late Defeat, it has been ſufficiently vindicated in the preceding Diſcourſe, by the Conſideration of our <hi>Sinfulneſs</hi> and <hi>Unworthineſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the <hi>General,</hi> he was a brave experienc'd Warrior, in the <hi>Regular Way,</hi> who had, by his good Behaviour in Military Affairs, deſerved well of his King and Country;—and was in high Favour with thoſe who knew his Abilities:—His Merit recommended him to his Majeſty's Service in <hi>America.</hi>—But he had not Opportunity to acquaint himſelf with the <hi>Irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Manner</hi> of Fighting in this Country—And ſo he happen'd to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate.—</p>
            <p>When he fell into Difficulty and Danger, he exerted himſelf to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt;—and when the Caſe requir'd it, expoſed himſelf as much as if he had been a common Soldier, rather than deſert our Cauſe, or ſave himſelf by an inglorious Flight.—And his Example was follow'd by the Officers, who, 'tis ſaid, behav'd in the moſt gallant Manner; tho' they alſo were unacquainted with the <hi>American</hi> Way of Fighting.</p>
            <p>The Means of this Defeat were ordain'd and order'd by God: The procuring Cauſe was our Sins, eſpecially the <hi>Accurſed Thing.</hi> We, by our
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:007583_0015_102D7F55559D3FB8"/>
Sins, by our <hi>Self-Confidence,</hi> together with <hi>that</hi> which prevail'd in the Army, rendered him unable to ſtand before our Enemies.</p>
            <p>Wherefore,</p>
            <p n="5">5. Let us take up a Lamentation over our fallen General; and over our degenerate Land.</p>

            <p n="6">6. We advance now to an Argument of Excitation and Encouragement.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Juſtice</hi> of our <hi>Cauſe</hi>—The <hi>Succeſs</hi> already granted—The <hi>Proſpect of Advantage</hi> to ourſelves, and Poſterity—And the <hi>Impoſſibility</hi> of living by ſuch <hi>perfidicus.

            </p>
            <p>That our <hi>Cauſe is juſt and good,</hi> has of late been prov'd by <hi>ancient au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentic Records,</hi> and <hi>Hiſtories</hi> of Facts, both <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>French</hi>; and by the moſt ſolemn Treaties of <hi>Utrecht</hi> and <hi>Aix la Chapelle</hi>; the Conditions of which, have never yet been fulfill'd by the <hi>French</hi>;—and are never like to be, unleſs we compel them by Sword in Hand. 'Tis further evident, from their <hi>vaſt Encroachments</hi> upon our Lands, and the numerous Forts they have built thereon, to defend them, computed to be near <hi>fifty,</hi> great and ſmall;—and from the <hi>execrable Barbarities</hi> committed by them and their <hi>Indians</hi> upon the Inhabitants, even in Times of Peace <note n="*" place="bottom">

            <p>In ſo doing, we have a <hi>Proſpect of rich Advantages</hi> to follow <hi>us,</hi> and our <hi>Children</hi> after us:—Such as the Recovery of our Rights and Properties, and the Lands of our <hi>American</hi> Allies, that have been raviſh'd from them <note n="†" place="bottom">The preſent State of <hi>North-America.</hi>

            <p>As to the <hi>Impoſſibility</hi> of living by ſuch bad Neighbours as the <hi>French,</hi>— we may obſerve, That their repeated Practices give us ſufficient Reaſon to conclude, they are of as bad a Diſpoſition, as it is poſſible for human Creatures to be of, in this Life; and that they want nothing but <hi>Ability</hi> and <hi>Opportunity</hi> (which, bleſſed be God, has hitherto been withheld from them) to <hi>ſhow</hi> the World how <hi>bad</hi> they are—They are not only a numerous, war-like Nation, whereby they are become reſpectable and formidable in <hi>Europe</hi>; but they are ambitious, enterprizing, ſubtile, deceitful, perfidious, and extremely cruel: And all this, under the amiable and attractive Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance or Shew of Honeſty, Pleaſantry, Humanity, and Politeneſs; whereby they impoſe upon the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who are more honeſt, by Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and of a better natural Diſpoſition.—Their late Practice of <hi>burning, killing, torturing,</hi> and <hi>destroying,</hi> all they conquer in <hi>America,</hi> without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to <hi>Age</hi> or <hi>Sex,</hi> is moſt ſhocking—<hi>Come,</hi> ſay they, <hi>let us cut them off from being a People; that the Name of</hi> New-England <hi>may be remembred no

            <p>May it not then be expected, that the Conſideration of theſe Things, which are known Facts, ſhould awaken every Soul to <hi>ſtrict Caution,</hi> and <hi>reſolute Action,</hi> againſt <hi>ſuch</hi> an Enemy?—If we fight, we can <hi>but</hi> die; if not, we are <hi>ſure</hi> to die.—A ſad <hi>Dilemma</hi> this, <hi>Fight, or Die!</hi> For the <hi>French</hi> ſeem determined, if poſſible, to root us quite out of <hi>America</hi>; and not only ſo, but to diſpatch us out of the World; as if we were the moſt noxious Animals, and had not as good a Right to live upon God's Earth, and to breathe in his Air, as they have.—It is the Opinion of ſome, that they have <hi>private verbal</hi> Orders and Inſtructions, <hi>To give no Quarter to the</hi> Engliſh <hi>in</hi> America:—But whether they have, or not, their <hi>Practice</hi> is equally <hi>hurtful</hi> to us.—And ſhall we <hi>tamely ſuffer</hi> ſuch intolerable Abuſes? —Shall we <hi>lie down,</hi> like <hi>Lambs,</hi> to be ſlain, becauſe they would have us? —Shall we not rather <hi>rouſe,</hi> like <hi>Lions,</hi> and <hi>exert</hi> ourſelves, like <hi>Men?</hi>—</p>
            <p>To ARMS then—To ARMS, ye <hi>Deſcendants</hi> of ancient HEROES,— Ye <hi>Sons</hi> of Honor and Renown.—<hi>Riſe, ye Fathers</hi> of your Country— Let every <hi>noble Principle,</hi> that <hi>reſides</hi> in your Patriot-Breaſts, <hi>awaken</hi> into <hi>new Life</hi> and <hi>Action, excited</hi> by the <hi>beſt Motives,</hi> and <hi>inſpirited</hi> by the <hi>moſt glorious Cauſe,—Religion, Liberty, Self-defence.</hi> Let all your Faculties and Powers be <hi>employ'd,</hi> and every Drop of Blood in your Veins <hi>grow warm,</hi> and <hi>glow</hi> to a <hi>noble Ardor—Reſent, Revenge,</hi> your Country's Wrongs.—<hi>Make</hi> it appear, that by the <hi>Help</hi> of God, and of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> you will bear their Inſults and Cruelties no longer: That you can't endure to ſee your <hi>Wives</hi> (the dear Partners of your Joys and Sorrows) raviſh'd before your Eyes, rip'd up with Child, and inhumanly murder'd;—nor your tender Babes (the lively Pledges of your mutual Loves) daſh'd in Pieces againſt the Stones!—<hi>Horror to your Eyes!—Worſe than Death to your Hearts!—More painful</hi> than the Sword, which (ſoon after the <hi>killing</hi> Sight) <hi>pierces your own Bowels!</hi>—And let them know, that you are not uſed to be driven into your Churches, and there burnt alive with your Wives and Children;— tho' ſuch a Thing has lately been deviſed!</p>
            <p>And as the <hi>French</hi> have for a long Time, been the Plagues of <hi>Europe,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually embroiling the Nations, ſo now they are become the the <hi>Diſturbers</hi> and <hi>Incendiaries</hi> of <hi>America:</hi> and (it ſeems) have, without aſking Leave of

Heaven, doom'd us all to utter, ſwift Deſtruction, without the tedious Ceremony of an <hi>Inquiſition</hi>—Now then, let us lay theſe Things together, and ſay, Whether it does not <hi>behave</hi> us, as <hi>Men,</hi> as <hi>Eritons</hi> by Deſcent, and as <hi>Christians</hi> by Profeſſion, to <hi>awake</hi> from our Slumbers, to <hi>start</hi> from our Beds of Eaſe and Indolence; to <hi>Ruſh to Arms,</hi> and to <hi>Play the Man for our People, and for the Cities of our God: And let the Lord do that which ſeemeth good unto Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. I ſhall now cloſe the <hi>dark</hi> and <hi>tragic Scene,</hi> with a ſerious Exhortation to the <hi>Uſe of Means, conducive</hi> both to our <hi>temporal</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual Intereſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Particularly,</p>
            <p n="1">(1) Let us <hi>deviſe,</hi> and <hi>uſe</hi> ſuch Means, as will probably diſconcert the Schemes of the <hi>French,</hi> diſappoint their Devices, and break their Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.—As we have a ſubtile and deceitful Enemy to deal with, ſo we ought to be more ſtrictly upon our Guard, and to uſe thoſe Faculties with which we are endued (for all neceſſary and good Purpoſes) in prying into<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and diſcovering their Schemes, and Artifices; that we may be able to counter-plot and counter-act them. They often get as great Advantages by <hi>Artifice,</hi> as by <hi>Action</hi>: And why cannot we attempt ſomething of this Kind?—Why can we not believe they always intend to deceive us, when they dare; and order our Matters accordingly?—Are we obliged to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them, becauſe they ſpeak fair?—</p>
            <p>Perhaps it would be thought impertinent at this Time, if I ſhould inſiſt upon the <hi>Expediency</hi> and <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of building and repairing <hi>Caſtles, Forts,</hi> and other <hi>Places</hi> of <hi>Defence</hi>; and keeping them in <hi>good Order,</hi> and <hi>well furniſhed</hi> with <hi>all Kinds</hi> of war-like Stores:—But as this has been much ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> in many Places, I thought it might bear men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning at leaſt—<hi>among their Polities!</hi> For when they ſhould have them <hi>ready,</hi> they too often have them to <hi>build</hi> or <hi>repair</hi>;—notwithſtanding they ſee a deſigning, encroaching Enemy, <hi>fortifying all around</hi> them, even in Times of Peace.—But as we have begun to <hi>reviſe</hi> our <hi>Politics,</hi> it is to be hoped we ſhall <hi>deſcry</hi> their <hi>Defects,</hi> and <hi>mend</hi> them in Time.</p>
            <p>As to our <hi>Militia</hi>—a proper Care thereof has been as much neglected, in ſome Governments, as our Fortifications, tho' it is a <hi>neceſſary Mean</hi> of Self-Preſervation and Defence.—King <hi>David,</hi> that <hi>great Warrior</hi> and <hi>wiſe Politician,</hi> never loſt a Battle; and it was owing in Part to the good Care he took of the <hi>Militia,</hi> as the Means. And it would be no Diſparagement to our <hi>greateſt Generals,</hi> to imitate him herein; and to inſpire their Men with Ambition to excel in Military Feats and Exerciſes.—After the Defeat
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:007583_0020_102D7F5F0AB220F0"/>
of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Jonathan, David had them</hi> (the Officers) <hi>teach</hi> even <hi>the Children of</hi> Judah <hi>the Uſe of the Bow,</hi> which had been neglected by <hi>Saul</hi>; or it might have been a late Invention of the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> that had not been diſcover'd by him: But it prov'd his Overthrow; for <hi>the Archers ſhot at him, and wounded him ſore.</hi> It is good Policy to acquaint ourſelves with all the Arts of War in Uſe among our Enemies, that we may know how to defend ourſelves, and annoy them, when we come to an Engagement: And to take Care that none but <hi>able-bodied, effective Men, well diſciplin'd,</hi> be ſent out to fight <hi>thoſe Battles</hi> for us, upon which the <hi>Fate</hi> of our Country depends.—And the more firmly they are attach'd to the Government, in Defence of which they fight, the better—But what can be expected from a Number of raw, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſciplin'd, debauch'd, enfeebled, diſſaffected, Mortals?—And thoſe that are ſent to war, ought to be equip'd with every Thing neceſſary therefor; and to be ſent <hi>in due Seaſon</hi>; for <hi>great Advantages</hi> may be loſt by <hi>ſoort De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays</hi>; and a <hi>long Train</hi> of bad Conſequences follow. A vaſt Expence of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Blood, and Treaſure, may be ſaved by <hi>Diſpatch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>all the Governments</hi> ought to DO their Proportion in <hi>ſupplying Men and Money</hi>;—for it is mean and fordid for any to attempt to <hi>cast the Burden</hi> upon others.—All the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Colonies conſider'd <hi>collectively</hi> and <hi>politically,</hi> are <hi>one Body,</hi> tho' conſiſting of many Members. Ought not every Member then to do its Part, to preſerve the whole Body? For if the Head be cut off, all the reſt of the Members will ſoon wither and die. This then is a Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, that will ſoon diſcover who are public-ſpirited, and who are not. If every one, by <hi>Parſimony,</hi> ſhould try to <hi>ſave all,</hi> every one would <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly loſe all</hi> in a ſhort Time. But to give liberally upon ſuch great Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, is a Duty, that all, who have Ability, owe to their GREAT BENEFACTOR, to their King, their Country, Themſelves, and their Poſterity.—But here it ought to be noted, That Four of the moſt <hi>Northern</hi> Governments have exerted themſelves in ſo free and generous a Manner, that they have almoſt <hi>out-done</hi> themſelves; and can do but <hi>little more</hi> in any future Expeditions, unleſs they have ſuch Aſſiſtance from their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Country, as the Exigence and Extremity of their Caſe require.</p>
            <p>It is alſo neceſſary, that <hi>all the Governments cut off,</hi> as much as poſſible, <hi>all Supplies</hi> of Proviſion (which is one of the main Sinews of War) from the Enemy, both <hi>directly</hi> and <hi>indirectly,</hi> by breaking up that <hi>illegal, clandeſtine</hi> Trade, which ſome <hi>inteſtine</hi> Enemies to the Government, carry on in a Time of War. This will certainly do much toward the ſuppreſſing our
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:007583_0021_102D7F60F73A84F0"/>
public Enemies, and ſome think more, than all our Forces. For, if they are not ſupplied <hi>by</hi> and <hi>from Us,</hi> they muſt ſtarve in a ſhort Time, or ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render without fighting. And this will prevent the ſpilling vaſt Quantities of human Blood, which is too precious to be bartered away for <hi>French</hi> Commodities by our clandeſtine Traders;—a Set of ſhort-ſighted Men, whoſe Eyes are ſo full of the <hi>Duſt</hi> of <hi>preſent</hi> perſonal Gain, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not foreſee one of thoſe dreadful Conſequences of this their Practice, that will inevitably fall upon their Poſterity; and perhaps upon themſelves:— If ſo, their Blood will be upon their own Heads; and the Blood of their Country will, in a great Meaſure, be required at their Hands, in the Day of Judgment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Unanimity</hi> and a <hi>good Underſtanding</hi> among the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Governments in <hi>America,</hi> is another <hi>excellent</hi> and <hi>neceſſary Mean</hi> of ſaving the whole Country from the Ravages of the Enemy; and indeed from <hi>utter Ruin.</hi>—For while our <hi>Heads</hi> and <hi>Leaders</hi> are reſenting Affronts, and contending among themſelves about Points of Honor, as well as <hi>Duty,</hi> the important, and preſſing Affairs of Government, and of War, muſt be neglected.—In the mean Time, our Enemies are <hi>unanimous, vigilant, active,</hi> and <hi>ſwift</hi> as Eagles; never failing to ſeize thoſe Advantages, which our unhappy Diviſions, Contentions, and Delays, always give them.—Do not then the Exigence and Importance of our public Affairs require, that our <hi>civil Rulers,</hi> our <hi>Generals,</hi> and <hi>Officers,</hi> in ALL the Governments, pay ſo ſacred a Regard to the <hi>Great Truſt</hi> repoſed in them, as ſtrictly to guard againſt every Thing that tends to a <hi>Miſunderſtanding,</hi> and opens a Door to <hi>Contention</hi> and <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi>?—And to <hi>cultivate,</hi> as much as poſſible, a <hi>good Underſtanding</hi> among themſelves? This is excellent Policy, eſpecially in a Time of War; agreeable to our Saviour's Words, <hi>Mark</hi> 3.24, 25. <hi>If a Kingdom be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided againſt itſelf, that Kingdom cannot ſtand. And if a Houſe be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided againſt itſelf, that Houſe cannot ſtand.</hi> If the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Colonies in <hi>America</hi> be divided againſt themſelves, how <hi>can</hi> they ſtand, at ſuch a Time as this, when they have Need to UNITE their Councils, and collect their ſcatter'd Forces, and to pour them with Fury upon our <hi>invidious</hi> and <hi>perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous</hi> Enemies? If this ſhould be our Caſe (as there is ſome Reaſon to fear it may be) <hi>Great-Britain itſelf</hi> cannot ſave us from the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Indians.</hi> For God's Sake therefore, let both <hi>Rulers,</hi> and <hi>Generals,</hi> and <hi>People,</hi> hearken to the excellent Advice of <hi>Solomon,</hi> the wiſeſt of Kings, and of mere Men. <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.14. <hi>The Beginning of Strife, is as when one letteth out Water; therefore leave off Contention before it be meddled with.</hi>

               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:007583_0022_102D7F62B8CDAFE0"/>We proceed to another Branch of Exhortation.</p>
            <p n="2">(2) If we hope for Succeſs in War, let us put away all our Accurſed Things.</p>
            <p>There are many ſuch among us; and they muſt be put away; or they will <hi>bring down</hi> the <hi>Judgments of God</hi> upon our <hi>Fleets, Armies,</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces</hi>; and upon the <hi>whole Kingdom</hi>: They <hi>must be taken away,</hi> both <hi>Root</hi> and <hi>Branch,</hi> by <hi>Faith, Repentance,</hi> and <hi>Reformation.</hi> And when this Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is a more holy and humble People; then, but not till then, they will be a happy and bleſſed People: And God himſelf will delight to dwell with them. Let us all then, both Magiſtrates and Miniſters, Generals and Admirals, and the other Officers, with the common Soldiers and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines, be ſenſible of the <hi>Corruption</hi> of our Hearts, and the <hi>Wickedneſs</hi> of our Lives; and apply to the <hi>Blood</hi> of Chriſt for Pardon and Cleanſing. And having ſo done, let us <hi>repent in Duſt and Aſhes, and forſake all our evil Ways; and make our Ways and Doings good.</hi> And <hi>when our Ways pleaſe God, then he will make even our Enemies to be at Peace with us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Particularly, let us put away <hi>Drunkenneſs</hi> and <hi>Debauchery</hi> from our <hi>Cities</hi> and <hi>Camps.—Query,</hi> Are not lewd Women <hi>Accurſed Things</hi> in our Camps? Do any but <hi>ſuch</hi> follow Armies? Ought they not then to be taken away? Do Soldiers in the Field need any Thing to be done for them, which they cannot do well enough themſelves?</p>
            <p>And having made all the neceſſary Diſpoſitions for War with our Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Men, let us not <hi>bid Defiance</hi> to Heaven by our Sins; but put them away—And <hi>ſet up our Banners in the Name of the Lord</hi>; and no more <hi>venture</hi> out into the Field of Battle, under the Standard of <hi>Self-Sufficiency,</hi>—nor <hi>dare</hi> again to <hi>diſplay</hi> the Colours of <hi>Self-Confidence,</hi> ſince we have had ſuch ſad Experience of the Folly of <hi>truſting to an Arm of Fleſh,</hi> which is weak in itſelf, and eaſily broken— Nor let our Officers and Men dare to <hi>diſcharge Vollies</hi> of profane Oaths and Curſes againſt the <hi>Battlements</hi> of Heaven, as many of them daily do; whereby they ſeem <hi>profeſſedly</hi> to <hi>ſet out</hi> on an <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition againſt Heaven</hi>; and <hi>do practically beſiege</hi> the <hi>Throne itſelf</hi> of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Generals</hi> and <hi>Admirals,</hi> and their Officers, have it in their Power to do <hi>public Honor</hi> to the Great Name of God, by making and giving out Laws in their Camps, and Fleets, with a ſevere Penalty annext, forbidding pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane Swearing and Curſing; not neglecting <hi>duly to inflict</hi> the ſame, when <hi>incurr'd.</hi>—And they ſhould make it appear, by their <hi>own Converſation,</hi> that they <hi>reverence</hi> and <hi>fear that moſt holy and dreadful Name.</hi>—And the only <hi>Strife</hi> among Civil and Military Officers, ſhould be, <hi>Who</hi> among them ſhall be

the <hi>moſt virtuous</hi> and <hi>exemplary</hi>; and <hi>who</hi> ſhall do the <hi>beſt Service</hi> for their King and Country.</p>
            <p>To proceed,</p>
            <p n="3">(3) Let us adjoin <hi>Prayer</hi> to Almighty God, as a ſpecial appointed Means of <hi>Succeſs,</hi> in all our Enterprizes.</p>
            <p>God is to be <hi>acknowledged</hi> in all our Ways, <hi>by Prayer,</hi> eſpecially in our <hi>Wars.</hi> And for an Encouragement to this Duty, He ſtyles himſelf, <hi>A God bearing Prayer.</hi>—When he had made large Promiſes, to the <hi>Jews</hi> in Captivity, of temporal and ſpiritual Bleſſings, He ſubjoins, <hi>Yet for all this, will I be enquired of by the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>to do it for them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As therefore we have taken the <hi>Sword</hi> in one Hand, we ought to take <hi>Prayer</hi> in the other. You may <hi>pray and fight,</hi> at the ſame Time: And the more ardently you pray for God's Bleſſing and Protection, the more likely you will be to do good Execution among your Enemies; and to eſcape with your own Lives too. All they that go forth to war, ought to <hi>exerciſe</hi> and <hi>expreſs</hi> a <hi>humble Dependance</hi> upon the Lord of Hoſts, and to <hi>truſt</hi> in Him for Safety. <hi>For the Battle is His, and he giveth it to whomſoever be pleaſeth.</hi>

            <p>Let us then pray, that God Almighty would be pleaſed to bleſs and preſerve <hi>King GEORGE,</hi> and the whole <hi>Royal-Family</hi>—and the <hi>Britiſh Miniſtry</hi>: That he would bleſs our <hi>Governors</hi> and <hi>Counſellors</hi>; our <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals</hi> and <hi>Admirals,</hi>—and make them the <hi>Guardians</hi> of our ſpiritual Privile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and civil Liberties; and the <hi>Aſſertors</hi> and <hi>Defenders</hi> of our Rights and Properties—That he would make our <hi>Armies couragious, valiant,</hi> and <hi>victorious</hi>—That he would <hi>cover their Heads in the Day of Battle</hi>—And that they may go on from conquering to conquer, till ALL our Enemies ſhall be <hi>ſubdued</hi> under us—That he would prepare us for ſo great a Mercy, by <hi>pouring out his Spirit upon us,</hi> and <hi>his Bleſſing upon our Offspring</hi>; and thereby diſpoſe us to a <hi>thorough Reformation l—But let thine Enemies periſh, O God, ſcatter thou the People, that delight in War.—Let God ariſe, let his Enemies be ſcattered, let them that hate him, ſhe before him: As Wax melteth before the Fire, ſo let them be conſumed at thy Preſence: For thou, Lord, art great in</hi> Zion: <hi>Thou art high above all People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Fathers and Brethren,</hi> if we do theſe Things aright, no doubt God will be <hi>for us,</hi> and enable us to <hi>ſtand before our Enemies.</hi>—Then ſhall our Armies return from Battle crowned with Victory, and cloathed with Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph—<hi>rejoicing in the Salvation of the Lord,</hi> and <hi>triumphing in his Promiſe.</hi>
            </p>

               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:007583_0024_102D7F66A8046E38"/>To conclude,</p>
            <p n="4">(4) Let us all liſt under the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by Faith, who is the Captain of Salvation; and then we ſhall be able to <hi>ſtand before</hi> ALL <hi>our Enemies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Being ſenſible, dear Friends, of your Captivity and Bondage to Sin and Satan, you ſhould learn your Need of the Ranſom which Chriſt has paid to Divine Juſtice for guilty Men, which was his own Blood—a Price of infinite Value!—He became <hi>obedient to Death, even the Death of the Croſs,</hi> that Sinners might have Life.—This is the <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> that he wrought out, the <hi>Ranſom</hi> that he paid, for ſuch as were condemn'd to die by the Law, and to be tormented forever, for their many Rebellions and Hoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities againſt the King of Heaven. But, tho' ye are Rebels by Nature, and condemned to die by Law; yet, if you will come and liſt under the <hi>Captain of Salvation,</hi> and ſubmit to Him, on his Terms, you ſhall be <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd, accepted,</hi> and <hi>ſaved</hi>: For he is the Great Captain of all the Forces, that are raiſed, and to be raiſed, in the Church-militant!—And as ſoon as you inliſt, you ſhall be intitled to the Large Bounty which he has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd in the Proclamation of Grace:—And for the Service you perform in his ſpiritual Kingdom, you ſhall be rewarded with a Crown of Glory in Heaven.—But ſuch is the <hi>Enmity of your carnal Minds</hi> againſt him, that you will never become <hi>Voluntiers,</hi> till you are made <hi>willing in the Day of his Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, you ought to conſider, that when you are inliſted among his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, you will ſoon <hi>receive Orders to march out into the Field of Battle, and to engage with Principalities and Powers,</hi> with the <hi>Rulers of the Darkneſs of this World,</hi> and with <hi>wicked Spirits</hi> in <hi>heavenly Places.</hi> In this Caſe, you muſt by no Means deſert your Colours, but <hi>put on the whole Armour of God,</hi> and <hi>fight the good Fight of Faith,</hi> as you hope to <hi>lay hold on eternal Life.</hi> And in order to this, you muſt obey the Inſtructions which he has given by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> which are recorded in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> 6.10.— <hi>Finally, my Brethren, be ſtrong in the Lord, and in the Power of his Might. Put on the whole Armour of God, that ye may be able to ſtand againſt the Wiles of the Devil.—Take unto you the whole Armour of God, that ye may be able to withſtand in the evil Day; and having done all, to ſtand. STAND there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, having your Loins girt about with Truth, and having on the Breaſt plate of Righteouſneſs; and your Feet ſhed with the Preparation of the Goſpel of Peace: Above all, taking the Shield of Faith, whereby ye ſhall be able to quench all the fiery Darts of the Wicked<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And take the Helmet of Salvation, and the
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:007583_0025_102D7F68CE933B50"/>
Sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God.</hi> You muſt learn the Art of <hi>uſing ſkilfully the Shield of Faith,</hi> or you will be often wounded by the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal Archers,</hi> who ſhoot no other than <hi>fiery Darts</hi>;—and of <hi>handling dexterouſly the Sword of the Spirit,</hi> or you will never overcome them. And you muſt be continually upon your Guard, <hi>watching againſt their Devices,</hi> that you may never be ſurprized; but always ready to <hi>withſtand their Wiles,</hi> by the Force of <hi>constant Prayer and Supplication in the Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now you muſt <hi>stand strong,</hi> fight couragiouſly in the ſpiritual War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, and ſhew yourſelves valiant Soldiers of the Captain of Salvation. And you may be aſſur'd, that as it is the Son of God, who is ſtyl'd <hi>the Captain of the Lord's Hosts,</hi> that leads you out into the Field of Battle; ſo, he will be your CHAMPION, to bring you off <hi>more than Conquerors,</hi> at laſt.</p>
            <p>Having therefore inliſted <hi>under</hi> Him, you ſhould encourage yourſelves <hi>in</hi> Him, upon <hi>every Appearance of Danger</hi>;—and be <hi>ſtrong</hi> upon all <hi>Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</hi>—Let not your <hi>Graces</hi> be like the <hi>Soldiers</hi> of <hi>Saul,</hi> who <hi>ſtood</hi> with him trembling, but like the <hi>Worthies</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> able to <hi>break thro'</hi> an Hoſt of Enemies, and draw Water at the Wells of Salvation.—And if at any Time you ſhould be wounded and ſoiled, <hi>look</hi> to your <hi>Leader,</hi> and he will <hi>heal</hi> you, and <hi>raiſe</hi> you up; for he is <hi>all-ſufficient.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>be then faithful to the Death</hi> (for thou muſt <hi>once</hi> paſs through <hi>that gloomy Vale,</hi> either in a natural or violent Way, to the bright triumphant World above) and then, tho' thou waſt ranked among the meaneſt of his Followers here, thou ſhalt be array'd and adorn'd with a Palm of final Victory, a Diadem of immaculate Beauty, and a Crown of immortal Glory; and ſhalt live and reign with Him in His Kingdom; where there is no Noiſe nor Rumour of War, but <hi>all the Region is everlaſting Peace.</hi>— Where ſits the PRINCE of Peace, in <hi>State</hi> of Glory, on his Throne, in the Midſt of <hi>Myriads</hi> of bleſſed Spirits; the <hi>Delight</hi> of every Eye, the <hi>Joy</hi> of every Heart, the <hi>ſupreme</hi> Reſt and Satisfaction of every happy Soul. To whom be GLORY, DOMINION, and POWER forever. <hi>AMEN.</hi>
