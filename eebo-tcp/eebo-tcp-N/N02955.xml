            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>Held the 25th Day of the <hi>Sixth Month,</hi> 1732, <hi>Concerning Children and Servants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT is an obvious and known Truth, that next to the Vigilance we ought to have over our own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, ſo as to ſtand accepted in the Sight of God, and to behave inoffenſively and exemplarily towards Men, is the comely and neceſſary Care for Poſterity, and over our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:003544_0002_0FF85CBCE422A410"/>
THIS Care is highly prudent, and an incumbent Duty, in Families, in Schools, and in Societies; for in general it may be ſaid and expected, That the Morals and Principles which are firſt imprinted will be of Duration, and if good, of great Advantage, ſince in the Courſe of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, the Children of this Age are to be the People of the next.</p>
            <p>REMARKABLE and grievous is the Depravity of Manners ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable in our Streets; ſorrowful enough is it to ſee the great Encreaſe of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſs and Lewdneſs, too generally among the People of late Years, much owing to the Importation of great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the vicious and ſcandalous Refuſe of other Countries. But it is yet more to be lamented by every honeſt Mind who wiſh well, and would contribute all in their Power to the Reputation, Sobriety, and future Happineſs of the Province, and are truely concerned for the Honour of God, and true Religion, to obſerve the rude Behaviour and vile Language, uſed and propogated among the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren almoſt as ſoon as they can ſpeak.</p>
            <p>AS this is become ſo publick and
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:003544_0003_0FF85CBE695C64E8"/>
conſpicuous an Evil, it is to be hoped, and earneſtly deſired, that the well-minded and ſober Inhabitants of all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſions, may uſe all Diligence, and think of proper Means to redreſs it, for the more general the Purpoſe and Endeavours are, the more eaſily will the good End be obtained.</p>
            <p>A Concern having been for ſome Time on the Minds of ſeveral Friends, on this Occaſion, this Meeting finds it highly neceſſary, to make ſome Eſſay towards a Reformation of the Evil. And conſidering, that it chiefly, and almoſt entirely will lie upon the Heads of Families, Parents and Tutors, we recommend the Caſe generally to them, and earneſtly preſs and entreat, that they will enter more deeply and cloſely into the Thoughts of their Duty, and at proper Times of Retirement, humbly and earneſtly implore the Divine Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and then diligently and conſtantly purſue what they find to be ſuch, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Wearineſs or Diſcouragement at the Difficulties or Diſappointments they may meet with: And although much muſt be left to the Vigilance and Care of 
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:003544_0004_0FF85CC1531C0F30"/>
thoſe, as Occaſion may call and excite them, yet on the Part of our Community, we for the preſent recommend and adviſe ſome Methods, which we hope may contribute towards the deſired Effect, and prevent much of the Diſorder among our own.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1ſt,</hi> That Parents do not ſuffer an indiſcreet and partial (and as it may prove ruinous) Fondneſs, to miſguide their Judgments, by hearkening to, and taking Part with their Children, againſt the due Correction which their School-Maſters or School-Miſtreſſes may uſe, or the Reproofs and Complaints of them, or other Friends, for their vicious or evil Behaviour, but, that Parents hear with Temper and Moderation, and where there appears juſt Cauſe, joyn their Authority for the Reproof or Correction of their Children, avoiding to vindicate or ſupport them with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment; but if they ſhould find any Degree of Vindication or Excuſe to be juſt, that they do it with Calmneſs and Prudence, and (unleſs the contrary be really neceſſary) out of the Hearing of their Children.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:003544_0005_0FF85CC536EA9418"/>
               <hi>2d,</hi> That Children be kept punctually to the Hours of School, and that at breaking up, they go directly to their reſpective Homes: It is deſired, that both Parents, School-Maſters and School-Miſtreſſes joyn their Authority and ſtrict Care in this Reſpect, which may prevent in good Meaſure, their falling into bad Company, and evil Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3d,</hi> That Parents be very cautious and watchful in the Liberties they give their Children, for Play or Recreation, limitting and obliging them as much as poſſible, to Punctuality, as to Time, Place and Company; accuſtoming them in an eaſy free Manner, to render true Accounts thereof; which they will be brought to do, and to receive Advice and Direction, if managed mildly, and in Love, without Brow-beating, or ſtriking Terror; unleſs it be on extraordinary and proper Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>4th,</hi> That School-Maſters and School-Miſtreſſes do ſeriouſly conſider the Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling they undertake, which conſiſts as much in the well forming the Morals of their Pupils, inculcating Obedience 
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:003544_0006_0FF85CC6DD91C360"/>
to their Parents and Superiours, and generally a decent &amp; becoming Behaviour, as in a juſt Care to forward and improve them in the Literature they profeſs to teach: Alſo, that they cauſe the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren under their Care, to come to Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and there attend with them, order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them at all Times, when there is Room, to ſit together conveniently, ſo as they may obſerve their Behaviour, taking proper Times in their Schools, to commend and encourage ſuch as behave ſoberly and orderly, and to reprimand and admoniſh thoſe who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have otherwiſe.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <hi>5th,</hi> The great Error of giving Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection rather from their own Paſſion, than the Import or Conſequence of the Fault, ſhould be carefully avoided both by Parents and Tutors: Few Things, very few in ſome Children, require bodily Correction; <hi>willful</hi> and <hi>habitual Lying,</hi> and <hi>obſtinate Diſobedience,</hi> ſeem to be the main Faults to which that ſhould be apply'd; to inculcate a Senſe of <hi>Shame</hi> and <hi>Diſrepute</hi> on the one hand, and a <hi>laudable Emulation</hi> on the other, is a beneficial Art in the Inſtructor.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:003544_0007_0FF85CC99FFE1BF8"/>
               <hi>6th,</hi> And whereas it is apparent, that much of the Diſorder complained of, is owing to the great Neglect in well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>governing and reſtraining of Apprentices and Servants, as well as Children; and probably more ſo, by the unreaſonable Liberties they take, and the ill Example they ſhew to Children: It is therefore deſired and urgently preſs'd, that ſuch of our Friends as are Maſters and Miſtreſſes, do alſo conſider well their Duty in that Station, eſpecially towards Apprentices, over whom they, in a manner, ſtand in the Place of Parents during their Contract; and both by Example and Precept, earneſtly endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to conduct them right in a Senſe of Religion, and a ſober and orderly Behaviour, which, it may be hoped, will make durable Impreſſions on them, highly beneficial in their grown State, and cauſe them to remember you, and the Time of their Service with Pleaſure and Gratitude.</p>
            <p>Let <hi>Apprentices</hi> and <hi>Servants</hi> therefore, as well as <hi>Children</hi> be encouraged to go to Meetings, eſpecially on <hi>Firſt Days,</hi> 
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:003544_0008_0FF85CCC369DDB78"/>
and there to ſit ſoberly and orderly, and ſtay the Time; for its obſerved with Grief, the Liberty taken by thoſe to ramble and ſtroll about Streets, and the adjacent Parts of the Town, or gather into Companies at idle or rude Sports or Games, on the firſt Days of the Week, and at other Times when they are not held to Labour or Buſineſs, to the great Reproach of the Place, and highly ſcandalous to Sobriety and good order; and as the Magiſtrates of the City have ſometimes uſed Means to prevent thoſe and the like Diſorders, with a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Succeſs; the reſolute Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of their Endeavours is hoped, and it is earneſtly deſired of all our Friends who are concerned therein, as Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, Conſtables, or otherwiſe, that they contribute all in their Power, in their reſpective Stations, to a Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſo neceſſary and laudable; which will make the Care and Endeavours of the Heads of Families much more eaſy and effectual.</p>
