            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>But let us Enquire a little more particularly.</p>
            <p>Queſtion I. What are the <hi>Means,</hi> whereby our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:000926_0014_0FACA349650A0A58"/>
               <hi>Phyſician</hi> of our Souls, does <hi>Heal</hi> our <hi>Soul-Diſeaſes</hi>?</p>
            <p>It is thus Anſwered.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The <hi>Blood</hi> of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, is the <hi>Grand Medicine</hi> of our Souls. Oh! the admirable, aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Riddle</hi> of the Goſpel! <hi>Fuſus eſt ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis Medici, et factum eſt Medicamentum phrenetici,</hi> was the ancient Admiration! The <hi>Blood</hi> of our <hi>Phyſician,</hi> is the Great <hi>Medicine</hi> for all our <hi>Diſeaſes.</hi> It was the Song of his praiſe, Rev. 1.5. <hi>He hath Loved us, &amp; Waſhed us,</hi> (and ſo Heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us) <hi>from our Sins, in His own Blood.</hi> The <hi>Blood</hi> of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, is a <hi>Sin-pardoning Blood,</hi> and a <hi>Sin-ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Blood,</hi> and all the Help that we have againſt our <hi>Sin</hi> lies in the <hi>Blood</hi> of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſhed for our <hi>Sin.</hi> We are told, 1 Joh. 1.7. <hi>The Blood of Jeſus Chriſt Cleanſeth,</hi> (&amp; ſo Healeth) <hi>from all Sin.</hi> Our <hi>Sin</hi> has made fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Wounds</hi> in our Souls: but from the <hi>Wounded ſide</hi> of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, there has dropt that <hi>Blood,</hi> which is a <hi>Soveraign Balſame</hi> for all our <hi>Wounds.</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:000926_0015_0FACA34A2C5EB038"/>
Hence tis ſaid, Iſa. 53.5. <hi>He was woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for our Tranſgreſſions, He was bruiſed for our Iniquities, and with His ſtripes we are Healed.</hi> Thus,
<q>Vulneribus Chriſts fit Medicina meis.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But, Secondly; The <hi>Spirit</hi> of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Applies</hi> the <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine</hi> to our <hi>Souls.</hi> Our <hi>Soul</hi> is <hi>Healed</hi> of <hi>Sin,</hi> by that <hi>Grace,</hi> which the <hi>Blood</hi> of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt has purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.

A <hi>Soul</hi> is <hi>Healed</hi> in its <hi>Converſion</hi> unto God: Sayes the prophet, <hi>If they Convert, they be Healed</hi> Now a <hi>Converſion</hi> is wrought by the Holy <hi>Spirit</hi> upon the Soul. It was ſaid of ſome, Act. 11.21. <hi>The Hand of the Lord</hi> [that is to ſay, The Spirit of the Lord,] <hi>was with them, and a Great Number Believed, and Turned unto the Lord.</hi> Men will never <hi>Turn unto the Lord,</hi> until the <hi>Spirit of the Lord</hi> ſhall

<pb n="17" facs="unknown:000926_0017_0FACA34BA7EC0C08"/>
firſt hopefully begun the <hi>Cure</hi> of a Soul, the <hi>Sacraments</hi> are then to carry on the <hi>Cure.</hi> Hence it was ſaid, Ezek. 47.9. <hi>The waters of the Sanctuary are for Healing.</hi> Indeed, it is a prepoſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Thing, to give the <hi>Eucharist</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, that are altogether Uncured. <hi>That</hi> I had almoſt called, <hi>Quack-Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity.</hi> But when the <hi>Word</hi> of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt has in a meaſure diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the Soul for it, then the <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> of the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> are ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Chriſtian, Though thou haſt a very <hi>Sick Soul</hi> in thee, yet thou mayſt venture to come.

The <hi>Comforts</hi> beſtowed upon us; Theſe are to bring our Souls into Frame, &amp; <hi>Lead us unto Repentance.</hi> The <hi>Sorrows</hi> inflicted upon us; Theſe are to make our Souls Better, and hereby our <hi>Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity is purged.</hi>

            <p>Queſtion II. What is that <hi>Healing</hi> which the <hi>Phyſician</hi> of our Souls, does by theſe <hi>Means</hi> Convey unto us?</p>
            <p>To this the Anſwer is;</p>
            <p>This <hi>Healing</hi> is the whole <hi>Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt: It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talus all the <hi>Benefits</hi> that flow to us, from His Alſufficient <hi>Mediation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Very particularly;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iuſtification</hi> is one thing, in the <hi>Healing</hi> of a Soul. When the <hi>Good Lord Pardoned the people,</hi> 'tis ſaid, 2 Chron. 30.20. <hi>The Lord Healed the people.</hi> When Sin is <hi>Forgiven,</hi> 'tis <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered</hi> by a Divine <hi>Plaiſter,</hi> and ſo the Soul is <hi>Healed.</hi> When the Prophet ſayes, <hi>Leſt they Convert and be Healed,</hi> the Evangeliſt renders it, <hi>Leſt they ſhould be Converted, &amp; their Sins ſhould be Forgiven them.</hi> We read, Iſa. 33.24. <hi>The Inhabitant ſhall not ſay I am Sick, the people ſhall be Forgiven their Iniquity.</hi> Truly, a Soul ſayes, <hi>I am no more ſo ſick, as once I was,</hi> when a man is <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given his Iniquity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:000926_0019_0FACA34D2B40B930"/>
               <hi>Sanctification</hi> is another thing in the <hi>Healing</hi> of the Soul. A Soul is made <hi>Healthy</hi> when 'tis made <hi>Holy.</hi> In <hi>Sanctifying</hi> a Soul, the Lord fulfils what is written, Jer. 30.17. <hi>I will Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore Health unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy Wounds.</hi> The Soul is <hi>Viciated</hi> by Sin. To Extinguish, and Extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate the <hi>Vices</hi> of the Soul, is to <hi>Heal</hi> the Soul. A <hi>Sanctified</hi> Soul is an <hi>Healed</hi> one, becauſe the <hi>Vic<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> of it are taken away. By <hi>Holineſs</hi> the loſt <hi>Image</hi> of God is Renewed in the Soul; and all the powers of the Soul are brought into a better Temper, and Order.</p>
            <p>And then, in the <hi>Healing</hi> of the Soul, there is <hi>Conſolation</hi> alſo. This is the <hi>Healing</hi> of the <hi>Broken in Heart</hi>; and a making of <hi>Broken Bones to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce.</hi> Thus 'tis ſaid, Iſa. 57.18. <hi>I will Heal him, &amp; Reſtore Comforts unto him.</hi> A <hi>Sad</hi> Soul is a <hi>Sick</hi> Soul. A <hi>Grieved</hi> Spirit, a <hi>Fearful</hi> Spirit, is a <hi>Wounded</hi> Spirit. The <hi>Oyl of Gladneſs</hi> poured into the Soul, by the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the New Covenant, is the <hi>Heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of the Soul.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:000926_0020_0FACA34DF301F3F0"/>Well, but who ſhall be partakers of this <hi>Healing?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. The Bleſſed <hi>Healer of Souls,</hi> will not <hi>Heal</hi> the <hi>Diſeaſes</hi> in the Souls of men, until He has made them <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible</hi> of their <hi>Diſeaſes.</hi> Men muſt be <hi>Sick,</hi> before the Lord will <hi>Heal</hi> them; that is to ſay, <hi>Senſibly Sick.</hi> It is not every <hi>Sick</hi> man that ſhall be <hi>Heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> by the Lord, but they who are ſo <hi>Sick,</hi> as to ſee and feel that they <hi>need a Phyſician.</hi> There muſt be a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction</hi> of Sin, to prepare men for their <hi>Deliverance</hi> from Sin.</p>

A man muſt be <hi>Senſible</hi> of his own <hi>Sinfulneſs.</hi> A <hi>Senſible Sick</hi> Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, is One that ſees himſelf a <hi>Sinner,</hi> and bemoans himſelf like him, Luk. 18.13. <hi>God be merciful to me a Sinner.</hi> He ſees himſelf a Sinner by <hi>Nature.</hi> He ſayes with the <hi>Senſible</hi> Pſalmiſt, <hi>Behold, I was ſhapen in Iniquity, and in Sin did my Mother Conceive me.</hi> He ſees himſelf a Sinner by <hi>Practice.</hi> He ſayes with the <hi>Senſible</hi> People, <hi>My Tranſgreſſions are multiplied before God, and my Sins testify againſt me.</hi> Yea, he ſees himſelf Diſtempered and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered, by <hi>Innumerable Sins</hi>: he ſayes with him, Pſal. 40.12. <hi>Innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Evils have compaſſed me about, mine Iniquities have taken hold upon me.</hi> A Soul <hi>Senſibly Sick</hi> is no <hi>Self-Justici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary.</hi> He Cryes out, <hi>Lord, I am Vile: I am a Sinful Wretch; my best, my fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and fineſt Works, are but ſplendid Sins<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> my Holy Things are Iniquities, I am a meer Lump of Sin; there dwells no Good thing in me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:000926_0023_0FACA3518BCF48F0"/>Secondly. A man muſt be <hi>Senſible,</hi> that <hi>Sin</hi> has Expoſed him to <hi>Every ſort of Evil.</hi> He muſt ſay, in Lam. 5.16. <hi>Wo is unto me, that I have Sinned.</hi> He is a <hi>Sick</hi> man indeed, that ſees <hi>Death,</hi> and nothing but <hi>Death</hi> before him. A Soul <hi>Senſibly Sick,</hi> ſees the <hi>Death,</hi> whereto he is by <hi>Sin</hi> become obnoxious. There is a Terror ſtruck into ſuch a Soul, by ſuch a Thought as That, Rom. 6.23. <hi>The wages of Sin is Death.</hi> Such a Soul, is caſt into an Agony of Conſternation and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhment at the Condition, which it is by Sin brought into. It ſees it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Siezed by the dreadful Wrath &amp; Curſe of God, &amp; ſhrieks, <hi>Oh! Wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed One that I am</hi>! Theſe, Theſe are the Soliloques of a <hi>Sin Sick</hi> Soul; <hi>Alas, What ſhall I do? Where ſhall I go? I am Condemned by the Law of God; All the Threatnings and Thunders of it, are directed againſt me. The Chains of Hell are upon me, and I am held faſt in the Bond of Iniquity; and</hi> I <hi>am a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of the Mighty: And if I Dy in this
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:000926_0024_0FACA351B17F3038"/>
Condition, what, what will become of me throughout Eternal Ages?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly; A man muſt be <hi>Senſible,</hi> that <hi>Sin</hi> is indeed the <hi>Worſt ſort of Evil.</hi> He muſt call it, as 'tis call'd, Jer. 44.4. <hi>The Abominable thing.</hi> That man is indeed <hi>Sick,</hi> who feels it a worſe thing to be <hi>Sick,</hi> than to be <hi>Poor,</hi> and <hi>Mean</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and labour under ten thouſand other Inconveniences. A Soul <hi>Senſibly Sick,</hi> looks upon <hi>Sin</hi> as the worſt miſery imaginable: There appears nothing ſo miſerable unto ſuch a Soul, as to ly under <hi>Sin.</hi> As 'tis ſaid of one, Heb. 11.25. <hi>He Choſe rather to ſuffer Affliction, with the People of God, than to enjoy the Pleaſures of Sin</hi>; So, ſuch a Soul counts the moſt <hi>Pleaſant Sin,</hi> more bitter, than the moſt <hi>bitter Affliction.</hi> Yea, the Sin which was once the chief Pleaſure of ſuch a Soul, now becomes <hi>more Bitter than Death.</hi> A <hi>Sin-Sick</hi> Soul, makes Ejulations and Exclamations of this Importance; <hi>What a forlorn Creature am I! Better work it for my Body to be
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:000926_0025_0FACA352653FA8E8"/>
Blind, than for my Soul to ly under this Blindneſs; Better for my Body to be Lame, than for my Soul to ly under this Lame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that my Sin has brought upon me. Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter were it for me to ly under any pining Sickneſs, than to have a Soul pining away in its Iniquities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly. A man muſt be <hi>Senſible,</hi> that he cannot be his <hi>own Saviour <hi>from Sin</hi>,</hi> or the <hi>Healer</hi> of his own Soul. A Soul <hi>Senſibly Sick,</hi> is that in Luk. 19.10. <hi>That which is Lost</hi>; a Soul at an utter <hi>Loſs,</hi> about its own Recovery. Then is a man <hi>Sick</hi> to purpoſe, when he ſees that he can't heal or help himſelf. A <hi>Sin-ſick</hi> Soul, is one that utterly deſpairs of <hi>Healing</hi> his own <hi>Sickneſs</hi>: but ſayes with the Pſalmiſt, Pſal. 65.12. <hi>The Lord only is my Salvation.</hi> A Soul <hi>Senſibly Sick,</hi> feels an infinite load of <hi>Sin</hi> lying up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it ſelf, and ſees it ſelf utterly una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to remove the leaſt part of that load. Such a Soul Cryes out, <hi>I am nothing, I can deſerve nothing, I can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form nothing</hi>! Yea, all Humane Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefs,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:000926_0026_0FACA353291CA0B0"/>
do fail ſuch a Soul; all Creatures appear inſufficient, and inſignificant, and <hi>Phyſicians of no value</hi> unto it. Theſe are the <hi>Sick,</hi> to whom the Lord Himſelf will be the <hi>Phyſician</hi>!</p>
            <p>Let us Apply theſe <hi>Faithful ſayings.</hi>
            </p>
            <div type="application">
               <head>APPLICATION.</head>
               <p n="1">I. Repair, O <hi>Sick Souls,</hi> Repair un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord JESUS CHRIST, for the <hi>Healing</hi> of your <hi>Sickneſs,</hi> your <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Sickneſs.</hi> We are a Congregation of <hi>Sick Souls</hi>: Where am I Preaching, Sirs, but in an <hi>Hoſpital?</hi> If there be any One Soul in the Congregation, ſo <hi>Whole,</hi> as to <hi>need no Phyſician,</hi> Be gone, O Soul, be gone: Why doſt thou tarry here? <hi>Heaven</hi> is the only place for ſuch a Soul. But indeed, if any <hi>Soul</hi> be ſo Conceited of it ſelf, that <hi>it need no Phyſician,</hi> there is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good to ſay, That there is no <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

deſperate Symptomes of a <hi>Sickneſs,</hi> that will End in <hi>Hell,</hi> and bring to <hi>Hell,</hi> at the laſt!</p>
               <p>Wherefore, Let every Soul now, be found lying at the feet of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, with that Cry, Pſal 41.4. <hi>Lord, be Merciful unto me, Heal my Soul, for I have Sinned againſt thee.</hi> And with that Cry, Pſal. 116.4. <hi>The Sorrows of Death compaſs me— O Lord, I beſeech thee, Deliuer my Soul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I call to mind, the words uſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord-General of <hi>Syria,</hi> labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under a <hi>Leproſy,</hi> 2 King. 5.3. <hi>I would my Lord were with the Prophet, that is in Samaria, for he would recover him of his Leproſy.</hi> Even ſo would I ſay; <hi>I would thy Soul were applying it ſelf unto the Lord Jeſus Christ, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour that is in the Heavens; for He would Recover thy Soul of all its Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea, Let us go to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, for the <hi>Sick</hi> Souls, that <hi>Cannot,</hi> and <hi>Will not</hi> (their <hi>Cannot,</hi> is indeed
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:000926_0028_0FACA354A8727248"/>
a <hi>Will not</hi>!) go for themſelves. We read, Mat. 9.3. <hi>Behold, They brought unto Him, a man Sick, and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus ſeeing THEIR Faith, ſaid unto the Sick, Son be of Good Cheer.</hi> Thus, let us go to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, for our <hi>Sick</hi> Neighbours, and eſpecially for our <hi>Sick</hi> Children, and other ſuch <hi>Relatives,</hi> who may be, by Sin indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed unto the <hi>Thing that is Good</hi>; and plead, <hi>Lord, I have ſuch Friends that are yet Strangers to thy Fear, and that follow theſe and thoſe Evil Courſes; Oh, Take them into thy Healing Hands, and Heal them, and Help them, and Change them, and put thy Fear into their Hearts, I pray thee, I pray thee</hi>! Who can tell, what the Lord will do for them, when He ſees <hi>YO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>R Faith</hi> ſo concerned for them?</p>
               <p>Conſider, What a <hi>Phyſician,</hi> O Periſhing Souls, what a Glorious <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician</hi> you are invited unto.</p>

Be thy Soul never ſo Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, and never ſo Forlorn, and never ſo Dead, yet mayſt thou come to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, with ſuch terms as thoſe, Matth. 8.2. <hi>Lord, if thou wilt, thou canſt</hi> help me!</p>
               <p>Again;</p>
               <p>You have a <hi>Phyſician,</hi> and He is a <hi>Gracious <hi>Phyſician</hi>.</hi> All may <hi>Come</hi> unto Him, and <hi>Welcome</hi>: He ſayes, Joh. 6.37. <hi>Him that Cometh unto me, I will in no wiſe Cast out.</hi> Here is a <hi>Phyſician,</hi> that calls upon <hi>All</hi> to <hi>Look unto Him, and be Healed,</hi> yea, and that will <hi>Heal</hi> them for a <hi>Look.</hi> He <hi>Offers</hi> His Kindneſſes to every One of us all; even to the <hi>Poor</hi> as well as the <hi>Rich</hi>: and all upon Free-Coſt.
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:000926_0030_0FACA37BF47BC2B0"/>
How obligingly does He ſpeak, Iſa. 55.2. <hi>Come without Money, and without Price</hi>! He not only ſayes, <hi>No Cure, no Pay;</hi> But He ſayes, <hi>You ſhall be ſure of a Cure, and then all the Pay ſhall be to Love and Thank the Lord your Healer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Once more;</p>
               <p>You have a <hi>Phyſician,</hi> and He is the <hi>Only <hi>Phyſician</hi>.</hi> There is no other <hi>Phyſician,</hi> that can do you any Good. We are told, Act. 4.12. <hi>There is not Salvation in any other.</hi> All other Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes, will but leave your Souls, as <hi>Helpleſs</hi> as they were before: There is no <hi>Help,</hi> except in the Name of this Lord! As the <hi>Dying Martyr</hi> Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, ſo may the <hi>Dying Sinner, None but Chriſt! None but Chriſt!</hi> Men may try to lick their Souls whole, with their own <hi>Repentances,</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations,</hi> or may Stupify their Souls, with the <hi>Opiates</hi> of worldly Diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but, O man, if thou keep at a Diſtance from the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, thy Fate will be that, Jer. 46.11. <hi>In

vain ſhalt thou uſe many Medicines, for thou ſhalt not be Cured.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Well then; Repair to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, with all the <hi>Diſeaſes</hi> of your Souls: And ſpread them all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Him; Conceal none of them, Smother none of them. He demands of you, as in Mar. 10.51. <hi>What wilt thou, that I ſhall do unto thee?</hi> Now, as that Blind man anſwered, <hi>Lord, That I might Receive my Sight</hi>? So do you anſwer, <hi>Lord, That my Sin may be Pardoned, Lord, That my Sin may be Conquered, Lord, That my Soul may be brought into a Right Frame, and that thy Image may be Renewed in my Soul; and that my Healed, and Strengthned Soul, may walk in thy wayes, and ſerve thee in Holineſs and Righteouſneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee, all my Dayes</hi>!</p>

Oh, Do not ſay, <hi>To morrow I'll do this</hi>! For thou haſt no Aſſurance of a <hi>To morrow; Boaſt not</hi> of it!
