            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>MY LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOUR Lordſhip's appointment to be Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary of State for the American depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by numbers that reſpected your Lordſhip's religious character, was looked upon as a very providential and happy event. Your patronizing of religious undertakings, confirmed the general opinion, and we were happy in the expectations of your Lordſhip's conſcientious regard to juſtice and equity, as well as to the civil and religious liberties of this great Continent; we expected the cauſe of liberty and religion would meet with the ſtrongeſt ſupport under your adminiſtration, and in your Lordſhip would ever find a conſtant and ſucceſsful advocate with your royal maſter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="IV" facs="unknown:014636_0003_0F9437EA2D5944A8"/>Unhappily during your adminiſtration, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures have been purſued very contrary to Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican hopes, and we eaſily conceive your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip may think it not leſs ſtrange that many friends of religion in America ſhould be ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy under laws which had your Lordſhip's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence and approbation.</p>
            <p>It is to the Man and to the Chriſtian I wiſh to be permitted to addreſs myſelf: Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ranks among the higheſt ſubjects, and has a large ſhare in all public meaſures, but anxiety for what may diſtreſs, and zeal for the welfare of the empire, can be no crime even in the meaneſt; and when a houſe is once in flames, every man is inexcuſable, or muſt at leaſt be ſo in his own breaſt, that does not contribute what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he may think in his power to their being extinguiſhed. The effects of the preſent meaſures are viſible, and it requires no ſagacity to foreſee what may be the conſequence, ſhould they be continued. Your Lordſhip may do much to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards reſtoring and perpetuating the tranquility of a great empire; perſons of my ſtation have nothing to offer but hints and wiſhes, ſhould theſe be beneath your notice, or ſtand in need of forgiveneſs, my ſincere wiſh to contribute any
<pb n="V" facs="unknown:014636_0004_0F9437EAF6407550"/>
thing towards a juſt, happy and perpetual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion between a parent ſtate and an infant country growing apace to the moſt aſtoniſhing importance, muſt be my only apology. <hi>Pulchrum eſt bene facere reipublicae, ſed &amp; bene dicere non eſt abſurdum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The queſtion, My Lord, which now agitates Great-Britain and America, and in which your Lordſhip has taken ſuch an active part, is, whether the Parliament of Great-Britain has a right to lay taxes on the Americans, who are not, and cannot, there be repreſented, and whether the Parliament has a right to bind the Americans in all caſes whatſoever? Whatever may be ſaid, or whatever the good people in Great-Britain may believe, this is the whole ſubject of the diſpute. All the ſeverities hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to exerciſed upon the Americans profeſſedly have no other view than to enforce ſuch a dependance, and nothing leſs than a claim deſtructive of all natural and national liberty, could poſſibly have united all America in a general oppoſition, or have arouſed them to join all like one man in their common defence. Let a declaratory bill be paſſed, that any law and uſage to the contrary notwithſtanding, America is entitled to all the
<pb n="VI" facs="unknown:014636_0005_0F9437EBB2B96D88"/>
common rights of mankind and all the bleſſings of the Britiſh conſtitution, that the ſword ſhall never be drawn to abridge, but to confirm, her birthright, and the ſtorm inſtantly becomes a calm, and every American thinks himſelf happy to contribute to the neceſſities, defence and glory of Great-Britain to the utmoſt of his ſtrength and power.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To bind them in</hi> ALL CASES WHATSOEVER, my Lord, the Americans look upon this as the language of deſpotiſm in its utmoſt perfection. What can, ſay they, an Emperor of Morocco pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend more of his ſlaves than to bind them in all caſes whatſoever. Were it meant to make the Americans hewers of wood and drawers of water, were it meant to oblige them to make bricks with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſtraw, were it meant to deprive them of the enjoyment of their religion, and to eſtabliſh a hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy over them ſimilar to that of the church of Rome in Canada? it would, ſay they, be no more than a natural conſequence of the right of binding them (unſeen, unheard, unrepreſented) in all caſes whatſoever.</p>
            <p>My Lord, the Americans are no ideots, and they appear determined not to be ſlaves. Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
<pb n="VII" facs="unknown:014636_0006_0F9437ECBACC3348"/>
will make wiſe men mad, but oppreſſors in the end frequently find that they were not wiſe men: there may be reſources even in deſpair ſufficient to render any ſet of men ſtrong enough not to be bound in all caſes whatſoever.</p>
            <p>Grievous is the thought, my Lord, that a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleman of your Lordſhip's character ſhould be ſo zealous to make war, and to imbrue his hands in the blood of millions of your fellow-ſubjects and fellow-chriſtians: Pray, my Lord, is it poſſible that thoſe, who at three thouſand miles diſtance can be bound in all caſes, may be ſaid to have any liberty at all? Is it nothing in your Lordſhip's eye to deprive ſo conſiderable a part of the globe of the privilege of breathing a free air, or to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugate numbers and generations to ſlavery and deſpotiſm? Can your Lordſhip think on theſe things without horror, or hope they muſt be productive of any thing but deteſtation and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment? Your Lordſhip believes a Supreme Ruler of the earth, and that the ſmall and great muſt ſtand before him at laſt: Would your Lordſhip be willing, at the general meeting of all mankind, to take a place among thoſe who deſtroyed or enſlaved empires, or riſk your future ſtate on the merit of having, at the expence of
<pb n="VIII" facs="unknown:014636_0007_0F9437ED2C74FF28"/>
Britiſh blood and treaſure, taken away the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, the life and liberty of the largeſt part of the Brittiſh empire? Can your Lordſhip think thoſe that fear the LORD will not cry to him againſt their oppreſſors, and will not the Father of mankind hear the cries of the oppreſſed? or would you be willing that their cries and tears ſhould riſe againſt you as a forward inſtrument of their oppreſſion.</p>
            <p>I know, my Lord, that this is not courtly language, but your Lordſhip is a profeſſor of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and of the pure, gentle, benevolent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of JESUS CHRIST: The groans of a people puſhed on a precipice, and driven on the very brink of deſpair, will prove forcible, till it can be proved that any power, in whoſe legiſlation the Americans have no part, may at pleaſure bind them in all caſes whatſoever; till it can be proved that ſuch a claim does not conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute the very eſſence of ſlavery and deſpotiſm; till it can be proved that the Americans (whom in this view I can no longer call Britons) may, and of right ought, to be thus bound; abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of ſuch aſſertions is only the language of truth, which in the end will force its way, and
<pb n="IX" facs="unknown:014636_0008_0F9437F08A72ED40"/>
riſe ſuperior to all the arts of falſhood and all the powers of oppreſſion.</p>
            <p>Right or wrong, my Lord, in all caſes what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, but more eſpecially when the fate of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions is concerned, are words of infinite moment. Your Lordſhip doubtleſs believes that the weighty alternative muſt have very ſolemn and different effects here and hereafter; but waving the right or wrong of this vile unhappy diſpute, let me entreat your Lordſhip's attention to conſider at what an infinite riſk the preſent meaſures muſt be purſued, even were it not demonſtrable that they are in the higheſt degree wrong, cruel and oppreſſive.</p>
            <p>The bulk of the inhabitants of a continent extending eighteen hundred miles in front on the atlantic, and permitting an extenſion in breadth as far as the ſouth ſea, look upon the claim, to bind them in all caſes whatſoever, as unjuſt, illegal and deteſtable, let us ſuppoſe for a moment that they are groſsly miſtaken; yet an error imbibed by millions, and in which they believe the ALL of the preſent and future gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations lies at ſtake, may prove a very dangerous error; deſtroying the Americans will not cure
<pb n="X" facs="unknown:014636_0009_0F9437F18A8089A0"/>
them, nor will any acts that condemn to ſtarve or be miſerable, have any tendency to perſuade them that theſe acts were made by their friends. The people in England are made to believe that the Americans want to ſeparate from them, or are unwilling to bear their part of the common burden. No repreſentation can be more falſe; but, my Lord, a nation cannot be miſled always, and when once the good people of Great-Britain get truer notions of the matter, they will naturally wreak their reſentment on thoſe by whom they have been groſsly miſinformed or wretchedly deceived.</p>
            <p>Review, my Lord, the effects of the preſent meaſures; the paſt and preſent will inform your Lordſhip of what may be to come.</p>
            <p>With an unparalleled patience did the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtonians bear the annihilation of their trade, the blocking up of their harbour, and many other diſtreſſes, till at Lexington an attack was made upon their lives, and then they gave ſufficient proof that their patience was not the effect of timidity, but of prudence and an unwillingneſs to ſhed Britiſh blood. This attack convinced all America <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>

were athirſt after their blood, and the behaviour of both parties on that day, and in many little ſkirmiſhes ſince, muſt convince all the world that in the cauſe of liberty the Americans are not afraid to look regulars in the face, and that in an unjuſt and oppreſſive ſervice Britiſh troops are far from being invincible.</p>
            <p>The burning of the innocent town of Charles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town, after it had been left by its inhabitants, is a piece of ſuch wanton cruelty as will fix an overlaſting diſgrace on the Britiſh arms. In the long civil war in Great-Britain nothing of the kind was attempted by either party, and this barbarity cannot fail being condemned by all ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilized nations.</p>
            <p>If at the battle on Bunker's hill the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans have been ſurprized, ſuperiority has coſt the regulars dearer than the Americans what is called their defeat, one or two more ſuch defeats of the Americans would forever put it out of the power of the preſent regular army to gain a victory.</p>
            <p>The rejecting of the New-York petition has
<pb n="XII" facs="unknown:014636_0011_0F9437F3F21D0678"/>
effectually ſilenced all thoſe who pleaded for, or hoped any good from, petitioning. The can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonading of that town in the dead of the night, and without the leaſt previous warning, as it has ſhewn what the inhabitants are indiſcriminately to expect, will in hiſtory ſtand as a laſting mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument of ſuch wantonneſs of cruelty as nations not remarkable for humanity would be aſhamed of.</p>
            <p>The deſtroying of the New-England fiſhery laid all thoſe who were deprived of their bread and occupation at ſea, under an abſolute neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of ſeeking it in the American army, and the ſenſe of the injury done them will doubtleſs exert itſelf in the day of battle.</p>
            <p>The endeavour to ſtir up popiſh Canadians and ſavage Indians againſt the Coloniſts has been productive of the taking of the important paſs of Ticonderoga, which has been effected with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the loſs of a ſingle life on either ſide.</p>
            <p>Detaining the inhabitants of Boſton, after they had, in dependance on the General's word of honour, given up their arms, to be ſtarved

            <p>My Lord, the violence of the preſent mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures has almoſt inſtantaneouſly created a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nental union, a continental currency, a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nental army, and before this can reach your Lordſhip, they will be as equal in diſcipline as they are ſuperior in cauſe and ſpirit to any regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.

            <p>The regular army employed on this errand, with four able generals, now lies no better than beſieged within the ruins of Charlestown and Boſton, unable to procure the neceſſaries of life, obliged to import their bread from Europe, and fuel from Canada, pining away with diſeaſe, and affording daily martyrs to cruelty and arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary power, while every day adds to the impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of their ever obtaining thoſe unhappy ends, A ſtrange ſituation for a Britiſh army!</p>

The numbers that croſſed the atlantic, or re-exported American commodities from Great-Britain, the manufacturers that wrought for America, or worked up her raw materials, will now be at full leiſure to know and feel whether the American trade be an object of any importance, and how much the nation is obliged to a miniſtry that has ſo effectually laboured its deſtruction.</p>

               <pb n="XV" facs="unknown:014636_0014_0F9437F6366F6108"/>The preſent diſpute has made every Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can acquainted with, and attentive to, the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the Brittiſh conſtitution: In this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, as well as in a ſtrong ſenſe of liberty, and the uſe of fire-arms almoſt from the cradle, the Americans have vaſtly the advantage over men of their rank almoſt every where elſe. From the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant topic of preſent converſation, every child unborn will be impreſſed with the notion: It is ſlavery to be bound at the will of another in all caſes whatſoever; every mother's milk will convey a deteſtation of this maxim. Were your Lordſhip in America, you might ſee little ones acquainted with the word of command before they can di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly ſpeak, and ſhouldering the reſemblance of a gun before they are well able to walk.</p>
            <p>When millions of free people at once turn their thoughts from trade, and the means of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring wealth, to agriculture and frugality, it muſt cauſe a moſt ſenſible alteration in the ſtate. My Lord, this is the caſe at preſent in America; every new act of violence will ſtrengthen and confirm the ſpirit that taught them the neceſſity of being frugal and virtuous, that they might remain free, and become invincible.</p>

               <pb n="XVI" facs="unknown:014636_0015_0F9437F71A2E6098"/>Admit, my Lord, (for ſuppoſitions now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come probable in proportion of their being aſtoniſhing and violent) that a Brittiſh fleet may effectually guard every harbour, river, creek or inlet on the American coaſt; admit alſo that her troops deſtroy every town, village or hut along the ſeaſhore, what then will be the conſequence? Why, my Lord, it will be the deſtroying the property of thouſands in Great-Britain, and of a few on this ſide of the water, whom your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip calls your friends; perhaps the attempt may not ſucceed, but ſuppoſing it ſhould, the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans, injured beyond a poſſibility of reparation, and irritated to the higheſt degree, will retire where they are inacceſſible to troops and ſhips; inſtead of trade and navigation, you will have a deſolate ſea-coaſt, the trade of America will be loſt, and with it the ſinews of war: And, my Lord, in the natural courſe of things America, in leſs than half a century, will contain more inhabitants than Great-Britain and Ireland; and that period, my Lord, is not ſo far diſtant, to put the preſent treatment entirely out of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance. America and Great-Britain joined in arms together, may grow confident againſt the world beſides; but if Britain continue her

            <p>In times of public confuſion men of all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are ſometimes carried further than they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended at firſt ſetting out.

            <p>The Americans have always ſhewn an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate regard to the king, and they are truly ſenſible of the neceſſity and advantage of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual union with the parent ſtate; but unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
<pb n="XVIII" facs="unknown:014636_0017_0F9437F9C1B74CF0"/>
ſeverities cannot be productive of any pleaſing returns. The Americans firmly believe that the claim at preſent endeavouring to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced, would render them mere ſlaves, and it is their general motto, "DEATH OR FREEDOM." The parliamentary, or, as they ſay, miniſterial, claim is now written in letters of blood, and that will be far from making it more acceptable to American readers.</p>
            <p>On the whole, my Lord, ſhould this addreſs be deemed impertinent and intruſive, I hope it may ſtill be excuſable from the importance of the cauſe, and the ſincerity of its motive. In the event of the preſent diſpute I look upon all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind as intereſted, and though not natural born, his Majeſty has not another ſubject that more ardently wiſheth that his own repoſe and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and that of all his ſubjects may never meet with any interruption. Whether Britiſh troops ſhall now drive liberty from out of the greater part of the Britiſh empire, and bury her remains in the American wilderneſs, or whether that wilderneſs ſhall flouriſh and chearfully contribute to make Great-Britain the greateſt empire of the univerſe, is the queſtion now to be decided, and
<pb n="XIX" facs="unknown:014636_0018_0F9437FA299C9E50"/>
it is not ſo unimportant, but it may be expected HE that is higher than the higheſt, and taketh up the iſles like a very little thing, will interpoſe in the deciſion. The whole American proceſs, my Lord, is liable to a reviſion, and when righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and judgment to come once make an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, many a Felix will tremble.</p>
            <p>To reſtore peace and harmony nothing is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary than to ſecure to America the known bleſſings of the Brittiſh conſtitution. This may be done in a moment, and without any diſgrace or riſk.

            <p>THERE was a time when there was no king in Iſrael, and every man did what was good in his own eyes. The conſequence was a civil war in the nation, iſſuing in the ruin of one of the tribes, and a conſiderable loſs to all the reſt.</p>
            <p>And there was a time when there was a king in Iſrael, and he alſo did what was right in his own eyes, a fooliſh ſon of a wiſe father; his own imprudence, the raſhneſs of his young counſellors, his unwillingneſs to redreſs the grievances of the nation, and the harſh treatment he gave to thoſe who applied for relief, alſo brought on a civil war, and iſſued in the ſeparation of the ten tribes from the houſe of David. He ſent his treaſurer to gather an odious duty or tribute, but the children of Iſrael ſtoned him that he died; and when he gathered one hundred and four ſcore thouſand men, that he might bring again the kingdom unto Roboam, GOD ſent them a meſſage, "ye ſhall not go up, nor ſight againſt your brethren, return every man to his houſe, for this thing is done of me." GOD diſapproved of the oppreſſive meaſures and miniſtry of Roboam, and that
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:014636_0021_0F9437FEAF7FAB00"/>
king's army appears more ready to obey the command of their GOD, than ſlay their brethren by orders of a tyrant.
<q>They obeyed the voice of the LORD, and returned from going againſt Jeroboam.</q>
2 Chron. x:18.xi:4.</p>
            <p>The things that happened before are written for our learning. By comparing paſt times and proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with theſe that are preſent, prudence will point out many ſalutary and religious leſſons. The conduct of Roboam verifies the lamentation of his father, "Woe to thee, o land, when thy king is a child." Eccleſ. x:16. A very ſmall degree of juſtice and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration might have preſerved his kingdom, but he thought weapons of war better than wiſdom; he hearkened not, neither to the people, nor to ſome of his more faithful counſellors, and the conſequence was that, inſtead of enſlaving the ten tribes who ſtood up for their liberty, GOD gave Judah to be ſervants to the king of Egypt, that they might learn the difference between his ſervice and the ſervice of the kingdoms of the nations. A people that claim no more than their natural rights, in ſo doing, do nothing diſpleaſing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to GOD; and the moſt powerful monarch that would deprive his ſubjects of the liberties of man, whatever may be his ſucceſs, he muſt not expect the approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of GOD, and in due time will be the abhorrence of all men.</p>
            <p>In a time of public and general uneaſineſs it behoves both ſuperiors and inferiors to conſider. It is eaſy to extinguiſh a ſpark, it is folly to blow up diſcontent into a blaze; the beginning of ſtrife is like the letting out of waters, and no man may know where it will end. There is a rule given to magiſtrates and ſubjects; which, if carefully attended to, would ſecure the dignity and ſafety of both; which, if not duly regarded, is uſually
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:014636_0022_0F9437FF330EC530"/>
attended with the worſt conſequences. The preſent, my hearers, will eaſily be allowed is a day of trouble, and ſurely in this day of adverſity we ought to conſider. When a people think themſelves oppreſſed, and in danger, nothing can be more natural than that they ſhould enquire into the real ſtate of things, trace their grievances to their ſource, and endeavour to apply the remedies which are moſt likely to procure relief: This I take to be the deſign of the preſent meeting of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons deputed from every part of the country; and as they have thought proper to open and begin their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberations with a ſolemn addreſs unto GOD, and the conſideration of his holy word, I moſt chearfully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with their requeſt to officiate on this occaſion, and ſhall endeavour, as I may be enabled, to point out ſuch directions from the holy ſcriptures as may make us wiſe in the knowledge of time, and direct us how to carry ourſelves worthy of the character of good ſubjects and Chriſtians: Whatever may be neceſſary for this purpoſe, I take to be comprehended in the apoſtolical rule, which I have laid down as the ſubject of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
<q>So ſpeak, and ſo do, as they that ſhall be judged by the law of liberty.</q>
            </p>
            <p>There are two things which properly come before us, viz.
<list>
                  <item>I. That we are to be judged by the law of liberty; and</item>
                  <item>II. The exhortation to act worthy, and under the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, of this important truth on every occaſion.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>A law is a rule of behaviour, made under proper authority, and with penalties annexed, ſuitable to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the tranſgreſſions. As all laws ſuppoſe man to be in a ſocial ſtate, ſo all laws ought to be made for the good of man: A law that is not made by ſuch as have
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:014636_0023_0F9437FFF4E70B88"/>
authority for ſo doing, is of no force; and if authority makes laws deſtructive in themſelves, no authority can prevent things from finally taking their natural courſe.</p>
            <p>Wherever there is ſociety, there muſt alſo be law; it is impoſſible that ſociety ſhould ſubſiſt without it. The will, minds, tempers, diſpoſitions, views and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of men are ſo very different, and ſometimes ſo oppoſite, that without law, which cements and binds all, every thing would be in endleſs diſorder and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion. All laws uſually wear the complexion of thoſe by whom they were made, but it cannot be denied that ſome bad men, from a ſenſe of neceſſity, have made good laws, and that ſome good men, from miſtake, or other weakneſſes, have enacted laws bad in themſelves, and pernicious in their conſequences.</p>
            <p>All human laws partake of human imperfection; it is not ſo with the laws of GOD. He is perfect, and ſo are all his works and ways.
<q>The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the ſoul. The teſtimony of the LORD is ſure, making wiſe the ſimple. The ſtatutes of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart. The commandment of the LORD is pure, enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the eyes. All his judgments are truth, and righteouſneſs altogether.</q>
Pſalm xix.</p>
            <p>Among men every ſociety and country has its own laws and form of government, which may be very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, and cannot operate beyond their limits; but thoſe laws and that form of government is undoubtedly beſt which has the greateſt tendency to make all thoſe that live under it ſecure and happy. As ſoon as we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider man as formed into ſociety, it is evident that the <note n="*" place="bottom">Salus populi ſuprema lex.</note> ſafety of the whole muſt be the grand law which muſt in<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ence and direct every other: Men did not paſs from a ſtate of nature into a ſtate of ſociety, to render
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:014636_0024_0F94380229D146C8"/>
their ſituation more miſerable, and their rights more precarious That government and tyranny is the here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary right of ſome, and that ſlavery and oppreſſion is the original doom of others, is a doctrine that would reflect diſhonour upon GOD; it is treaſon againſt all mankind, it is indeed an enormous faith that millions were made for one; tranſubſtantiation is but a harmleſs abſurdity, compared with the notion of a divine right to govern wrong, or of making laws which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to every idea of liberty, property and juſtice.</p>
            <p>The law which the apoſtle ſpeaks of in our text, is not a law of man, but of Him who is the only lawgiver, that can ſave and condemn, to whom all owe obedience, and whoſe laws none can tranſgreſs with impunity.</p>
            <p>Though all the laws that GOD ever gave unto man are worthy of GOD, and tend to promote the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of thoſe to whom they were given, yet we may obſerve a very ſtriking variety in the different laws which he gave at different times and to different people.
<q>He ſhewed his word unto Jacob, his ſtatutes and his judgments unto Iſrael; he has not dealt ſo with any other nation.</q>
Pſalm cxlvii:18.19.</p>
            <p>To the generality of mankind he gave no written law, but yet left not himſelf without a witneſs among them; the words of the law were written in their hearts, their conſcience alſo bearing witneſs, and their thoughts the mean while excuſing or elſe accuſing one another: It cannot be ſaid they were without law, whilſt what they were to do, and what they were to forbear, was written in their hearts.</p>
            <p>To Iſrael GOD came with a fiery law in his hands, it was given with the moſt awful ſolemnity upon mount Sinai; and as the ſum and ſubſtance of all their cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial, political and moral law centered in the ten commandments, ſo the ſum and ſubſtance of theſe is
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:014636_0025_0F9438024C152B90"/>
comprehended in love to GOD and love to man, which, as our LORD himſelf informs us, contains all the law and all the prophets.</p>
            <p>All manifeſtations of the will of GOD have been gradual, and it is probable the means of knowing GOD will be progreſſive through different ages, till eternity gives the good man a full ſight of GOD in his imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate preſence. During the diſpenſation of the old te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament and the ceremonial law, a ſpirit of bondage obtained unto fear, the law was a ſchoolmaſter to bring us unto CHRIST; neither did the law make any thing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope: Grace and truth was brought to light by JESUS CHRIST, and hence the diſpenſation of the goſpel, under which we live, is called the law of LIBERTY.</p>
            <p>Though there is a manifeſt diſtinction between law and goſpel, and ſometimes theſe two things are even oppoſed to one another, yet the doctrine of the goſpel is alſo called "the law of faith;" Rom. iii:17. partly becauſe it was uſual with the Jewiſh writers to call every doctrine a law, and partly alſo becauſe the doctrine of the goſpel preſents us with a rule of life, which all its profeſſors are bound to obey; hence they are ſaid to be "not without law, but under the law of CHRIST;" 1 Cor. ix:11. and hence our apoſtle ſpeaks of a royal law, which, though we cannot obey in perfection, nor derive any merit from our imperfect obedience, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not neglect without danger, nor diſobey without ſhewing our diſregard to the doctrine of the goſpel in general.</p>
            <p>It deſerves very particular attention that the doctrine of the goſpel is called a law of LIBERTY. Liberty and law are perfectly conſiſtent; liberty does not conſiſt in living without all reſtraint; for were all men to live without reſtraint, as they pleaſe, there would ſoon be no liberty at all; the ſtrongeſt would be maſter, the
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:014636_0026_0F943802F118DCE8"/>
weakeſt go to the wall; right, juſtice and property muſt give way to power, and, inſtead of its being a bleſſing, a more unhappy ſituation could not eaſily be deviſed unto mankind than that every man ſhould have it in his power to do what is right in his own eyes: well regulated liberty of individuals is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural offſpring of laws, which prudentially regulate the rights of whole communities; and as laws which take away the natural rights of men, are unjuſt and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, ſo all liberty which is not regulated by law, is a deluſive phantom, and unworthy of the glorious name.</p>
            <p>The goſpel is called a law of liberty, becauſe it bears a moſt friendly aſpect to the liberty of man; it is a known rule, <hi>Evangelium non tollit politias,</hi> the goſpel makes no alteration in the civil ſtate; it by no means renders man's natural and ſocial condition worſe than it would be without the knowledge of the goſpel. When the Jews boaſted of their freedom, and that they never were in bondage, our LORD does not reprove them for it, but only obſerves, that national freedom ſtill admits of improvement:
<q>If the Son ſhall make you free, then are you free indeed.</q>
John vi<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>:16. This leads me to obſerve that the goſpel is a law of liberty in a much higher ſenſe: By whomſoever a man is overcome, of the ſame he is brought into bondage; but no external enemy can ſo completely tyrannize over a conquered enemy, as ſin does over all thoſe who yield themſelves its ſervants; vicious habits, when once they have gained the aſcendant in the ſoul, bring man to that unhappy paſs that he knows better things and does worſe; ſin, like a torrent, carries him away againſt knowledge and conviction, while conſcience fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince him that he travels the road of death, and muſt expect, if he ſo continues, to take up his abode in hell; though his decaying body clearly tells him ſin breaks
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:014636_0027_0F943804E78AE108"/>
his conſtitution, as well as waſtes his ſubſtance, though he feels the loſs of credit and wealth, ſtill ſin has too ſtrong a hold of him to be forſaken, though he faintly reſolves to break off, yet, till the grace of GOD brings ſalvation, when he would do good, evil is preſent with him; in ſhort, inſtead of being under a law of liberty, he is under the law of ſin and death, but whenever he feels the happy influence of the grace of the goſpel, then this
<q>law of liberty makes him free from the law of ſin and death;</q>
Rom. viii:2. it furniſheth him not only with motives to reſiſt but with power alſo to ſubdue ſin; ſin reigns no longer in his mortal body, becauſe he is not under the law, but under grace. By this law of liberty he is made free from ſin, and has his fruit unto holineſs, and the end of it eternal life. There is another reaſon why the goſpel is called a law of liberty, which is to diſtinguiſh it from the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial law under the Moſaic diſpenſation; a yoke, of which an apoſtle ſaith, neither they nor their fathers were able to bear; it was ſuperadded on account of their tranſgreſſions, and ſuited to the character of a groſs and ſtubborn nation, to whom it was originally given; they were ſo prone to idolatry, and ſo apt to forget their GOD, their notions were ſo groſs and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, that a number of external rites and ceremonies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came neceſſary, to put them in mind of him, and to attach them to ſome degree of his worſhip and ſervice. This, however neceſſary, was a heavy burden; it bid them "touch not, taſte not, handle not;" it required of them expenſive ſacrifices, and a coſtly and painful ſervice; it was attended with the moſt fearful threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, if any man brake Moſes law, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> under two or three witneſſes; and the very ſpirit they then received, was a ſpirit of bondage unto fear: Whereas the goſpel diſpenſation <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> a ſpirit of confidence,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:014636_0028_0F9438055A849EB8"/>
and under the law of liberty we call upon GOD as Abba Father. By this law of liberty the profeſſors of the goſpel will be judged.</p>
            <p>Every man is a rational, and therefore accountable, creature. As a creature he muſt needs depend on his Creator, and as a rational creature he muſt certainly be accountable for all his actions. Nothing is more evident than that man is not of himſelf; and if once we admit that he holds his exiſtence, his faculties and favours from GOD, that made him, it becomes a very obvious concluſion, that his Maker muſt have had ſome view in giving him exiſtence, and more underſtanding than to the beaſts of the field, neither can it be a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of indifference to him whether man acts agreeably or contrary to his deſigns. The Creator of the natural world, is alſo its moral ruler; and if he is now the proprietor and ruler of intelligent beings, at ſome time or other he muſt alſo be their judge.</p>
            <p>If GOD had not made his will known unto man, there could have been neither tranſgreſſion nor judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. If it ſhould be ſaid that GOD has not manifeſted himſelf alike unto all men, and that ſome have much ſmaller opportunities to know his will and their duty than others, it is enough to obſerve, that no man will be judged by a rule of which it was impoſſible he ſhould have any knowledge. Every work and every man will be brought into judgment, and the judgment of GOD will never be otherwiſe than according to truth; but thoſe that never had the law of liberty, will not be judged by that law, and thoſe that have been favoured with the revelation of the goſpel will be more inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable than any others, if they neglect the day of their viſitation.
<q>As many as have ſinned without law, ſhall alſo periſh without law, and as many as have ſinned in the law, ſhall be judged by the law.</q> Rom. ii:12.

All men are under ſome law, they feel, they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious, that they are ſo; the thoughts which already excuſe or condemn one another, are an anticipation of a final and deciſive judgment, when every man's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward will be according to his works.</p>
            <p>That all thoſe who heard and profeſſed to believe the goſpel, will be finally judged by that, we have the fulleſt aſſurance, GOD will judge the ſecrets of men by JESUS CHRIST according to his goſpel.
<q>The word that I have ſpoken,</q>

John xii:48. It greatly intereſts us clearly to know what is the import and conſequence of being judged by the goſpel <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s a law of liberty; and it contains the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing things,</p>
            <p>The general character, all the thoughts, words and actions, together with the general conduct of all thoſe who profeſſed the goſpel, will be brought to the teſt, and tried by this rule. Man's own opinion of himſelf, the good opinion of others, will here ſtand him in no ſtead, his character will not be determined by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal appearance, but by his inward reality.
<q>Man looketh on the outward appearance, but the LORD looketh on the heart.</q>
1 Sam. xvii:7. The ſelf-righteous phariſee will be rejected, notwithſtanding his fair appearance and boaſting; the penitent publican will be <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

to their inviſible ſpring; thoughts are out of the reach of human cognizance, but they are the firſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of divine notice; there is not a word that drops from our tongue but what our judge hears, whatever we do, or whatever we neglect, is all under his imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate eye, and he not only attends to our general cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, but alſo to every thought, word or action, and the prevailing complexion of all theſe taken together form our true and real character.</p>
            <p>In the judgment, according to this law, our cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, words, thoughts and actions will be brought to the teſt of this rule, our conduct will be compared with theſe precepts, this is the balance of the ſanctuary, in which the profeſſors of the goſpel ſhall be weighed, and as they ſhall be found approved or deficient, their caſe muſt be determined. Thoſe whoſe temper and actions ſhall be found conformable to the law of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, will be acquitted, graciouſly accepted, and made ever happy, and thoſe who turned the grace of GOD into wantonneſs, and made the liberty of the goſpel a cloak for their ſins, will be finally rejected. The goſpel informs us, that a day is already appointed for that purpoſe; it acquaints us with the perſon of our judge, and every circumſtance, as well as the rule according to which he will proceed in judgment. Perhaps on that day when all nations ſhall appear before the judge, and he will divide them as a ſhepherd divideth the ſheep from the goats, diſtinct places will alſo be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted to thoſe who are to be judged by natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and the law of nature, and thoſe who have been favoured with a divine revelation, and eſpecially with the light of the goſpel: The people of Niniveh will ariſe againſt empty profeſſors of the goſpel, and will condemn them. Thoſe who have been exalted above others in means and privileges, will ſit proportionably
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:014636_0031_0F943808385E7F08"/>
lower than thoſe who have made a better improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of leſſer means; and notwithſtanding the fondeſt hope and fineſt profeſſion, it is a determined rule of the law of liberty, that
<q>except our righteouſneſs ſhall exceed that of the ſcribes and phariſees, we ſhall in no caſe enter into the kingdom of heaven.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It deſerves our peculiar attention, that the apoſtle conſiders the goſpel as a law of liberty, at the ſame time when he ſets it before us as the rule by which we are to be judged. We are not to imagine becauſe the goſpel is a law of liberty, therefore men will not be judged; on the contrary judgment will be the more ſevere againſt all who have heard and profeſſed the goſpel, and yet walked contrary to its precepts and doctrine. As the tranſgreſſion of a law of liberty muſt be more inexcuſable, than the tranſgreſſion of a law un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt or oppreſſive in itſelf, or even the ceremonial law, which was given only for a certain period, and to anſwer temporary purpoſes, ſo their judgment and doom muſt be proportionably heavier, who have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt love and liberty, as well as againſt power and juſtice.</p>
            <p>According to this law the fate of men will not only be determined, but ſentence will alſo be put into exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. GOD ſitteth on the throne of judgment every day, and judgeth righteouſly, but he hath moreover appointed a particular day when he will manifeſt his power and juſtice before the whole creation; when the dead both ſmall and great will ſtand before GOD; when thoſe that acted agreeable to the law of liberty, will attain the fulneſs of glory of the freedom of the ſons of GOD, and when he will alſo take vengeance on all that have not known God, and have not obeyed his holy goſpel. This naturally leads to the ſecond thing propoſed, to take a nearer view of the importance of
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:014636_0032_0F94380B89DF05F8"/>
the exhortation,
<q>So ſpeak, and ſo do, as they that ſhall be judged by the law of liberty.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It ſeems as though the apoſtle had an eye to ſome particular branch of the law of liberty, <hi>i. e.</hi> the love which we owe unto our neighbour, and that his deſign is to obviate the miſtake as though men might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as fulfilling the law of CHRIST, in paying re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to ſome of its commands and prohibitions, at the ſame time that they were entirely regardleſs of the reſt. He aſſures them, that
<q>whoſoever ſhall keep the whole law, but ſhall tranſgreſs in one point</q> (<hi>e. g.</hi> having reſpect of perſons) "is guilty of all." On this principle the apoſtle builds the general exhortation, <q>So ſpeak, and ſo do, as they that ſhall be judged by the law of liberty.</q> This implies:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Be thoroughly convinced of the certainty of a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to come, and that it extends to you, to all your thoughts, words and actions. There is not any truth of greater moment, nor perhaps more eaſily forgotten. The belief or unbelief of this important doctrine muſt have the moſt ſenſible effects. All the apoſtles fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently put their hearers in mind of a judgment to come; and there is not any truth more neceſſary to be frequently inculcated and daily thought on, and wherever this truth is really believed and felt, it will have a conſtant and natural influence on the behaviour of thoſe who truly believe it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. See to it that in judgment you may ſtand. All men will be brought into judgment, but few will be able to ſtand; none will be excuſed, or be able to withdraw, and only thoſe who have acted worthily, will meet with the divine acceptance. The difference will be amazing and beyond all conception: An eternity of happineſs, which eye has not ſeen, ear has not heard, and which never entered into the heart of any man, lies on the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:014636_0033_0F94380C8E9258C0"/>
one ſide, and deſpair, miſery and torment on the other. Thoſe that are able to ſtand, will meet with the ſmiles and approbation of their judge, and to all the reſt the king will ſay,
<q>Theſe mine enemies that would not have me to bear rule over them, bring them here, and ſlay them before mine eyes.</q>
Thoſe that believe and are convinced of this awful alternative, ſhould certainly make it their care that they may be able to ſtand in judgment; neither ſhould the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion of this only influence their conduct in general, but theſe words ought to be conſidered as a rule, which we ought to have conſtantly before our eyes in all our diſcourſes and every undertaking; we ſhould ever
<q>ſo ſpeak, and ſo act, as they that ſhall be judged by the law of liberty.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall draw a few inferences, before I conclude with a more particular addreſs to the worthy Gentlemen at whoſe requeſt I preach on this occaſion.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The goſpel is a law of Liberty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A late writer <note n="*" place="bottom">See a tract, entituled, "Chains of ſlavery." Printed London. 1775.</note> aſſerts,
<q>Every religion counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances deſpotiſm, but none ſo much as the Chriſtian.</q>
This is a very heavy charge againſt religion in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, but bears hardeſt on the Chriſtian. Whether it proceeds from malice, ignorance, or miſapprehenſion, it is needleſs to determine, but if chriſtianity be a law of liberty, it muſt be obvious how ill-grounded is ſuch a charge againſt it. It cannot be denied but ſome Chriſtian writers have wrote againſt the rights of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. All thoſe who ſtand up for unlimited paſſive obedience and non-reſiſtance, may have given but too much cauſe for ſuch ſurmiſes and ſuſpicions; but the truth is, that both thoſe which make this charge, and thoſe who gave occaſion for it, were alike ignorant of the ſpirit and temper of Chriſtianity; and it may well
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:014636_0034_0F94380CB3CA2DC0"/>
be doubted whether the venders of ſuch odious doctrines, who foiſted tenets, ſo abominable and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious to mankind, into the ſyſtem of Chriſtian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, have not done that holy religion greater hurt under the pretence of friendſhip and defence than its moſt barefaced enemies by all their moſt violent at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks. Some Chriſtian divines have taught the enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous faith, that millions were made for one, they have aſcribed a divine right to kings to govern wrong; but what then? Are ſuch abominable doctrines any part of chriſtianity, becauſe theſe men ſay ſo? does the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel ceaſe to be a law of liberty, becauſe ſome of its profeſſors pervert it into an engine of tyranny, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion and injuſtice.</p>
            <p>The aſſertion, that all religion countenances deſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and chriſtianity more than any other, is diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trically oppoſite to fact. Survey the globe, and you will find that liberty has taken its ſeat only in Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and that the higheſt degree of freedom is pleaded for and enjoyed by ſuch as make profeſſion of the goſpel.</p>
            <p>There are but two religions, which are concerned in this charge; the Jewiſh and the Chriſtian. Natural religion writers of this kind I ſuppoſe would not include in their charge; if they do, they ſet all religion at variance with the rights of mankind, contrary to the ſenſe of all nations, who are gererally agreed, that, abſtractly of a world to come, religion is of real ſervice and neceſſity to mankind, for their better govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and order.</p>
            <p>As to the Jewiſh religion, it ſeems really ſtrange that any ſhould charge it with favouring deſpotiſm, when by one of its expreſs rites at certain times it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
<q>liberty throughout the land, to the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants thereof.</q>
Levit. xxv:10. It required their
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:014636_0035_0F94380D6CAFBE38"/>
kings
<q>not to be lifted up in their hearts above their brethren.</q> Deut. xvii:20 And the whole ſyſtem of that religion is ſo replete with laws againſt injuſtice and oppreſſion, it pays ſuch an extraordinary regard to property, and gives ſuch ſtrict a charge to rule in juſtice and the fear of GOD, and to conſider thoſe, over whom they judge, as their brethren, even when diſpenſing puniſhments, and forbids all exceſs in them, that it is really ſurprizing any one acquainted with its precepts, ſhould declare it favourable to deſpotiſm or oppreſſion.</p>
            <p>The Chriſtian religion, while it commands due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and obedience to ſuperiors, no where requires a blind and unlimited obedience on the part of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; nor does it veſt any abſolute and arbitrary power in the rulers. It is an inſtitution for the benefit, and not for the diſtreſs, of mankind. It preacheth not only "glory to GOD on high," but alſo
<q>peace on earth, and good will among men.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The goſpel gives no higher authority to magiſtrates than to be
<q>the miniſters of GOD, for the good of the ſubject.</q>
Rom. xiii. From whence it muſt ſurely follow, that their power is to edify, and not to deſtroy: When they abuſe their authority, to diſtreſs and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy their ſubjects, they deſerve not to be thought miniſters of GOD for good; nor is it to be ſuppoſed, when they act ſo contrary to the nature of their office, that they act agreeable to the will of GOD, or in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the doctrine of the goſpel.</p>
            <p>The goſpel recommends unto maſters to forbear threatnings, and to remember that they alſo have a maſter in heaven; it aſſures them that the eye of GOD is equally upon the ſervant and the maſter, and that with GOD there is no reſpect of perſons: It commands maſters, from the moſt ſolemn conſiderations, to give
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:014636_0036_0F94380E2CB73C30"/>
unto ſervants that which is juſt and equal; it ſaith to the meaneſt ſlave:
<q>Art thou called being a ſervant, care not for it, but if thou mayeſt be made free, uſe it rather.</q> 1 Cor. vii:21.</p>
            <p>The doctrine of the goſpel has that regard to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, that it commands even ſoldiers,
<q>Do violence to no man, and be content with your wages:</q>
Luke iii:14. — that a Paul ſent back a run-away ſlave, though now converted, and belonging to his intimate friend, and at a time when he ſeems to have ſtood in real need of his ſervice, from a delicacy that he would do nothing without the owner's mind, leſs his benefit ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear as if it were of neceſſity, and not willingly. Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem. 14. From the ſame ſpirit of juſtice a Zacheus, after his converſion, reſtored fourfold what before he had taken from any by falſe accuſation: Surely then the ſpirit of the goſpel is very friendly to the rights and property of men.</p>
            <p>The goſpel ſets conſcience above all human au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in matters of faith, and bids us to
<q>ſtand faſt in that liberty wherewith the Son of GOD has made us free.</q>
Gal. v:1. Freedom is the very ſpirit and temper of the goſpel:
<q>He that is called in the LORD being a ſervant, is the LORD's freeman. Ye are bought with a price, be ye not the ſervants of men.</q>
1 Cor. vii:22 23. At the ſame time that it commands us to ſubmit to every ordinance of men, it alſo directs us to act
<q>as free, and not uſing liberty as a cloke of maliciouſneſs, but as the ſervants of GOD.</q>
1 Pet. iii:13-18.</p>
            <p>Thoſe therefore that would ſupport arbitrary power, and require an unlimited obedience, in vain look for precedents or precepts for ſuch things in the goſpel, an inſtitution equally tending to make men juſt, free
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:014636_0037_0F94380EF9DC5508"/>
and happy here, and perfectly holy and happy here after.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The main deſign of the goſpel is not to direct us in our external and civil affairs, but how we may at laſt ſtand with comfort before</hi> GOD, <hi>the judge of all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Human prudence is to be our guide in the concerns of time; the goſpel makes us wiſe unto ſalvation, and points out the means to be purſued that it may be well with us in the world to come. As rational creatures we are to make uſe of our reaſon; as Chriſtians we are to repent and believe the goſpel. Motives of a worldly nature may very properly influence us in our worldly concern, we are created not only for eternity, but alſo for time: It is not at all improper for us to have a due regard for both. The goſpel will regulate our deſires and reſtrain our paſſions as to earthly things, and will raiſe us at the ſame time above time and ſenſe, to objects of a nature more worthy of our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. A due regard for, and frequent meditation on, a judgment to come, will greatly aſſiſt us in all our concerns; and this very conſideration the goſpel holds out to us in the cleareſt manner. It not only affirms as a truth, what reaſon and conſcience might conſider only as probable, but it takes away as it were the veil from between us and things to come; it gives us a preſent view of the future bliſs of ſaints, and the terrors and deſpair of ſinners; — rather a hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical account than a prophetic deſcription of all the proceedings of the dreadful pleaſing day; it clearly points our the road to deſtruction, and the way to eſcape; it affords us a plain and general rule to obtain ſafety and comfort, when it bids us,
<q>So ſpeak, and ſo do, as they that ſhall be judged by the law of liberty.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This general rule may alſo be of conſiderable ſervice
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:014636_0038_0F9438120F73A0A0"/>
in extraordinary and particular caſes. It is impoſſible to provide expreſs directions for every particular caſe, and in the courſe of things circumſtances may happen when a good man may be at a loſs to know his duty, and find it difficult ſo to act as to obtain his own ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation. There may be danger of going beyond, and danger in not coming up to, the mark. To act worthy of GOD, who has called us, is the general rule of the Chriſtian at all times, and upon every occaſion, and did we but always follow this rule, what manner of perſons ſhould we then be! But in caſes of intricacy we may ſtill be in doubt what may be moſt for the glory of GOD, and moſt conſiſtent with our duty. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times alſo our relative duties may ſeem to come in competition with one another, and we may heſitate in our own mind which for the preſent has the ſtrongeſt call. We would fain obey our ſuperiors, and yet we cannot think of giving up our natural, our civil and religious rights, nor acquieſce in or contribute to render our fellow-creatures or fellow-citizens ſlaves and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable. We would willingly follow peace with all men, and yet would be very unwilling that others ſhould take the advantage of a pacific diſpoſition, to injure us in hopes of impunity. We would expreſs duty, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and obedience to the king, as ſupreme, and yet we would not wiſh to ſtrengthen the hands of tyranny, nor call oppreſſion lawful: In ſuch a delicate ſituation it is a golden rule,
<q>So to ſpeak, and ſo to do, as they that ſhall be judged by the law of liberty.</q>
Nothing has a greater tendency to make men act wrong than the diſbelief of a future judgment, and nothing will more effectually reſtrain and direct them than the full perſuaſion that ſuch an event will certainly take place: nothing would have a happier tendency to make us act with prudence, juſtice and moderation than the
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:014636_0039_0F943812E641E648"/>
firm perſuaſion that GOD will, bring every work into judgment, and every ſecret thing, whether it be good or bad.</p>
            <p>Neither could I think on any direction more appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to the deſign of our preſent meeting, or which I might more properly recommend to the reſpectable Gentlemen, now met together to conſult on the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very and preſervation of the liberties of America, and who choſe to begin their deliberations with a ſolemn act of worſhip to almighty GOD who has eſtabliſhed government as his ordinance, and equally abhors li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſs and oppreſſion; whoſe ſingular bleſſing it is if ſubjects enjoy a righteous government, and under ſuch a government lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godlineſs and honeſty.</p>
            <p>You are met, Gentlemen, in a moſt critical time, and on a moſt alarming occaſion, not in a legiſlative capacity, but (while the ſitting of the uſual repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is not thought for the king's ſervice, or neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the good of this province) you are choſen by the general voice of this province to meet on their behalf, to conſult on ſuch meaſures as in our local circumſtances may be moſt to the real advantage and tend to the honour of our gracious ſovereign, as well as the good and ſafety of this province and of all this great continent. For the ſake of the auditory, I ſhall briefly ſtate the immediate cauſes that have given riſe to this Provincial and a general American Congreſs, and then offer ſuch humble advice as appears to me moſt ſuitable to our circumſtances.</p>
            <p>To enforce ſome Acts for laying on a duty to raiſe a perpetual revenue in America, which the Americans think unjuſt and unconſtitutional, which all America complains of, and ſome provinces have in ſome meaſure
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:014636_0040_0F94381370BD8618"/>
oppoſed,<note n="*" place="bottom">This oppoſition in ſome provinces conſiſted in ſending the tea on which this duty was to be paid, back to England, not ſuffering it to be ſold or landed in others, and in Boſton, when they were prevented from ſending it back, it was entirely deſtroyed, but no perſon hurt, nor any blood ſhed.</note> A fleet and army has been ſent to New-England, and after a long ſeries of hardſhips by that province patiently endured, it is now out of all que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion that hoſtilities have been commenced againſt them; blood has been ſhed, and many lives have been taken away; thouſands, never as much as ſuſpected of having any hand in the action which is made the pretence of all the ſeverity now uſed againſt that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, have been and ſtill are reduced to the greateſt diſtreſs. From this other provinces have taken the alarm; an apprehenſion of nearer foes, not unlikely to appear as auxiliaries in an unjuſt cauſe, has thrown our neighbours into arms; how far and wide the flame ſo wantonly kindled may be permitted to ſpread, none can tell; but in theſe alarming circumſtances the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of this continent, of which we are a part, the ſafety and domeſtic peace of this province will naturally become a ſubject of your deliberations; and here I may well adapt the language of old,

<q>Rent your hearts, and not your garments, and turn unto the LORD your GOD, for he is gracious and merciful, ſlow to anger and of great kindneſs, and repenteth him of the evil, who knoweth if he will return and repent, and leave a bleſſing behind him, even a meat-offering and a drink-offering unto the LORD your GOD.</q> Joel ii:13.14.</p>
            <p>Let it be a ſtanding rule with every one that is to ſit in council upon this occaſion,
<q>ſo to ſpeak, and ſo to do, as one that is to be judged by the law of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</q>
Let us moſt carefully avoid every thing that might make us incur the diſpleaſure of GOD, and
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:014636_0042_0F943815C9891210"/>
wound our own conſciences. The effects of your deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration may become very ſerious and extenſive, and the conſequences extremely important: Think there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore before you ſpeak, deliberate before you execute, and let the law of liberty, by which you are hereafter to be judged, be the conſtant rule of all your words and actions: Far be it from us to be reduced under laws inconſiſtent with liberty, and as far to wiſh for liberty without law; let the one be ſo tempered with the other that when we come to give our account to the ſupreme lawgiver, who is the great judge of all, it may appear we had a due regard to both, and may meet with his approbation.</p>
            <p>Such always hath been, and ſuch is ſtill, the attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of America to the illuſtrious houſe of Hanover, that I need not put you in mind of our duty to the king as ſupreme. By our law the king can do no wrong; but of his preſent Majeſty, who is univerſally known to be adorned with many ſocial virtues, may we not juſtly conclude that he would not do any wrong, even though he could. May we not hope that to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a monarch, he will ſuperadd the feelings of the man, the tenderneſs of a father. May we not hope that when the truth of things, the tears of his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſubjects, the diſtreſſes cauſed by Acts extremely ill adviſed, once reach his notice, a generous pity will force his heart, and that pity, when he feels it, will command redreſs.
<q>The heart of the king is in the hand of the LORD, as the rivers of water, and he turneth it as he pleaſeth;</q> Prov. xxi:1. moſt earneſtly there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us pray that in this great and moſt important matter alſo GOD may give unto the king an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding heart, that power may be governed by wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:014636_0043_0F943816727E9ED8"/>
and the wheels of government roll on with juſtice and moderation.</p>
            <p>Should you think that all our preſent diſtreſs is owing to evil counſellors, nothing need to hinder you from praying that GOD would turn their counſels into fooliſhneſs; you may make it your earneſt requeſt both in public and in private, that the wicked being removed from before the king, his throne may be eſtabliſhed in righteouſneſs, that the rod of the oppreſſor may be broke, and juſtice and equity take place of tyranny and oppreſſion.</p>
            <p>It may be owing to nothing but the firm attachment to the reigning family that ſo many Americans look upon the preſent meaſures as a deep laid plan to bring in the Pretender. Perhaps this jealouſy may be very groundleſs, but ſo much is certain, that none but Great-Britain's enemies can be gainers in this unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural conteſt.<note n="*" place="bottom">Were it deſigned to give the Pretender an opportunity; to raiſe diviſions in Great-Britain, ſtarve the manufacturers, ſend away troops from Ireland and Scotland, and breed civil war in America, muſt all be circumſtances too favourable, and I may ſay, very tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p>Never let us looſe out of ſight that our intereſt lies in a perpetual connection with our mother country. Notwithſtanding the preſent unwiſe and harſh meaſures, there are thouſands in Great-Britain that think with us, and wiſh well to the American cauſe, and make it their own; let us convince our enemies that the ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles of America have not their riſe in a deſire of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependency, but from a warm regard to our common conſtitution; that we eſteem the name of Britons, as being the ſame with freemen; let every ſtep we take afford proof how greatly we eſteem our mother country,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:014636_0044_0F943817369A0ED0"/>
and that, to the wiſh of a perpetual connexion, we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer this only conſideration, that we may be virtuous and free <note n="†" place="bottom">The idea of a ſeparation between America and Great-Britain is big with ſo many and ſuch horrid evils, that every friend to both muſt ſhudder at the thought. Every man that gives the moſt diſtant hint of ſuch a wiſh, ought inſtantly to be ſuſpected as a common enemy; nothing would more effectually ſerve the cauſe of our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, than any propoſal of this kind; all wiſe men and all good men would immediately ſpeak, write and act againſt it; ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal, whenever it ſhould be made, would be an inlet to greater evils than any we have yet ſuffered: But what America deteſts as the greateſt evil, a Britiſh miniſtry has taken the greateſt pains to effect; has waſted Britiſh blood and treaſure to alienate America and Great-Britain; the breach is growing wider and wider, it is be come great like a ſea, every moment is a loſs that is not improved towards bringing about a reconciliation.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Let me intreat you, Gentlemen, think coolly, and act deliberately; raſh counſels are ſeldom good ones: miniſterial raſhneſs and American raſhneſs can only be productive of untoward compounds; inconſiderate meaſures, framed on the other ſide of the atlantic, are the cauſe of all our miſchiefs, and it is not in the leaſt probable that inconſiderate meaſures in America can be productive of any good. Let nothing be done through ſtrive and vain glory; let no private reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or party zeal diſgrace your honeſt warmth for your country's welfare: Meaſures determined on by integrity and prudence, are moſt likely to be carried into execution by ſteadineſs and moderation. Let neither the frowns of tyranny, nor pleaſure of popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity, ſway you from what you clearly apprehend juſt and right, and to be your duty. Conſider how much lies at ſtake, how greatly your religion, your liberty, your property, your poſterity, is intereſted. Endeavour to act like freemen, like loyal ſubjects, like real Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:014636_0045_0F943817F071BBC0"/>
and you will <q>ſo ſpeak, and ſo act, as they that ſhall be judged by the law of liberty.</q>
Act con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientiouſly, and with a view to GOD, then commit your ways to him, leave the event with GOD, and you will have great reaſon to hope that the event will be juſt, honourable and happy.</p>
            <p>And now, Gentlemen, you have the wiſhes and prayers of every thoughtful perſon, that your delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may be carried on with candour, unanimity and prudence, may be bleſſed to preſerve the quietneſs of this province, and co-operate in reſtoring the rights and tranquillity of all America, as well as promote the proſperity of the whole Britiſh empire. This will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford you a heartfelt ſatisfaction, and tranſmit your name to poſterity with honour, when all thoſe who had oppoſite views, and ſought their greatneſs in the ruins of others, will be held in abhorrence and deteſtation.</p>
            <p>I have but a few hints to give to my hearers in general.</p>
            <p>The times are evil; this is a day of adverſity, and in a time of adverſity we ought to conſider. It may perhaps ſoon become impoſſible, even to the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolent, to continue unconcerned, and thoſe that wiſh no more than to hide themſelves in quiet obſcurity, may not always have it in their power to remain neuter: To know the ſigns of the time, is a conſiderable part of human prudence, and it is a ſtill greater to walk circumſpectly, and redeem the time, becauſe the days are evil. Whatever part you may think yourſelves obliged to take,
<q>So ſpeak, and ſo do, as they that ſhall be judged hereafter, and judged by the law of liberty.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In theſe times of confuſion I would preſs on my
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:014636_0046_0F95A74E571C32E0"/>hearers a moſt conſcientious regard to the common lawsof the land. Let our conduct ſhew that we are not lawleſs; by well-doing let us put to ſilence the reproaches of our adverſaries. Let us convince them that we do not complain of law, but of oppreſſion; that we do not abhor theſe acts becauſe we are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient to be under government, but being deſtructive of liberty and property, we think them deſtructive alſo of all law. Let us act
<q>as free, and yet not make liberty a cloke of maliciouſneſs, but as the ſervants of God.</q>
            </p>
            <p>While it is yet peace and quietneſs with us, let us not think ourſelves inacceſſible to the evils which are already come upon others; there are ſome evils which we would rather deprecate in private than ſpeak of in public, againſt which being forewarned, we ſhould be forearmed; every trifling report ſhould not alarm us, but it would be folly ſtill greater not to be on our guard againſt ſudden dangers.</p>
            <p>Remember them that ſuffer adverſity, as being your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves alſo in the body. Think on thoſe who are driven from their habitations and all their conveniencies of life, or confined in their own houſes by an enraged ſoldiery, to ſtarve in their own country, in the midſt of property and plenty, not permitted to enjoy their own, and diſtreſſed in every connexion, and this with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any cauſe alleged againſt numbers of them, without complaint, ſuſpicion or a legal trial: The like was never heard ſince the cruel ſiege of Londonderry, and is a ſpecies of cruelty at which even that hardhearted bigot James II. relented.</p>
            <p>Above all, let every one earneſtly pray that HE that is higher than the higheſt would ſoon make a righteous end of all their confuſion; that he would
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:014636_0047_0F943819ED9FF650"/>
incline the king to hear the cries of his ſubjects, and that no more innocent blood may be ſhed in America.</p>
            <p>One thing more: Conſider the extreme abſurdity of ſtruggling for civil liberty, and yet to continue ſlaves to ſin and luſt.
<q>Know ye not to whom ye yield yourſelves ſervants to obey, his ſervants ye are, to whom ye obey, whether of ſin unto death, or of obedience unto righteouſneſs.</q>
Rom. vi:16. Ceaſe from evil, and do good, ſeek peace, and purſue it, who will hurt you while you follow that which is good; become the willing ſervants of the LORD JESUS CHRIST, hearken to and obey the voice of his goſpel; for
<q>where the ſpirit of the LORD is, there is liberty;</q>
and "if the Son makes you free, THEN, and not till then, "SHALL YOU BE FREE INDEED."</p>

            <head>From the ſimilarity of the ſubject, an extract from another ſermon is added:</head>
            <p>THE queſtion between Great-Britain and Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, which has already been productive of ſuch alarming effects, is,
<q>Whether the parliament of Great-Britain have any power or authority to tax the Americans without their conſent?</q>
Every im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial man will allow that this is the foundation of the whole diſpute. It is evident that in this queſtion conſcience is deeply intereſted, and in this view it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a very proper ſubject for the pulpit. If any thing is required of ſubjects which in conſcience they are bound to pay, give or do, the refuſal of it is not only a crime againſt the ſtate, but alſo a ſin againſt GOD: I think it therefore not only not improper, but
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:014636_0048_0F94381A2D41D4A8"/>
my duty, to point out unto my hearers ſuch hints and precedents as may illuſtrate this matter from the word of GOD.</p>
            <p>The caſe I would ſtate thus,
<q>Whether any duty or impoſt ſuppoſed to be laid on in an illegal man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and inconſiſtent with natural and civil rights, from motives of conſcience ought nevertheleſs to be paid?</q>
and to elucidate this, I obſerve, the general rule is this:
<q>Render therefore to all their dues; tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to whom tribute is due, cuſtom to whom cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom; fear to whom fear, honour to whom honour.</q> Rom. xiii:7. There is ſomething <hi>due</hi> to government which cannot be refuſed without injuſtice, and more than which cannot be demanded without tyranny and oppreſſion. When our LORD was aſked,
<q>What thinkeſt thou, is it lawful to give tribute unto Ceſar or not?</q>
he gave a very wiſe and general anſwer,
<q>Render therefore unto Ceſar the things which are Ceſar's, and unto GOD the things which are GOD's.</q> Matth. xxii:17.21. We are informed, that upon another occaſion he paid the tribute-money, and that, after aſking Peter of whom do the kings of the earth take cuſtom or tribute? and Peter anſwering of ſtrangers, he remarked, "Then are the children free;" and yet nevertheleſs, as a voluntary act, ordered Peter, <q>Take a piece of money, and give unto them, for me and thee.</q> Matth. xvii:25-27.</p>
            <p>On theſe paſſages I ſhall make but two remarks, which are very obvious, and will apply themſelves: 1. How far ſoever the power of the magiſtrate and the ſubmiſſion of the ſubject may be extended, it is plain that by theſe rules and precedents property is left to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. To render, give, or pay, ſuppoſes property. Thoſe who may be juſtly deprived of what they poſſeſs, at
<pb n="30"
                   facs="unknown:014636_0049_0F94381AEE3CAF68"
                   rendition="simple:additions"/>
another's pleaſure, cannot be ſaid to be poſſeſſed of any property; and therefore they can neither give, pay, or render; they are themſelves the property of another. I would further obſerve, 2. That from the anſwer our LORD gives unto Peter, it appears that ſovereigns ought to treat their ſubjects as children, and that children ought to be free. O the free and benevolent ſpirit of the goſpel!</p>
            <p>By ſome it is urged, that ſovereigns have a right to take away what their ſubjects poſſeſs, at pleaſure. This right they ground on the following paſſage, 1 Sam. viii:10—
<q>This will be the manner of the king that ſhall reign over you, he will take your ſons, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point them for himſelf, for his chariots, and to be horſemen, and ſome ſhall run before his chariots— and he will take your daughters, to be confectionaries and to be cooks and bakers; and he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your oliveyards, even the beſt of them, and give them to his ſervants; and he will take the tenth of your ſeed, and of your vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards, and give to his officers and his ſervants; and he will take your men-ſervants and your maid-ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and your goodlieſt young men, and your aſſes, and put them to his work; he will take the tenth of your ſheep, and <hi>ye ſhall be his ſervants.</hi>
               </q>
Here then, according to ſome, is the warrant of divine right for arbitrary power. Thoſe however, who found authority to do what is wrong in a repreſentation, meant to deter the Jews from putting it in any man's power to treat them thus, would do well to conſider that from the text itſelf it plainly appears, this was not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as a right, but as a grievance, which their folly had brought on themſelves.
<q>You ſhall cry in that day, and the LORD will not hear you.</q> Your miſery
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:014636_0050_0F94381BABF70528"/>
will be the effect of your own folly. We have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other precedent, which ſeems ſomewhat in point: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoboam was a fooliſh ſon of a wiſe father; it ſeems he laid a tribute on Iſrael: (2 Chron. xiii:18.) The people applied unto him, preſented their grievances, and prayed redreſs:
<q>Thy father made our yoke grievous, now therefore do thou make it lighter, and we will ſerve thee.</q>
This the council of the old men ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed him to do; they ſaid,
<q>If thou wilt ſpeak good words unto them, they will be thy ſervants forever.</q>
But more violent counſels prevailed, the acts were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced,
<q>I will add to your yoke, I will chaſtiſe you with ſcorpions.</q>
This the deluded monarch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably conſidered as firmneſs and dignity; but what was the event? When all Iſrael ſaw that the king hearkened not unto them, they ſaid,
<q>What portion have we in David? to your tents, o Iſrael! now ſee to thine own houſe David.</q>
A kind and juſt anſwer might have prevented this; and what did the king himſelf gain? "The king ſent Adoram, who was over the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, and all Iſrael ſtoned him, that he died, and the king <hi>fled</hi> to Jeruſalem" Thus far tyranny was very unſucceſsful. But this is not all; when the army of Judah was now ready to fall upon the ten tribes, GOD himſelf interpoſed,
<q>Ye ſhall not fight againſt your brethren, the children of Iſrael; return every man to his houſe, for this thing is of me.</q>
Thus this matter ended in a ſeparation of the two kingdoms, and this very Roboam himſelf afterwards became a ſervant, and tributary to the king of Egypt.</p>
            <p>I leave the application of all theſe things to thoſe whom it may concern; but would further obſerve,</p>
            <p>Every government muſt be ſupported, and what is neceſſary for the ſupport of government, is alſo juſtly
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:014636_0051_0F94381EEBB0F790"/>
due, and ought to be GIVEN with readineſs and willingly.</p>
            <p>Thoſe that think their ſuperiors have a right to take away their property, or any part of it, without their conſent, upon their own principle are guilty of ſinful reſiſtance and rebellion, if they do not comply with whatever government may demand.<note n="*" place="bottom">King James the Firſt aſked the biſhops Nelſon and Andrews, whether he had a right to raiſe money on his own authority?

            <head>A SHORT AND CONCISE ACCOUNT OF THE STRUGGLES OF <hi>SWISSER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAND</hi> FOR LIBERTY.</head>
            <p>TO a benevolent mind taking a ſurvey of the globe, it muſt be a very melancholy conſideration that liberty, which is the birthright of man, is ſtill confined to a few ſmall ſpots of our earth: All Aſia and Africa are out of the queſtion; in the ſouthern hemiſphere of America it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, and aſtoniſhing pains are now taken to drive it out of this northern Continent In Europe Great-Britain is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly viewed as the ſeat of it; but if the conjecture of the biſhop of St. Aſaph be not void of foundation, even there it hath a ſickly countenance; SWISSERLAND, by that great man, is the only country which deſerves to be called free, and even Voltaire pronounceth it happy. By what means the Swiſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered and preſerved their freedom, is the ſubject of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing narrative.</p>
            <p>The three countries (uſually called cantons) of Ury, Switz and Underwalden, which firſt entered into a confederacy that laid the foundation of the republic of Swiſſerland, are but of ſmall extent, all the three cantons together do not exceed ſeventy miles in length and about thirty in breadth; they are alſo very thinly inhabited, owing to their ſituation among the Alps, many of which are covered with everlaſting ſnow, and inacceſſible to man or beaſt; it is uſually ſaid of the climate, that there is nine months winter and three months cold. At the time of their revolution the country was not nearly ſo well cultivated as it is at preſent, and at preſent all the inhabitants of the three cantons, capable of bearing arms, are not eſtimated above 12,000 men; a ſmall number to make head with, as they did, againſt the very powerful houſe of Auſtria. Power and number do not prove the juſtice of any cauſe, and it is more honourable to be defeated in the cauſe of virtue and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, than to erect trophies to injuſtice and oppreſſion. All Swiſſerland was ſubjugated by Julius Caeſar; it became after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſubject to different Lords, and had a nobility which
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:014636_0053_0F943820311C3078"/>
treated their inferiors with great petulancy and violence. The three cantons choſe Rudolph of Habſburg to be their captain, and on his being choſen Roman emperor in 1273, the nobility complained againſt theſe countries before him, and called them rebellious; but when the emperor ſaw their charters, he acquitted them, confirmed their privileges, and gave them governors that were not inhabitants of theſe countries, and were not to tyrannize over, but only from time to time to come among them, to adminiſter juſtice. Thus the country was quiet, ſubmitted to their governors; and had they been always treated with equal juſtice, probably would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſo to this day, but <hi>Nullum violentum diuturnum,</hi> "No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is violent laſts long."</p>
            <p>After the deceaſe of Rudolph of Habſburg, Adolphus of Naſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſau was choſen emperor; he confirmed their liberty, and they continued in ſubmiſſion to his government. Adolphus was ſlain in battle by the own hands of his rival, Albertus of Auſtria, ſon of Rudolph; and it has been obſerved that neither this Albertus, nor any that were active againſt Adolphus, died of a natural death.</p>
            <p>Albertus of Auſtria, having a numerous family of children, projected the eſtabliſhment of a new principality in Swiſſerland which then was a part of the empire; many imperial fiefs he apropriated to the houſe of Auſtria, purchaſed ſome juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions which belonged to monaſteries, and having made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf maſter of ſome ſtrong places, he thought to ſubdue theſe three cantons alſo, and ſent ambaſſadors to Ury, Switz and Underwalden, requeſting that they would ſurrender themſelves to him and the houſe of Auſtria, under many very fair promiſes. When his ambaſſadors arrived among them, the cantons pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced their charters, and alſo ſent an embaſſy to the emperor, praying that they might be confirmed, and that they might not be torn from the empire, and put in ſubjection to the then new houſe of Auſtria. Inſtead of being gratified, as they had hoped, they were not only refuſed, but the emperor alſo would not take the leaſt notice of their complaints againſt their gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, but appointed two new governors over them, which from day to day proceeded to new and unheard of acts of violence. The deſign was, by ſuch means to excite an inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection among the inhabitants, and then, under pretence of being rebellious, to make war upon them, and entirely to
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:014636_0054_0F9438210ADE9BA8"/>
bring them under the yoke. Theſe are the expreſs words of an hiſtorian, and in different times and places, tyranny makes uſe of the ſame arts. The tyranny and cruelty of theſe gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors continually encreaſed. At that time there lived in Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwalden an aged and honeſt inhabitant, whoſe name was Henry de Melchdall. The governor ordered two oxen to be taken from his plough, without even charging him with any crime; the honeſt man wanted at leaſt to know what had been his fault; but the governor's officer anſwered it was the will of the governor that henceforth the peaſants ſhould work in the plough themſelves, and took away the oxen by force; the ſon of the farmer, enraged at ſo much injuſtice and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, gave the officer a blow with a ſtick, and wounded his finger, and then fled the country immediately The governor put his aged father in priſon, and wanted to oblige him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver up his ſon; he excuſed himſelf that he did not know what became of him, but the governor ordered both his eyes to be put out, and took from him all he had.</p>
            <p>The caſtle of Rozberg was occupied by the governor's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty of the family of Wolfenſhieſs, the ſame ſeeing a very handſome woman, wanted to conſtrain her to gratify his bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal luſt; under ſome pretence ſhe withdrew, met her huſband, who being informed of it, gave the governor a back-ſtroke with an axe, and alſo immediately fled the country.</p>
            <p>Werner Stauffacre, a reſpectable man in the canton Switz, was building a handſome new houſe; the governor riding by, enquired of him whoſe it was? Stauffacre, aware of ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign if he ſhould dare to call it his own, replied, My noble governor, the houſe belongs to my king and you, and it is my fief. This fruſtrated the governor's deſign, but he told him withall, I will not ſuffer it that peaſants ſhould build houſes for themſelves as though they were lords, I will bridle you more cloſely.</p>
            <p>Governor Grisler, of Ury, could not help perceiving the diſſatisfaction of the people, and that he might diſcover the malecontents, he placed a hat on a pole at Altdorff, and gave ſtrict orders, that every one ſhould pay that hat the ſame honour as if he were preſent himſelf; he alſo placed ſome ſpies to obſerve who ſhould pay obeiſance to his hat and who ſhould neglect it. This inſolence wrought ſo effectually on the people, that even ſome of the nobility declared it impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:014636_0055_0F943821AD9A9750"/>
any longer to endure ſuch tyrannical proceedings. Among numbers that thought ſo in their hearts, there was one that had courage to refuſe ſubmiſſion to ſuch a badge of abject ſlavery. William Tell paſſed ſeveral times without pulling his hat; he was informed againſt, and after ſome impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, condemned, at the diſtance of one hundred and twenty yards, with his bow and arrow to take off an apple off the head of a beloved child of his, about ſix years old, and threatened with death in caſe he miſſed. No remonſtrance availed, his life and that of his ſon was threatened in caſe of refuſal; the afflicted parent moſt tenderly took his leave of his child, the ſpectators melted in tears, but he providentially hit the apple without doing any injury to his child. This hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened October 30, 1307; and romantic as it may ſeem, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blic monuments to this day confirm the truth of the fact The people congratulated Tell on his ſucceſs; but the governor obſerving he had another arrow in his quiver, aſked him the meaning. Tell at firſt excuſed himſelf with the common cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of marksmen: but this not ſatisfying the governor, and he ſolemnly promiſing him his life if he ſhould declare the truth, Tell very frankly ſaid, that had he had the misfortune to have done any injury to his child, he was determined to ſend the next arrow to the heart of the tyrannical governor. The governor condemned him to impriſonment for the reſt of his days. Tell was permitted to bid farewell to his family, and then bound to be carried acroſs a lake to the place of his cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, and in the ſame veſſel the governor alſo paſſed with his attendants. The lake of Lucerne is very liable to ſevere and ſudden tempeſts, a ſtorm of this kind brought them all into the moſt immediate danger: in this extremity Tell, who was known to be a good pilot, was ordered to take the helm, and he laboured ſo effectually that he brought the veſſel near the ſhore; which he had no ſooner effected, than he jumped out, and puſhed the veſſel off. The governor, with great difficulty, landed at ſome diſtance, but in the way to his caſtle he was waylaid by Tell in a narrow road, who placed the reſerved arrow in his heart that he inſtantly fell dead from the horſe; and Tell had time to fly to ſome of his friends and give them notice of this event. Theſe were Werner Stauffacre, Walter Fürſt and Arnold de Melchdall; theſe were partly ſorry to hear of this event, as it had been agreed upon to do nothing
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:014636_0056_0F943822703FF1A8"/>
before the firſt of January, 1308, when an attempt to recover liberty was to be made by the three cantons at once; they apprehended the killing of the governor before they were ready to follow the blow, would fruſtrate their attempt, and bring matters to a criſis before they were prepared; but ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants frequently haſten their own doom by their own meaſures.</p>
            <p>The oppreſſive governors were poſſeſſed of three caſtles, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs theſe were reduced, the oppreſſion muſt become every day more intolerable: One of the confederates had an amorous connexion with a ſervant-maid in the caſtle of Rozberg; ſhe, as uſual, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed him with means of entering, and he introduced twenty of his friends, who ſeized the caſtle and the governor without difficulty. The caſtle at Sarnen was taken by another ſtratagem: It was cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomary on new year's day to bring preſents to the governor; twenty confederates accordingly appeared at the caſtle gates early in the morning, and made the governor the uſual compliments, armed with nothing but long ſtaves; the governor was juſt agoing to maſs, and as he ſaw them without arms, ordered them to carry their gifts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the caſtle. They had no ſooner entered, but they fixed irons which they had concealed to their ſticks, made priſoners of the garriſon, and the caſtle was demoliſhed. The governors betook themſelves to flight, and nobody offered to purſue them. Thus in one day all the ſtrong holds were taken and deſtroyed, and the next day the three cantons ſolemnly ſwore to each other for the ſpace of ten years: This ſmall beginning laid the foundation of the republic of Swiſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, which has maintained its freedom and independency until this time, and nearly ſurvived the liberty of moſt ſtates of Europe.</p>
            <p>The emperor Albert had now obtained his wiſh, viz. a pretext to reduce the cantons by open war, under pretence of rebellion. He immediately repaired to Baden, <hi>ſtopt all commerce with theſe three cantons, and ordered his vaſſals to declare war againſt them</hi>; but while he meditated war againſt an oppreſſed people, he was himſelf mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by his nephew, whoſe inheritance he unjuſtly detained from him; his murderer hoped to find a place of retreat among theſe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons, but the Swiſs, zealous for their liberty, were incapable to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure it by giving an aſylum unto criminals; his widow was ſo bent upon avenging the death of her huſband, that ſhe took no meaſures againſt the Swiſs, who had reſiſted the oppreſſions of their tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal governors.</p>
            <p>Leopold, the ſon of Albert, when he came of age, determined to make war againſt the three cantons, and collected an army of 20,000 men for that purpoſe; his plan was to attack the confederates the 15th of November, 1311, at a place called Morgarden, ſituate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a lake and a mountain. In expectation that the inhabitants
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:014636_0057_0F9438232D2A7060"/>
of Underwalden would come to the aſſiſtance of the confederates, the Count of Straſberg and the city of Lucern were to invade the cantons at the ſame time and at two different places. At dinner he aſked the opinion of his jeſter, who replied,
<q>All adviſe how to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the country, it ſeems to me neceſſary to conſider how to come out again.</q>
His adviſe was deſpiſed, but verified by the event. A brave and virtuous people may be attacked, but wo to ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants that cannot retreat.</p>
            <p>The plan was exactly followed; Leopold made a falſe attack at Arth, and perhaps the confederates would have placed all their little force there, if they had not received an information to "beware at Morgarden." To that place the cantons Ury and Underwalden ſent 700 men, and the canton Swiſs an equal number, who were poſted on a mountain called the Saddle. On the day appointed the duke of Auſtria advanced at the head of his cavalry, his troops marched in great confidence, "<hi>ſure to obtain an eaſy victory upon peaſants, badly armed, and without military diſcipline:</hi>" Accordingly they proudly preſſed into a defile, when they were ſtopt by 50 men, who had been baniſhed the cantons for crimes, and whom, notwithſtanding their requeſt, the confederates would not think worthy to fight for liberty, even upon this preſſing occaſion. Theſe men, however, by generouſly expoſing themſelves for their country, hoped to deſerve the pardon of former crimes, they poſted themſelves on a very ſteep hill, above a narrow path, where the Auſtrian army could not march above two men a-breaſt; they ſuffered them very quietly to advance, but when a conſiderable number were now engaged in theſe narrow roads, they ſent ſuch a ſhower of ſtones and rolled large pieces of timber among the Auſtrian cavalry, that they were ſoon put in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion; which the Swiſs no ſooner perceived, than they fell upon them with ſuch fury, that they were obliged to retreat towards the plain; to gain ground to form the order of battle, the infantry opened their ranks, to let the cavalry paſs; at this moment the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates broke in upon them, and ſtanding on riſing ground, their halbards did moſt dreadful execution. A cotemporary author ſaith, it was not a fight but a maſſacre. The prince loſt near 1500 of his horſe, the loſs of the infantry could not be aſcertained, but 52 men from Zuric, then in the intereſt of Auſtria, were all found ſlain in a heap; the loſs of the confederates was incredibly trifling: Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while the count of Straſberg, with 4000 men had alſo invaded Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwalden, who ſend to their friends at Morgarden, and 400 of the victorious Swiſs inſtantly fled to their relief; they came up with a body of their own people, with whom they attacked the count, who ſeeing colours among them that had been at Morgarden, judged his maſter was defeated, and ſo fled. The Swiſs killed about 300 of his men in the retreat. After this battle gained, the three cantons en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:014636_0058_0F943823F7DFC1B8"/>
into a perpetual alliance, which no power has ſince been able to break, and which heaven has remarkably preſerved.</p>
            <p>One of the next greateſt battle the Swiſs fought in defence of their liberty, was in the year 1386. Leopold, duke of Auſtria<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> perſonally repaired to Swiſſerland, in order to carry on the war with greater vigour. The duke had reſolved to lay ſiege to Sempach: the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates had intelligence of it, and both oppoſite armies arrived before this little town the very ſame day. The Auſtrian advanced guard conſiſting of about 1400 men, committed all manner of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence on their territory: One of their officers mounted a cart loaded with halters, and threatened to hang all the inhabitants before ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet. The Auſtrians inſulted the Swiſs, it being in the time of hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>making, they came ſo near the walls to ſpeak with them, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired they would ſend dinner and wages to their mowers. The Swiſs replied, it was not the cuſtom of the Swiſs to pay wages till they were earned, and that they would prepare a dinner for them, that many ſpoons ſhould drop out of their hands. The duke's army conſiſted of about 4000 picked men, and among them many princes and noblemen, armed from head to foot. The confederates were about 1300 men, badly armed, and all on foot; they had no arms but hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bards, and faſtened pieces of wood on their arms, to fend off and break the blows of the enemies; their order of battle was very cloſe, and repreſented an angle, one ſoldier was followed by two, two by four, and ſo on; in this order this handful of men courage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly advanced againſt the enemy. Before they begun the engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as was uſual with them, they fell down to prayers which made the duke's jeſter ſay, <q>Leopold, my countrymen (for he was a Swiſs) have all lift up their hands, and ſworn to almighty GOD, to kill thee.</q> An Auſtrian officer, obſerving their undaunted coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, adviſed to delay the battle till next day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but a nobleman de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, <q>He would deliver that handful of boors before ſupper into the hands of the duke roaſted or boiled, as he ſhould beſt like them.</q> The nobility was ſo eager to engage, that they diſmounted, gave their horſes into the care of their ſervants, and would not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any but noblemen to ſhare in the honour of the day. It happened that a young nobleman, in cutting off the long point of his ſhoe (as all the reſt did) wounded his toe which made him cry, whereupon the nobility ordered him out of the rank, as unworthy to fight His brethren were all ſlain, and his life was ſaved. The battle begun, the ſuperior power of the Auſtrians in men and arms ſoon appeared, 60 confederates were killed before they could make the leaſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion on their enemy in this diſtreſs a brave knight of the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

down as many of their long pikes as he could hold, the others preſſed after him with irreſiſtable fury, broke in with their halbards upon the Auſtrians, and made dreadful havock.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid, that before the engagement they proclaimed that every man that thought himſelf inſufficient to encounter ten Auſtrians, might withdraw, and that about 300 withdrew according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but when theſe ſaw the Auſtrians order of battle broke, they haſtened to aſſiſt their brethren, and the nobility loſt courage, gave way to the Swiſs, and many of them, from the heat of the day and ſeverity of the engagement, were ſuffocated by the weight of their own armour. The duke was ſeveral times entreated to withdraw, but ſeeing his banner in danger, he generouſly advanced to reſcue it, but fell in the attempt. When the ſervants, who had been ordered in the rear with the horſes ſaw the defeat of their maſters, they mounted their maſters horſes, and left their maſters to ſhift for themſelves. It is ſuppoſed the loſs of the Auſtrians amounted to 2000. including 667 of the nobility, and among them 350 with crowned caſkets. The Swiſs loſt about 200, who were all carried to their reſpective homes. The third day they permitted the enemy to carry off their dead, among whom the duke was the principal; he was carried of the field of battle in a great box (ſtill extant), which, 'tis ſaid, had been full of halters, to hang the confederates. The Swiſs, in hopes of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining peace, were ſparing of the blood of the Auſtrians, and did not purſue them in their retreat; they had reaſon to repent their lenity, but the continuance of the war ſerved only to increaſe the victories and fame of the Swiſs confederates. The ſons of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated Leopold made great preparation for war, and many imperial cities joined with them againſt the Swiſs; a truce was indeed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, which the Auſtrians badly kept, and by ſurprize and ſecret intelligence made themſelves maſters of Weſen, the poſſeſſion of which laid the whole canton of Glaris open to their ravages. The Swiſs confederates adviſed that canton to get the beſt terms poſſible, but thoſe propoſed by the Auſtrians were ſo exceſſive ſevere, that that treaty came to nothing. The Auſtrians propoſed themſelves to invade that country with about 8000 men; the inhabitants had caſt up an entrenchment, which was guarded by about 350 men; when the Auſtrians advanced, theſe finding themſelves to weak to reſiſt, retreated to a riſing ground, the Auſtrians penetrated into the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and burned the village of Naſels, and then attacked the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned handful of inhabitants, who received them with a ſhower of ſtones; the Auſtrians having retreated a little to put themſelves under cover, the Swiſs ſeized the favourable moment, and fell upon them with ſuch fury, that after an engagement of five hours, they were forced to fly. The Swiſs purſued and came up with them at
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:014636_0060_0F943827E25BA780"/>
a bridge, where about 700 Swiſs had gathered; the Auſtrians, in their confuſion not aware that the bridge was broke, preſſed on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and numbers were drowned. The loſs of the Auſtrians was computed at 20<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>0, while that of the Swiſs did not exceed 55 men.</p>
            <p>The dukes of Auſtria again conſented to a truce, by which the Swiſs were to remain in poſſeſſion of all their conqueſts; this truce in 1314 was renewed for twenty, and in 1412 for fifty years longer. The Swiſs made uſe of theſe times of tranquillity to give ſtability and perfection to their military diſciplines. In 1393 they agreed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the following regulations among themſelves: 1. No church nor chapel to be attacked, unleſs it is made uſe of as an aſylum to the enemy. 2. No woman to be violated or inſulted. 3. <hi>Every Swiſs engageth to ſacrifice his ſubſtance and life for his country.</hi> 4. No Swiſs to forſake his poſt, even tho' wounded. 5. Forbids to pillage with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out leave of the commander, and orders the ſpoils to be equally divided 7. All that ſend proviſions to the Swiſs ſhall be protected. 8. No canton to make war without the conſent of the reſt. 9. No Swiſs to take away any thing by violence from another, neither in time of war nor peace.</p>
            <p>The Swiſs carried their military diſcipline to ſuch perfection, that Machiavel pretends no nations ever exceeded them in that reſpect, except the Romans.</p>
            <p>On the whole then we may conceive the riſe and progreſs of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty in Swiſſerland thus: 1. They had ſome rights and liberties granted them by emperors, which do not appear very conſiderable. 2. The emperors of the houſe of Auſtria endeavoured to ſeparate them from the Roman empire, and bring them in ſubjection to the then riſing houſe of Auſtria. 3. Againſt this the Swiſs remonſtrated, petitioned and pleaded their charters. 4. Governors were ſent among them, who were to, and did, oppreſs them, in order to drive them to ſome act of deſpair, which their enemies intended to term rebellion, and under pretence of it reduce them by force of arms. This, 5. at length produced confederacies, firſt only of three men, by degrees of three ſmall countries, which encreaſed gradually to <hi>thirteen</hi> cantons, beſides ſome confederates. 6. To ſubdue them, a ſtop was firſt put to their trade, and afterwards they were attacked by force. 7. When attacked, they defended themſelves with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible bravery, and under every poſſible diſadvantage reſiſted every attack and at laſt obliged their enemies not only to deſiſt, but to declare them a free ſtate; and ſurrounded by Auſtria, France and Savoy they have continued free and brave ever ſince, and may they do ſo to the end of time.</p>
