            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

obtain, if it may be, the <hi>Candour</hi> of this <hi>auguſt Aſſembly</hi>; and partly, to <hi>apologize</hi> for the many Defects which my <hi>Hearers</hi> will doubtleſs diſcover in the <hi>preſent Performance</hi>) That <q>So many eminent Pens have gone before in this Way, as have left it very difficult for thoſe who come after, either to ſay any Thing which they <hi>have not</hi> ſaid, or not to ſay, that much worſe which they <hi>have.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Upon being informed, that our <hi>Honourable Rulers</hi> (ſure I am, very unexpected to me) had <hi>Ordered</hi> I ſhould Preach before Them on <hi>this</hi> ſolemn Occaſion, my Thoughts fixed upon the <hi>Words</hi> read; which, if God ſhall pleaſe to afford his gracious Aſſiſtance, may be profitably handled, and appear to be <hi>a Word in Seaſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In order to the clearer Underſtanding of <hi>them,</hi> it will be requiſite to look back to the 15th Verſe of the Chapter, where, and in the Verſes following, the Prophet is directed to go and deliver a ſad Meſſage to <hi>Shehna,</hi> to tell him, that though he made <hi>Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> for a pompous Sepulture in the Place where he then was, he ſhould <hi>ſurely</hi> be <hi>violently toſſed like a Ball into a large Country,</hi> and <hi>there die,</hi> and be ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in his Office by one better than he, meaning <hi>Eliakim.</hi> As to <hi>Shehna</hi> and <hi>Eliakim</hi> 
               <q>Both of them had been Miniſters of State under King <hi>Hezekiah, Shehna</hi> having been his Scribe or Secretary, and <hi>Eliakim</hi> the Maſter of his Houſhold. And their Hiſtory (ſays a learned Man <note n="b" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Prideaux</hi>'s Connection, &amp;c. Vol. I. P.45.</note>) as far as may be collected from the Words of the Prophet, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be thus. <hi>Shehna</hi> being a very wicked Man was a fit Perſon to ſerve the Luſts and
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:006175_0006_102803650C5A1430"/>
evil Inclinations of <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> in the firſt Part of his Reign, and therefore was made his firſt Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter Of State; and <hi>Eliakim,</hi> who was of a quite contrary Character, was quite laid aſide. But on the Revolution that happened on the coming of the Army of the <hi>Aſſyrians, Shehna</hi> was taken Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner with his Maſter, and carried to <hi>Babylon,</hi> and there detained in Captivity to his Death. And therefore <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> on his Repentance and return to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> having reſolved on other Meaſures, called for <hi>Eliakim,</hi> and put the Management of all his Affairs into his Hands, who being a Perſon of great Wiſdom, Juſtice and Piety ſoon re-eſtabliſhed them upon the ſame Foot as they had been in the Days of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> and ſo preſerved them in Peace and Proſperity all his Time, to the great Honour of the King, and the Good of all his People, and therefore he hath the Character given him of being a <hi>Father to the Inhabitants of</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, <hi>and to the Houſe of</hi> Judah.</q> Thus he.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Robe</hi> and <hi>Girdle</hi> mentioned in the Text, are Enſigns of <hi>Authority.</hi> The Former very peculiar to <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> hence it is ſaid concerning the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and <hi>Jehoſophat</hi> the King of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi> that they <hi>ſat each on his Throne, having put on their Robes.<note n="c" place="bottom">1 Kings 22.10.</note>—Purple</hi> was anciently the Colour of the Garment or Robe worn by the Chief Ruler among the <hi>Romans</hi>: So that to ſend any one the <hi>Purple</hi> was in Effect to declare him <hi>Emperour</hi>

            <p>It follows,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And I will commit thy Government into his Hand.</hi> Civil Government is not an <hi>accidental</hi> Thing, which Men have hit upon by Chance, but is of Divine Inſtitution; <hi>By Me Kings reign</hi>

            <p>Notice is here taken of the <hi>Robe, Girdle,</hi> or <hi>Belt,</hi> and elſewhere <note n="l" place="bottom">Job 29.14</note> of the <hi>Diadem</hi>; all which, as alſo <hi>Crowns, Scepters, Gold Chains,</hi> &amp;c. are Emblems of <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi>; and therefore <hi>Princes</hi> and Potentates, have by the unanimous Vote of Mankind, had theſe Marks of Reſpect conferred upon them. All Ages have been content, that thoſe who <hi>govern</hi> them ſhould be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from the <hi>Vulgar,</hi> and make a more ſplendid Appearance upon all Occaſions than a <hi>Peaſant.</hi> And if they do not, they are apt to be look'd upon with Contempt. <q>Hiſtory (ſays one <note n="m" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Caryl.</hi>

him, but when they found him without any <hi>State,</hi> an old man in a mean Habit, they went away Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, none regarding him.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But not to inlarge here; I ſhall proceed to offer a few <hi>Reaſons,</hi> why thoſe who are advanced to Places of Power (as Civil Rulers are) ſhould be <hi>diſtinguiſhed</hi> from others, by <hi>external</hi> marks of <hi>Grandeur.</hi> And they are theſe that follow,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>To be a Motive to Rulers to excite them to Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilance and Care for the Good and Welfare of thoſe, on whoſe Account they have a juſt Title to thoſe Enſigns of Authority.</hi> A <hi>Ruler</hi> is not prefer'd to <hi>that</hi> Dignity only to give him Lieſure to be ſlothful and indolent, put in order to inſpire him with Reſolutions of acting in his exalted Station agreable to it: So that the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours done to him ought, and ſhould be ſo many <hi>Monitors</hi> to him, to lay out himſelf with ſo much the greater Diligence and Fidelity in ſerving the <hi>Publick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I believe the high Dignity <hi>Joſeph</hi> was raiſed to in <hi>Egypt,</hi> was a conſiderable <hi>Incentive</hi> to him to be very active in promoting the Welfare of that Kingdom. For after the Account that is given of the Marks of Reſpect <hi>Pharaoh</hi> put upon him, by placing him next to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in Authority, and giving him his <hi>Ring</hi> from off his Finger, clothing him with <hi>ſine Linnen,</hi> and putting a <hi>gold chain about his Neck</hi>; I ſay, after all this, it is ſaid, that <hi>Joſeph went out over all the Land of Egypt</hi> 
               <note n="n" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 41.41, 42, 43, 45.</note>. He forthwith applied himſelf to the Duties belonging to his Station, and did not content himſelf at Home in the enjoyment of the Honours conferred upon him, but by
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:006175_0010_10280369A3EC1F08"/>
his Diligence and Activity in his Office, let the King who had thus advanced him ſee, that his Favours were not miſplac'd.</p>
            <p>Indeed, Civil Rulers have much better, ſtronger and higher Motives to be public <hi>Benefactors</hi> than any <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Honours,</hi> that are done them, can be; ſuch as their being in a Capacity more <hi>extenſively</hi> to <hi>ſerve</hi> their <hi>Generation,</hi> than thoſe who move in a lower Sphere; and the high <hi>Reward</hi> that ſhall be given them in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, if they do it <hi>religiouſly.</hi> But ſtill <hi>outward Marks</hi> of Reſpect and Honour have their uſe and influence to this Purpoſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The publick Honours paid to Civil Rulers are partly deſigned for the <hi>Safeguard</hi> and <hi>Security</hi> of their <hi>Perſons.</hi> If Rulers behave in their Office ſuitable to the Dignity of it, and diſcharge with a laudable Fidelity the Truſt repoſed in them, the <hi>State</hi> ought to be more than a little concerned to preſerve and protect them. Men in high Stations are ſometimes expoſed to the Rage of unthinking People, and malign'd by envenom'd Tongues, while at the ſame Time they are endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faithfully to ſerve the Public; <hi>Is it a ſmall Thing that thou haſt brought us up out of a Land that floweth with Milk and Honey, to kill us in this Wilderneſs, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept thou make thy ſelf altogether a Prince over us?—Wilt thou put out the Eyes of theſe Men? We will not come up,</hi> 
               <note n="o" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Numb.</hi> 16.13, I4.</note> is Language that the meekeſt Man on Earth, and one of the beſt Rulers, was treated with, by an obliged, tho' ungrateful People. And it were well, if nothing of this Spirit were now to be found in the World, The Civil Ruler being <q>the <hi>Guardian</hi>
                  <pb n="12" facs="unknown:006175_0011_102800EB502F2488"/>
of the publick Quiet; appointed to reſtrain Violence,—and to preſerve that Order and Peace which preſerves the World: It is apparent, on theſe, and many other Accounts, what Hazards a good Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate runs; and therefore the Retinue of State which belongs to him, is ſuch as may, at the ſame Time, be his Ornament and Defence.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. and <hi>Laſtly,</hi> External Marks of Honour are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe appropriated to Rulers, in order to promote in thoſe under their Authority a proper Eſteem and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard for them. Not that it is to be ſuppoſed any are ſo weak as to be influenced to behave dutifully towards Rulers, and treat them with Reverence merely on the Account of the outward Splendor, annexed to their Office, but that <hi>this</hi> may be ſome Inducement to People to ſhew them that Reſpect and pay that Defference to them which is juſtly due to their Character.</p>
            <p>None then ſhould envy the civil Ruler thoſe Marks of Honour which the Oracles of God entitle him to, and the Wiſdom of Nations hath thought it proper he ſhould enjoy: Since ſuch valuable Ends as we have heard may be ſerved hereby.</p>
            <p>I now proceed to the</p>
            <p n="2">II. Obſ. That <hi>Good Rulers are, and ſhould be</hi> FATHERS <hi>to their People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Twas my Purpoſe chiefly to have inſiſted upon <hi>this,</hi> but the Time, I perceive, will not admit of much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> here; and therefore ſhall content myſelf as briefly as I can,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:006175_0012_1028036EE30BA630"/>1. To ſhew, <hi>Wherein</hi> Civil Rulers ſhould be FATHERS to their People. And,</p>
            <p n="2">2. What <hi>Obligation</hi> they are under to be ſo.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I am to ſhew, <hi>Wherein</hi> Civil Rulers should be FATHERS to their People.</p>
            <p>This is an Appellation given in the Scripture to Perſons cloathed with Publick Authority. Hence KINGS are called <hi>nurſing Fathers</hi>; and <hi>Naaman</hi>'s Servant addreſſed him in the ſame Stile of Reſpect and Reverence, who <hi>was a great Man with his Maſter</hi> (the King of <hi>Syria</hi>) <hi>and Honourable,</hi> 
               <note n="p" place="bottom">2 Kings 5.1.13.</note>
               <hi>My Father, if the Prophet had had thee do ſome great Thing,</hi> &amp;c. And 'tis related of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> (who perhaps was one of the beſt and wiſeſt of all the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors, before the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> was publickly countenanced in <hi>that State,</hi>) that when <q>the People offer'd him the Title of <hi>Lord,</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed it, and thought the Title of <hi>Pater Patria</hi> more honourable</q> 
               <note n="q" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Ducter. Hiſt.</hi> Vol. II. <hi>P.</hi> 3.4.</note>, as indeed it was.</p>
            <p>Now there are ſeveral Ways wherein <hi>Civil Rulers,</hi> (who are <hi>Political Fathers</hi>) may, and ſhould mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt their <hi>paternal</hi> Regards to thoſe who are under their Authority,</p>
            <p n="1">1. By their <hi>Love</hi> to them. The Love of <hi>natural Parents</hi> to their <hi>Children</hi> is exceeding great: <hi>Can a Woman forget her ſucking Child</hi> 
               <note n="r" place="bottom">Iſal. 49.15.</note>? Intimating that
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:006175_0013_102800EEDEEF6F00"/>
it is a very unlikely Thing, and next to an Impoſſibility, <hi>David</hi> wiſh'd he might have died inſtead of his Son <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolom; Would God,</hi> ſays he, <hi>I had died for thee</hi> 
               <note n="s" place="bottom">2 Sam. 18.33.</note>.</p>
            <p>And ſhall no Footſteps of <hi>paternal</hi> Affection be found in thoſe who are <hi>political Fathers?</hi> Since <hi>both</hi> are ſtiled <hi>Fathers,</hi> may it not be juſtly expected, that there ſhould be ſomething <hi>ſimilar</hi> in them? Certainly, <hi>civil Rulers</hi> may be look'd upon rather as <hi>Tyrants</hi> than FA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THERS, if they be not cordial <hi>Lovers</hi> of thoſe whom they rule over: <hi>God be gracious to thee my Son,</hi> ſaid <hi>Joſeph</hi> to his Brother <hi>Benjamin</hi> 
               <note n="t" place="bottom">Gen. 43.29.</note>. Which, perhaps, was ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken rather as <hi>Superiours</hi> were wont to do to thoſe below them <note n="u" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Patrick</hi> in Loc.</note> than becauſe he was his near Relation; tho' it may include <hi>both.</hi> If the <hi>former</hi> be only meant, then it ſhews great Regard, Love and Affection, <hi>civil Rulers</hi> ought to have for thoſe who are Subject to their Authority</p>
            <p>The Truth is, if <hi>political Fathers</hi> have no <hi>real Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> for their People, 'tis not probable that there will be any <hi>mutual Confidence</hi> between them. They will always be <hi>jealous</hi> one of the other; and the <hi>One</hi> will be apt to <hi>rule as Tyrants,</hi> and the <hi>Other</hi> to <hi>obey as Slaves</hi>; becauſe they cannot help it.</p>
            <p>So that it is neceſſary, in order to anſwer the Ends of civil Government, that <hi>Rulers</hi> ſhould behave towards their <hi>People,</hi> with the Tenderneſs and Affection of FA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THERS. So did <hi>Nehemiah, David,</hi> and <hi>Jehoſhaphat,</hi> and divers others in the <hi>firſt Chair of Government,</hi> which are found on Scripture Record.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:006175_0014_102803706A3DE760"/>And in <hi>the ſame Way,</hi> it is <hi>ſtill</hi> the Wiſdom and Duty of <hi>civil Fathers</hi> to conduct themſelves towards their <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>: And if they do ſo indeed, doubtleſs they will find their Account in it, ſooner or later.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Civil Rulers ſhould ſhew themſelves <hi>Fathers</hi> to their <hi>People,</hi> by <hi>protecting</hi> them to the utmoſt of their Power. This they ſhould do both in Times of <hi>War</hi> and <hi>Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">(1) In a Time of <hi>War.</hi> 
               <q>In ſuch a World as this is, there is no living without War</q>; tho' the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents of it are commonly very dreadful; <hi>every Battle of the Warriour</hi> being <hi>with confuſed Noiſe, and Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments rolled in Blood</hi> 
               <note n="w" place="bottom">Iſa. 9, 5.</note>.</p>
            <p>Therefore <hi>civil Rulers</hi> (as <hi>Fathers</hi> of their People) ſhould do all they can, to <hi>preſerve</hi> them from ſo great Calamity; as <hi>natural Parents,</hi> we may well ſuppoſe, would, to ſave their <hi>Children</hi> from Deſtruction. Hence 'tis their Duty to make <hi>ſeaſonable</hi> Proviſion for their Safety; and this they may do, not only by uſing all proper Means to preſerve them from the Miſeries of War; but likewiſe by making, in Times of Peace, ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table <hi>Preparation</hi> for their <hi>Defence,</hi> in Caſe a War ſhould happen. 'Twas prudent Advice King <hi>Asa</hi> gave his People, and well becoming a <hi>Father</hi> of his Country, <hi>Let us build theſe Cities, and make about them Walls, and Towers, Gates and Bars, while the Land is yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us</hi>—<note n="x" place="bottom">2 Chron. 14.7.</note>.</p>
            <p n="2">(2) <hi>Political Fathers</hi> ſhould be careful to promote the outward Proſperity of their People in Times of Peace.
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:006175_0015_102800F6F41A2E38"/>
How much of the Spirit of a true <hi>Patriot</hi> breathed forth in theſe Words, which proceeded from royal Lips; and how much of the Tenderneſs and Affection of a <hi>Father</hi> did they diſcover towards his People? <hi>And</hi> David <hi>ſpoke unto the Lord, when he ſaw the Angel that ſmote the People, and ſaid, Lo, I have ſinned, and I have done wickedly, but theſe Sheep, what have they done? Let thine Hand, I pray thee, be againſt me, and againſt my Father's Houſe</hi> 
               <note n="y" place="bottom">2 Sam 24.17.</note>. As a tender <hi>Parent</hi> will hazard his own Life to ſave his <hi>Child's,</hi> ſo this good King had the Welfare of his <hi>Subjects</hi> ſo much at Heart, that he was even willing to redeem <hi>their</hi> Lives with the Loſs of <hi>his own: Theſe Sheep, what have they done? Let thine Hand, I pray thee, be againſt me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Civil Fathers, it may be, never act more becoming their Character, than when they manifeſt a true Concern for their People's <hi>Prosperity,</hi> and how they may moſt effectually promote it.</p>
            <p>And here allow me to ſay, that a neceſſary Step to this Purpoſe, is to provide <hi>good Laws,</hi> and to take due Care that they be <hi>well executed</hi>; Laws that encourage In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, and are deſignedly calculated to put Marks of Diſgrace upon the <hi>Idle</hi> and <hi>Lazy</hi>; that Children born of <hi>needy</hi> Parents, be put out to Trades, and brought up in honeſt <hi>Callings</hi>: Hereby the Publick, in all Probability, will, not only be eaſed of <hi>a Bill of Charge,</hi> but reap the <hi>Benefit</hi> of their diligent Labours. <hi>That</hi> good <hi>Order,</hi> and <hi>ſeaſonable Hours</hi> be kept in Houſes of <hi>publick Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment</hi>; and <hi>Intemperance</hi> (the <hi>growing Iniquity</hi> of the preſent Age) be ſuppreſt, if poſſible. <hi>Eſpecially,</hi> that the LORD'S-DAY be religiouſly obſerved, and kept
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:006175_0016_1028037202326C78"/>
as a Day of <hi>holy Reſt.</hi> In a Word, <hi>that</hi> ALL <hi>Immora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,</hi> of what Kind ſoever be diſcountenanced and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed.</p>
            <p>And while I am ſpeaking of theſe Things, I cannot paſs over in Silence, the late excellent ACT made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>profane Curſing and Swearing</hi>; for which, I doubt not, all good Men are very <hi>thankful,</hi> and <hi>bleſs</hi> God, that he was pleaſed to put it into the Hearts of our <hi>honourable Rulers</hi> to make ſuch a noble and heroic STAND againſt ſo <hi>prevailing</hi> an Iniquity.</p>
            <p>And to encourage (if need be) our <hi>civil Fathers</hi> in their <hi>future Endeavours</hi> to <hi>reform</hi> the <hi>Lives</hi> and <hi>Manners</hi> of this People; I would further ſay, that the ACT re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to, hath been thought (by thoſe who are moſt likely to know) to have given a conſiderable <hi>Check</hi> to that <hi>bold Tranſgreſſion.</hi> It were to be wiſh'd, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like it <hi>had</hi> been alſo, or <hi>may be invented,</hi> more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually to ſuppreſs <hi>Drunkenneſs; a Sin which threatens Ruin to this Land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Civil Rulers, as <hi>Fathers</hi> of their People, ſhould uſe much <hi>Prudence</hi> in exerciſing their Authority. It is ſaid, concerning <hi>David,</hi> that <hi>he behaved himſelf wiſely—and he was acceptable in the Sight of all the People, and alſo in the Sight of</hi> Saul's <hi>Servants</hi> 
               <note n="y" place="bottom">1 Sam. 18.5.</note>, The whole <hi>Court,</hi> it ſeems, admired him for his diſcreet Conduct: And in ſuch a Society, to behave ſo as to be univerſally applau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, is no common Thing.</p>
            <p>For Want of <hi>prudent Management, Rehoboam</hi> loſt the <hi>greater</hi> Part of his Subjects. Had he given them good
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:006175_0017_102800F880C79D90"/>
Words, and followed the ſage Advice offered him by his grave Counſellors, the unhappy Separation that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued, might (humanely ſpeaking) have been prevented:</p>
            <p>But his Conduct was ſuch, even when his <hi>all,</hi> in a Manner (as to his Regal Authority) lay at Stake, that the worſt of his Enemies could not wiſh him to act more fooliſhly than he did.</p>
            <p>It was ſaid by the old Men, who had been of his Father's Council, <hi>If thou wilt be a Servant unto this People this Day, and ſpeak good Words to them, then they will be thy Servants forever</hi> 
               <note n="z" place="bottom">1 Kings 12.7.</note>. But he had not the Wiſdom to take their Advice, and thereupon great Confuſion followed. See here, <hi>How requiſite Prudence, and wiſe Conduct is in Civil Rulers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. and Laſtly, Civil Rulers ſhould manifeſt their <hi>Paternal</hi> Care of their People, by ſetting before them a <hi>good Example.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis not eaſy to imagine what a mighty Influence a pious Ruler's Example is apt to have upon thoſe who are under his Authority. Children, we ſee, have a ſtrong Propenſity to approve and practice what is done by their Parents: And the Caſe is much the ſame with Reſpect to <hi>Civil Fathers</hi>; THE EXAMPLE OF THE KING being a Maxim that moſt ſeem willing to conform unto.</p>
            <p>Therefore it muſt needs have a great Tendency to promote the beſt Interſts of a People when their <hi>politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Fathers</hi> are Perſons of eminent Piety, and bright Examples of <hi>pure and undefiled Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:006175_0018_102800D1C6998788"/>The Prophet <hi>Eliſha</hi> would have had no Regard to the diſtreſſed Hoſt of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and thoſe that were with them, had it not been for the Reſpect he bore to King <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> on the account of his great <hi>Piety; And</hi> Eliſha <hi>ſaid unto the King of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>What have I to do with thee?—Surely were it not that I regard the Preſence of</hi> Jehoſaphat, <hi>the King of</hi> Judah, I WOULD NOT LOOK TOWARD THEE, NOR SEE THEE <note n="a" place="bottom">2 Kings 3.13, 14.</note>.</p>
            <p>If a People ſee their Rulers to be looſe or profane, they will either deſpiſe them, or be too ready to imitate their bad Example; and thus their <hi>Leaders will cauſe them to err</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="bottom">Iſai. 9.16.</note>.</p>
            <p>Having ſhewed in a few Particulars, Wherein Civil Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers ſhould be FATHERS to their <hi>People</hi>: I come in the</p>
            <p>II Place, as was propoſed, to mention the <hi>Obligations</hi> they are under to <hi>be ſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I ſhall Name only Two at preſent,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>great Trust</hi> committed to Civil Rulers ought to be a ſtrong Inducement to them to exert their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, in all proper Ways, for the Good of their People, and to carry as <hi>Fathers</hi> to them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Natural Fathers</hi> look upon their <hi>Off-ſpring</hi> to be an important Charge (as indeed it is) and therefore are willing to run all Hazards to preſerve them, and to promote their Welfare.</p>
            <p>And the like Concern (in ſome Degree) ought Civil Fathers to have for their Poople.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:006175_0019_102800FBC0477CC8"/>Thus they ſhould carefully conſult their Intereſt in all Reſpects; adviſe them in the beſt Manner they can, and upon all difficult Emergencies appear in the Gap for their Relief. Hear how <hi>Job</hi> (who doubtleſs had been a Man in Authority) ſpeaks concerning himſelf, <hi>I delivered</hi> (ſays he) <hi>the Poor that cried, the Fatherleſs, and him that had none to help him. The Bleſſing of him that was ready to periſh came upon me; and I cauſed the Widows Heart to ſing for Joy. I was Eyes to the Blind, and Feet was I to the Lame: I was a Father to the Poor, and the Cauſe which I knew not, I ſearched out: And I brake the Jaws of the Wicked, and plucked the
Spoil out of his Teeth</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="bottom">Job. 29.12,—17.</note>.</p>
            <p>Thus to do is the ſureſt Courſe Civil Rulers can take to ſecure to themſelves the amiable Character of true <hi>Patriots.</hi> And indeed for this very End and Purpoſe were they appointed, and not <hi>to lord it over their Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours.</hi>
            </p>

If Rulers do not behave as <hi>Fathers</hi> towards their <hi>People,</hi> there is <hi>Danger</hi> of their <hi>loſing the Honour, Eſteem and Reverence,</hi> which otherwiſe they might juſtly expect to receive from them. The <hi>Subject</hi>'s Love is the <hi>Prime</hi>'s ſtrongeſt Cittadel. If Rulers are tyrannical and cruel in their Government, they muſt look for no <hi>chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> but only a <hi>forc'd</hi> Submiſſion to be paid them. If thoſe under Authority perceive their Rulers have no <hi>paternal</hi> Concern for them, they will be apt to have but little Affection for their <hi>Civil Fathers</hi>; which muſt needs be productive of great Confuſion and Diſorder in the Body Politic: <hi>One</hi> will be jealous of the <hi>other</hi>; and when <hi>Power</hi> is viſibly abuſed <hi>Submiſſion</hi> will be found an hard Taſk.</p>
            <p>That Parent who governs his Children with a prudent Lenity or Gentleneſs, and appears to be deeply concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for their Welfare on all Accounts, takes the ſureſt Courſe to entitle himſelf to their ſincere Reſpect, and to be truly honoured by them. Whereas he that is rigorous and always treats them in a churliſh imperious Manner, is only <hi>ſlaviſhly feared,</hi> but not <hi>cordially loved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the Caſe is much the ſame as to <hi>Political Fathers</hi>: If by <hi>them</hi> the People <hi>enjoy great Quietneſs, and very worthy Deeds are done unto</hi> them, by their <hi>Providence,</hi> they probably will <hi>accept of it always, with all Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs.</hi> Sure I am, they would be liable to ſevere Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures

if they did not. But if nothing but Frowns and Rebukes, haughty and imperious Carriage be to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, no wonder if ſuch Rulers ſoon loſe the Hearts of their People. But <hi>Beloved, I hope better Things of you,</hi> our Civil Fathers, <hi>though I thus ſpeak.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But there is one Thing that I muſt by no Means omit the mentioning of, and that is, to recommend a PUBLICK SPIRIT, which is ſo much wanting in <hi>this Land</hi>; and which is equally neceſſary to be found not only in Rulers, but the People alſo, in order to our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming a proſperous and flouriſhing State. A learned Man, whoſe Words I have had Occaſion to cite before, ſays, <q>' Twas the Temper of the <hi>Romans</hi> to do and receive all they could for the Interſt of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Wealth, without taking or reſerving any Thing to themſelves, but the Honour of ſerving it to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of their Power; and as long as this Temper laſted, they proſpered in all their Undertakings; but afterwards, when this <hi>Public Spirit</hi> became turned all into <hi>Self-Intereſt,</hi> and none ſerved the Public but to ſerve <hi>themſelves,</hi> by plundering it, every Thing then went backward with them as faſt as it had gone for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward with them before, till they were ſoon after ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up, firſt in Tyranny, and afterwards in Ruin.</q>

            <p>Thus I have done with the <hi>Obſervations</hi> raiſed from the Text, and ſhall now proceed the the</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>APPLICATION</head>
               <p>In which 'tis my Purpoſe to be very brief.</p>
               <p>Use I. Hence how great a <hi>Mercy</hi> ought a People to account it, when God gives ſuch to rule over them who are concerned to promote their beſt Intereſts, and deſirous to ſhew them all the Affection and Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of kind Fathers. And ſuch a Mercy our Nation and Land enjoy in his preſent MAJESTY, our <hi>Rightful and most Gracious Sovereign King</hi> GEROGE II. who, we truſt, eſteems it a greater Honour to be the Common Father of his Loyal Subjects, than to wear the Imperial Crown of <hi>Great-Britain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſuch, we hope, His <hi>Excellency</hi> our Commander in Chief, and all our <hi>Civil Rulers</hi> will be to <hi>this Province.</hi> And if they are indeed ſo, and we do not accordingly Eſteem and Honour and Support them, let every Body call us ungrateful, and they cannot call us worſe, or ſay any Thing of us that is more to our Diſcredit.</p>
               <p>'Tis juſtly to be look'd upon as an high Favour when Rulers are ambitious of arriving to the Character of being <hi>Fathers</hi> to their People. All Things in the <hi>State</hi> will then probably be carried on with much Eaſe and Unanimity; <hi>Rulers</hi> will not graſp after <hi>more</hi> Power than properly belongs to them, nor the <hi>People</hi> be under a Temptation to wiſh it <hi>leſs</hi> than it is.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="unknown:006175_0023_102801019C405C60"/>And thus there will be an admirable Harmony be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Rulers and Ruled, which is the Beauty and Glory of all Communities both civil and ſacred.</p>
               <p>Use II. Are Rulers Civil FATHERS? Then 'tis our Duty to <hi>honour</hi> them <hi>as ſuch</hi>; and not with a curious or (which is much worſe) a malicious Eye, to pry into their Failings (which none are without) and magnify them beyond what they really are. Thoſe of lower Rank know little of the Cares and Burden of <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> 
                  <q>Whatever ambitious and inconſiderate Men may think (ſays one) wiſe Men do certainly <hi>know</hi> and find by Experience, that to diſcharge all the Parts of a good <hi>Governour</hi> is a very difficult and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Province. Inferiour Magiſtrates (as he goes on) find Care and Trouble enough, in that ſmall Share and Part of it which they ſuſtain; and if ſo, then certainly the Care and Concernment of the <hi>whole</hi> muſt needs be a heavy Burden indeed. <note n="h" place="bottom">Abp. <hi>Tillot.</hi> Vol. II.

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore, inſtead of <hi>Murmuring</hi> and <hi>Railing</hi> at our Civil Fathers, we ought to pity and pray for them, to <hi>reverence</hi> and <hi>honour</hi> them; and as much as we can to encourage them in their faithful Endeavours to ſerve the Public, as they did <hi>Ezra; Ariſe, for this Matter belongeth unto thee,</hi> WE ALSO WILL BE WITH THEE: <hi>Be of good Courage and do it</hi>
