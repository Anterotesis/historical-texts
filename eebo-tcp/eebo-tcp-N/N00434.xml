            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Your coming here according to the Custome of your Ancestors, to Condole the death of your <hi>Brethren</hi> Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered at <hi>Shennechtady</hi> is very acceptable, whereby your Inclination towards us is Demonstrated; we must acknowledg that they did not keep so good Watch as they ought, considering what a false and deceitful Enemy they had to deal withal, but that which made them so secure, was, the great Trust which they Reposed in the forty <hi>Maquass</hi> who came here, and Tendered their Service to go and be the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>watch, and to spy the Enemy: To which end Powder and Lead

               </gap> they desired; we were about Hiring Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians to send thither, but were unhappily diverted by the said Company of <hi>Maquass,</hi> who promised to have four Posts ready, two to go to their own Country, and two to come hither if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Enemy should appear. For the Brethren did assure us, that <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> 
               <hi>French</hi> could come here without being Discovered; and then would all fall into our hands: We are likewise mindful, how that the five Nations last <hi>Fall,</hi> when the Gentlemen of <hi>New-England</hi> were here did Declare how they would Encompass the <hi>French</hi> of <hi>Canada,</hi> that they could not break out this Winter, without being Discovered and Fallen upon: We did likewise propose by our Messengers, <hi>Arnout,</hi> and <hi>Robert Sanders</hi> at the General Meeting of <hi>Onnondage</hi> to have Three or Four Hundred Men sent hither to be ready on all occasions, but see none.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Brethren,</hi> this Evil is done and cannot be called back again, and the only means to prevent the like for the future, is to keep good Watch, and to have good courage to oppose and resist the Enemy.

               <hi>Onnondage,</hi> speaking of Peace, and then they were upon the way, hither to commit this Murther.</p>
            <p>☞ The <hi>Brethren</hi> need not fear for a <hi>Cessation</hi> to hinder us to pursue the Enemy, for as we told you before, the KING that ordered <hi>that,</hi> was a <hi>Papist,</hi> and a great Friend of the <hi>French;</hi> But our present Great KING will pursue the War to the outmost: Therefore we must all prepare for War. It will therefore be very requisite that the <hi>Brethren</hi> for their better Security come and Plant this Summer at <hi>Shinnechtady</hi> upon the Land that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be cultivated this year, that we may be near to one another upon any occasion. Concerning the Proposition of the <hi>Shackkook</hi> Indians, 'tis concluded on some dayes ago, to propose to the <hi>Shack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kook</hi> Indians the Planting on <hi>Marte Gerritse</hi> Island hard by the Town, and the River <hi>I</hi>ndians that live below shall also come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to be ready on all occasions.</p>
            <p>We must <hi>I</hi>nsist and Recommend you to perswade them of <hi>Oneyde</hi> to send the <hi>Priest</hi> hither, for you have seen how dangerous
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:000545_0008_0FA6B653B8DF3440"/>
it is to have such persons among you, who informs the Enemy of all your doings, and discovers all our Designs, we shall secure him that he Run not away, and when the Owner demands him, and these Troubles are over, shall be Delivered, for he can do more harm in <hi>Oneyde</hi> than an hundred men.</p>
            <p>We think it Convenient that one or two of the <hi>Sachims</hi> stay here, and that a <hi>Sachim</hi> of each Nation be here to assist in the management of the Affairs of the War. There was given them six Belts of <hi>Wam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pom,</hi> some <hi>Duffils,</hi> Tobacco, and some Bags with Provision.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A</hi>fter the Proposition was answered, they gave a Shout according to their Custome, which signified <hi>Amen,</hi> that they would continue the War to the utmost.</p>
            <p>After the said Answer was made, The <hi>Maquas Sachems</hi> said after they had Repeated our Answer. We are glad to see that you are not Discouraged, A mistake can be made by the best and wisest of men, and we must see now to Pursue the War with all Vigour, we have an hundred men out in Pursuit of the Enemy still, who are good Sko<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>s; in the mean time, we expect all the <hi>Sachims</hi> of the Upper Nations to Consult with us, who will come to Condole the Death of our <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi> Murthered at <hi>Shennechtady:</hi> You need not fear our being Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, we are soon fitted out, our Ax is in our hand.

The Buisiness must be soon brought to a Period; therefore send in all haste to <hi>New-England,</hi> for we nor you cannot live long in this Condition; we must order it so, that the <hi>French</hi> be in a continual Fear and Alarm, and that is the way to be in Peace here.</p>
            <p>Concerning the <hi>Shakkook</hi> Indians in our Opinion they lye well where they are, as a good Watch, They are our Children, we will take care that they do their Duty, but as for the <hi>Indians</hi> that live be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Town, Them we mean must be sent for up, and got to Plant and live together, to be always in Readiness upon occasion.</p>
