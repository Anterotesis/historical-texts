            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.
      </p>
         </projectDesc>
         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The chief occaſion of there being ſo many errours, was, the Printer being a man of another nation and language, as alſo not bred to that employment, conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſomething unexpert both in language and calling, and the corrector's not being ſo frequently at hand as the caſe required, all which I deſire thou wouldſt favourably conſider.</p>
            <p>The Intent of publiſhing this, was chiefly to prevent any from being deceived, and alſo to undeceive thoſe that may have been already deceived by this unfair, man's abuſive book; for ſuch it is, and as ſuch, let it be added to the Catalogue of thoſe many envious and abuſive writings, that have been ſent forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, from time to time, to hinder the ſpreading of truth, and the progreſs of Gods people in the way of it: all which will ſurely be accounted for one day, and not witſtanding all which, the truth remains the ſame, and I am ſatisfied will more and more ſpread it ſelf, and prevail, in and upon and the hearts ſpirits of people, notwithſtanding the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and reſtleſs attempts of its Oppoſers, to hinder it.

Now theſe things put me into a farther ſearch, into both his former and latter books, and in his former I ſtill found, where he was concerned to treat of the ſubject, he alvvais denyed that knovvledge to be eſſentially neceſſary to ſalvation, particularly in his <hi>Umiverſal free Grace &amp;c., p.</hi> 117, and <hi>Light of truth triumphant, p.</hi> 6. By his former books, I mean ſuch as bear date before the year 1681. or thereabouts, Which is ſuppoſed to be about the time that he wrote (as he acknowledged) 199 of the 200 queries concerning the <hi>Revolution of humane ſouls &amp;c.</hi> But by his latter books it appears, that he is clearly changed in principle as to the point of doctrine; and I finding things thus, and alſo how he was receded from his principles in ſome other matters, wherein he differed with Friends, as About the ſufficiency of the Light without ſomething elſe, and about Preachers being Magiſtrares, and o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But there is one thing more, which I am ſure he ought not only to Retract, now his hand is in, but alſe deeply to lament, and that is; His ſo abuſing his poor bigotted followers Cas I have already hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) in his thus deluding them, by ſo often perſwading them, at the firſt, that he was not changed in his Principles; and when he hath done this, I know not, but as to this point, he may pretty well paſs, for ſuch a kind of an honeſt man, as is ſo vvith good looking to: But before he dos thus much, I do not ſee hovv he can be afforded the appellation. And novv to conclude, I do ſay; that ſuppoſe I had ſeen, and took no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of ſome paſſages in our Friends books, which might ſeem to me like inconſiſtencys, eſpecially in relation to things not then in controverſy, I do not look upon my ſelf equally obliged to expoſe them, as I did his, which were ſo palpable, and done for the reaſon aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>The next thing I ſhall take noice of, is, <hi>Daniel Leedss'</hi> pretences in this his <hi>Preface</hi> now be fore me; that

Yet I queſtion not to prove him in his thus doing not only an <hi>Accuſer,</hi> but a very falſe <hi>Accuſer of the Brethren</hi>; which to be ſure could not proceed from a motion heavenly, and ſcarſe think he can be ſo infatuated, as to think it did, unleſs his meaning be; That he was influenced in this action, by the motion of the ſtarrs, that are placed in that firmament of huven, and

<q>That it was unworthy of God to pardon but not to inflict puniſhment on the innocent, or require a ſatisfaction where there was nothing due.</q>
Now mark, Theſe words plainly imply that <hi>W. P.</hi> counted <hi>Chriſt</hi> innocent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that there was nothing of debt due from him, which ſpoils <hi>D.

Nothing leſs: For is it not common among men, for a man to pay a debt for his Friend, which though he pay with his own, yet the debt was not due from him; Even ſo, <hi>Chriſt laid down his live for our ſins,</hi> but yet not to pay any debt of his own, for as <hi>W.

            <p>I now muſt again call upon <hi>D: L.</hi> to be impartial, for if <hi>W: P.</hi> be guilty of errour here, how can his Friend <hi>G: K.</hi> be ſound? For it is one of the falſe doctrins he charges the <hi>New-England</hi> Profeſſours with;
<q>That juſtification is only by <hi>Chriſt's</hi> righteousneſs without <hi>us,</hi> imputed to us, and received by faith alone, and not by any righteousneſs of god and <hi>Chriſt</hi> infuſed into us, or wrought in us, </q>ſee <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian and Independent &amp;c.</hi> p: 204, not yet retracted, and in his <hi>Looking glaſs to the Proteſtants</hi> p: 21,

<q>this is our faith, that we are juſtified by an inward righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs wrought by the Spirit of God in our hearts.</q>
What Saiſt thou now <hi>Daniel?</hi> Can <hi>W: P.</hi> be heterodox in this matter, and <hi>G: K.</hi> orthodox?

<q>that he hath retracted or renounced any one aſſertion in any one of his former books, that was judged by him an Article of faith, of which this about juſtification is one; for ſaith he: this is our faith, that we are juſtified by an inward Righteousneſs &amp;c.</q>

            <p>His next flingh is grounded cheifly upon his abuſing <hi>G: W</hi>'s. words and meaning, as well as that he there in abuſeth his Reader, by his forging words in <hi>G.

<q>To ſay the man <hi>Chriſt</hi> is in us, or the light in us is the man <hi>Chriſt,</hi> I do not contradict it in a true ſcripture ſence, as he is called <hi>the hidden man of the heart,</hi> and <hi>the new man,</hi> but this is a figurative expreſſion, and that in a twofold reſpect: Firſt by a Metaphor, or Allagory, as he is called <hi>a Lamb, a Lion.</hi> 2dly By <hi>a</hi> Sydechdoche of the giving the name of the whole to the meaſure.</q>

But as to <hi>Chriſt</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:000948_0027_0FAD9675D8826230"/>
offering up in us, by which the wrath of God is appeaſed to us, <hi>VV,</hi> P, expleans in the next paragraph, to wit
<q>that <hi>Chriſt</hi> offers himſelf in his children in the nature of a Me<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>diatory Sacrifice; And further ſaith <hi>Chriſt</hi> as a Mediator can atone in the conſciences of his People at what time they fall under any miſcarriage if they unfeignedly repent ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to 1 John 2, 1, 2. &amp;c.</q>
Now it is one thing to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe the wrath of God or man in a <hi>Mediatory</hi> way, and quite another thing to pay the debt that's due in ſuch a ſtrict ſenſe as aforeſaid. So that though W, P, denyed ſuch a ſatisfaction to be made in one book; yet he did neither expreſly nor conſequently own it in the other; therefore no contradiction.</p>
            <p>Now whereas <hi>D,</hi> L. askes
<q>How many thouſand offerings this new Scripture makes of <hi>Chriſt</hi>;</q> as many Saints, ſo many times <hi>Chriſt</hi> offers himſelf up a Sacrifice,
For this I ſhall refer him to his great Friend G. <hi>K,</hi> for ſatisfaction, if any thing beſides abuſing the <hi>Quakers</hi> will ſatisfie him, ſee G, <hi>K</hi>'s <hi>VVay Caſt up</hi> not yet retracted where in p, 157, 158,
he holds
<q>that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is a Mediator in the Saints, and that his Spirit as man, prayeth and maketh interceſſion onto God in the Saints, and cites <hi>Rom,</hi> 8 for it,</q>
Now dare <hi>D.</hi> L. ſay, that the praying of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is not an offering and living Sacrifice to God; and G, <hi>K.</hi> ſaith
<q>
                  <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath done ſo from the beginning, by whom the children of God in all ages have received grace from God,</q>
And in p, 109 G, <hi>K.</hi> tells how
<q>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> Preacht <hi>Chriſt</hi> to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> in the time of their <hi>Heathenism,</hi> cruicified in them, and cites <hi>Gal,</hi> 3 5 6</q>
Now let G. <hi>K.</hi> tell <hi>D,</hi> L. how many crucifyings of <hi>Chriſt</hi> there is, ſo many heathen, ſo many times Chriſt crucified, But I ſay again, prejudice blinds man,</p>
            <p>Well now to make G, <hi>F,</hi> contradict W, P, in this matter, in his <hi>Numb,</hi> 30, he quotes <hi>Great Miſtery</hi> p 63, thus
<q>
                  <hi>Chriſt</hi> gave himſelf, his body for de life of the world, he was the offering for the ſins of the Whole world, and paid the debt, and made ſatisfaction,</q> To which he implicitely op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes W, P. as before, to wit, that <q>a ſatisfaction is
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:000948_0028_0FAD96769C03FF40"/>
totally excluded, and what is forgiven is not paid.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> What <hi>G: F.</hi> ſaid was in anſwer to a Prieſt that ſaid, <q>Every man ſhould not have his ſins pardonned;</q> Which <hi>G.F.</hi> did not deny, but told, how
<q>
                  <hi>Chriſt</hi> gave himſelf an offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the ſins of the World,</q>
and that he had enligthned every man coming into the World, that all through him might believe and (which was enough to ſhew, that though all man had not their ſins pardonned, yet all were put into ſuch a capacity, as that they might have their ſins pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, in as much as) <hi>Chriſt</hi> had offered himſelf for all (which many of the Profeſſors at that time dinyed) and which offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Father was well pleaſed with, and ſatisfied in, and ſo in that ſence he made ſatisfaction, according to <hi>G: F.,</hi> &amp; which <hi>W:P.</hi> in that very book viz <hi>Sandy Foundation</hi> p: 32 did really own viz
<q>That <hi>Chriſt</hi> in life, doctrine and death, fulfilled his Fathers will, and offered up a moſt ſatisfact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory Sacrifice, but not (ſaid he) to pay God, or help him, as being otherwiſe unable to ſave men.</q>

               <q>And is <hi>Chriſt</hi> the ſaviour as an outward bodily exiſtence or perſon without us diſtinct from God, and upon that conſideration to be worſhipped as God, yea or nay. &amp;c.</q>
Now though <hi>G.</hi>W. oppoſes <hi>R.</hi>G<hi>'s.</hi> doctrine of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s being or exiſtence to be outwardly and bodily without us; yet it does not at all follow from thence, that he believes, <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath not a body, that hath a being or exiſtence without us. It is one thing to maintain, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> the Saviour of the World hath a body exiſting whithout us wich G.W. denied not; and another thing to hold or maintain, that that bodily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence it ſelf is <hi>Chriſt</hi> the ſaviour of the world, which (and no leſs) <hi>R.</hi>G<hi>'s.</hi> words ſeem to import. The outward bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily exiſtence of a man cannot be ſaid ſtrictly to be the man, for them when it dies, and the bodily exiſtence is put off, the man would, ceaſe to be. And where it is ſaid of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that he <hi>bare our ſins in his own body on the three</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24; It might as well be ſaid, that the body bare our ſins on his own body on the tree. So that to conclude, I ſay it is a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt falſehood in <hi>D.L,</hi> to ſay that G.W. denies <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exiſtence without us. <hi>Chriſt's</hi> body doth exiſt without us: Yet that bodily outwardly exiſtence is not the <hi>Chriſt,</hi> without his ſoul ſpirit and God head.</p>

<pb n="41" facs="unknown:000948_0044_0FAD96891BCEFCF0"/>
and forgeries he is guilty of in the beforegoing.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now proceed to his <hi>third Chapter,</hi> which I find much like his former, it being grounded upon his not being willing to diſtinguiſh, in aſcriptural ſenſe, between Chriſt as he was from the beginning, and as he came in the body in the fulneſs of time.</p>
            <p>As for what he here ſaith of <hi>John Whitehead,</hi> I refer the Reader to <hi>Tho. Ellwood's</hi> book, Called <hi>Truth Defended</hi> &amp;c. p. 124.</p>
            <p>As for his saying, That "The true <hi>Chrſtians</hi> believe that the true Chriſt hath a body of fleſh and bones &amp;c. To this I anſwer, That how, or after what manner, Chriſt's body is now in heaven I ſhall by no means undertake to determine' it being (I believe) above the capacity of us Mortals ſo to do: But I ſhall tell <hi>D.L.</hi> that he hereby brings his great friend <hi>G.K.</hi> under his cenſure of not being a true <hi>Chriſtian</hi>; for <hi>G.K.</hi> expreſly ſaith of Chriſt's body, that,
<q>It is no more a body of fleſh blood and bone, but a pure Aethereal heavenly body, ſee <hi>Way caſt up</hi> p. 131 not retracted.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Then, for his bantering <hi>W: P.</hi> about his calling Chriſt's body holy: ſaying Can this be other than hypocrisy? "for as is noted at <hi>Numb</hi> 49 50, he holds the body to be earthly and periſhing, I would have the Reader note, it proceeds from <hi>W: P</hi>'s vindicating this ſaying ſo <hi>Jſaac "Peningtons</hi>' That which Chriſt took upon him was but the garment of our nature, which is of an earthly and periſhing nature.</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, That Chriſt's body was a holy body ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>W.</hi>P. Surely <hi>D.L.</hi> will not deny; Yet that it was the garment of our nature is not (me thinks) hard to make out: For it is ſaid <hi>Heb:</hi> 2:14 <hi>For as much then as the children are partakers of fleſh and blood, he alſo him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf likewiſe took part of the ſame</hi> [Mark of the ſame] Now how it is the ſame, if not of the ſame nature, for my part I know not; though Chriſt defiled not his nature
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:000948_0045_0FAD968A7436DA10"/>
by ſin, as we have done ours, is Certain; and therefore a holy body according to <hi>W·P:</hi> Yet in as much as <hi>he took on him</hi> the ſeed of Abraham, he ſurely took on him our nature, unleſs the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> be not of our nature, and that this is the garment which <hi>Is. P</hi> meant, I ſuppoſe <hi>D.L.</hi> will not deny: Nay the ſcripture ſaith expreſly v. 17. <hi>In all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethern</hi> Yet though Chriſt was in all things made like unto his breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, though he took hould of the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and took part of the ſame fleſh and blood with us, which fleſh and blood of ours is ſurely of an arthly and periſhing nature; Yet I utterly deny <hi>D: L</hi>'s inference, that <hi>W: P.</hi> renders Chriſt's body earthly and periſhing: For though he took part of the ſame fleſh and blood with us which fleſh and blood of ours (as I ſaid) is of an earthly and periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nature; yet by the mighty power of God, Chriſt's bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was raiſed from the dead, and ſaw no corruption, and ſo he dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him, but he ever liveth to make interceſſion for us, in his ſoul and ſpirit and glorious and heavenly body.</p>
            <p>I come next to touch upon one paſſage in his <hi>Chap.</hi> 4, where he thinks he hath gotten I know not what advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage againſt <hi>W: P,</hi> He cites <hi>VV: P</hi>'s. <hi>Reaſon againſt Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> p. 165. where <hi>D.</hi>L. ſaies "W.P. juſtifies and declares that he abides by there ill names given by <hi>E. Burrough,</hi> p.
<q>30. &amp;c. to wit, <hi>Thou Ieſuit, thou Sot, thou Sorcerer, thou art a Serpent</hi> &amp;c. And yet (ſaies <hi>D</hi> L) in <hi>Addreſs to Proteſtants</hi> p. 242, he at once unchriſtians himſelf and all his Brethren, for ſo doing, for ſaith he, Men that call names for Religion, may tell us they are Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, if they will, but no body would know them to be ſuch by their fruits, to be ſure they are no <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of Chriſt's making.</q>
Upon which <hi>D. L.</hi> cries out
<q>Good Reader take notice of it; Alas. how has the man forgot him ſelf!</q>
            </p>
            <p>Anſw. Alas! how hath <hi>D: L.</hi> abuſed <hi>VV</hi>: P. and his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der too; For <hi>VV: P.</hi> doth not declare, that he abides by

any <hi>ill names</hi> given by <hi>Edward Burrough</hi>: for the word [ill] is not <hi>VVill. Penn's,</hi> but added by <hi>D: L,</hi> which was <hi>ill</hi> done of him: <hi>VV:</hi> P's. words in the page quoted by <hi>D: L.</hi> being theſe, viz,
<q>But let it ſuffice that <hi>Edward Burrouge</hi> gave no harder names than the ſcriptures by Rule allows. We read of <hi>dogs, bears, wolves, ſwine, ſerpents, vipers, foxes, childeren of the Devil</hi> and ſuch like: And as that nature to whom they were then given, thought them hard, ſo doth <hi>Thomas Hicks</hi> now; But the ſame power that then gave them, hath now uſed them to the ſame end and purpoſe, and I abide by it.</q>
Thus far W: <hi>P</hi>; where obſerve W: P. doth not declare that he abides by any <hi>ill names,</hi> for he uſeth not the word [ill] but <hi>hard names.</hi> 2dly He ſheweth how ſuch like names have been given of old by good men (yea it was by the beſt of men) and ſaith, that <hi>E: B.</hi> doing it to the ſame end and purpoſe, he abides by it, and ſince <hi>D: L.</hi> finds fault with it, we may eaſily gueſs at his reaſon for ſo doing, viz, "twas W: P. that wrote it; For of all the hard names his friend <hi>G: K.</hi> hath given his oppoſers, I cannot, if it were for my life, find that he blames him for one of them, and to ſhew, that not only the ſcriptures and our friends, as above, but that alſo <hi>G: K.</hi> hath given hard names to his oppoſers, I ſhall inſtance (for brevity ſake) but one place out of but one of his books entituled, <hi>The true Chriſt owned,</hi> ſee p. 104.105 thus His <hi>falſe</hi> accuſations; his <hi>beaſt with</hi>

Now where will <hi>D: L</hi>'s ſincerity and impartiality be, if he deal not with <hi>G: K,</hi> as he hath dealt with us in this matter.</p>
            <p>Then as to what he offers to prove that W: P. unchriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ians him ſelf and Brethren at once, becauſe he ſaith (as <hi>D· L.</hi> quotes him) "Men that call names for religion may tell they are <hi>Chriſtians</hi> if they will &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="unknown:000948_0047_0FAD968C8637A108"/>I <hi>anſwer</hi> Here he hath very unfairly left out that part of <hi>VV: P</hi>'s. words which would unqueſtionably have ſhewn ſuch men he there diſcreyd to be no <hi>Chriſtians</hi>; For <hi>VV: P.</hi> being there treating concerning and ſpeaking againſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors, he hath it thus, viz,
<q>Men that call names for religion and fling ſtones and perſecute for faith, may tell us they are <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> if they will, but no body would know them to be ſuch, by their fruits.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now theſe words [and fling ſtones and perſecute for faith] <hi>D: L.</hi> hath concealed from his Reader, and I am ſure, that is a worſe errour than <hi>a little failure in Syntax.</hi> But by inſerting them, my Reader may ſee what ſort of men they were, whom <hi>VV: P.</hi> rejected, as unworthy of that honourable name, viz <hi>Perſecutors for faith, flingers of ſtones as well as callers of names for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n</hi>; And it is well known, that ſuch perſecutors, in formers and others, would not only fling ſtones, but throw dirt too, and alſo call ſuch names as theſe; <hi>You Quaking Curr, You Anabaptiſt Rogue, You Fanatick Dog,</hi> and the like; Now it is clear, that this was the calling names for Religion which W.<hi>P.</hi> meant, and not the calling of names after the manner as the Prophet did, when he called a ſort of men, <hi>Greedy Dogs</hi> &amp;c. nor after the manner as <hi>E: B.</hi> did, when he called ſuch like men, <hi>Sot Sorcerer</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But perhaps <hi>D: L.</hi> will ſay in vindication of <hi>G. K,</hi> that he hath retracted the hard names by him given to his Oppoſers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> That Retractation is but a meer flam like ſome of the reſt: For how far hath he retracted this? Why his words are of ſo large an extent, that's that I know no Profeſſor of Chriſtianity but both might and would ſay as much and yet retract juſt nothing at all, neither would there be any ſervice in it in order to give the leaſt ſatiſfact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion to any concerned who might ſuppoſe themſelves abuſed by hard names publiſhed; for his retractation is only in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral terms (viz
<q>He retracts in general all the hard names that he hath given to ſuch as did nor deſerve them) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out discharding any particular perſon or ſociety from the
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:000948_0048_0FAD968D15B08D20"/>
ſcandal of thoſe hard names.</q>
For inſtance G.K. in his Antichtiſts and Saducees detected hath beſtowed many hard names upon me, as Antichriſt, Saducee or rather Atheiſt, Bold Ignorant, Miller Philoſopher &amp;c. Now ſince there is great probability that he doth not mean me to be one of thoſe upon whoſe account he hath retracted the hard names given; So alſo any of his former Opponents to whom he hath given hard names may ſay I know not that he means me to be one of them who have not (in his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) deſerved them, and now although he ſeems to make an acknowledgment and blame himſelf for beſtowing hard names on divers, yet ſince he names none of thoſe diver what ſatiſfaction to me is his pretended retraction in this more than his charging them on me in his former, and what ſincerity doth he manifeſt in it? For thoſe divers he hints at either did occur to his memory at the writing of his book or thy did not: If they did, and he ſincere i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> his pretenſion he ſhould have named them; but if they did not then it is a ſign he put down what he publiſhed by meer rote and in ſhort, he had as good have ſaid nothing about it ſince every particular perſon concerned in thoſe hard names may ſay they are never the more ſatisfied there by and ſo all of them ſtill lye at <hi>G: K</hi>'s door.</p>
            <p>Upon pruiſal of his 5th. Chapter about propheſies I find not above one that he hath mentioned which hath failed: For thoſe he ſpeaks of who have of late propheſied againſt ſeveral towns and places, I never heard that any prefixed a time, nor otherwaies than upon condition, viz unleſs they did repent, which whether there was not ſo much repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in ſo many of them as might move the Lord to a farther compaſſion on them is ſurely more than this D: L: knows.</p>
            <p>(As for <hi>D: L</hi>'s ridiculing <hi>G: VV.</hi> about his propheſie concerning <hi>G: K.</hi> viz
<q>And thus ſaith the Lord, becauſe thou haſt poured out contempt, ſcorn and reproach upon my ſervants and people, I will aſſuredly pour out and bring great contempt and ſcorn upon thee.</q>

And although he may ſlight what <hi>G.W.</hi> ſaid of <hi>G.K,</hi> becauſe as he ſaith,
<q>it's The fate of all men, leſs or more; yet that's no more than thoſe might have ſaid, whom the Apoſtle compared to <hi>Jannes</hi> and <hi>Jambres,</hi> and of whom he ſaid, <hi>Their folley ſhould be manifeſt to all men</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3:9.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In his 6. Chapter he flings out his ſcoffs and taunts about Infallible diſcerning, and in particular reflects upon our Friends about <hi>Delaware,</hi>
               <q>that they want this ſpirit of diſcerning, and to prove it inſtances the caſe of <hi>Robert Ewer.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Now to this I ſay, Though <hi>G: F.</hi> (as quoted by him) ſpeaks of <hi>a Miniſter of Chriſt's having an infallible diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of a mans ſtate and condition,</hi> Yet he doth not ſay it is without any reſpect had to the fruit he brings forth: And (Chriſt ſaith <hi>Matt.</hi> 7:16 <hi>By their fruits ye ſhall know them.</hi> So that I do believe, to know any mans condition without this token, muſt be an extraordinary and particular gift of God; But by the fruits brought forth, I do believe, according to the words of Chriſt, people may be known, and that infallibly too, for what is ſhort of that, is not properly knowledge, but barely conjecture. And as for <hi>Robert Ewer</hi> There was not ſo near an unity bewixt him and our Friends, a conſiderable time before that buſineſs of that Woman at <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> was talked of, as <hi>D: L.</hi> may poſſibly imagine; But it is not the Churches place to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own any Member, before proof be made, of ſome evil done by him or her, and to prove what I ſay, I hope I have an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor very ſufficient in <hi>D: L</hi>'s eye, for it is no leſs perſon than his great friend <hi>G: K,</hi> who in his late book of <hi>Retracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> &amp;c. (not yet retracted again that I heare of) hath it thus in p. 3;
<q>We find no warrant from ſcripture to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:000948_0050_0FAD968E96AE32B8"/>
an accuſation againſt any, far leſs a poſitive judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, without plain evidence of matter of fact againſt them, by credible witneſſes &amp;c.</q>
Well then; ſo far as matter of fact was thus made appear againſt <hi>Robert Ewer,</hi> he was dealt with according to Goſpel order too. But for D: L's telling us, of
<q>Late ill example of divers of our Preachers, eſpecially of their being unlawfully concerned with women:</q>
He ſhould either have let us know who they were, or elſe have been ſilent about it; for for my part I know them not, but do beleive it is a great ſlander.</p>
            <p>In his p. 64 he banters <hi>W: P.</hi> for ſaying,
<q>We aſcribe not infallibility to men, but to the grace of God, and to men ſo far as they are led by it:</q>
Here upon he makes this reflection, viz
<q>Behould Reader, and note this Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick well! For are not other Profeſſors, yea, all men in the world ſo far infallible, as well as <hi>Quakers.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw</hi>: Yes. But does not D: <hi>L.</hi> know, that there are multitudes of men in the world, who are ſo far from being led by the infallible grace, or ſpirit of God, that they make a mock at, and deride it, and ſurely, ſuch are very far from being infallibly led by it. But what need was there for <hi>D:</hi> L. to ſay [<hi>as well as Quakers</hi>] ſince <hi>W: P.</hi> according to <hi>D: L</hi>'s own citation, doth not reſtrict infallibility only to the <hi>Quakers,</hi> but to men indefinitely, for ſaith he [<hi>and to men ſo far as they are led by it</hi>].</p>
            <p>As for his telling, how friends "admit none to travel upon Truth's acount without certificates, I think it is very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable; but paſting by his mocking, viz, his ſaying, it is "to help our ſpirit of diſcerning, I take notice of what he ſaith of <hi>G</hi>: W. quoting him out of <hi>Quakers plainneſs,</hi> thus
<q>We have a Record in Peoples conſcience; as if there fore there was no need of a Certificate, which he <hi>Iſhmael like, calls a Pocket Record.</hi>

            <p>

<pb n="48" facs="unknown:000948_0051_0FAD969069399AA8"/>
our Friends do not think they have attained to a greater degree of diſcerning ſpirits, than the primitive Chriſtians had, and the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> intimates, their <hi>approving by their letters,</hi> ſuch as went to <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> about the Churches ſervice, ſee 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.3.

            <p>But to wave any farther digreſſion, I come again to the point, and do ſay, That as it is clear, that what <hi>W.P.</hi> wrote there, was intended againſt thoſe who uſed ſuch like worldly weapons, in the carrying on of Religious mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: So it is alſo clear, that he never thereby meant to inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate, as if Chriſt upon his coming into the world, or offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring up himſelf, had put an end, or commanded an end to be put to all outward Government in matters Civil: For in the ſame page, <hi>W.P.</hi> intimates;
<q>That Chriſt came to reform the lives of men, and to make them better ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to obey <hi>Ceſar</hi> &amp;c,</q>
So that if ſubjects be owned, Princes, &amp;c. muſt be owned likewiſe; And ſeeing <hi>W P</hi> owned, that Chriſt came to make men better ſubjects to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey <hi>Ceſar,</hi> by conſequence he muſt needs have owned, that Chriſt did allow of a <hi>Ceſar</hi> to command ſuch obedien<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And I my ſelf was once a <hi>Sheriff,</hi> but neither before, then, nor ſince, did I ever underſtand, that ſuch a thing as a weapon, peculiarly belonged to, or was eſſentially need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in, the due execution of that Office. Then as for <hi>Stocks, Priſon and Gallows,</hi> he may call them weapons if he pleaſe, but for my part I do not think them ſo; much leſs that they come under the Apoſtle's denomination of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, when he ſaies 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10:4, <hi>The weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty trough God to the pulling down of ſtrong holds</hi> &amp;c. For the weapons which the Apoſtle here oppoſes to carnal, being ſuch wherewith they pulled down ſtrong holds, ſeems to me to allude to ſuch outward wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, with which the warriours of old did fight, and pull down outward ſtrong holds; Conſequently, did not allude to the ſtrong holds themſelves, which (in a ſenſe) Stocks and Priſons are. So then, where the Apoſtle ſpeaks of the

            <p>In p. 85. mentioning <hi>Peter Boſs's</hi> tryal, he has a fling at <hi>David Lloyd</hi>; on this wiſe
<q>In the tryal of which (ſaith he) <hi>D. Lloyd,</hi> being Attorney, pleaded for <hi>S. J.</hi> and read a caſe out of an old Law book, to this effect, <hi>That though a Biſhop was ſeen to be drunk, yet he was not to be reproved.</hi>
               </q>
In anſwer thereto, <hi>David Lloyd</hi> denies, that he brought
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:000948_0067_0FAD96F189A3E158"/>
any ſuch inſtance, or that he ſo much as knows of any ſuch caſe in any Law-book whatſoever.</p>
            <p>In p. 86. he gives us a pretended ſpeech of <hi>Arthur Cook's</hi> on this wiſe, viz;
<q>Well, ſeeing Friends that you are not like to agree, you are abſolved <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>om your Teſt (or Oath) and are discharged; and we wil have another Jury that ſhall agree, and find the bill.</q>
To this, <hi>Arthur Cook</hi> and others then concerned, whom I have discourſed with, ſay, that No ſuch expreſſion dropt from him, ſo far as they can recollect; But that he did deliver his opinion; <hi>That ſeeing the Jury could not agree, another inqueſt ſhould be awarded, as the law in that caſe directs.</hi> So that I have ſufficient reaſon to conclude, that this great noiſe, is no other than a falſe, as well as baſe inſinuation, againſt both the <hi>Court</hi> and <hi>Arthur Cook,</hi> in order to repreſent them all, to be ſuch manner of perſons, as were reſolved to have the bill found in that caſe, right or wrong.</p>

<q>That no <hi>Quaker</hi> or reputed <hi>Quaker</hi> ſhall ſerve on any Juries, or bear any Office or Place of profit in the Government; he makes this reflection,</q>
               <q>They may ſee what their ill man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in <hi>Pennſilvania</hi> has brought on them &amp;c.</q>
To which I anſwer, This I take to be as idle an inſinuation, as any one in his whole book; As if the clauſe, in that Law made in <hi>England</hi> were added, becauſe of <hi>G. K. Peter Boſs</hi> &amp;c. their being proſecuted here, a very ſilly groundleſs ſtory.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> This is not ſo, for Governour <hi>Fletcher's</hi> power here, expired before any Aſſembly ſate, or was ſo much a cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen in the year 1695. Neither did hein 1694 preſs the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, to raiſe a fund, towards the ſecuring the Province from the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Indians:</hi> So that allowing his one years miſtake, as to time; yet his charge in the main is utterly falſe. Neither was the reaſon why no mony was reiſed then, becauſe we pladed (as he falſly incinuates) it was againſt our tender conſciences; for at that time the Aſſembly was ſatisfied, they had a very reaſonable and ſufficient plea, for their not complying with his deſires, without alledging matter of Conſcience in the Caſe.</p>

               </gap>d <hi>Acts.</hi> 4.24. to 31. where we find, that the Church then aſſembled together, <hi>lift up theie voices with one accord in prayer</hi> to God; in which prayer, there is not one word of confeſſion of, or begging pardon for ſin: And if <hi>D:</hi> L: be ſo blind, as that he can perceive no difference or diſtinction to be made, between Chriſt by his <hi>ſpirit helping our infirmities,</hi> in our prayers, which we ſay he doth, and without which we cannot pray <hi>as we ought</hi> ſee <hi>Rom:</hi> 8:26: and ſaying, that 'tis Chriſt in us that prays, which we ſay not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we cannot help it: Then what, or how due his attendance hath been, for twenty years, I know not, but ſure I am, I have heard earneſt cryes and fervent ſupplications put up to God in our publick meetings, for pardon and remiſſion of ſins, many times in leſs than ten years.</p>
            <p>His ſecond reaſon is this

                  </gap>praying for pardon of ſins,</hi> and <hi>not praying to Chriſt at all</hi>; which is partly anſwered already, but in order to the more full clearing the latter objection, I ſhall take notice of one paſſage more in the ſame page. After he hath oppoſed the Apoſtles, Saints and Martyrs to us, he concludes that paragraph thus, viz,

<q>He hath not only himſelf done ſo, but alſo hath heard others expreſly naming the wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There may be the ſame reaſon ſhewed by <hi>G. W,</hi> why he took no notice of many particular paſs ages in ſome certain books, which he hath anſwered, as <hi>G.

<q>Becauſe <hi>Cotton Mather</hi> had not diſtinctly anſwered my former book againſt him: As alſo that the ſaid <hi>Mather's</hi> book was filled with manifeſt falshoods, perverſions and abuſes, ſufficiently replyed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, partly by others, and partly by me (ſath he).</q>

<q>he had discovered and laid open the Myſtery of iniquity more clearly than he had ſeen it done by any other: for which he prayed God of his bounty to reward him &amp;c:</q>

               <q>

As if God had intended him for ſome great work to be performed with his tongue; Wereas the great work that has appeared (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be the work of God or the Devil, let the Reader judge) has been the writing of a few ſcandalous and reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full books, all which might have been done, if his ſpeech had been ſo totally taken from him, as that he could not have ſpoken one word.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> He falſly as well as without proof aſſerts theſe falſhoods,

All which ſuggeſtions I deny as falſe, and had he but a name, I ſhould require him to prove them.</p>
            <p n="4">4thly As groundleſs as well as proofleſs is his inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<q>That it ſeems People may ſing the <hi>Quakers</hi> writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, but not <hi>David's,</hi> by their allowance.</q>

I ſhall take no farther notice of, than to tell him; If he had named them, and proved his charge, perhaps he might have received a farther anſwer to it.</p>
            <p n="6">6thly His ſtory about <hi>Walter Clark, Walter Clark</hi> denies, as ſtated by him; ſo that I cannot but eſteem him falſe and abuſive in this alſo. To which I may add, as all of a piece, his envious reflection ſurmiſed after this manner, viz,
