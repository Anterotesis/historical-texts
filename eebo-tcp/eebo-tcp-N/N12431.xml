            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And with the divine leave and aſſiſtance, ſhall diſcourſe to you on thoſe words of holy writ, which you may find in the XLV Chapter of EZEKIEL, part of the 8th, together with the 9th verſe.</p>
            <q>
               <p>—<hi>And my princes ſhall no more oppreſs my people. And the reſt of the land ſhall they give to the houſe of Iſrael, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their tribes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord God, let it ſuffice you O princes of Iſrael: remove violence and ſpoil, and execute judgment and juſtice; take away your exactions from my people, ſaith the Lord God.</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>'TIS happy, that we have in the holy ſcriptures divine directions to regulate the conduct of <hi>all ranks:</hi> nothing leſs than the <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of God</hi> can do this, to any purpoſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:015703_0006_0F99E06A61A4B390"/>
But, when God ſpeaks, before whom <hi>prince</hi> and <hi>peaſant</hi> ſtand upon a parr, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, all, from the loweſt to the higheſt, muſt liſten with a ſacred veneration!</p>
            <p>Indeed, as God does not now direct his voice <hi>immediately to us,</hi> we muſt not coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit it, and ſay—<hi>the Lord ſaith</hi>—when the Lord hath not ſpoken. But yet, in ſimilar circumſtances, we may, by analogy, take the ancient voice of God, as directed to us. This is the uſe we are to make of a great part of the old teſtament.</p>
            <p>Let us keep this in mind and, I truſt, we ſhall find that we are not unconcerned in the words now read to you.</p>
            <p>They were ſpoken at a time when there was a general corruption of manners; <hi>princes</hi> and <hi>people</hi> conſpiring to provoke God to anger, and to bring down his judgments.</p>
            <p>And, if we look over the prophets, we ſhall find that the <hi>rulers</hi> were peculiarly guilty: the <hi>princes</hi> were become <hi>mighty oppreſſors:</hi> and, when foreign enemies attacked them, <hi>unnaturally</hi> joined, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:015703_0007_0F99E06B39418820"/>
their ruin! This was a crime of the higheſt nature! For, nothing can be more aggravated than for the <hi>ſhepherds</hi> to <hi>miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lead</hi> and <hi>butcher</hi> the flock they were ſet to <hi>defend</hi> and <hi>feed!</hi> And the <hi>guardians</hi> of the public <hi>intereſts,</hi> to turn <hi>traitors</hi> and <hi>aſſaſſins</hi> to them that raiſed them to their high pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.!</p>
            <p>To the <hi>princes</hi> and <hi>rulers,</hi> therefore, who were too big to hear any other, the <hi>God of Heaven</hi> ſpeaks in my <hi>text,</hi> and ſome preceeding and following verſes.</p>
            <p>Ordering, that the rulers ſhould have a reaſonable portion laid out round their cities, by the ſide of the portion of the <hi>prieſts,</hi> which was laid out <hi>by meaſure.</hi> And then that the reſt of the land, as in the text, ſhould be divided among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as their inheritance.</p>
            <p>And then, ſays God—<hi>my princes ſhall no more oppreſs.</hi> That is—Thus <hi>prince</hi> and <hi>people</hi> ſhall know their own, and enjoy their own: And the princes ſhall make no more encroachments upon the <hi>people'</hi>s <hi>rights</hi> or <hi>poſſeſſions;</hi> which are as ſacred as theirs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:015703_0008_0F99E06C17D1A030"/>
               <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, Let it ſuffice you O princes of Iſrael: remove violence and ſpoil, and execute judgment and juſtice, take away your exactions from my people, ſaith the Lord God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As if he had ſaid—Who is he that will not hear, when the Lord of heaven ſpeaks? It concerns all the <hi>princes</hi> and <hi>ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers</hi> of the world to liſten, for <hi>God, God,</hi> I ſay, ſpeaks! It is <hi>enough</hi> O <hi>princes</hi> and <hi>ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers</hi> and more than enough, that ye have done already, in <hi>oppreſſing</hi> and <hi>abuſing</hi> thoſe whom you were bound by every tie to <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect</hi> and <hi>make happy! Ceaſe</hi> your <hi>violence</hi> then, make no more <hi>ſpoil</hi> upon my people! But let <hi>judgment</hi> and <hi>juſtice</hi> be impartially executed, that all may have the benefit of it: and put an end to your extravagant <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions:</hi> and henceforth, let taxes and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute be requir'd only in proportion to the neceſſity of the public affairs, and not to <hi>ſupport your own luxury</hi> or <hi>defend your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous claims!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, from this, <hi>rulers</hi> may learn ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing what is the <hi>will of God</hi> concerning them; and the <hi>people</hi> ſomewhat of their <hi>duty</hi> to them. And all may be led to
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:015703_0009_0F99E06CCB7C00A0"/>
               <hi>mourn</hi> over the <hi>mighty oppreſſions</hi> of the earth, and to pray and hope for deliverance in God's time.</p>
            <p>Let me therefore beg the attention of this honourable audience, while, in the fear of God, and with a due reſpect to my nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous ſuperiours, I diſcourſe in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing manner.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt. Conſider, very briefly the duty of princes and rulers to the people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2dly. <hi>The duty of people to their rulers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3dly. <hi>Take a brief view of the oppreſſions of the rulers of the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4thly. <hi>Enquire, how it comes to paſs that ſuch multitudes of mankind ſuffer themſelves to be thus grievouſly oppreſs'd, by a few of their fellow men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5thly. <hi>Conſider, how contrary this is to the will of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6thly. <hi>Juſt hint to the people at ſome things, which ſeem to me moſt likely to guard againſt tyranny in their rulers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:015703_0010_0F99E06D743F4A38"/>
               <hi>And finally, conſider, a moment, the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of mankind when oppreſſors ſhall ceaſe, and they who rule over men ſhall be juſt, ruling in the fear of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Then, <hi>I ſhall very briefly conſider the duty of princes and rulers to the people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now as to old-faſhion'd rulers hack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney'd to the ways of the world, the voice from heaven cries to them to <hi>oppreſs no more.</hi> It cries moſt ſolemnly in my text. But as ſuch rulers hear neither <hi>God</hi> nor <hi>man,</hi> we have no immediate buſineſs with them! And God grant we never may.</p>
            <p>'Tis other kind of magiſtrates with whom we have to do; <hi>choſen by the people</hi> (as all lawful magiſtrates are) to defend them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe ravening wolves, which have been devouring them.</p>
            <p>And, their duty is to exert themſelves in <hi>watching</hi> over and <hi>defending</hi> them, with unwearied diligence; leſt they give the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple room to ſay, that <hi>power</hi> is to be truſted with no body, and ſo are put out of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of all government, and run into anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy and confuſion.</p>
            <p>

In the firſt place, (where the conſtitution is diſſolv'd) their duty is (with the aſſent of the people) to frame the moſt <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table conſtitution;</hi> calculated, in the beſt manner which human wiſdom can deviſe, to anſwer the great and only deſign of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, <hi>the ſecurity</hi> of the <hi>lives, liberty</hi> and <hi>property</hi> of the people.</p>
            <p>For, though, where the <hi>magiſtrates</hi> and <hi>people</hi> are generally <hi>virtuous,</hi> the people may be tolerably happy under almoſt any conſtitution, or indeed without any. Yet, as the world is, a <hi>good conſtitution</hi> is by no means to be diſregarded; but is the firſt foundation to be laid for the happineſs of the people; and of great importance.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The making and eſtabliſhing of <hi>good laws,</hi> is another important duty of theirs.</p>
            <p>And it is a rare happineſs indeed when they have it in their power to begin all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new, and <hi>reviſe</hi> and <hi>correct</hi> the whole <hi>code,</hi> and fix every thing on the ſtable baſis of perfect equity.</p>
            <p>And, here—Let no man make a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

3. <hi>Wiſe</hi> and <hi>virtuous</hi> men muſt in the next place be appointed to every impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant office, that the laws may be faithfully and impartially <hi>executed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Without this, all the laws in the world will anſwer no good end: but <hi>government</hi> will be deſpis'd, and <hi>vice</hi> and <hi>diſorder</hi> reign and rage.

            <p>II. <hi>As briefly, To conſider the duty of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to their rulers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It ſeem'd meet to mention the <hi>duty of rulers <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> becauſe the <hi>duty</hi> of the <hi>people</hi> reſults from their honeſt diſcharge of it. And, if the rulers groſsly neglect their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſo as to ſail of anſwering the end of their inſtitution, eſpecially if they play the <hi>tyrant</hi> and <hi>deſtroy</hi> what they were appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to preſerve, common ſenſe teaches, and we all agree, that they forfeit all <hi>obedience</hi> and <hi>reſpect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:015703_0013_0F99E06FB6058F30"/>
The renown'd and excellent emperor <hi>Trajan</hi> order'd that the very <hi>prayers</hi> for him, ſhould be <hi>conditional—if he obſerves the laws—if he govern as he ought—if he make the people happy.</hi> The light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture taught him this.</p>
            <p>And yet, we ought to conſider magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates as <hi>men,</hi> and make allowance for <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man frailties</hi> and <hi>miſtakes.</hi> And therefore, if they <hi>mean honeſtly</hi> and in any tolerable meaſure anſwer the end of their advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, eſpecially if they diſcharge their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>wiſely</hi> and <hi>faithfully,</hi> the people's duty to them cannot be diſpenſed with, any more than other duties, on pain of eternal <hi>damnation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In ſuch caſes they are bound not only by fear of wrath, but for <hi>conſcience ſake.</hi> For ſuch an <hi>ordinance of man</hi> is <hi>God'</hi>s <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance</hi> alſo.</p>
            <p>But, depend upon it, <hi>no government is God's ordinance,</hi> but that which is for <hi>the good of mankind:</hi> it would be the groſſeſt reflection on the <hi>divine goodneſs</hi> to ſuppoſe it! Nay, I think, but little ſhort of <hi>blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy!</hi>
            </p>

               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:015703_0014_0F99E070D5ED8298"/>
But, to <hi>good rulers</hi> the people owe—</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Honor</hi> and <hi>reſpect.</hi> 'Tis abſurd to ſuppoſe the people ſhould chooſe thoſe to <hi>lead</hi> and <hi>defend</hi> them, who are not thought worthy of theſe by the electors! How ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd then to deny it!</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Obedience.</hi> For the people to chooſe men to be <hi>rulers</hi> and call them ſo; and not readily obey them, when acting in charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, is to make themſelves contemptible.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Tribute,</hi> is due, in order to their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable ſupport, and to carry on the great affairs of government.</p>
            <p>As <hi>no man goeth a warfare at his own charges,</hi> ſo 'tis abſurd to expect <hi>magiſtrates</hi> to devote themſelves to the public, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an adequate reward for their important ſervice.</p>
            <p>And, at ſome ſeaſons, when all lies at ſtake, it is impoſſible but <hi>taxes</hi> and <hi>tribute</hi> muſt run high. And, when <hi>neceſſary,</hi> they ſhould be readily paid, unleſs they out-run all the benefit, which can hardly be, where <hi>property, liberty</hi> and <hi>life,</hi> are all at ſtake to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether! To talk of <hi>expence</hi> in ſuch a caſe,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:015703_0015_0F99E071306C0AB8"/>
is to <hi>dream.</hi> For 'till it be determined whether we have any thing or not, what is <hi>expence to us?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Another duty of the people is to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend their magiſtrates,</hi> in time of danger, againſt all attempts of bloody men.</p>
            <p>In times of danger, like the preſent, whether we conſider it or not, <hi>they,</hi> and all <hi>others,</hi> who go <hi>foremoſt,</hi> are peculiar marks of the enemies vengeance: and therefore every man in whoſe cauſe they act, is bound in <hi>honor</hi> and <hi>conſcience</hi> to <hi>ſtand by and defend</hi> them.</p>
            <p>And, how ſhocking a crime, how diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graceful to humanity, would it be to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert them, (the moſt <hi>honorable Preſident</hi> of our <hi>Congreſs,</hi> and our incomparable Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, for example) and leave them to fall a ſacrifice to the fury of the enemy! Should we be capable of ſuch meanneſs, we ſhould never deſerve to have another friend? But I proceed</p>
            <p>III. <hi>To take a brief view of the oppreſſions of the rulers of the world.</hi>

            <p>

To pretend to give a particular hiſtory of this, would be almoſt the ſame thing as to give the <hi>hiſtory of the world,</hi> from <hi>Cain</hi> to <hi>Nimrod,</hi> and from him to <hi>Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar,</hi> and from him to <hi>Alexander,</hi> and from him to <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> and from <hi>Julius</hi> to <hi>George!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor could any, who have the common feelings of humanity, bear the tragical ſtory, without growing almoſt ſtiff with horror! For, it is almoſt one continued ſcene of <hi>cruelty, blood</hi> and <hi>ſlaughter!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thoſe who have never felt the weight of theſe oppreſſions, nor enter'd much into the hiſtory of them, can form no idea of them!</p>
            <p>Men are, to their ſhame, in general, too much tyrants to one another. I wiſh the preſent day were not, to the grief of all good men, too much a witneſs of this, while we are all ſuffering together unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel'd oppreſſions from the common Enemy!</p>
            <p>But, vile as theſe things are, they are all as nothing compared with what has been done by the <hi>great oppreſſors</hi> of the

earth, who were entruſted with power by the people to defend them from the <hi>little oppreſſors.</hi> The <hi>ſword</hi> of <hi>juſtice</hi> was put into their hands, but behold they ſoon turned it into a <hi>ſword</hi> of <hi>oppreſſion;</hi> and made their <hi>little ſinger</hi> thicker than all <hi>their</hi> loins of whom the people were afraid.</p>
            <p>And ſo, in a multitude of inſtances, the <hi>remedy</hi> has prov'd unſpeakably worſe than the <hi>diſeaſe!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The buſineſs of all in power is to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend</hi> the <hi>lives, liberties</hi> and <hi>property</hi> of the <hi>people:</hi> And they have no other buſineſs: And yet every one of theſe have the great tyrants of the world invaded! they have not only <hi>robb'd</hi> and <hi>ſpoil'd,</hi> them of their <hi>property</hi> by their <hi>violent exactions</hi> and by engaging them in <hi>needleſs wars,</hi> to gratify their own <hi>luſt, ambition</hi> and <hi>avarice!</hi> but at length roſe to ſuch a pitch of arrogance, as to claim the <hi>people</hi> and all they had as their <hi>property,</hi> to be diſpos'd of at their pleaſure, as if all the <hi>people</hi> were made for them and not they for the people!</p>
            <p>One would think this was <hi>tyranny</hi> and <hi>ſlaverly compleat!</hi>—And yet they
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:015703_0018_0F99E0738D9E63A0"/>
have gone further ſtill.—Being intoxicated with power, they have ſometimes butcher'd the poor people like <hi>roaring lions</hi> and <hi>raging bears,</hi> and far beyond! They have done what theſe never did! They have <hi>burnt Towns</hi> and <hi>Cities,</hi> and <hi>depopulated Countries;</hi> which they were bound to protect: And <hi>tortur'd</hi> thoſe from whom they receiv'd their <hi>power</hi> and <hi>ſupport;</hi> and torn out <hi>their entrails</hi> with helliſh cruelty, from whom came their <hi>crowns</hi> and <hi>diadems,</hi> their <hi>purple raiment</hi> and their <hi>ſuptuous fare!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Were it not a day in which <hi>all the man</hi> muſt be ſummon'd up in every ſoul—who could refrain from tears?</p>
            <p>It would be eaſy, if the time would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, to exemplify all theſe ſeveral kinds of oppreſſion, a thouſand times over, in the civil hiſtory of the world. But I ſhall confine myſelf to a few hints from the <hi>ſacred Hiſtory,</hi> that moſt <hi>ſure word.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>That ſo many <hi>millions of men</hi> all over the world ſhould be brought into <hi>bondage</hi> to <hi>one</hi> or to a <hi>few;</hi> and kept under it after they have endur'd every <hi>inſult, abuſe</hi> and <hi>torment,</hi> which man can inflict; if the fact was not <hi>notorious,</hi> would ſeem abſolutely incredible!</p>
            <p>No man denies but that <hi>originally</hi> all were equally <hi>free.</hi> Men did not <hi>purchaſe</hi> their <hi>freedom,</hi> nor was it the <hi>grant</hi> of <hi>kings,</hi> nor from <hi>charter, covenant,</hi> or <hi>compact,</hi> nor in any proper ſenſe from <hi>man:</hi> But from <hi>God.</hi> They were <hi>born free.</hi>

               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:015703_0022_0F99E076770868D0"/>
But, behold, <hi>ſin reign'd</hi> and <hi>diſturb'd</hi> the <hi>peace of men:</hi> And then <hi>tyrants</hi> preſently began to <hi>reign</hi> alſo: Like our <hi>cloathing</hi> they are the mark of loſt inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence. The people truſting <hi>too much pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> in the hands of ſome to <hi>defend</hi> them, they preſently uſed it to <hi>oppreſs</hi> them.</p>
            <p>So long as men were <hi>virtuous,</hi> they ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had no rulers, or choſe the <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>good.</hi> But either theſe degenerated, being intoxicated with too much power; or the people were governed by their luſts in chooſing, and choſe <hi>bad men:</hi> And then what wonder that theſe prov'd <hi>tyrants</hi> and govern'd by their luſts.</p>
            <p>To trace this a little more particularly.</p>
            <p>Groſs <hi>ignorance</hi> and <hi>ſloth</hi> in the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple muſt lay the foundation. <hi>Ignorance</hi> is as much the <hi>mother of ſlavery</hi> as of <hi>popiſh devotion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the body of the people become ſo <hi>ignorant</hi> as not to know the <hi>bounds</hi> of the <hi>magiſtrates lawful authority</hi> or their own <hi>juſt rights,</hi> how eaſily may the <hi>prerogative</hi> be <hi>ſtretch'd,</hi> and the people's rights inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:015703_0023_0F99E07735D061E8"/>
Or, if, when the magiſtrates are choſen, they are too <hi>ſluggiſh</hi> to attend the choice, or keep no careful <hi>watch</hi> over thoſe that are in power, or, thro' inexcuſeable <hi>indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,</hi> will not exert themſelves till 'tis too late; who can wonder at this evil's creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in?</p>
            <p>Again. All <hi>intemperance</hi> and <hi>debauch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery</hi> lead to this. For they ſoon eat out the <hi>heart,</hi> the <hi>ſtrength,</hi> the <hi>courage</hi> of a people; and ſo prepare them to fall a prey to thoſe who will <hi>invade</hi> their rights.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Covetouſneſs</hi> alſo, it is certain, has had, and ſtill has, a <hi>great hand</hi> in this <hi>great evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some chooſe a <hi>tyrant</hi> becauſe they want <hi>poſts</hi> under him, in which they may ſhare with him in <hi>eaſe</hi> and <hi>luxury.</hi> Or they are directly <hi>brib'd</hi> to put thoſe into authority who <hi>buy</hi> them, becauſe they deſign to ſell them again. And when the people are ſo <hi>covetous</hi> and <hi>venal</hi> as to <hi>ſell themſelves</hi> firſt, how can they wonder if they are put to ſale again by thoſe who bought them? When therefore this kind of <hi>bribery</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes common, if we had not ſo many
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:015703_0024_0F99E077EBFDCF70"/>
examples in the hiſtory of the world to prove it, our reaſon would teach us that ſlavery and ruin muſt be at the door.</p>
            <p>Further, this great evil is partly owing to the <hi>craft</hi> and <hi>ſubtilty</hi> uſed by thoſe <hi>in power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Power,</hi> eſpecially over-grown power, whets the ambition and ſets all the witts to work to enlarge it. And therefore encroachments on the people's liberties are not generally made all at once, but ſo <hi>gradually</hi> as hardly to be perceived by the leſs watchful; and all plaiſtered over, it may be, with ſuch plauſible pretences, that before they are aware of the <hi>ſnare,</hi> they are taken and cannot diſintangle themſelves.</p>
            <p>Theſe, theſe, no doubt are the <hi>roots</hi> of this great evil; not to mention <hi>conqueſts</hi> made by force upon an inoffenſive peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which, I am clear gives no <hi>right:</hi> but yet againſt which there is at preſent no remedy but force.</p>
            <p>But, it may be aſked—Why don't the multitude <hi>riſe</hi> and <hi>ſhake</hi> off the yoke, when they find it intolerable? The anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer is eaſy—</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:015703_0025_0F99E07C85B41158"/>
               <hi>Tyrants</hi> always ſupport themſelves with <hi>ſtanding armies!</hi> And if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible the <hi>people</hi> are <hi>diſarmed,</hi> or beſure the <hi>militia</hi> neglected and kept low, and the chief ruler at the head of all the mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary force. And, when it is come to this, it is extremely difficult for them to <hi>unite</hi> in ſufficient bodies to effect their deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. But, if they would <hi>unite,</hi> nothing, nothing, could ſtand before them. So that in a word <hi>the want of union, the want of union,</hi> is the ruin of the world. For want of this thoſe noble ſpirits who would riſque all to be free, are forced to ſit down in chains!</p>
            <p>When therefore we ſee in a manner, the whole world, except theſe <hi>American States,</hi> groaning under the moſt abject <hi>ſlavery,</hi> with ſo few <hi>ſucceſsful attempts</hi> to deliver themſelves, how <hi>ſtupid</hi> muſt we be, if we do not exert ourſelves to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to ſave ourſelves from falling into this <hi>remedileſs</hi> eſtate, this bottomleſs gulf of miſery.</p>
            <p>But I muſt not enlarge. But proceed,</p>
            <p>V. <hi>To conſider, how contrary this is to the will of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="unknown:015703_0026_0F99E07DC1DBE808"/>
Now a little attention to the <hi>nature of God,</hi> and to his <hi>revealed will</hi> may fully ſatisfy us that it is the abominable thing which his ſoul hateth.</p>
            <p>It may ſuffice to conſider his <hi>holineſs</hi> and <hi>goodneſs.</hi> Can his <hi>holineſs</hi> poſſibly approve of <hi>oppreſſion</hi> and <hi>murders,</hi> which are the groſſeſt ſins of men? Can it ſee <hi>millions</hi> and <hi>millions butchered</hi> by theſe <hi>bloody</hi> men without indignation? Impoſſible!</p>
            <p>And as to his <hi>goodneſs,</hi> who will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to reconcile the approbation of human <hi>miſery</hi> and <hi>butchery</hi> with this divine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection? <hi>There is none good, but one;</hi> ſays Chriſt, and <hi>that is God:</hi> And yet no man of common benevolence can think of this without abhorrence! How then muſt our <hi>heavenly Father</hi> abhor it! And, <hi>revelation</hi> abundantly confirms it.</p>
            <p>When God gave a <hi>model of government</hi> to his <hi>favourite people,</hi> he contrived it, with exquiſite art, to guard againſt <hi>tyranny</hi> and <hi>oppreſſion;</hi> and laid the moſt perfect foundation, which was ever laid, for <hi>real</hi> and <hi>perpetual freedom.</hi> This, I think, muſt be <hi>clear</hi> to every judicious eye who ſhall take a thoro' view of it, which I have not now time for.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:015703_0027_0F99E07EB2003778"/>
But one thing I would juſt mention, which, ſo far as I know, is peculiar to that divine model of government—And that is—That by forbidding <hi>uſury</hi> and even <hi>intereſt upon money lent to the poor,</hi> and appointing the <hi>year of Jubilee,</hi> when both <hi>ſervants</hi> and <hi>lands</hi> were to be <hi>releaſed, ſlavery</hi> was directly prevented, and remote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all <hi>tyranny</hi> and <hi>oppreſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, had not it been for the Jews mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in inſiſting to have their <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py government</hi> changed into a <hi>monarchy,</hi> I am perſuaded, the world would have ſeen more of the excellency of that divine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution by the <hi>fruits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I need only add, that no <hi>ſin</hi> is ſpoken of with more deteſtation, from one end of the bible to the other, than <hi>oppreſſion,</hi> or more awfully <hi>threatned.</hi> And <hi>wicked rulers</hi> are compared to <hi>fierce</hi> and <hi>ravenous beaſts,</hi> or to bulls of <hi>Baſhan, roaring lions</hi> and <hi>raging bears,</hi> &amp;c. (See Amos iv. I. and Prov. xxviii. 15, 16.) So that I need not enlarge, but proceed,</p>
            <p>VI. <hi>Juſt to hint to the people at ſome things which ſeem to me moſt likely to guard againſt tyranny in their rulers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:015703_0028_0F99E07F85027C68"/>
Now if I may, without preſumption, ſhew my opinion, in a matter ſo much above me. I would ſay—</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let the people by all means en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage <hi>ſchools</hi> and <hi>colleges,</hi> and all the means of <hi>learning</hi> and <hi>knowledge,</hi> if they would guard againſt <hi>ſlavery.</hi> For a <hi>wiſe,</hi> a <hi>knowing</hi> and a <hi>learned</hi> people, are the leaſt likely of any in the world to be enſlaved.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let them do all in their power to <hi>ſuppreſs vice</hi> and <hi>promote religion</hi> and <hi>vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</hi> For, beſides their <hi>natural</hi> efficacy, I am perſuaded no people were ever yet given up by God to <hi>ſlavery,</hi> till they had firſt given themſelves up to <hi>wickedneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Let only men of <hi>integrity</hi> be entruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by you with any <hi>power.</hi> I think pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is much ſafer in their hands than in men of <hi>greater abilities,</hi> but who are want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this aſſential point.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Let not <hi>too much power</hi> be truſted in the hands of any. It may hurt them, and then they may hurt the public. Or if it ſeem <hi>neceſſary</hi> in ſome critical time (like the preſent) to lodge great power in ſome <hi>hand</hi> or hands, let it be for a <hi>limited time,</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="unknown:015703_0029_0F99E08027F34B80"/>
and the power renewed <hi>annually,</hi> if there is occaſion.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Let elections of the <hi>Legiſlators</hi> be <hi>frequent;</hi> and let <hi>bribery</hi> and <hi>corruption</hi> be guarded againſt to the utmoſt. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, thoſe who are guilty of theſe ſhould be forever rendered incapable of any place of <hi>power</hi> or <hi>truſt;</hi> and this by a funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental law of the conſtitution.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Let the <hi>militia</hi> be kept under the beſt regulation, and be made <hi>reſpectable.</hi> This will be a great ſecurity a great many ways.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Let <hi>ſtanding armies</hi> be only for <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity</hi> and for a <hi>limited time.</hi> For, when corrupted, they have been the ruin of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a country's <hi>liberty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. Let theſe <hi>armies</hi> never be put under the abſolute power of any magiſtrate in time of peace, ſo as to <hi>act</hi> in any <hi>cauſe,</hi> till that <hi>cauſe</hi> is approved by the <hi>ſenate</hi> and <hi>people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. Let <hi>monopolies,</hi> and all <hi>kinds</hi> and degrees of <hi>oppreſſion</hi> be carefully guarded againſt. They are dangerous to the <hi>peace</hi>
               <pb n="31" facs="unknown:015703_0030_0F99E080F00A37C0"/>
of a <hi>people,</hi> and they are dangerous to their <hi>liberties!</hi> I am miſtaken if the preſent time does not prove it.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Let a <hi>careful watch</hi> be kept, and if any is found <hi>groſsly</hi> and <hi>notoriouſly</hi> exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>limits</hi> of his power, methinks, it ſhould be a ſtanding invariable rule never to truſt him with any power more.</p>
            <p>Finally, Let the <hi>powers</hi> and <hi>preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives</hi> of the <hi>rulers</hi> and the <hi>rights</hi> and <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges</hi> of the people, be determined with as much preciſion as poſſible, that all may know their <hi>limits.</hi> And where there is any diſpute, <hi>let nothing be done,</hi> till it is ſettled by the people, who are the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of power.</p>
            <p>But I forbear, and ſubmit theſe hints—which I only offer to conſideration, as a friend to <hi>liberty</hi> &amp; to <hi>mankind.</hi> And I haſten,</p>
            <p>Laſtly, <hi>To conſider a moment the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of mankind, when oppreſſors ſhall ceaſe, and they who rule over men are juſt, ruling in the fear of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That ſuch an happy day ſhould come to <hi>his people,</hi> ſeems to be promiſed by God,
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:015703_0031_0F99E081A4071948"/>
in the Text. And it ſeems promiſed to the <hi>world</hi> in many <hi>paſſages,</hi> (which I have not now time to mention.) And, who that ſees the preſent melancholly ſtate of the world, but muſt <hi>wiſh</hi> and <hi>pray</hi> and even <hi>long for</hi> the glorious day. For, then the moſt perfect models of government will be adopted, when, I doubt not, more regard will be had to the ſpirit of the <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine model</hi> given to <hi>Iſrael</hi> than ever yet has been. And then a <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>equitable body</hi> of <hi>laws</hi> will be framed, which can <hi>oppreſs</hi> no man, except by accident: which <hi>laws</hi> (with great deference to thoſe before whom I ſpeak) at leaſt the <hi>funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental ones,</hi> methinks, ſhould by all means be <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>conciſe</hi> as poſſible; or they cannot in reaſon be binding on the body of the people: for they cannot know them.</p>
            <p>Again. The <hi>wiſeſt</hi> and <hi>beſt</hi> men will be appointed to fill every department: and ſo none will <hi>hurt</hi> or <hi>deſtroy; violence</hi> and <hi>oppreſſion will ceaſe;</hi> their <hi>officers will</hi> be <hi>peace</hi> and their <hi>exactors righteouſneſs.</hi> And ſo <hi>juſtice</hi> and <hi>judgment</hi> will run down the ſtreets as a <hi>river</hi> in an uninterrupted
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:015703_0032_0F99E082983B9148"/>
courſe, and <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> be as the <hi>waves</hi> of the ſea, <hi>ſucceſſive</hi> and <hi>perpetual.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, then, O happy day, every man will enjoy the freedom of a man, <hi>eat the fruit of his labour,</hi> and <hi>lie down</hi> and <hi>riſe up</hi> and <hi>walk by the way,</hi> and have none to <hi>diſturb</hi> him or make him <hi>afraid.</hi> In a word, the people will <hi>feel</hi> themſelves <hi>happy,</hi> and ſo cannot fail to honor their <hi>rulers,</hi> and pay them tribute, and diſcharge their whole duty to them. For a people made happy by their rulers, can never, I believe, be raiſed into a general tumult againſt them, or groſsly neglect their duty to them.</p>
            <p>But, the time would fail me to expati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate; and if you live to ſee this glorious day, you will not want to have it deſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>I ſhall conclude with ſome <hi>Addreſſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, I. To the <hi>General Aſſembly,</hi> this day convened.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Honoured civil Fathers,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We rejoice that we yet ſee our rulers, at a time when our enemies propheſied we ſhould be all <hi>anarchy</hi> and <hi>confuſion.</hi> And
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:015703_0033_0F99E085E58A8110"/>
that we ſee no cauſe to addreſs you in the language of the text: But may without flattery ſay, we ſee the day when (human frailties excepted.) our officers are <hi>peace</hi> and our <hi>exactors righteouſneſs:</hi> And we rejoice in the <hi>government</hi> over us.</p>
            <p>There are thoſe, I am ſenſible, who ſtill keep up their claim of authority over us, under whom we <hi>ſuffered</hi> ſuch <hi>unexampled oppreſſions</hi> and <hi>miſeries as</hi> made their yoke intolerable! And they are ſtill like the <hi>roaring lion</hi> and <hi>raging bear!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The words of my text might with great propriety be ſounded in their ears. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, Let it ſuffice you, O princes, remove violence and ſpoil, and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute judgment and juſtice, take away your axactions from my people, ſaith the Lord God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But alas, alas, they are deaf to the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted voice of this oppreſſed land—They are deaf to the voice of <hi>God</hi> himſelf.—And therefore the united voice of the land hath ſaid—<hi>What portion have we in the King of the Iſles? What inheritance in the land of our fore fathers? See to thine own houſe, O thou great oppreſſor!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="unknown:015703_0034_0F99E086ADE60BB8"/>
And to you now, O our <hi>civil Fathers,</hi> we look under God, to defend us againſt their bloody deſigns. We <hi>bluſh</hi> and <hi>mourn</hi> that any are ſo <hi>ſottiſh</hi> and abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as to counteract you in your endeavours to ſave the land! who ſeem to deſire to return back to <hi>AEgypt</hi> and to <hi>bondage,</hi> and to be ready to take their <hi>butchers</hi> for their <hi>guardians,</hi> and their <hi>murderers</hi> for their <hi>protectors!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, theſe notwithſtanding, the <hi>union</hi> is <hi>glorious;</hi> and one would think the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard of barbarity of the enemy muſt bid fair to make it more <hi>compleat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Be not therefore diſmayed; but do your utmoſt, we entreat you, to <hi>defend</hi> the land, and reſtore it's <hi>tranquility:</hi> And, in a word, to make the people <hi>wiſe, virtuous</hi> and <hi>hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py:</hi> And, aſſuredly, all generations will then riſe up and <hi>call you bleſſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as to the affairs of this day, ſuffer me to entreat every one concerned, to conſider the <hi>great</hi> importance of a <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>good choice</hi> at this criſis of our affairs; and therefore do nothing by partiality, but in the <hi>fear of God,</hi> and with a ſingle eye to his glory and the beſt ſervice of this
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:015703_0035_0F99E087F81E5D10"/>
bleeding land! But, what am I ſaying? When we are all embarked in one common cauſe, and that the moſt important that ever any people were engaged in, and all lies at ſtake, ſure we may ſpare our words and leave this matter with all ſafety in your hand—you cannot be wanting. Forgive me that I have ſpoken. Wiſhing <hi>you</hi> therefore, and the <hi>Honorable Council</hi> to be elected, the divine preſence, direction and <hi>bleſſing</hi> this day and evermore, with all due reſpect, I take my leave of you. But may we meet at laſt in a better world, where the wicked ceaſe from troubling and the weary are at reſt!</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let me <hi>addreſs</hi> myſelf, in a few words, to this <hi>Capital.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your paſt <hi>diſtreſſed ſituation,</hi> your <hi>almoſt miraculous preſervation</hi> and <hi>deliverance,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torts this from me, out of the uſual mode.</p>
            <p>Search, I pray you, and ſee wherefore it was that the Lord hath dealt thus with you.</p>
            <p>I know indeed, that your forwardneſs in the public cauſe was what provoked the enemy: But ſee, I beſeech you what it was that provoked God to ſuffer it. And <hi>amend</hi> what is amiſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="unknown:015703_0036_0F99E088A74A1EE8"/>
And be very <hi>thankful</hi> to God for ſo wonderful a deliverance, and render unto him according to the mighty benefits re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole, adopt I pray you the language of <hi>Ezra,</hi> (<hi>Ezra</hi> ix. 13, 14) <hi>And after all that is come upon us—ſeeing that thou our God haſt puniſhed us leſs than our iniquities deſerve, and haſt given us ſuch deliverance as this, ſhould we again break thy commandments,—wouldeſt thou not be angry with us till thou hadſt conſumed us, ſo that there ſhould be no remnant nor eſcaping.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our earneſt <hi>wiſh</hi> and <hi>prayer</hi> is, that this <hi>capital</hi> may ever <hi>lead</hi> in all <hi>virtue,</hi> and be <hi>preſerved</hi> and <hi>bleſſed,</hi> and made in all reſpects the glory of this land.</p>
            <p>Finally. Let me in a few words <hi>addreſs</hi> this <hi>whole people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O my brethren, God's <hi>judgments</hi> are now <hi>abroad</hi> in all the land, and he juſtly expects that we <hi>learn righteouſneſs:</hi> How melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly is it that we ſee no more of it! Many are <hi>ſighing</hi> and <hi>crying</hi> for the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations which are yet found in the midſt of us; and particularly for the <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate oppreſſions</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="unknown:015703_0037_0F99E089293B57F8"/>
Nothing <hi>is,</hi> nothing <hi>can be,</hi> more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemly than to <hi>oppreſs one another,</hi> while we are all groaning under <hi>public oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions</hi> of the <hi>enemy,</hi> and crying to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>man</hi> for help! <hi>Baniſh it, baniſh</hi> it, from the land, I pray you. On my knees would I gladly <hi>beg</hi> this of you, could I hope thereby to prevail.</p>
            <p>And let there be no ſtrife. I pray you, between <hi>town</hi> and <hi>country,</hi> for we are all <hi>brethren, members</hi> of one body. And neither can ſay—I have no need of you.</p>
            <p>Bleſſed be God, there is a ſufficiency in the land, of the neceſſaries of life; and if ſomebody is not wanting, all the poor may be ſupplied. And as to many, if not moſt, foreign articles of great importance, there is undoubtedly a conſiderable ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply. How then comes it to paſs, that ſuch mutual jealouſies ſhould ariſe, as to make an <hi>artificial</hi> ſcarcity where we all know there is none? For Gods ſake, don't let us counterfeit a ſcarcity leſt he bring a real one! But, let <hi>town</hi> and <hi>country</hi> open their <hi>Stores</hi> and their <hi>hands,</hi> and, to the utmoſt of their power, ſupply each other; for the continuance of this ſtrife will be very diſhonourable to both, and be very <hi>hurtful,</hi> if not <hi>ruinous,</hi> to the common cauſe!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="unknown:015703_0038_0F99E089F8975DA0"/>
A little <hi>condeſcention</hi> and <hi>good-nature,</hi> on both ſides, would eaſily ſet all to rights. And they who go foremoſt in rectifying this matter, will be the moſt <hi>honorable,</hi> let who would begin it.</p>
            <p>And, as all depends upon the <hi>divine preſence</hi> and <hi>bleſſing,</hi> let us do our utmoſt to engage them by earneſt <hi>prayer</hi> and <hi>ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication;</hi> yea and by <hi>turning every one from his evil way and from the violence that is in his hands</hi> (as the king of Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veh well expreſſed it) <hi>who knows but the Lord will think upon us for good, that we periſh not?</hi> Yea more, I <hi>doubt not,</hi> that upon this the Lord will be with us and <hi>maintain our righteous cauſe,</hi> againſt an <hi>ungodly nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have ſeen abundance of the <hi>goodneſs of God</hi> already, amidſt all our calamities. And our enemies have been many a time <hi>diſappointed,</hi> and <hi>fretted,</hi> and gnaſhed their teeth. Give God the glory of all his ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations.</p>
            <p>And let the counſel of the Lord be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to the land: And let them whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>break off their ſins</hi> by <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> and their <hi>iniquities by ſhewing mercy to the
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:015703_0039_0F99E08AA3421B98"/>
poor;</hi> and I have no doubt it will be the <hi>reſtoring</hi> and <hi>lengthning</hi> out of our tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity; yea, and that our land, will, ere long, become an <hi>aſylum,</hi> or <hi>place of refuge,</hi> to all the perſecuted <hi>ſons of Liberty,</hi> in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part of the globe, and be filled with wiſe and happy men, and become the <hi>joy,</hi> if not <hi>envy,</hi> of all the earth.</p>
            <p>And, that it may be ſo, in God's time, Let me entreat you devoutly to join with me in a <hi>prayer for our land,</hi> taken from a <hi>divine model,</hi> in the 83<hi>d pſalm:</hi> The ſpirit of which, and every principal thought, I have carefully transferred to ourſelves, only varying the names and a few other things peculiar to them: A prayer which points out ſo many particulars in our caſe this day; that it might almoſt ſeem to have been prophetically compoſed for us.</p>
            <p>O thou ſupreme Jehovah, who ruleſt in Heaven and earth, and canſt at all times do thy pleaſure, even with a words ſpeaking.</p>
            <p>Appear now for us, we earneſtly beſeech thee, in this day of our diſtreſs, when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded by a cruel and blood-thirſty enemy; who are come with a deſign to reduce us to <hi>ſlavery</hi> or deſolation.</p>

               <pb n="41" facs="unknown:015703_0040_0F99E08B8FF92068"/>
They are <hi>thine enemies</hi> in this thing as well as ours, being come in a moſt <hi>unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous cauſe,</hi> without any provocation to juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify this outrage.</p>
            <p>And yet they make a <hi>noiſe</hi> and a <hi>tumult</hi> like the <hi>waves</hi> of the <hi>ſea</hi> on which they come; and proudly boaſt that they are come with ſtrength enough to cruſh us: And they even <hi>mock</hi> our dependance on thee to ſave us!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Keep not thou ſilence, hold not thy peace, ſit not ſtill,</hi> O God, and ſee us periſh; but ariſe for our help; and let thy all-power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful word defend us; that the proud may know that they are but <hi>men,</hi> and that God is with us, againſt whom they have no power.</p>
            <p>We know they have had long <hi>conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> againſt us, and laid their plan with all the <hi>depth</hi> of <hi>ſubtilty</hi> and <hi>crafty wiſdom,</hi> againſt this thy people, whom thou haſt ſo long and ſo wonderfully defended, as an <hi>hidden</hi> treaſure, or as the apple of thine eye.</p>
            <p>They have ſaid—If they will not be our <hi>ſervants</hi> and <hi>bond men,</hi> and ſuffer us to do <hi>what we pleaſe</hi> with them,—Come, let

us gather a mighty force from all nations, far and near, who will lend us aid, and let us burn their <hi>towns</hi> and <hi>cities,</hi> and make their land a <hi>deſolation!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, behold, they are even now <hi>lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued</hi> together, even <hi>many nations,</hi> beſides our <hi>furious brethren</hi> the <hi>Britons,</hi> who are <hi>principals</hi> in this war; and have begun the moſt deſperate attacks upon us in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious parts of the land. And, unleſs God mercifully interpoſe and prevent it, nothing but <hi>blood</hi> and <hi>ſlaughter</hi> are to be expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>And, notwithſtanding all our warlike preparations, we dare not depend on an arm of fleſh to ſave us! O that the battle might be the Lords and not ours!</p>
            <p>To this end therefore we pray—</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Awake,</hi> O Lord, for our help, and come and ſave us! <hi>Awake,</hi> O Lord, as in ancient times! Do unto them, O Lord, if it be thy will, as thou didſt unto the <hi>Midianites</hi> and their <hi>confederates,</hi> and to <hi>Siſera</hi> and to <hi>Jabin,</hi> when they unjuſtly and without provocation, invaded thy people: And make their <hi>lords</hi> and <hi>nobles</hi> and <hi>great commanders,</hi> like <hi>Oreb</hi> and <hi>Zeeb,</hi> and like <hi>Zeba</hi> and <hi>Zalmunna.</hi>

Tho' theſe angry brethren profeſs to worſhip the ſame God with us, yet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is in ſome-what of a different mode, they ſeem to have ſaid—<hi>Come let us take the houſes of God in poſſeſſion,</hi> accordingly they have vented a peculiar <hi>ſpite</hi> againſt the <hi>houſes</hi> of <hi>God; defaced</hi> and <hi>defiled</hi> thy <hi>holy</hi> and beautiful ſanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, where our fathers worſhipped thee, turning them into houſes of <hi>merchandiſe</hi> and <hi>receptacles for beaſts;</hi> and ſome of them, they have <hi>torn in pieces</hi> and <hi>burned</hi> with fire!!</p>
            <p>What holy indignation ought to ariſe in our breaſts on this occaſion! And will not God alſo be angry at ſuch <hi>barbarous profanity</hi> and <hi>impiety?</hi> Surely thou will not hold them guiltleſs, who thus mock thee, and bid defiance to heaven as well as to us!</p>
            <p>Therefore we humbly pray—That thou wilt hedge up their way and not ſuffer them to <hi>proceed</hi> and <hi>proſper.</hi> But, put them to flight <hi>ſpeedily,</hi> if it be thine holy will, and make them run as faſt as a <hi>wheel</hi> downwards, or as <hi>ſtubble</hi> or <hi>chaff</hi> is driven before a furious <hi>whirlwind:</hi> And, as the <hi>fire</hi> conſumes the <hi>wood,</hi> and ſometimes

lays waſte whole <hi>foreſts</hi> on the <hi>mountains,</hi> ſo let them be laid <hi>waſte</hi> and <hi>conſumed,</hi> if they obſtinately perſiſt in their bloody deſigns againſt us.</p>
            <p>Lord, raiſe a <hi>dreadful tempeſt</hi> to affright them, and let thy tremendous ſtorms make them quake with fear; and purſue them with thine arrows, till they are either de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, or brought to ſee that God is with us of a truth and fighteth for us, and ſo return to their own lands, covered with <hi>ſhame</hi> and <hi>confuſion;</hi> and <hi>humble</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves before thee, and ſeek to appeaſe thine anger, by a bitter repentance for their murderous deſigns! And let them have neither <hi>credit</hi> nor <hi>courage,</hi> to come out any more againſt us.</p>
            <p>That ſo all the nations ſeeing thy mighty power and thy marvellous works, may no more call themſelves <hi>ſupreme;</hi> but know and acknowledge, that thou art God alone, the only <hi>Supreme Governor</hi> among men, doing whatever pleaſeth thee.</p>
            <p>And ſo let thy glorious name be mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified in all the earth till time ſhall be no more! And, let all the people ſay, AMEN and AMEN!</p>
