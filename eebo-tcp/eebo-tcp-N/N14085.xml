            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>NARRATIVE.</head>
            <p>AS the late ſcene in Bennington, which has cloſed with my diſmiſſion, is not only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting to my friends, who are fellow-ſufferers with me, but it is imagined that the knowledge of it may be uſeful to others, who have at leaſt a curioſity to know, I would humbly requeſt the candour of the public, while I exhibit a ſummary view of it for the ſatisfaction of inquirers.</p>
            <p>This office, which I have accepted at the inſtance of many whom I much eſteem, I am not inſenſible is as delicate as it is difficult for me to perform, as the innocent feelings of each one concerned are to be preſerved unhurt, while truth and charity require that I deal faithfully with all.</p>
            <p>To open the ſcene, then, to the greater advantage, I would beg leave to acquaint the reader, that the ground on which it has been acted was, no longer ago than twenty three years, an entirely uncultivated and howling wilderneſs; lying about forty miles north-eaſt of Albany. The ſoil being rich and luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riant, the ſituation high and ſightly, in a pure and healthy air, was nevertheleſs very inviting to ſettlers. From ſmall beginnings this town has ariſen to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable eminence and importance, in regard both of the number of its inhabitants and wealth; and in regard of military proweſs, Bennington is thought to be ſecond to none on the continent.</p>
            <p>The original proprietors were chiefly Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Separates, from different parts of New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:017823_0004_0FA31997044D3240"/>
who being weary of the reſtraints of authority, and in fear of dwindling to nothing in their ſcattered ſituation, were willing to embody together, that they might act out their principles without reſtraint, and exhibit to the world the light of their religion.</p>
            <p>This favorable ſpot was then choſen as the thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre of their glory. While they were few in number and feeble in their circumſtances, they were remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for their love of one another. Beſides this there have been ſeaſons of eſpecial awakening and attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on here; and in the judgment of charity a happy number have been renewed and added to the Lord. This circumſtance has contributed not a little to the gaining them reſpect and even fame abroad, as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious people.</p>
            <p>As a number of profeſſors, not of the ſeparate or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, have become inhabitants of the town, and have had great reſpect for the perſonal and miniſterial en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments of the Rev. Mr. DEWEY, who was of catholic and liberal principles, they have, at dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent periods joined the communion here.—And it is to be hoped that, by converſing with chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians of other diſtinctions, and by a more liberal train of thinking, theſe walls of jealouſy, ſhyneſs and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration, which now divide profeſſors, will ſoon be demoliſhed; and goſpel union and affection be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored in the houſe of Chriſt's friends.</p>
            <p>My worthy predeceſſor, who held his office here about fifteen years, was no ſooner gathered to his fathers<note n="*" place="bottom">DEC, 21, 1778.</note>, than the united attention of this people was turned upon me to become his ſucceſſor. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly I made them a viſit in January 1780, when I was received with great warmth of affection. This viſit I continued until the laſt of February, when the people were pleaſed to give me a call for ſettlement,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:017823_0005_0FA3199800B993D0"/>
with only one diſſentient in the church, and one in the congregation.</p>
            <p>From this great union and good agreement, after they had had a fair opportunity of knowing my ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents on religion, I was induced to think that here was laid a happy foundatſon for my living in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the people, and for my being uſeful in this part of the vineyard, where labourers are very much needed. And being willing to make a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of other views and proſpects, for the ſake of doing this people good, I did, on the tenth of April, accept their invitation to ſettle here.</p>
            <p>It being not my intention to deſcend to many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute circumſtances in this narration, I ſhould gladly paſs the following one in ſilence, did it not claim par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular notice, as it ſhows the nature, as well as the beginning of our confuſions. The incident is this: That when, upon giving my anſwer to the people's call, I propoſed that they would be pleaſed to appoint a day and a council for my inſtalment,—The Hon. JOHN FASSET, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> who had objected againſt ſending for me in the firſt place, and who had been uniformly againſt me all along, was pleaſed to object againſt its being done at preſent, it being cold and late in the day. And notwithſtanding the appointment might have been made in leſs time than was conſumed in ſhuffling it off, it was poſtponed from Monday until Friday.</p>
            <p>And when the Friday-meeting came on, there appeared the ſtrongeſt jealouſy—That all was not right—that I held dangerous ſentiments in my heart, which I was unwilling now to bring out, and that the people were taking a haſty ſtep, which they might have occaſion to tread back at a future period. This will be truly ſurprizing, when it ſhall be known, that as yet I had broached no one ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:017823_0006_0FA319992E097DF0"/>
different from what I had clearly diſcuſſed, to the entire ſatisfaction of the church, previous to their call. The conſequence of all was, that after much had been done to give content and to ſave the credit of the church, five brethren were againſt my inſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and two or three profeſſed to be neuters.</p>
            <p>The incivility and the indeceney of this uſage of a miniſter of Chriſt, and the interruption of the peace and harmony of the town, met with deſerved rebuke from men of feeling here. And while this manoeuvre failed of gaining the conductors of it that applauſe, which it might have gained them if they had not over-acted their part, they had difficulty in retreating ſo as wholly to cover a deſign,—and to ſupport their profeſſion as "Iſraelites indeed, in whom is no guile."</p>
            <p>This manoeuvre was no ſooner over, and the heat of men's ſpirits abated, than the people very amica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly agreed in making the neceſſary appointments for the inſtallation without oppoſition.</p>
            <p>The third day of May was the time of our attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this ſolemnity. And when there appeared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the council but three diſſenters in the church, and only one in the congregation, the oppoſition was ſo ſmall that I made no ſcruple to renew my anſwer: which as it will give the reader an idea of my views, as well as of the manner of my induction, I beg leave to preſent him with it here.</p>

                        <p>And inaſmuch as I have heretofore been duly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained an officer in Chriſt's kingdom, by "the lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on of the hands of the preſbytery," whereby I am inveſted with full power and authority to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter ſealing ordinances, and to do all the duties of a miniſter in God's houſe; and inaſmuch as I can receive no new, nor even any acceſſion of power by a re-ordination; I do now, without ſome of the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual ceremonies of an inſtalment, thus publicly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge and declare myſelf to be under the moſt ſacred vows to exerciſe my office, and to do all the duties of the paſtor of this church, according to the tenor of the charge given to Timothy or Titus, or to any other paſtor of new teſtament deſcription, ſo long as God in his providence ſhall continue me with you. And, in reliance on divine grace, I do engage to exerciſe this my office for your edification and not deſtruction, that I may hope to preſent you as a choſen virgin to Chriſt, to whom I am to give account, that you and I may rejoice together at his appearing.</p>
                        <p>Upon this occaſion, I hope that your goodneſs, my brethren, will ſuffer me to mention to you that I have great confidence in your zeal and faithfulneſs,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:017823_0008_0FA3199A0653EF20"/>
that you will concur with me in every prudent mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure for the reviving and ſupporting of church diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, to the end that the erroneous may be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, the vicious and the impenitent may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, and that the juſt may be vindicated and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged; or, to ſpeak in the language of the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Jude, "Of ſome have compaſſion, making a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference; and others ſave with fear, pulling them out of the fire; hating even the garments ſpotted by the fleſh." In this way will you become conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as a city on a hill; and in this way will the "KING greatly deſire your beauty."</p>
                        <p>Finally, my brethren, as you regard your own advancement, the beſt intereſt and good of others, and the glory of God in the kingdom of redemption, you will afford me the chriſtian charity of your prayers, that I may be guided by the ſpirit of truth; that I may have fortitude and ſtrength for every en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter; that I may defend the goſpel againſt all oppoſers; that I may ſtand in an evil day; that I may make full proof of my miniſtry; that I may turn many to righteouſneſs; and that at laſt I may meet the approbation of my Judge—"to whom be glory in the church by Chriſt Jeſus, throughout all ages, world without end." Amen.</p>
                        <p>In the next place I would turn my addreſs to the people of the congregation, who uſually meet for public worſhip with the church here.</p>
                        <p>My dear friends,</p>
                        <p>Your cheerful and unanimous concurrence with the church, in calling me to labour in this part of the vineyard, hath been no ſmall inducement to me to ſettle amongſt you.</p>
                        <p>Inaſmuch as the holy ſcriptures, and indeed the very nature of the thing, do manifeſtly make a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction between an evangeliſt and a paſtor; the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

                        <p>Upon this principle would I proceed therefore to declare, in the witneſſing view of heaven and of this aſſembly, that I do very cordially accept your invitation to me to become your miniſter. And I do hereby engage to exerciſe my office as a preacher of the goſpel amongſt you, to notice your morals, to ſeek your beſt intereſt, and to watch for your ſouls and the ſouls of your children, as one who muſt give account to God.</p>
                        <p>And give me leave, my people, to aſſure you, in this public manner, that I have great pleaſure in the thought that you will give your conſtant attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance on my miniſtry; and that you will, in honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and effectual ways, exert yourſelves, with ſpirit, to encourage my heart and to ſtrengthen my hands, in this good work which I have now undertaken for your benefit and ſalvation.</p>
                        <p>And, Oh! that my labours may not be in vain, as to any of you, my precious charge! While I ſhall be continued your miniſter, it will, I truſt, be the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate prayer of my heart, that you may be giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en me as the ſeal of my miniſtry, and as the crown of my rejoicing in the day of the Lord Jeſus.</p>

            <p>When the eyes of the people thus ſaw their teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, there was viſibly a great and general joy, as might naturally be expected upon ſuch an occaſion. The noiſe and clamour, which before had been ſo great, being now huſht to ſilence, and my oppoſers ſeeming unwilling to appear in arms, the people fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitated themſelves much in proſpect of increaſing delight in my miniſtry.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:017823_0010_0FA3199B86536A50"/>
But as bright and halcyon days ſeldom continue long without a cloud, ſo it was not long before this tranquility was greatly interrupted, when a rencoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter commenced, in a way little expected by one un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with ſuch operations.</p>
            <p>Some time in June, the head of the oppoſing par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty preſented, to the church, a ſmall liſt of grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ariſing from my preaching, which he deſired might be accepted as a ſufficient apology for his withdraw from the worſhip of God where I guided the aſſembly.</p>
            <p>This gentleman pleaded, that although he could not and dared not ſay that my doctrines were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptural, yet, as he could not ſee them to be right, he judged that he ought not to be compelled to hear that which he deemed not for edification. Beſides, he wiſhed that, if he were in an error about my doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines, or did not rightly apprehend my ſentiments, the church would bear with his weakneſs and afford him help by conference; that he and they might yet walk together in love.</p>
            <p>Although the church had no idea that this apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy ought to have been accepted by them, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing willing to gratify a brother, in a caſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected faith and conſcience, they readily complied with the motion for a conference.</p>
            <p>In managing this interview, the church were very particular in explaining the grounds and reaſons of their belief in thoſe points which were ſo ſtumbling to their brother. But their explanation was ſo far from yielding him ſatisfaction, that it appeared only to give an edge to his feelings. Hence there com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced a long and tedious diſpute. But after a diſtreſſing trial of this expedient, Mr. Faſſet was more diſſatisfied, and more burdened, about my principles than before. But this was not all—by
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:017823_0011_0FA3199C44C23360"/>
this time, a number of others had collected courage enough to come out, and declare themſelves diſſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the ſame points that had been the ground of diſpute now in the church.</p>
            <p>While this conference made work and made way for one or two more, there was found no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit ariſing from it, except it was to ſee under whoſe banners one and another would appear. And the ſame may be ſaid of almoſt every conference on the ſubject of grievances. For as the diſſenting intereſt began now to gain credit and to lift up its head, ſo, at almoſt every conference, ſome new re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruit would be found paraded on the oppoſite ſide. And thus the church appeared to be daily dividing againſt itſelf, and to threaten a general convulſion.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, if town fame is true, the leaders in the oppoſition ſounded the feelings of many from houſe to houſe, thereby exciting the ſympathy of weakneſs in their favour, becauſe of their burdens and great diſtreſſes. So that there was little now to be heard, from any quarter, but the cry of grievances.</p>
            <p>At length, being weary, by hearing the dolorous ſound of uneaſineſs and diſcontent, and willing to make their patience and condeſcenſion as conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as their love of order, the church did, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding confering had hitherto been quite unavail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſo far yield to the dint of importunity as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to meet them once more in conference. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, very early in January following, the church aſſembled to ſee if any thing more could be done, in this way, towards giving content to their troubled brethren. Care being had to the aggrieved's ſenſe of the articles of their burden; and it being found that, in caſe the church ſhould fail in clearing them up to their liking and acceptance, they would
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:017823_0012_0FA3199D060C7258"/>
continue ſtill to abſent themſelves from my miniſtry, our ſituation became truly alarming; and we began now to apprehend danger from the very meaſures which we were purſuing with our brethren, who were bound to the ſame obſervance, of rule and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der as we were.</p>
            <p>The church, upon this, needed very little time to conſider that theſe articles of grievance, as they were ſtiled, were properly to be deemed articles of charge and complaint againſt the paſtor, for mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adminiſtration. And by this time, their eyes were opened to ſee that they were going upon enchanted ground, while they were ſuffering charges to be brought thus againſt a brother, and eſpecially againſt an elder, under the fallacious cloak of grievances, when there had been no private labour with the brother complained of, as a neceſſary and an indiſpenſible pre-requiſite to a public hearing of a caſe, of ſuch nature and degree as to be made the ground of ſeparation amongſt brethren.</p>
            <p>Accordingly, conſidering that no one hath right to be grieved with his brother, except for tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion—that, in caſe of tranſgreſſion, it is antichriſtian and cruel to proſecute a brother publicly, before private influence has been exerted betwixt the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties alone—that a church hath no right to hear a caſe of tranſgreſſion debated, except in the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed way of diſcipline:—Conſidering alſo, that the practice of telling grievances, which are real charges, is an abuſive way of proſecuting a brother, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the dictates both of humanity and revelation—and that it hath a direct tendency to create fears, ſuſpicions, jealouſies, heart burnings, and alienati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of affection, the bane and ruin of all intercouſe, communion and happineſs in a church—and finally being determined to ſupport the credit of religion
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:017823_0013_0FA3199DC3FB93B8"/>
and the honor of their own profeſſion:—the church, at laſt, very wifely reſolved, that they would allow of this uſage no more.</p>
            <p>How painful, and how confounding to the views and ſchemes of our great advocates for the practice, now laid aſide by the church, this reſolution was, is hard to ſay. The moſt piteous out-cry was now made, that could well have been made, had the church voted againſt one of the firſt privileges of the kingdom of heaven. And notwithſtanding the popular cry of tyranny and intolerance, the church have done themſelves the honour hitherto to ſupport, with fortitude, their good reſolution.</p>
            <p>The way being thus prepared, I urged upon my oppoſers, with great ſolemnity, that they ſhould treat me according to Chriſt's law of diſcipline, in caſe I had tranſgreſſed, in my preaching, on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of which they were ſo much offended as to turn their backs upon my miniſtry—to the end that they might appear to regard the divine authority, and that I might know my crime and repent.</p>
            <p>But, being perſuaded that they could not make a chargelye againſt me, and unwilling to hazard a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal trial, in which, if they ſhould fail, they muſt abide the conſequences, they excuſed themſelves from this irkſome taſk, by ſaying that they did not know, and ſo did not chooſe to ſay, that I had tranſgreſſed, or that my preaching, in the leaſt, erred from the divine word.</p>
            <p>When they were reminded of what had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated to them times out of mind, that they could not be juſtified, in their withdrawing from the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and interrupting the communion by treating the paſtor as an offender, for his preaching, unleſs they could ſhew that the paſtor had erred, and that his preaching was corrupt; and that, in ſuch caſe,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:017823_0014_0FA3199E84C11250"/>
they could not be excuſed from ſo plain and ſo binding a duty as that of diſcipline—they replied, that inaſmuch as the preaching was of public no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriety and expoſed to every one's remark, the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate ſteps of diſcipline might lawfully be diſpenſed with.</p>
            <p>But when they were reminded of the principles of the church on this head, that Chriſt's law of diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline is not to be reſtricted to private offences and treſpaſſes, but that it reſpects treſpaſſes, as well pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic as private, and may, in no caſe of treſpaſs, be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed with—and that every one who is guilty of treſpaſs is entitled to the priviledge of being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplined according to law—and that, they ought, therefore, to extend this privilege to the paſtor, would they keep themſelves in countenance, even if it were only their opinion that he had erred in his preaching:—they had the ſagacity to avail them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of a method, as extraordinary as their caſe now required to help them out of a pinch, which was, to deny that they conſidered me as a member of the church, over whom they were to exerciſe bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly watch. This was their reaſoning to make it out: That I was not a member unleſs a paſtor of the church—that I was not a paſtor unleſs ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—that I was not ordained legally unleſs by the power of the brotherhood;—but inaſmuch as my ordination was by the preſbytery, by virtue of their own office-power without any inveſtiture from the brotherhood—they could not ſee that I was an offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, nor that I belonged to their communion. And when they were reminded that as the ſubject of my ordination had been largely conſidered by the church and by themſelves too, not only previous to my inſtalment but to their giving their call, and that my denying the right of ordination in the brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:017823_0015_0FA3199F43FDCA20"/>
by no means invalidated my ordination by the preſbytery, much leſs deſtroyed it, or made it out that it was no ordination: they anſwered that they had not ſo well conſidered this matter before, as they had ſince my introduction.</p>
            <p>The principal actor being now ſtruck off from the ſtage, the ſcene ſuddenly ſhifted, and aſſumed a new form, much to the ſurprize of the ſpectators, when the whole train of grievances was now brought in againſt the church, for their receiving me and my doctrines. Lay ordination, allowed by Cambridge platform and practiſed by many great and good men, and which is one of the principal bulwarks of the ſeparate intereſt—the danger of ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendering the privileges of the church into the hands of thoſe who explode the power of the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood in ordination—That by receiving a miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter who does not fellowſhip the doctrine of lay or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination is building the things which they once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, and thereby making themſelves tranſgreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors—were popular themes to harp upon, and like a vade-mecum, were always at command when occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on called for them.</p>
            <p>The church having now become the declared ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our brethren's grief and uneaſineſs; and as it was proper that they ſhould be allowed an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of telling us ought that they had againſt us; the ſecond day of March was appointed for a full audience, when every article, to be conſidered, ſhould be ſtated in writing. The church met ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.</p>
            <p>But when it was found that our brethren would not ſay that they were aggrieved, on the account of any tranſgreſſion of the church; and that they were unwilling to treat thoſe articles as grounds of diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline; notwithſtanding they could not walk with the
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:017823_0016_0FA319A00514E358"/>
church as they now were—conſidering alſo that bringing theſe articles againſt the church, when they had no iniquity to lay to their charge, was in reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, though under cover, obliquely proſecuting the paſtor, as he was the mark to which all their arrows were ſtill pointed; the church judged it not their duty to conſume time in hearing complaints againſt themſelves, any ſooner than they would againſt a brother, unleſs they were for ſome bad conduct, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther real or ſuppoſed; and that it would be early enough for them to confer with the aggrieved when they ſhould declare themſelves aggrieved on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of ſin, either real or ſuppoſed.</p>
            <p>However, conſidering that, by the unwarrantable meaſures now purſued, the doctrines of Chriſt were daily growing into diſrepute; that the dignity of the miniſterial office was hereby degraded and brought down to the duſt of men's feet; and that the breach of friendſhip was conſtantly ſpreading itſelf like fire, and threatening general ruin to the church:—we propoſed, in much condeſcenſion to our brethren, to call in the aid of mutual council, if peradventure they might do ought to ſave us, before our caſe ſhould become incurable. The conditions were, that each party ſhould chuſe whom they pleaſed, and no one ſhould fault his brother's choice. This motion was very readily agreed to, and a council appointed. The church appointed miniſters of the ſtanding or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and the aggrieved miniſters of the ſtrict congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gational order, as the ſeparates are ſtiled.</p>
            <p>Our diſputes being now referred to an enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and judicious board, in whom we placed great confidence, we enjoyed, for a moment, a little ceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and we fondly felicitated ourſelves on the proſpect of our receiving much ſatisfaction from the gentlemen. But, in the mean time, the ſending of
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:017823_0017_0FA319A0C65402A8"/>
our letters miſſive was unexpectedly delayed, for ſome weeks, when there were found plauſible objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againſt our ſending for the council at preſent. However, the church were quite happy in finding themſelves able ſo far to ſurmount thoſe huge diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties as to agree, the ſecond time, to ſend for the men, whom they, according to accepted propoſals, had choſen for counſellors.</p>
            <p>But when the much wiſhed for time for the ſeſſion of council had arrived<note n="§" place="bottom">25<hi>th of May</hi> 1781</note>, we were made to know, by a very affecting providence, that it was not the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of Chriſt that there ſhould yet be an end put to our troubles. For inaſmuch as all the gentlemen ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the aggrieved failed, the other could do little more than to behold our miſery and return, leaving us, like ſhip wrecked mariners, ſtill buffet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the waves. A double gloom was now caſt upon the face of our affairs; and indeed we walked in darkneſs and had no light!</p>
            <p>The church, hitherto unwilling to croſs the incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, the humours and prejudices of the aggriev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in any thing which they could with any colour avoid, leſt they might ſeem to be inattentive to their comforts and delights, ſo far allowed them to rule as to omit the celebration of the Lords ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per untill now. But finding, upon trial, that this conformity to them was as fruitleſs as it was unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable, it being turned into wantonneſs by them, the church felt themſelves approved for their own folly, and on the firſt of <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> them communed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in this ordinance, for the firſt time ſince my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalment.</p>
            <p>But, notwithſtanding the church profeſſed to have communed with Chriſt, at his table,—to have ſat under his ſhadow with great delight,—and to have
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:017823_0018_0FA319A186173058"/>
found his fruit ſweet to their taſte,—our aggrieved brethren took great umbrage at our conduct, ſtig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiſing it with the opprobrious epithets of prema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, raſh and unwarrantable, as well publicly as privately from houſe to houſe. However, had we waited longer for a ſettlement of the grievances, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented only in a way of complaining of certain things which they did not like, we might have left our gift at the altar until now, without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in a legal way, that they had ought againſt us: For their telling us, not in a way of diſcipline, that they could not believe as the church did, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting my introduction and doctrines; when at the ſame time they declared, that they were not grieved with the church on the account of ſins; what was there for us to remember that our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren had againſt us? The truth is, that a church ſhould never neglect a plain duty that good might come. The way of duty is the way of ſafety—and we are to expect light and comfort only in the way of the keeping of Chriſt's commandments. And "they who obſerve lying vanities, forſake their own mercy."<note n="§" place="bottom">Jonah ii. 8.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Deſpairing now of the church's turning from the ſtedfaſtneſs of their purpoſe not to take cognizance of grievances, which were not on the account of ſing our brethren judged it time to turn their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to other meaſures for redreſs. Accordingly, very early in autumn, they moved for a council of ſeparate churches only, as the church had never profeſſed to be in fellowſhip with any but thoſe of this order.</p>
            <p>But, conſidering that the time was now paſt for a council to prevent a rupture; that diſcipline ought to precede the dernier reſort to council; that as
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:017823_0019_0FA319A245F90D80"/>
there had been made no complaint of error, nor of ſin, we had no buſineſs proper for a council, as yet; and that, according to the propoſal for having none but ſeparates, our election could not be free, and ſo, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all, the council could not be mutually choſen: the church thought it not their duty to gratify them in their requeſt.</p>
            <p>But this denial having given no conviction to our brethren, either of the impropriety of their motion, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

<pb n="22" facs="unknown:017823_0020_0FA319A376D4B288"/>
this ſubject, it unhappily failed in affording that conviction, which was fervently prayed it might af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, to check their fiery ambition; although they were not a little mortified that their own meaſures had ſo unfortunately turned againſt their darling views.</p>
            <p>The ſeaſon following was remarkable for nothing more than the production of two additional articles of grievance, though not on account of <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> in the church. Theſe were made the pretext for calling the church together, ſome time in May, when, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing themſelves of them, together with all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther articles, which ſtill diſturbed the peace of their conferences as much as ever, our zealous brethren, with great warmth, renewed their application for a council. But being unwilling to countenance a motion, which now ſavoured ſtrongly of a deſire in them, not ſo much to gain light as to be availed of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, by which they might hope to have their own meaſures ſanctified and they themſelves placed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the reach of blame; although we had no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy apprehenſions from that quarter; and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that there ſtill exiſted the ſame objections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our ſending now for a council, as there did laſt fall when we rejected this motion; and indeed being filled with a ſenſe that our own dignity, that propriety and decency would not allow us to treat the ordinance of councils with ſo great diſreſpect, as to ſend for one, when it had been already judged, that we had nothing prepared to be laid before any board from abroad: the church was obliged, upon principle, once more to deny them.</p>
            <p>Finding themſelves foiled and baffled in all their attempts for a council, our brethren had now but little hope of ſucceeding in the courſe which they held; and, it ſeems that, they would have been
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:017823_0021_0FA319A3EA76E150"/>
quite in deſpair, had not the ſuppoſed goodneſs of their cauſe been to them as a reviving cordial to keep up their ſpirits, while they imagined that God would yet appear for them, and bring light out of preſent darkneſs.</p>
            <p>Of this deſponding countenance was a requeſt, as abſurd as it was extraordinary, which they made to the church, in the beginning of fall, that we would diſmiſs them in regular ſtanding and in chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian fellowſhip, that they might be a church by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. The impropriety, if not the impoſſibility, of our granting this requeſt to thoſe, who had virtually if not formally renounced our fellowſhip, and whoſe only reaſon for this motion was, that the church held to ſuch a faith and practice as that they could not commune with us, appears evidently at firſt bluſh. For if they could not hold fellowſhip with us when we were related to each other as members of one body; how could they do it when we ſhould be divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two? Beſides, we were perſuaded that the laws of God's houſe make no proviſion for a church's di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding on points which prevent, not only the higher acts of communion at the table, but even their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and worſhiping together, either upon the ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath or any other day; except by regular diſcipline; but then not in fellowſhip. To ſuppoſe the contrary would be to make profeſſors covenant breakers ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to law. But this is both abſurd and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible.</p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding all this, ſo intent had the church hitherto been on making their patience, their forbearance and their condeſcenſion as great, as was their brethren's want of theſe virtues, they would have attended to any arguments which might have been offered on the ſubject, had not their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct rendered it inadmiſſible. For as one of the
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:017823_0022_0FA319A484D30028"/>
ſigners of their requeſt was under public diſcipline, in a very heavy charge of hereſy and ſcandal, their petition carried in it a requeſt that we would acquit him of this charge when he had done nothing to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy it. And when they were reminded of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delicacy and impropriety, ſo far were they from a diſpoſition to expunge his name, and leave his caſe to be decided in the church without them, that they choſe rather to ſtand or fall together, as the die might be caſt.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, as they allowed the ſentiments to be juſt which their brother was charged with broaching and maintaining; although they granted that he had been imprudent in declaring them; they were not a little intereſted in the trial depending, and repeatedly urged the bringing of it on. This indeed was neceſſary in order to their knowing what ſtep to take next.</p>
            <p>The trial of this brother was no ſooner iſſued, in the church, than it was judged that there muſt be iſſued other meaſures beſides thoſe on which they had hitherto placed dependence. Accordingly they inſtantly circulated, through the church, a ſubſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, requeſting a meeting "to ſee if the church would agree to call a council of churches, known by the name of ſtrict congregational churches, to look into the difficulties then ſubſiſting in this church, and to give their advice agreeable to Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge platform and our covenant."</p>
            <p>After this paper had obtained the names of one half of the church, it was brought to me, for my direction. And, paſſing unnoticed the indignity of this low ceremony of jealouſy, I warned a meeting according to orders; but with leſs cheerfulneſs, than I ſhould have done the ſame buſineſs, had only one or two made this requeſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:017823_0023_0FA319A54490A7C8"/>
It being now found, when the church came toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that my friends were overpowered by numbers, and conſidering that diſputing would be more likely to ſtir up wrath, than to convince thoſe who could ſhow a majority, the council was appointed, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to deſire, without indecorum.</p>
            <p>Although I ſaw no neceſſity, nor any regularity or propriety in this appointment, as our affairs were circumſtanced—and although no one was under any obligation to plead, in defence, before the council, as there had been no legal proceſs to lay any under ſuch obligations:—Yet being willing to embrace ſo favourable an opportunity for propagating light, as well for the ſatisfaction of the ſpectators as of the council: I complied with the deſire of my friends ſo far as to give a stating of facts, as they had happened, and to correct ſuch miſtakes and miſrepreſentations as might be made, in handling the ſeveral points ſet up, by our aggrieved brethren.</p>
            <p>That which has been improved as the occaſion of ſo much uneaſineſs and debate, and of interrupting the communion here; and been the occaſion of ſo great a noiſe through the country; to the no ſmall diſadvantage of the goſpel, and to the wounding of religion, may be ſeen, as it is judiciouſly drawn up in the following reſult of council, which now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites the reader's attention.</p>

The council choſe the Rev. E. Wright mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator, and J. Spalding for be.</p>
                        <p>The council being opened with prayer, proceeded to hear the Rev. Mr. Avery give a narration of the various ſteps, by which the differences have ariſen which now ſubſiſt in the church. Several articles of grievance were then laid before the council, by a number of the brethren of the church, and the day being ſpent, the council adjourned until eight o'clock the next morning.</p>
                        <p>May 27th, the council met, according to adjourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, opened with prayer, and proceeded to hear diſcuſſed the article of grievance reſpecting the church's departing from their covenant and plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, in receiving the Rev. Mr. Avery as their miniſter.</p>
                        <p>The council having carefully attended to this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of complaint or grievance, are of the opinion that the church have not departed from their cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant or platform, in receiving the Rev. Mr. Avery as their miniſter; and that there is no juſt cauſe of grievance on that account.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, The council proceeded to hear the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing articles of grievance or complaint againſt the church, for their receiving certain doctrines, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by Mr. Avery, as ſound and orthodox, which they the aggrieved members look upon as er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous: which doctrines, for ſubſtance, are as follows—</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That whatever an unregenerate man does, as a moral agent, is ſin.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That Chriſt's interceſſion, in the court of heaven, is ſuch as now operates againſt all the views, ſchemes, and evil deſigns of the wicked, and will at laſt terminate in the utter ruin and overthrow of finally impenitent ſinners.</p>
                        <p n="3">
                           <pb n="27" facs="unknown:017823_0025_0FA319A6C645A6E0"/>
3. That a man can do all that God requires of him, if he is but willing: or, in other words, that moral ability conſiſts in the will.</p>
                        <p>The council having carefully examined what has been ſaid for and againſt theſe doctrines, are of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that they are agreeable to divine revelation.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, The council attended to the general run of the doctrines received by the church, as being mere ſpeculation.</p>
                        <p>As to this, we are of the opinion that thoſe who make this complaint are blameable!</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, The complaint relative to the church's receiving Leonard Robinſon to their communion, after he had been ſet by for ſeveral years, although there had been no charge againſt him, was laid before the council.</p>
                        <p>Careful attention being paid to this article, we are of the opinion that the church did right in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Mr. Robinſon again to their communion.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, The Rev. Mr. Avery was accuſed to the council, as ſaying—To make our appeal to creeds and confeſſions of faith, as teſts of orthodoxy, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of making it to the bible, in any cauſe reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing revelation, is more becoming papiſts than pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant chriſtians.</p>
                        <p>The council having heard Mr. Avery explain himſelf, as to this matter, are of the opinion that there was, in this, no juſt cauſe of offence.</p>
                        <p>Sixthly, The diſcipline of the church, reſpecting Mr. Simeon Sears, was ſubmitted to the council for their opinion.</p>
                        <p>This being conſidered, we are of the opinion that the church's procedure againſt Mr. Sears was juſt.</p>
                        <p>We would now addreſs ourſelves to the paſtor and brethren of this church.</p>

Reverend and Beloved,</p>
                        <p>It is with the greateſt ſenſibility that we feel for you, in your trials. You cannot but be ſenſible that ſin is the cauſe of all the troubles into which you are plunged. And from a conviction that ſin is the cauſe of theſe evils, let every one examine his own heart and ſay, what have I done?</p>
                        <p>It ſeems that the deſign of the inſtituted means of grace is much fruſtrated amongſt you—goſpel ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances brought into contempt—the heart of the righteous made ſad—and the bands of the wicked ſtrengthened—through your diviſions; which will prove bitterneſs to you in the latter end.</p>
                        <p>We would therefore earneſtly recommend to you to put away all ſinful ſtrife and contentions; and each one, for himſelf, walk with God, in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of his heart, and tenor of his life, as the only way that will bring you to walk together in the kingdom and patience of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, conſidering the embarraſſments, the diſadvantages and diſcouragements, that muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily attend the Rev. Mr. Avery, in proſecuting his miniſtry in this place, and the little proſpect that you or Mr. Avery can have, of his being inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal of uniting this people—we would recommend it to you, as our advice, that, if Mr. Avery ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt the ſame, you would diſmiſs him from his paſtoral charge over you; that he may be at liberty to ſerve God in his generation, in the work of the miniſtry, where he may have a greater proſpect of doing good than he has with you—and you alſo may be at liberty to ſeek for yourſelves another paſtor, in whom you can be better agreed.</p>
                        <p>We would alſo take this method to declare our eſteem for Mr. Avery, as a miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt;
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:017823_0027_0FA319A843E93880"/>
and, as ſuch, we do freely recommend him to the acceptance of all God's people.</p>

            <p>The moderator then, in the preſence of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, delivered the following admonition, to which they all gave conſent. A copy has ſince been giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en us for the preſs.</p>
            <q>
               <p>"I think it my duty, before I take my leave of you, to addreſs myſelf, in a particular manner to the aggrieved brethren, as they are called.</p>
               <p>Beloved brethren,</p>
               <p>From what I have ſeen and heard, in the courſe of the trials which have been depending before this council, I am very deeply concerned for you and for the church in this place. I hope you will allow me to expreſs my concern for you, in dealing plainly and faithfully with you. It may be this will be the laſt opportunity that I ſhall ever have to ſee you or to ſpeak to you; and I am unwilling to go away without leaving my teſtimony with you.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, then, I have to tell you, that thoſe doctrines exhibited to the council, which you deny to be doctrines according to godlineſs, I eſteem to be ſome of the great truths revealed in the word of God. I have believed them, and preached them for many years; and I have known them to be owned and bleſt of God for the awakening, and I truſt for the converſion of many ſouls, eſpecially in the place where I live.</p>
               <p>In your oppoſing theſe doctrines, it appears to me that, you are oppoſing ſome of the great truths, on which the faith and hope of the people of God depend. If we give up theſe doctrines, we do, in effect, give up the whole ſyſtem of divine truths.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="unknown:017823_0028_0FA319A9045F4B10"/>
And notwithſtanding you may thing yourſelves honeſt and upright, in oppoſing Mr. Avery in theſe doctrines, I earneſtly beſeech you to conſider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you are not really doing the devil's work. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan is endeavouring, various ways, and by any means that he can make uſe of, to root up the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel to deſtroy it from off the face of the earth: and what muſt the unhappineſs of thoſe be that ſerve him herein?</p>
               <p>Furthermore, conſider, I pray you, whether, by your means, the goſpel will not be driven away from Bennington; and this people be deprived of the means and ordinances of grace, whereby many poor ſouls may periſh eternally, and their blood be required at your hands.—I really think, my brethren, that you have reaſon to fear that this may be the caſe.—I therefore ſeriouſly entreat you not to think light of it.</p>
               <p>In the next place, your neglecting your duty as members of this church, your not attending the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, the order and rule of God's houſe, fills me with painful apprehenſions for you. I have known ſeveral churches, that were as flouriſhing for a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon as any, perhaps, in the land, that by letting in ſuch diſputes and contentions, and indulging a ſpirit of diviſion and ſeperation, have gone on to bite and devour one another, till they have been conſumed one of another, and not the leaſt appearance of a viſible church left.</p>
               <p>While I have theſe things in view, and conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the circumſtances that this church is in, at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, I have the greateſt reaſon to fear that this may be your caſe here in Bennington; and that you will become like Shiloh of old, when the ark was taken from them. God is with his people while they hearken to his voice and obey his word: but if they
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:017823_0029_0FA319A9C3D20AE8"/>
walk contrary to him, he will walk contrary to them, and repent of the good wherewith he ſaid he would benefit them.<note n="§" place="bottom">Lev. xxvi. 23, 24. Jer. xviii. 10.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Be entreated therefore, my brethren, to ſtop and conſider your ways, leſt, if you go on as you have done, you may repent when it will be too late!</p>
               <p>Thus, brethren, I muſt take my leave of you, praying that God, of his ſovereign grace and mercy, would direct and preſerve you in the way that you ſhould go."</p>
            </q>
            <p>When, upon this occaſion, the moderator put to vote the doings of council, my friends accepted of every article; but the aggrieved brethren accepted of none but the firſt.</p>
            <p>Now finding that, notwithſtanding my oppoſers were thus confounded by their own meaſures, they ſtill maintained, in full ſtrength, their averſion to my doctrines and diſcipline; and that their ear could not be gained by all the eloquence and perſuaſion of the worthy council of their own choice, the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of which they had obtained with ſo much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, I could not long heſitate what part to act.</p>
            <p>Accordingly, being perſuaded of the truth of the wiſeman's maxim, as well in regard of the people as of myſelf, that "Better is a dry morſel, and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs therewith, than a houſe full of ſacrifices with ſtrife,<note n="†" place="bottom">Prov. xvii 1.</note> I reſigned my office here the 17th of June; but not without the livelieſt ſenſe of grief for the very unhappy neceſſity which compelled me to do it.</p>

            <p>Thus has cloſed a ſcene which has made as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable, as it has an unuſual diſplay, on the chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian theatre. While the actors on one part have been intent on a favourite point, thoſe on the other part have contended earneſtly for the faith once delivered to the ſaints. Who has acted a part worthy of imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, is left to the reader's judgment—and whoſe eye has been ſingle, in conducting this ſcene, is humbly refered to the judgment of the great day.</p>
            <p>I have now only to make a remark or two, and then I ſhall put an end to this writing.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I cannot but be of the opinion, that a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal occaſion of our confuſions has been a neglect of church diſcipline.</p>
            <p>Had diſcipline been ſeaſonably and duly obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it would, without doubt, have blaſted, in the bud, thoſe evils which have brought forth ſo much cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt fruit. This would have prevented our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren's taking up a cauſe of uneaſineſs with my preaching, unleſs they had againſt it reaſons ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to juſtify a public declaration. And, in ſuch caſe, they would not have made any public declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:017823_0036_0FA319AF04306728"/>
before they had uſed private influence to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover me from error. In this way, communion would not have been interrupted, and the peace and union of the church would have remained.—And I beg leave to add, that had the church turned their forbearance into diſcipline, they would either have gained their brethren, or elſe have excluded them from their communion according to law; and ſo have preſerved the dignity and order of God's houſe.—But, alas, the day in which we live is a day when it is imagined that church diſcipline ſavours rather of a hard and unchriſtian diſpoſition, than of that love and faithfulneſs which conſtitute the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Chriſt. Hence, honeſt men, who know their duty, are too much inclined to neglect this ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance through fear of offence. But this is their weakneſs, and it calls for mourning, as well as it does that it ſhould be ſhrewdly given out, in vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ways, that the great law of brotherly love is dangerous to the union and peace of churches.</p>
            <p>When churches put up with evils, which require diſcipline, thinking thereby to get along, ſome how, as it is often expreſt, would do well to conſider that there is no getting along, in Chriſt's kingdom, but by keeping his commandments; and that when theſe are neglected, churches ly ſtill, or rather go back, and are making work for repentance. Should the inſtance before us convince the reader of the truth of this remark, it will be found that he has read our affecting ſtory not in vain.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To revive and ſupport the eſtabliſhed order of God's houſe, is an object of the firſt importance to command the attention and the zeal of chriſtians.</p>
            <p>Every one ought to "mark well, and behold with his own eyes, and hear with his ears all that
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:017823_0037_0FA319AFC4400728"/>

This being regarded will raiſe up the church from her low ſtate, and make her ſhine in all the beauties of holineſs. Adopting any other ſyſtem, and acting upon any other max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims, however plauſible, and however celebrated they may be, will utterly fail in reducing men to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the houſe.

And then it will be found to be a divine PRIVILEGE to be a member of the church, when every member will be treated ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to law, without fear from brethren, when they have no ſin to lay to his charge,—for "in that day there ſhall be no more the Canaanite in the houſe of the Lord of hoſts."<note n="¶" place="bottom">

In this great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign many hands are employed—the wiſdom of the learned, and the eloquence of the orator. And in this work is diſplayed the unparrallelled love and zeal of the Lord himſelf. This is his own decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.

            </p>
            <p>Having this glorious object in view, how can chriſtians ſit with folded hands and take their reſt, when "the hedges" of Zion "are broken down, ſo that all they which paſs by the way do pluck her?"<note n="‡" place="bottom">Pſal. lxxx. 12.</note> Without diſcipline a church ſoon becomes like "the field of the ſlothful, and the vineyard of the man void of underſtanding,—all grown over with thorns, and nettles covering the face of it, and the ſtone wall thereof broken down."<note n="§" place="bottom">Prov xxiv. 30, 31.</note> And indeed it is hard for us to ſee that phyſic is more neceſſary for the body, or regulations for an army, than diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline for a church.

And without the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, all the diſtinction which we give to the idea of an army is confounded and even loſt in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, mutiny, deſertion, obſtinacy, uproar, and a wild ungovernable mob; utterly unfit for ſervice, affording no defence to any nation, ſtate or king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.

            <p>AS you have a joint intereſt with me in the ſceene now deſcribed, I beg leave to addreſs you, in particular, on the ſubject, at my parting with you.</p>
            <p>My heart being filled with the tendereſt ſympathy, I do ſincerely condole with you, in your preſent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction. By matters being brought to this criſis. I am ſenſible that your views and expectations are cut off equally as my own. And notwithſtanding peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are wont to feel little concern in affairs foreign to them, yet I am perſuaded that the hiſtory of your troubles, as it is a hiſtory of human nature, will not fail to excite in perſons of ſenſibility the livelieſt pity and compaſſion for you; eſpecially if they themſelves have experienced the like misfortune. But that which is moſt needful for you is to make a wiſe improvement of the diſpenſation which ſo

            <p n="1">1. Adore that holy hand which hath effected thoſe events by which we are obliged to part.</p>
            <p>This is the believer's challenge; "Shall there be evil in a city, and the Lord hath not done it?" And not only revelation, but even nature itſelf teacheth the ſame doctrine. "Aſk now the beaſts, and they ſhall teach thee; and the fowls of the air, and they ſhall tell thee: or ſpeak to the earth, and it ſhall teach thee; and the fiſhes of the ſea ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare unto thee: who knoweth not in all theſe, that the hand of the Lord hath wrought this."<note n="†" place="bottom">Job xii. 7—9.</note>

            <p>While you conſider that you have to do with God in theſe concerns, you will be happily guarded againſt fretting at ſecond cauſes. Second cauſes are in his hand, as inſtruments of diſcipline and correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and great good may come to you by them.

            <p n="4">4. Be aware of a ſeparateing ſpirit.</p>
            <p>From the many awful diſplays of this ſpirit, made before your eyes, in the courſe of a few years paſt, as well before as ſince I came amongſt you, there is more reaſon why you ſhould fear it, than there is that you ſhould fear "the peſtilence that walketh in darkneſs, or the deſtruction that waſteth at noon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day."<note n="‡" place="bottom">Pſal. xci. 6.</note> This ſpirit always feels independent of its neighbours; and is intent only upon its own inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and humour. It never eſteems another better
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:017823_0043_0FA319B446653CD0"/>
than itſelf; and it ſeldom bluſhes to make its own goodneſs a ſtandard for its brother. Hence it is not uncommon for this ſpirit to affect great compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for the blindneſs and the ſmall experiences of its fellow-profeſſors. In various ways it calls upon beholders to admire its ſhining excellencies; and in as many ways it is wont to ſhow diſpleaſure if they withhold their applauſe. It "loves the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt ſeats in the ſynagogues, and greetings in the market,"<note n="†" place="bottom">Luke ii. 43.</note> as though theſe of right belonged to it. It aſſumes, with airs, the dictator's chair; and is not unwilling to give laws to inferiors. And if you diſpute this prerogative, it ſcruples not to adopt that all-convincing reaſoning, "I am holier than thou."<note n="‡" place="bottom">Iſa. lxv. 5.</note> And the leaſt diſobedience to this evil ſpirit is, at any time, a ſufficient reaſon for its withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from you, as though you were unworthy of its communion. And then the diſcipline of ſhyneſs, jealouſy, murmuring, unſociableneſs, ſurlineſs, ſour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, unkindneſs, unmercifulneſs, and complaining, is the ordinance of your reformation. As this ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit never gathers with Chriſt, it always ſcatters abroad, contrary to the whole ſtrain of the ſcriptures. And what is ſurpriſing is, that it delights in being alone, when it can exclude all others as not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to its happineſs.</p>
            <p>When I conſider that the ſpirit of the goſpel is a uniting ſpirit <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> that it is the deſire of Chriſt that all his people "may be one, that they may be made perfect in one;" and that this union made manifeſt in life is deſigned as the great mean of conviction to the world that his miſſion was from heaven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when I conſider alſo the great ſtreſs which is laid upon the doctrine of union, in the ſcriptures, as, "Be
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:017823_0044_0FA319B5063B5A28"/>
of one mind." "Be perfectly joined together in the ſame mind and in the ſame judgment." "Let us ſtand faſt in one ſpirit." "Behold how good and how pleaſant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity." "Now I beſeech you, brethren, mark them which cauſe diviſions and offences, contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned; and avoid them." I ſay, when I conſider theſe things, and how great a ſtreſs is laid upon this doctrine, which all believers receive in the love of it—I heſitate not to pronounce upon a ſeparating ſpirit, that it is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian ſpirit, and ought to be avoided as the bane of churches.</p>
            <p>You cannot, therefore, my friends, have too great an abhorrence of this ſpirit, in whomſoever it may, at any time, appear. You ought to guard againſt it with diligence, and cruſh the firſt riſings of it amongſt you. If it be let alone very long, it will become head-ſtrong, and utterly unmanageable, like the wild Gadarene, whom no man could tame.</p>
            <p>Introduced with this unholy and dangerous ſpirit is a train of evils of the fouleſt character. Its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and conſtant attendants are, "debates, envy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, wraths, ſtrifes, backbitings, whiſperings, ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, tumults." And whenever you ſhall ſee this troop of furies ariſe, ſtand in awe and dread the conſequences. For if every kingdom divided againſt itſelf is brought to deſolation: and if no city or houſe divided againſt itſelf ſhall ſtand: know you for certain, that when a ſpirit of diviſion ſhall have dominion over you, then deſtruction will be even at your door. "If ye bite and and devour one another, ſaith the apoſtle, take heed that ye be not conſumed one of another."</p>
            <p n="5">5. Seek after goſpel order and walk in it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="unknown:017823_0045_0FA319B5C4701FA8"/>
The bleſſings of order are ſo numerous, ſo great, and ſo precious, that it is truly aſtoniſhing that it does not more command the attention of believers. Its lines are drawn with ſo much clearneſs and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion; and its diſtinguiſhing marks are ſo plain and eaſy to be ſeen; that it ſeems to require invention to avoid it. To every humble and honeſt diſciple, the way of duty is obvious enough: ſo that "the way-faring men, though fools, ſhall not err therein." Hence young children, and perſons of very ſcanty capacities may eaſily be convicted of perverſeneſs, and wilful blindneſs when they refuſe to walk in it. This is the covenant.</p>
            <p>"Thine eyes ſhall ſee thy teachers: and thine ears ſhall hear a word behind thee, ſaying, This is the way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the left." "The meek will he guide in judgment: and the meek will he teach his way. All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth unto ſuch as keep his covenant and his teſtimonies." And as "God is not the author of confuſion, but of peace, as in all churches of ſaints:" ſo his peculiar people are diſtinguiſhed from others by their love and practice of peace and order.</p>
            <p>Indeed this is an article of ſuch eſtimation in the ſcriptures, that "in this the children of God are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, and the children of the devil: whoſoever doth not righteouſneſs is not of God, neither he that lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not his brother." Of your duty on this head, this is the ſum: "Thou ſhall not hate thy brother in thine heart; thou ſhalt in any wiſe rebuke thy neighbour, and not ſuffer ſin upon him." "If thy brother ſhall treſpaſs againſt thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he hear thee, thou haſt gained thy brother. But if he will not
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:017823_0046_0FA319B68578E100"/>
hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witneſſes every word may be eſtabliſhed. And if he ſhall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church: but if he neglect to hear the church let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican." "Withdraw yourſelves from every brother that walketh diſorderly. If any man obey not our word by this epiſtle, note that man, and have no company with him, that he may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed" "Mark them which cauſe diviſions, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the doctrine which ye have learned, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void them." "I have written to you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolator, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner—with ſuch an one, no not to eat.<note n="‡" place="bottom">If any reader ſhall imagine that we are prohibited eating with an excommunicant, at the Lord's table only—let him conſider—that we are to have NO company with him—ſurely then, not the HIGHEST and MOST HONORABLE kind of company. Otherwiſe we ſhall make our apoſtle read thus abſurdly—with ſuch an one NO, not even to eat the Lord's ſupper, as that is the GREATEST act of communion that chriſtians ever perform on earth.—Beſides, this reſtriction reſpects our treatment of a man, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a brother, when he is caſt out of the church. With others, even the fornicators of this world, we may eat: but if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator—with ſuch an one, no not to eat. But while he was in the church, every brother might eat with him.</note>"</p>
            <p n="6">6. Diſplay, upon all occaſions, true greatneſs of mind.</p>
            <p>This is neceſſary in order to your ſhining in that religion which will make you the light of the world. And it is to be wiſhed, that you may appear to the beſt advantage, that others beholding "your good works may glorify your Father who is in heaven."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="unknown:017823_0047_0FA319B745AD56B0"/>
Narrowneſs and contraction are not more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aimiable or even contemptible in the eyes of men, than they are unfavourable to a religious character. Hence, under the reign of righteousſneſs, when there will be light ſufficient to exhibit and to diſtinguiſh characters with clearneſs,—</p>
            <p>"The vile perſon ſhall be no more called liberal, nor the churl ſaid to be bountiful. For the vile perſon will ſpeak villainy, and his heart will work iniquity, to practiſe hypocriſy, and to utter error againſt the Lord, to make empty the ſoul of the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, and he will cauſe the drink of the thirſty to fail. The inſtruments of the churl are evil: he deviſeth wicked devices, to deſtroy the poor with lying words, even when the needy ſpeaketh right." And yet this ſame vile perſon, this churl, the enormity of whoſe villainy and covetouſneſs exceeds even the livelieſt deſcription, would fain be thought to be liberal, bountiful, manly, honorable. He ſeems not to ſee any reaſon in his "depart in peace, by ye warmed and filled"—not being accepted in lieu of "thoſe things which are needful to the body." And ſhould any have the confidence, from the churl's 'making empty the ſoul of the hungry, and his cauſing the drink of the thirſty to fail,' to ſcruple the goodneſs or the nobleneſs of his heart, it will be much if he is not deemed uncharitable and ſevere. Hence hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical and lying profeſſions of a good diſpoſition, of good intentions, of full reſolutions,—to do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing clever, ſomething honorable and noble, are always to ſupply the gaping vacancy of ſomething clever, honorable and noble. And after all his ſtudy and care to ſave appearances, while he rebels againſt righteouſneſs, and againſt his duty; his ſpeaking villainy, his heart's working iniquity, his practiſing hypocriſy, his uttering error againſt the
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:017823_0048_0FA319B803D94A60"/>
Lord, his making empty the ſoul of the hungry, his cauſing the drink of the thirſty to fail, his evil in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, his wicked devices, his deſtroying the poor with lying words, will all appear without a covering and without excuſe, and procure him the heavy curſes due to his little ſoul. He ſhall no longer then be ranked amongſt good and honourable men—he ſhall be called, and treated as, a vile churl.</p>
            <p>"But the liberal deviſeth liberal things."—This man can look on great and generous deſigns with noble pleaſure and a heart-felt ſatisfaction; and in this, as well as in every other reſpect, he is ſuperior to a man of a narrow mind, in that he can behold the ſolicitor of a charity, without turning pale. It is not his character to treat the good of others with cold indifference; for he knows by experience that "it is more bleſſed to give than to receive." And as he enjoys the pleaſure of diffuſing happineſs amongſt men, ſo he is "ſatisfied from himſelf." With him it is not ſufficient barely to be juſt—he delights in being bountiful. And ſince he hath this promptitude, it is no marvel that he prefers the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic to any private intereſt. His "charity ſeeketh not her own." The amaſſing of wealth, and laying up riches, he knows not whether for a wiſe man or a fool, is not an object of ſo much importance in his eſtimation, as his being "eyes to the blind, and feet to the lame; a father to the poor, and a ſearcher out of the cauſe that he knows not, his breaking the jaws of the wicked, and plucking the ſpoil out of his teeth." The cry of the poor, of the fatherleſs, and of him who hath none to keep him, more readily reacheth his feelings, than the moving eloquence of the ableſt orator; and the widow's heart ſinging for joy affords him a nobler entertainment, than even a band of the beſt performers. And ſo odd is he in
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:017823_0049_0FA319B8C5B0C1B0"/>
his notion, that he really prefers "the bleſſing of him who was ready to periſh," to all the praiſes of cringing ſycophants, and the loud huzzas of lazy dependents, or even the degrading encomium—He is a very rich man.</p>
            <p>To recommend this excellence of temper yet more to your acceptance, I beg leave only to add, that it will help you to paſs by affronts and to pardon abuſes. You may have much need of this, in the midſt of ſuch a provoking generation as this, who think it becoming men of ſpirit readily to reſent, at leaſt with the ſword of the tongue, every uſage of their neighbours, that is ſo unfortunate as not to agree with their nice ſentiments of dignity and honor. It is the glory of a great mind to paſs unnoticed ſuch abuſe; "not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but contrary wiſe bleſſing; knowing that he is thereunto called, that he ſhould inherit a bleſſing.'</p>
            <p>Should this divine greatneſs, therefore, ſwell and enoble all your breaſts, and prompt and regulate all your views, give me leave to aſſure you, my friends, that it will make you the ornament of religion, the pillars of ſociety, and the beaſt and glory of good men. This will acquire you a name that is better than precious ointment; and the fruits of it will be "an odour of a ſweet ſmell, a ſacrifice acceptable, well pleaſing to God."</p>
            <p>"And by liberal things ſhall he ſtand." 'For he that in theſe things ſerveth Chriſt is acceptable to God, and approved of men." Although theſe liberal things are not the meritorious ground of our ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the divine favour, yet they ſhall be produced as the neceſſary vouchers of our righteouſneſs, when we ſhall be judged according to our works. "Then ſhall the King ſay unto them on his right hand, Come, ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the kingdom
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:017823_0050_0FA319B9862DBDC8"/>
prepared for you from the foundation of the world: for I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirſty, and ye gave me drink: I was a ſtranger, and ye took me in: naked, and ye cloathed me: I was ſick, and ye viſited me: I was in priſon, and ye came unto me. Inaſmuch as ye have done it unto one of the leaſt of theſe my brethren, ye have done it unto me.</p>
            <p>Be not afraid, then, my friends, to be truly libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and truly great. So far are you from loſing your money by lending it unto the Lord, that you loſe even all that you do not lend to him. In this diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of your intereſt you lay up for yourſelves trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures in heaven, which you ſhall enjoy hereafter. "He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the Lord; and that which he hath given will he pay him again." "There is that ſcattereth, and yet increateth; and there is that withholdeth more than is meet, but it tendeth to poverty. The liberal ſoul ſhall be made fat; and he that watereth ſhall be wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered alſo himſelf."</p>
            <p n="7">7. Reprove and avoid a levelling diſpoſition.</p>
            <p>If you receive my advice under the laſt head, ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly you will under this. Your religious character, and your higheſt intereſt depend upon it. As a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling diſpoſition is not only dangerous to ſociety, but is expreſsly forbidden in God's word, I beſeech you not to ſpeak lightly of it: for in this matter you have a mighty concern with your maker. The divine law, on this ſubject is—"In lowlineſs of mind let each eſteem other better than themſelves." "Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honor prefering one another." "Render to all their dues: fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour" "Therefore all things whatſoever ye would that men ſhould do to you, do ye even ſo to them."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="53" facs="unknown:017823_0051_0FA319BA43D03628"/>
This law you need to have well written in your hearts, that you may diſplay it in all your deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment towards others. Chriſtians in nothing appear more like the great Pattern of humility, of meekneſs and of philanthropy, than they do in a ſtrict confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to this rule And I am free to ſay, that it is owing to nothing but pride and arrogancy that any are not in ſubjection to it.</p>
            <p>As a levelling ſpirit ever envies the ſuperiority of its neighbours; ſo it does not ſcruple to adopt any meaſures to clip the wings of thoſe who fly, or to depreſs thoſe who attempt to riſe. This demon of envy can never endure its equal, much leſs its rival, in either intereſt or fame. And indeed, ſuch is the nature of this diſpoſition, that it cannot reſt without degrading other characters below the level, that it may enjoy the pleaſure of thinking itſelf eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teemed above them. Its language is—I am not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior to any one—men were made to ſerve me! Hence it confounds the diſtinctions which nature has made, and which time immemorial has ſanctified, between members of ſociety, on the account either of their age or rank. Men of this ſtamp "deſpiſe government, preſumptuous are they, ſelf willed, they are not afraid to ſpeak evil of DIGNITIES."</p>
            <p>And this evil diſpoſition is as deſtructive to ſociety, as it is ungracious and degrading. For as it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robes public characters of that dignity and honour which God has confered upon them for the good of others; ſo it renders uſeleſs their adminiſtrations, whether it be in church or ſtate, exactly in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as they are brought down from that eminence in which their offices place them above others. Would you then, my friends, deſire to have the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil magiſtrate "a terror to evil doers, and a praiſe to ſuch as do well," hold him up in the light of
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:017823_0052_0FA319BB0497F6E0"/>
DIGNITY. And would you wiſh to have the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the goſpel "ſave them who hear them," hold them up in the light of DIGNITY. And ſince this daring, levelling ſpirit of the times has pervaded all our land, and ſhakes even the pillars of church and ſtate, from both extremities of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, and more than legions of veterans is threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening ruin to our liberties and to our religion—let me conjure you to awake, and to be upon your guard againſt this fiend, this offspring of pride, this enemy of all righteouneſs, this peſt and plague of ſociety. Now is the time for you to rouſe, when the effects of a levelling ſpirit have become ſo alarming. Lift up then a ſtandard againſt this enemy, and make the tyrant flee—make the tyrant die! Cruſh, with ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, the firſt riſings of his power, before he gains ſtrength amongſt you—You can more eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer him in the cradle, than in the field—"I ſpeak as to wiſe men; judge ye what I ſay."</p>
            <p>Finally, as family-religion—family-government—the education of children—and the promoting of learning in this young and riſing ſtate—are ſubjects of high importance to you, I would gladly diſcant upon each of them, were it not that it will ſwell this addreſs to too great a ſize. Nevertheleſs, allow me to indulge in the pleaſure of the hope that my pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful inſtructions on theſe topics will be kept in laſting remembrance, and will be carried forth in practice, by you.</p>
            <p>And now, I muſt take my leave of you—it may be that with ſome it will be for ever. I hope you will allow me to remind you, that the opportunities which we have had together, in the courſe of my mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry here, will ſenſibly affect us hereafter. The great doctrines of grace which I have invariably preached to you are of the firſt excellence and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance.
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:017823_0053_0FA319BBC42F0B80"/>
And accordingly as theſe doctrines have been receieved or rejected, ſo will the happineſs or the miſery of the hearers be. Be adviſed then to take heed to what you have heard and learned, and hold faſt. Be careful to make theſe doctrines ſhine in all your converſation, that you may ſhine hereafter in the kingdom of your Father.</p>
            <p>"Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace ſhall be with you. If there be therefore any conſolation in Chriſt if any comfort of love, if any fellowſhip of the ſpirit, if any bowels and mercies, fulfill ye my joy, that ye be like-minded, having the ſame love, being of one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, of one mind." My addreſs concludes with the bleſſing of Iſrael:</p>
            <p>"The Lord bleſs thee, and keep thee: the Lord make his face to ſhine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee: the Lord lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee peace."</p>
