            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE work of man's redemption, through the merit of the Son of God, is a moſt important theme! It is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal deſign and ſubject of divine revelation—compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends in it all divine and ſaving knowledge—It is a ſubject which the angels deſire to look into, nor is one deſire gratified, 'till new ones ariſe;—for here is ſcope for alternate inquiry, and pleaſing admiration, 'till time ſhall be no more, and to all eternity—And this truth known and embraced by men, will make them wiſe to ſalvation.—It is a ſong that is, and ever will be new—a ſong melodious in the ears of God himſelf—entertaining to ſaints and angels on earth and in heaven, and will be their delightful em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment to all eternity. And a clear knowledge and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the truths contained in it, will be the means, in the hand of the ſpirit, of diſpelling all the clouds of ignorance and miſts of error, that have ſo long overvailed the nations, and diffuſing thro' them all, knowledge and grace, purity and joy—the means of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting thouſands and ten thouſands from ſin to holineſs; deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them from the power of darkneſs, and tranſlating them into the kingdom of God's dear Son—the means of bringing on the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter day glory; breaking the ſerpent's head; expoſing his infernal

deſigns, and deſtroying his kingdom and power over the hearts of men, and of happyfying ſaints and tormenting devils and wicked men for ever and ever.—And the words I have now read to you, afford us a very comprehenſive view of this ſubject.—"Thou art worthy to take the book and open the ſeals thereof; for thou waſt ſlain and haſt redeemed us to God by thy blood."——And in treating on them, I ſhall do the following things—
<list>
                  <item>I. Shew what is implied in our redemption to God.</item>
                  <item>II. How the Son of God hath accompliſhed this work.</item>

               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. I am to ſhow what is implied in our redemption to God.</p>
            <p>And in general, it implies that we are in a ſtate of bondage—out of which the Son of God hath redeemed us, by paying the <hi>price</hi> of our ranſom, and by conquering and ſubduing that <hi>power</hi> by which we were held.</p>
            <p>Man, in his firſt creation, was made in the image of God. His ſoul conſiſted of three faculties, <hi>underſtanding, principle</hi> and <hi>will.</hi> —His <hi>underſtanding</hi> is the ſeat of ideas and ſpeculative knowledge; his <hi>principle</hi> is the ſeat of ſenſation, perception and moral taſte— his will is the ſeat of exerciſes and volitions.</p>
            <p>The <hi>principle</hi> of the ſoul, as it is a diſtinct faculty, is ſometimes called <hi>diſpoſition</hi> of heart, <hi>temper, affection, inſtinct,</hi> &amp;c. In ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it is called <hi>mind, nature, treaſure, fountain,</hi> &amp;c. And it is evident that <hi>underſtanding</hi> or <hi>will</hi> cannot ſupply the place of <hi>princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> by being the ſeat of ſenſation, perception or moral taſte.<note n="*" place="bottom">See Pr. Edwards Orig. Sin, p. 157.</note>—</p>
            <p>And the ſoul created with theſe faculties, dependent on the will of God for its exiſtence and activity, is capable of forming ideas, perceptions and volitions itſelf. Though God creates and upholds theſe faculties; yet God doth not <hi>create</hi> the <hi>ideas, perceptions</hi> and <hi>volitions,</hi> with their <hi>rectitude</hi> or <hi>ſinfulneſs,</hi> which are only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent modes of the exerciſes.</p>
            <p>The ideas, perceptions and volitions of the mind, are tranſient; but the three faculties of the ſoul are permanent; and will remain the ſame in ſubſtance to all eternity, though they may alter as to their moral quality and perfection.</p>
            <p>And in theſe faculties of ſoul conſiſted the <hi>natural</hi> image of God, in which man was created. And the <hi>moral</hi> image of God, in which man was created, conſiſted in the <hi>rectitude</hi> of his <hi>principle</hi>; which laid a foundation for right perception, or moral taſte, of thoſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects that were formed in his underſtanding. The underſtanding is not the ſeat of moral rectitude or taſte; but the heart, including the<note n="†" place="margin">See Pr. Edwards on Orig. Sin, part 2d, chap. 1ſt, ſec. 1.</note>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:020704_0004_0FB0A62563C51EA8"/>
               <hi>principle</hi> and <hi>will</hi> is the ſeat of all holineſs and ſin. And as the principle, in the firſt creation of angels and men, was right and uncorrupted, all the perceptions and exerciſes of their <hi>principle</hi> and <hi>will,</hi> were holy: God made man upright; in his own image, in knowledge, righteouſneſs and true holineſs.</p>
            <p>And regeneration is a rectifying this principle, and removing its corruption, by the ſupernatural influences of the holy ſpirit of God, which is again miniſtred to mankind, through the <hi>knowledge</hi> of Chriſt and his goſpel. See 2. Pet. i. 3.4. Man being provided with the means of knowledge, was capable of forming the truth of God's character, law and government in his underſtanding; and of perceiving and reliſhing the moral beauty and excellency of them, in his <hi>principle,</hi> and his <hi>will</hi> was diſpoſed and inclined to love God's character, obey his law, and ſubmit to his government, and all his ſubordinate affections and paſſions to a proper exerciſe. Man, then, placed his happineſs in the knowledge of God, love to him and joy in him. And now, when God had brought moral creatures into exiſtence, it was neceſſary that there ſhould be a moral govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and therefore God gave them a law, and eſtabliſhed a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral government over his intelligent creatures—to this law he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed a penalty, in order to ſupport the authority of it, and the dignity and vigour of his government. And it was neceſſary that the threatening of this law be inflicted on tranſgreſſors; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe God himſelf could not uphold moral government over his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent creatures. To ſuppoſe that God governs rational crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures without a law, enforced by promiſes and threatenings, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and puniſhments, but by irreſiſtible force, or divine effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, is to confound the diſtinction between <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>moral</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment—For God to create or produce ſin and righteouſneſs, obedience and tranſgreſſion, by omnipotent power, as he doth a world or light, is inconſiſtent with the very idea of <hi>moral</hi> govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment—of blame or praiſe—or any accountableneſs for our exerciſes or actions. Sin is not a created exiſtence produced by God, but only a contingent mode of exerciſe, originated by a rational crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in tranſgreſſion; and always pre-ſuppoſes error in the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of ſuch a creature, which is incompatible with a being perfect in knowledge. And the great God, in order to manifeſt and ſupport the honour of his own character, as moral Governor, and the authority and dignity of his law and government, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand obedience, and ſo promote the peace, proſperity and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his moral kingdom; declared himſelf to be infinite, eternal and immutable in his exiſtence, knowledge, wiſdom and power. And in his moral perfections, ſuch as benevolence, juſtice and truth, or in one word, his righteouſneſs or holineſs. And, conſequently, that his laws muſt be holy, juſt and good, and his government
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:020704_0005_0FB0A62A57E33FE8"/>
righteous. So that all the ſubjects of his moral kingdom may put an <hi>implicit</hi> faith in his word, and yield an <hi>implicit</hi> obedience to his laws and commands, and an <hi>implicit</hi> ſubjection to his government.</p>
            <p>And God's moral kingdom was now in peace; and all the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of it high in the divine favour; poſſeſſed of liberty and life; and probationers for immortality, in a ſtate of holineſs and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the favour of God forever. They were diſpoſed to love God's moral character, and yield an <hi>implicit</hi> obedience to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and rejoice in his government and works— And when the foundations of the world were laid, all the ſons of God ſhouted for joy! And the <hi>law</hi> of God, as a tranſcript of his moral perfections, expreſſed his will, and was calculated to manifeſt the RIGHTEOUS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NESS of God as moral Governor; i. e. his benevolence, his juſtice and truth; and ſo to lead them into a more perfect knowledge of God; and conſequently to increaſe their conformity to him, in holineſs and happineſs. And they had the indwelling of the holy ſpirit, in its vital influences, to accompany the truth of God's character, and increaſe their love to it.</p>
            <p>The righteouſneſs of God exhibited in his law (as we juſt obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) conſiſts in three things, viz. Benevolence, Juſtice and Truth —By benevolence, I mean the goodneſs, love, mercy and grace of God—by juſtice, I mean his diſtributing to every one rewards and puniſhments according to their deſerts—of treating every one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his moral character—And by truth, I mean the divine veracity and faithfulneſs to his threatenings and promiſes; or his punctually fulfilling his word. The moral law is a tranſcript of theſe perfections of God—and the moral perfection of any intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent creature is a conformity of heart and life, to theſe perfections of the Deity. This was the righteouſneſs of the holy angels, and of innocent man in paradiſe. This righteouſneſs of God, as mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Governor, the moral law was deſigned to manifeſt. The law, in its precepts, promiſes and threatenings, expreſſed God's infinite regard to his own glory, and his benevolence to his moral kingdom, and his diſpoſition and determination to promote the peace, proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity and happineſs of it; by communicating to them, the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of himſelf in his true character; and their duty to him, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and each other. The precept of the law is <hi>holy</hi>; ſuited to conform the ſinleſs obſerver to the moral image of God, and ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote his happineſs. The rewards promiſed in the law are <hi>good,</hi> infinitely exceeding the merit of the moſt perfect obſerver—And the penalty <hi>juſt,</hi> and ſhows the infinite diſpleaſure of God againſt ſin; and is no more than adequate to the crime; and is well ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to deter from tranſgreſſion, and ſo maintain the peace and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of the obedient. And this law, as it manifeſts God's righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs as moral Governor, hath a <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>moral</hi> tendency to promote the happineſs of its obſervers.</p>

               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:020704_0006_0FB0A62B604565F8"/>And unleſs the Governor of the Univerſe, makes it appear by his punctually conferring the promiſed rewards, and executing the threatened puniſhments of his law, that he is <hi>infinite</hi> in his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence, <hi>inflexible</hi> in his juſtice, and <hi>inviolable</hi> in his truth; his government cannot be ſupported, but will be unhinged in the minds of his ſubjects, and will fall into contempt, and tend to diſſolution.</p>
            <p>And God, in his firſt creation of intelligent creatures, placed them in a ſituation near to himſelf, and ſurrounded them with the happy fruits and teſtimonies of his love, and under this holy, juſt, and good law, every way ſuited to advance his honour and glory, and their happineſs and well being. And all this happineſs was ſuſpended upon condition of their yielding an <hi>implicit</hi> obedience to a known, poſitive command of God; given them for their trial; diſobedience to which command, was threatened with death: which death implied a withdrawment of the divine favour, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwelling of the holy ſpirit, in its vital influences, and ſo, in the <hi>total</hi> corruption of the moral principle—and in the loſs of liberty, life and immortal happineſs, in the divine favour—and in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed ſtate of <hi>wickedneſs</hi> and miſery, under the wrath and curſe of God for ever.</p>
            <p>A number of the angels (perhaps not ſeeing the <hi>reaſonableneſs</hi> of ſome plain, poſitive command given to them for their trial) tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed, and revolted from God, and fell under the penalty or curſe —and had it immediately executed upon them, without any mercy or reprieve. Upon this revolt, a grand <hi>moral conteſt</hi> commenced between heaven and hell, concerning the righteouſneſs of God as moral Governor: and the devil ſet himſelf to oppoſe God's moral government, not by natural force, but by temptation, by begui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, deceiving, and ſo prevailing on the ſubjects of Gods moral kingdom, to believe and embrace that <hi>error,</hi> "God will not exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the threatened penalty, if you do tranſgreſs his command." This implied that God is not <hi>inflexibly</hi> juſt, and <hi>inviolably</hi> true; and that it is inconſiſtent with his infinite benevolence to inflict the puniſhment according to the threatening. And in conſequence of this, infinite diſhonour is caſt on God's character, and infinite da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage done to his moral kingdom.</p>
            <p>The devil having riſen in rebellion againſt God by diſobeying his will, ſeeks to ſet up a kingdom founded in error and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in oppoſition to God's moral kingdom, founded in truth and righteouſneſs. The devil (as I have before obſerved) doth not contend with the Almighty for the <hi>natural</hi> kingdom or dominion of the univerſe—or ſeek to reſiſt the natural power or omnipotence of God by <hi>force.</hi> But he contends with God for the <hi>moral</hi> kingdom —and oppoſes God, by oppoſing his truth and righteouſneſs—The devil oppoſes God, by leading his ſubjects into erroneous notions concerning God's moral character, law and government, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:020704_0007_0FB0A62CED023B68"/>
them to believe, that it is for their intereſt to embrace them and practice upon them; and to diſbelieve the threatening of God; or believe that God will not execute the threatening, if they tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs his commands. And the nature of virtue and vice, and the very eſſence of moral government, forbid that moral agents ſhould be overruled, compelled or influenced by natural force or divine ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency; but require that they be influenced by the manifeſtation of truth to their minds, and by propoſing to them rewards and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, in promiſes and threatenings.</p>
            <p>Man being put in a ſtate of trial, under a plain, poſitive com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God; ſatan, under the form of a ſerpent, or rather a <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raph</hi> (as it is in the original) deceived, beguiled, and ſo prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon our firſt parents to believe that God would not execute the threatening on them if they did tranſgreſs—and upon this tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they were emboldened to partake of that fruit which was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to the eyes, good for food, and deſired to make them wiſe; tho' they <hi>knew</hi> it was prohibited by an expreſs command of their all-wiſe and benevolent Creator. And the evil of this ſin conſiſted, in its being rebellion to the <hi>known</hi> command of their rightful Lord and Sovereign; to whoſe known and expreſs commands, they were under infinite obligation to yield an <hi>implicit</hi> obedience, though to them, no <hi>reaſon</hi> for the command appeared, but the contrary. With ſuch a command Abraham was tried, and yielded an implicit obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to it, though to him no other <hi>reaſon</hi> for obedience appeared, but only it was a command of God; in every other view it muſt have appeared <hi>unreaſonable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt ſin was not enmity to God's moral character; for that implies a previous withdrawment of the holy ſpirit of God from the ſoul, in its vital influences; and a corruption of the moral princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which muſt have been a <hi>judicial</hi> act of God, or <hi>puniſhment</hi> for ſin, which could not conſiſtently precede tranſgreſſion.</p>
            <p>But ſome may ſay, How could there be tranſgreſſion without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious enmity, ſince all ſin now proceeds from corruption of princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and want of love to God? To this I anſwer, it is evident there may be tranſgreſſion which doth not proceed from want of love to God's moral character, but from <hi>deception.</hi> We have an inſtance of it 1 Kings xiii. in the prophet of the Lord that was ſent to Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, to denounce judgements againſt that place, and was expreſsly commanded by God, "To eat no bread, nor drink water, in that place:" and the prophet appeared well diſpoſed to obey the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God; till an other prophet purſued him, and overtook him in his return; and ſaid to him, "I am a prophet alſo as thou art; and an angel ſpake unto me, by the word of the Lord, ſaying, bring him back with thee into thine houſe, that he may eat bread, and drink water. <hi>But he lied unto him."</hi> "So he went back with
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:020704_0008_0FB0A62E70B84658"/>
him and did eat bread in his houſe, and drink water." And will any one ſuppoſe that the diſobedience of the prophet, that came from Judah, proceeded from want of love to God? Did it not evidently proceed from his being <hi>deceived</hi> and <hi>beguiled</hi> by the prophet, that <hi>lied to him,</hi> in the name of the Lord? And yet was not his diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience a horrid ſin in the ſight of God, which coſt him his life? Had that prophet been in the exerciſe of ſupreme love to God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any enmity to his moral character, would this have been any ſecurity againſt his being deceived, or his diſobedience? Did he not act as much under the influences of love to God, in the laſt act, as in the firſt?</p>
            <p>And may we not as rationally ſuppoſe, that Eve was influenced by the devil to diſobedience in the ſame manner? The devil came to her, in the form of a <hi>ſeraph</hi>; which form, holy angels often aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume when they bring meſſages to this world from God; and it is very probable, that the devil before his fall, as an angel of light, had appeared to our firſt parents in the ſame form, as their guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian angel, with meſſages from God; and now he transforms him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf again into an angel of light. To which inſtance, the Apoſtle may have reference, 2. Cor. xi. 14. "For ſatan himſelf is tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed into an angel of light." And the devil tells them as an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs a <hi>lie,</hi> in the name of God, as the old prophet told the other —and by this <hi>lie</hi> the woman was <hi>deceived,</hi> and ſo was in the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion. And love to God's moral character could not have ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red her againſt the deception. But yet this was an horrid ſin in our firſt parents, and ſubverſive of all moral government. For it is impoſſible that moral government, over creatures, that are imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in their knowledge and wiſdom, ſhould be ſupported, unleſs they will put an <hi>implicit</hi> confidence in the wiſdom, an <hi>implicit</hi> faith in the word, and yield an <hi>implicit</hi> obedience to the command of their ſovereign, whoſe wiſdom and benevolence they have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to doubt. What confuſion would it make in an army, if the under officers and ſoldiers refuſe obedience to the commands of their General, but inſiſt upon ſeeing the reaſonableneſs of every com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand before they execute it? Love to the moral character of the Sovereign, and ſincere benevolence to the intereſt of his moral king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, would neither ſecure their obedience, or excuſe their tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion. God might have prevented their deception, and ſecured their obedience, by immediate <hi>revelation</hi> of the truth of his will, and their danger; but I do not ſee how this could have been done, by increaſing their <hi>love</hi> to his moral character, by internal influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences. And in conſequence of this tranſgreſſion of our firſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and not before, the favour of God, and the vital influences of his holy ſpirit, were withdrawn from the ſoul; in conſequence of which their moral <hi>principle</hi> became <hi>totally</hi> corrupted and depraved
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:020704_0009_0FB0A62FF2EBEF38"/>
—they loſt all love to God, and were filled with enmity to truth, righteouſneſs and holineſs—and love to darkneſs, error and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs—loſt their liberty, life and immortal happineſs—became pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners of divine juſtice—involved in death ſpiritual, and expoſed to death temporal, became dead in law, and were conſigned over by God, to a confirmed ſtate of darkneſs, error and wickedneſs and miſery; under the wrath of God, the power of ſin, the tyranny of the devil, with ſinning angels in hell; according to the threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed penalty or curſe, "In the day thou eateſt thereof thou ſhalt ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly die." To be thus left of God, under the power of ſpiritual death, and given up to their own hearts luſts, to walk in their own counſels, and chuſe their own deluſion, and deſtruction, is not only the ſin of men, but their <hi>puniſhment.</hi> as you may ſee, Pſal. lxxxi. 11.12. Sin, being the ſinner's own choice and delight, doth not make it a leſs puniſhment but a greater curſe. And God threatens ſinners with ſuch ſpiritual plagues—and in theſe <hi>moral evils</hi> a great part of the <hi>puniſhment</hi> of the damned conſiſts.</p>
            <p>Now, our redemption by the Son of God conſiſts, in his deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us from the penalty or puniſhment, threatened in the divine law, to ſin—from the wrath and curſe of God, and the dreadful priſon of hell; from the power of ſpiritual death, ignorance, error and wickedneſs; from the deluſion and tyranny of the devil, and all that everlaſting ſhame and miſery, to which we are liable, whil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the devil's kingdom—and reſtoring us to the moral image and favour of God—and to liberty, life, and eternal glory and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity in the everlaſting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jeſus Chriſt. In redeeming us to God, he redeems us to all the ſacred trinity; and reinſtates us in the favour of all.</p>
            <p n="2">II. We proceed to conſider, how the Son of God hath accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed this work of redemption.</p>
            <p>And in order to have a comprehenſive view of this matter, we muſt take into our conſideration, that eternal <hi>ſtipulation</hi> or <hi>compact</hi> which was made between the Father and the Son, called the <hi>cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> of <hi>redemption</hi> or of peace, and the law of mediation, of which law or covenant the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks, pſal. xl. 7.8. "Then ſaid I, lo I come: in the volume of the book it is written of me: I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to do thy will, O my God; yea, thy law is within my heart." And Zach. vi. 13. "And the covenant of peace ſhall be between them both." This covenant contained in it certain conditions to be performed by the Son as God's ſervant, and certain honours to be conferred upon him as the reward of his merit, by the Father. And the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, by which he paid the price of our redemption, made ſatisfaction for ſin, and merited all the honours conferred on himſelf, and all the benefits beſtowed on his ſpiritual ſeed, conſiſts in what he did and ſuffered in obedience to this law or
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:020704_0010_0FB0A631691B6C18"/>
covenant; for in fulfilling this law, conſiſted his chief work and buſineſs in this world. And as a diſtinct divine agent, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to his being under any obligation to obey, God the Son took upon him the office of Mediator and Redeemer, before he aſſumed human nature—and executed ſeveral parts of the mediatorial office without human nature. He drew nigh to God the Father, and treated with him about terms of peace and reconciliation for men —entered into a covenant of redemption with the Father—and the human nature had no voice in this ſtipulation—before he aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med human nature he became a ſurety for men, and received pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and bleſſings for them upon the credit of that fountain of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit which he engaged to procure by his ſervices and ſufferings in time—and he agreed, in the covenant, to do and ſuffer all that the Father required of him, in order to procure ſuch a fountain of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs or merit. And to make ſuch terms, agreements and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, no more required a human nature in the Son, than in the Father. But when it was proper for him to perform theſe ſervices and endure theſe ſufferings, it was neceſſary for him to aſſume hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature (and cloath it with the moral character of his divine, that he might put his divine character in the power of his enemies) and not before. And as a divine agent he obeyed the law of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation in the execution of the offices of prophet, prieſt and king. And he fulfilled all that was required of him, as to obedience and ſufferings, in the covenant of redemption. The Son engaged to declare the righteouſneſs and glory of God as moral Governor— ſupport the dignity and authority of the divine law and government and ſecure, maintain and promote the good of his moral kingdom, more fully than they could have been, by the puniſhment of the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, recording to the threatening—and manifeſt the evil of ſin, and the diſpleaſure of God againſt it, and his diſpoſition and determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to puniſh the ſinner, unleſs ſatisfaction be made adequate to the crime; and diſplay his juſtice in puniſhing the ſinner, in ſuch a manner that the ſinner may be convinced that it is an evil and bitter thing to violate the law of God—and the violation deſerves, and may be expected to be followed with the moſt awful conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. The Son engages to make it fully appear, by what he ſhall do and ſuffer, that God is infinite in his benevolence, inflexible in his juſtice, and that his truth is inviolable; that his law is holy, juſt and good, and his government righteous, and that he is the ſame in execution as in legiſlation. And theſe things being done, atonement and ſatisfaction are made; and God can, conſiſtent with his juſtice, be propitious to him that receives this atonement, by believing in Jeſus—and can pardon, juſtify and confer eternal life upon the ſinner. For on this covenant of redemption God hath founded a covenant of grace, in which he hath promiſed theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:020704_0011_0FB0A63353B82FF0"/>
to all that ſhall believe in his Son. And the Son of God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in the covenant of redemption, not only to make ſatisfaction to divine juſtice for ſin, and a purchaſe for believers; but he alſo engaged to deliver his people from the power of darkneſs, and tranſlate them into his own kingdom, and gain their hearts to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and ſet up his kingdom in their hearts, and deſtroy God's enemies. Now, to anſwer theſe purpoſes, the Son of God came into this world to engage in a war with God's enemies—and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide the moral conteſt concerning God's righteouſneſs; and ſo take the poſſeſſion of the hearts of ſinners for himſelf, by delivering them from the error, deluſion and wickedneſs of the devil's kingdom— and cauſing them to embrace truth and righteouſneſs, and ſo build up a kingdom for himſelf, upon the ruins of the devil's kingdom. And the grand controverſy is, Whether it is conſiſtent with the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of God as moral Governor of the univerſe, i. e. with his juſtice, benevolence, love and goodneſs to his moral kingdom, to inflict eternal death upon any of his creatures for diſobedience or tranſgreſſion. God declares, that his righteouſneſs or glory, as moral Governor, obliges him to do this—He hath threatened it in his law, and to remit the penalty in one inſtance, unleſs adequate ſatisfaction be made, ſo as to ſecure the rights of government; is to give up the honour of his truth and juſtice, and his benevolence to his moral kingdom. And God will not pardon ſinners, unleſs he can do it in a way conſiſtent with his own glory and the good of his moral kingdom—a way, in which the dignity and authority, of the law and Legiſlator, and the exiſtence and righteouſneſs of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral government may be preſerved. That which rendered the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of the ſinner neceſſary was, that the infinite evil of ſin, and righteous diſpleaſure of God againſt it, might be expreſſed— and the dignity and authority of the law might be maintained—the vigour of divine government be ſupported, and the happineſs of God's moral kingdom by this mean advanced.</p>
            <p>The devil ſaith, God is not righteous; he cannot maintain his truth <hi>inviolable,</hi> his juſtice <hi>inflexible,</hi> and yet manifeſt his infinite benevolence—and he will not execute the threatening. And ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are in the devil's kingdom and intereſt, they eſpouſe his cauſe, and are continually contending with the Almighty, and replying againſt God. They cannot ſee how it is conſiſtent with his benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to verify the truth of his threatening on ſinners. Hence they deny the eternity of hell torments, and plead for univerſal ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and an other ſtate of probation after this life is ended. And preſuming upon the goodneſs and benevolence of God, they tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs his commands with the hope of impunity. You cannot make an infidel or impenitent ſinner believe, by the preaching of the law, that God will verify the threatening on ſinners. To convince ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:020704_0012_0FB0A6370C3AC490"/>
of this is what the law cannot do, becauſe it is become weak through the fleſh; but God ſending his own Son, in the likeneſs of ſinful fleſh, his being made a ſacrifice for ſin hath condemned ſin in the fleſh, that the righteouſneſs of the law might be fulfilled in all that believe in Chriſt Jeſus, and walk not after the fleſh but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſpirit; by faith in this ſacrifice, the ſinner is fully convinced of ſin, righteouſneſs and judgement, and is intereſted in a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs which fully anſwers the demands of the law; and ſo the righteouſneſs of the law is fulfilled in them. See Rom. viii. 3.4.</p>
            <p>But here let us enquire, and ſhew particularly,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> How the Son of God was ſlain.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> How his blood is a mean of our redemption to God. And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Wherein his worthineſs or merit doth conſiſt, "Thou art worthy—for thou waſt ſlain; and haſt redeemed us to God by thy blood."</p>
            <p>Firſt, I am to ſhow, how the Son of God was ſlain. And he was ſlain as a <hi>victim</hi> a <hi>ſacrifice.</hi> A ſacrifice (in Heb.) is <hi>minchah,</hi> and preſuppoſes a victim, a conqueſt or victory, obtained over an enemy; and is that which is ſlain, or that on which they feaſt, in triumph of the victory obtained. Thus, among ancient nations, when any one obtained a victory over an other in war; the conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror ſuppoſed he had a right to ſlay the victim or conquered foe, and take their ſubſtance as a prey; and they ſlew beaſts, and prepared a feaſt of the ſpoils. And ſometimes among the barbarous, they feaſted on the fleſh and blood of the victims; and this was called a <hi>ſacrifice,</hi> or a feaſt upon a victim. <hi>Corban,</hi> (in Heb.) is any kind of <hi>gift</hi> or <hi>offering</hi> made to God. But <hi>Minchah</hi> is a <hi>ſacrifice</hi> or <hi>feaſt upon a victim.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus was Chriſt, the Son of God ſlain, as a victim and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice in the devil's kingdom, by the hand of his enemies, in the exerciſe of all their ſpight, enmity and malice to his moral cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, as the HEIR of the kingdom. "This is the HEIR (ſay they) come let us kill him, and ſeize on the inheritance."</p>
            <p>By the determinate counſel and foreknowledge of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he is delivered up, and ſet forth to be a propitiation, i. e. a victim and ſacrifice. And God the Son aſſumes human nature, and cloaths it with the moral perfections of his divine, on purpoſe to put his divine, moral character into the power of his enemies— And then this great <hi>Theanthropos,</hi> as the high prieſt under the law, <hi>offers</hi> up himſelf—to be made a victim and ſacrifice, by his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies—and they with <hi>wicked hands</hi> did to him, what ever God's hand and counſel determined before to be done; not as paſſive wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons in the hand of God the Father; but as free, diſtinct agents from God; who could form their own deſigns, and execute them,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:020704_0013_0FB0A63916B6A6C8"/>
in oppoſition to God's deſigns, in carrying on this war. And they firſt conquer him, and then ſacrifice and ſlay him, and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph in their conqueſt. They firſt ſlay him in a <hi>moral ſenſe</hi>—i. e. deprive him of his divine moral character, in the view of his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſubjects.</p>
            <p>The <hi>moral character</hi> of a holy being is his <hi>life</hi> in a moral ſenſe— And the divine character of Chriſt, as moral Governor, ſuffered in an infinite degree when he hung upon the croſs; and his enemies denied his divinity; and challenged his veracity—ſaying, "He ſaid, he was the Son of God"—and, "If thou be the Son of God, come down from the croſs, and we will believe"—and he appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be ſo under the power of his enemies, that he was unable to ſave himſelf, or vindicate his character from theſe reproaches and ſlanders—And ſays, "This is your hour, and the power of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs." And this was all the death it was poſſible for any one to die, in a <hi>moral ſenſe.</hi> It was not poſſible for the Deity to ſuffer in his eſſence: But God the Son could, and did ſuffer to an infinite degree in his divine and moral character as the Governor of the univerſe, in the view of his moral ſubjects, when he hung on the croſs. But all the reproach was wiped off by his reſurrection from the dead, in the view of all that believed that he aroſe. By his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection from the dead, he was declared to be the Son of God with power—and the truth of all he ſaid, concerning his Father's righteouſneſs, and his own divinity, was confirmed.</p>
            <p>This death, which the Son of God ſuffered, in the reproaches caſt on his divine character, when he was obliged to endure the croſs, deſpiſing the ſhame, was the moſt bitter ingredient in all the cup that his Father put into his hand to drink. The proſpect of this overwhelmed his <hi>holy, benevolent</hi> ſoul, in the garden. When God the Son repreſented to his human ſoul, the great evil of ſin, as it caſts ſuch infinite reproach on the divine character as moral Governor, the infinite diſpleaſure of God againſt it, and the dreadful conſequences of it to the damned: This put him into an agony, and cauſed him to ſweat drops of blood, and ſay, "Now is my ſoul troubled;" all out of love to holineſs and benevolence to ſinners, and a ſenſe of their ſin and danger, and his deſire of their ſalvation. And when his enemies reproach him, and inſult him, as if he was forſaken of God, becauſe he was not reſcued from the croſs; "He truſted in God (ſay they) let him deliver him if he would have." This was a very cutting part of his ſufferings, that they ſhould be made the occaſion of ſuch a thought as this, that God had forſaken him, and that there was no help for him in God— This cauſes the human nature of Chriſt to cry to God the Son, in the exerciſe of a moſt ſteadfaſt <hi>ſenſe</hi> of his love and union with him, and continuance of his <hi>truſt</hi> in his power and grace. "My God,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:020704_0014_0FB0A63A63B140B8"/>
my God, why haſt thou forſaken me!" i. e. in the view of my ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, which hath given them occaſion thus to reproach and inſult my confidence in thee—not that the Son had in himſelf any <hi>diſtruſt</hi> of God's power or love and favour; or apprehenſion of any <hi>real</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion or dereliction of his Father. This is not the cry of God the Son to God the Father; but of the human nature to God the Son, who was the God and Father and Creator of his human nature, and was now in an intimate union with it. For God the Son could not in any ſenſe be <hi>forſaken</hi> of God the Father.</p>
            <p>His enemies alſo ſlay his body by crucifying him in a moſt igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious, cruel and diſtreſſing manner; and this being in union with his divine nature—and being put to death out of enmity to his divine and moral character as the <hi>heir</hi> of the kingdom, exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly aggrevate his ſufferings, and the ſin of his crucifiers. And the Son of God <hi>willingly</hi> ſubmits to be thus conquered and ſlain by his enemies, in the exerciſe of the greateſt humility, patience, meekneſs and condeſcention; and is, by them, "Brought as a lamb to the ſlaughter, and as a ſheep dumb before her ſhearers; and ſo he opened not his mouth." He laid down his life of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, though he was not his own executioner, nor did he create the ſin of his crucifiers.</p>
            <p>To this victim and ſacrifice of the Son of God, all the victims and ſacrifices under the law, had reference; and eſpecially the lamb ſlain for a burnt offering. Theſe were all, but ſo many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies and types of this <hi>real</hi> victim and <hi>ſacrifice</hi> of the Son of God incarnate—they all point to this—and are ſuited to direct the mind of the offerer from his own merit and righteouſneſs, to the merit of this victim and ſacrifice for ſin, conquered and ſlain by his enemies; when he was ſubſtituted by God, to make atonement for ſin, by the ſacrifice of himſelf; and did actually ſacrifice his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, life and glory to redeem ours. His ſufferings were vicari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. And wherever a <hi>ſacrifice</hi> is mentioned in ſcripture, it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſes ſuch a victim or conqueſt. The beaſt, before it was ſlain for a ſacrifice, evidently repreſented ſuch a victim, and was ſo call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It was to be conſidered as a conquered foe, lead forth to be ſlain, and patiently ſubmitting to the ſacrificial knife. And when the Lord is ſaid to have a ſacrifice in Bozrah, a conqueſt of enemies is preſuppoſed, and this is a feaſt in triumph of ſuch a conqueſt. The bread and wine brought forth by Melchizedek to Abraham, was a feaſt upon a conqueſt. And the invitation of wiſdom, Prov. ix. 5. "Come eat of my bread, and drink of the wine which I have mingled," is to repreſent a feaſt upon a victim. "Wiſdom hath killed her victims;" as you may ſee ver. 2.</p>
            <p>And the ſacrament of the Lord's ſupper is a feaſt upon the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim, and ſacrifice of the Son of God, by his enemies, by which
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:020704_0015_0FB0A63C0E58AF08"/>
means he obtained a compleat victory over them, and will finally ſacrifice them all, if they ſubmit not in heart to his government. And the Lord's ſupper is deſigned to repreſent this victim and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the Son of God, by his enemies; and the conqueſt he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains over them, in this way. And this wonderful tranſaction we celebrate in that ſacred feaſt! How the bleſſed God, when he ſet forth his Son to be a propitiation, i. e. a victim and ſacrifice, through faith in his blood, to declare his righteouſneſs; was ſo well pleaſed for his righteouſneſs ſake—that he paſſed over belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in the execution of his wrath; and cauſed his diſpleaſure to fall on their enemies; as was the caſe in Egypt, in conſequence of the ſacrifice and ſprinkling of blood. To this the Apoſtle refers, i. Cor. v. 7.8. "For even Chriſt our paſſover is ſacrificed for us; therefore, let us keep the feaſt." And hence Chriſt is called the <hi>Hilaſteerion,</hi> or mercy ſeat, and the propitiation; becauſe he interpoſed himſelf between the wrath of God and curſe of the law, and his people, and renders him propitious. The mercy-ſeat was that which covered the ark of the covenant, in which the tables of the Law were depoſited;—upon this mercy-ſeat God is repreſented as ſetting between the cherubim, that were fixed on each end of this ſeat, ſo as to form a throne with their wings; and this mercy-ſeat, and theſe cherubim, were of pure gold. And as this mercy-ſeat, or propitiation, came between God and the law, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the curſe; ſo Jeſus Chriſt, as our Mediator, by being made a victim, ſacrifice, or a curſe for us, interpoſeth himſelf between God our Judge, and the law by which we ſtand condemned and curſed; and by being made ſuch a curſe, i. e. a victim and ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for us, delivers us from the curſe of the law, and renders God propitious.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> We are to conſider, how his <hi>blood</hi> is a mean of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption to God. By his <hi>blood</hi> here we are to underſtand all he ſuffered while here upon earth, in his divine character, and his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature as the HEIR of the kingdom and moral Governor of the univerſe. The <hi>blood</hi> ſignifies the <hi>life</hi>; and in taking away his divine character as moral Governor, they took away his liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, his <hi>life</hi> and glory. And had not this been taken away, the ſhedding his blood, and the ſufferings he endured in his human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, would have been of no avail in making atonement for ſin.— The infinite evil of ſin, and the righteouſneſs of God, would not have been declared, nor his <hi>infinite wrath</hi> and <hi>diſpleaſure</hi> againſt ſin been manifeſted, or his love to holineſs diſplayed by his death, or adequate ſatisfaction made.</p>
            <p>And the way in which the blood of Chriſt is a mean of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption to God, is in that, hereby God's righteouſneſs is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted and declared to all that have ſaith in his blood, as the life of
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:020704_0016_0FB0A63DB36BAA70"/>
the Son of God taken away for ſin: And that ſin is both the <hi>procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi> and <hi>inſtrumental</hi> cauſe of his death. The righteouſneſs of God hath been declared by the law, as hath been ſhewn, and it hath been witneſſed by the prophets.</p>
            <p>And the Son of God declared, by his preaching, the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God's character, law and government. This was the grand theme of his preaching, as a teacher ſent from God,—and he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed his miſſion by miracles—and in him all the prophecies of the old teſtament were accompliſhed. And he declared the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of the law, by his yielding a ſinleſs obedience to it, in human nature, to all that believed in his divinity: For ſurely that muſt be a holy, righteous and good law, to which the Son of God himſelf yields a perfect and ſinleſs obedience. Whoever believes his divinity, will not doubt of the righteouſneſs of the law, to which he paid ſuch great reſpect.</p>
            <p>But this righteouſneſs of God, which was witneſſed by the law and the prophets, and which was confirmed by the preaching and obedience of our Saviour—is manifeſted without the law, by this victim and ſacrifice, in a more conſpicuous and convincing manner to all that believe in Chriſt. Every branch of God's righteouſneſs is declared to all that ſhall be convinced, that this was the blood of the Son of God, a perſon of infinite dignity and merit. As all ſhall be convinced of it, either in this world for their ſalvation, or at the day of judgment for their eternal condemnation and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment—Then both men and devils ſhall be convinced of this truth, by the blood of Chriſt, that the judgment of God, in condemning ſinners to eternal death, for their ſin and diſobedience, is accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to truth and righteouſneſs. By this mean the infinite <hi>benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence</hi> of God is declared; which is one very important branch of his righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>The benevolence of God, was manifeſted in the law (as hath been ſhewn) but how much more fully manifeſted in the blood of Chriſt? For God not to ſpare his ſon, infinitely dear to him, but to ſubſtitute him to make ſatisfaction for ſin, as our ſurety, and deliver him up for us all—for ſinners, for enemies, and when we as ſheep were gone aſtray, to lay on him the iniquities of us all; to impute to him that immenſe debt we owed to divine juſtice, that he might ſatisfy for it—that it ſhould pleaſe the Father to bruiſe him and put him to grief, by delivering him up out of his boſom, into the hands of his enemies, to be wounded for our tranſgreſſions, and bruiſed for our iniquities, when the chaſtizement of our peace was on him, that by his ſtripes we might be healed—that he ſhould wake up the malice and rage of his enemies againſt him, by the manifeſtation of truth to their conſciences, ſaying, "Awake, O ſword, againſt my ſhepherd, againſt the man that is my fellow"—
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:020704_0017_0FB0A63F090791B8"/>
what great benevolence muſt it manifeſt! For though God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was not himſelf the executioner, or inflictor of any ſufferings on his Son, by his decree, efficiency or command—nor was the Son ever the object or victim of his Father's wrath, but always the object of his infinite love, under his greateſt ſufferings; yet, <hi>in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering him up into the hands of his enemies,</hi> to be made a victim and ſacrifice by them for the cauſe of truth, meekneſs and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, the Father ſignified his pleaſure that he ſhould ſuffer in this manner, as ſully as if he had himſelf inflicted theſe ſufferings on his Son: So that it may with great propriety be ſaid, that it <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed</hi> the Father to bruiſe him, and put him to grief, "and we eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teemed him ſtricken and ſmitten of God;"—for his enemies could have done nothing, unleſs it had been given them from above, and the Father and the Son had put him in their power: And therefore his ſuffering in this manner is a wonderful proof and manifeſtation of the love of God, who ſet him forth to be a propitiation for ſin.</p>
            <p>The benevolence or love of God, is not the effect, but the cauſe of Chriſt's coming into the world, and ſuffering what he did in it. Chriſt did not die to purchaſe the love of God to ſinners, or to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline him to love them, and exerciſe mercy and grace to them, but to open the way for God freely to exerciſe his grace to ſinners, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtently with his juſtice. "God ſo loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son." See John iii. 16.17. And the Apoſtle John ſpeaks of it, as being as great an expreſſion and proof of God's love, and benevolence, as if God had laid down his own life. See i. John iii. 16. "Hereby perceive we the love of God, becauſe HE laid down his life for us." The character of any being is his life in a <hi>moral ſenſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No being, but one of infinite benevolence, would part with a ſon ſo dear to him, and equal to himſelf, in every divine perfection, and deliver him up into the hands of his enemies, to be treated by them in ſuch an ignominious, cruel manner, for the ſake of opening a way for the ſalvation of rebellious ſinners. Had God ſent his Son merely to yield obedience to his holy law, without requiring any ſufferings, his love to ſinners would not have appeared ſo great; becauſe this would have been eaſy, and honourable, and no ſelf-denial would have been exerciſed.</p>
            <p>And the divine benevolence, is manifeſted not only in God's ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Son to bear our ſins, and ſuffer in our room and ſtead; but alſo in the Son's conſenting to become a ſervant, and freely offer up himſelf, and ſubmit to ſuch great humiliation and ſufferings, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to work out our redemption. His great love and benevolence to ſinners—his relation to them, and the deſire he had of their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation—was the occaſion of all that overwhelming diſtreſs and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of his ſoul, that great agony and bloody ſweat he endured in
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:020704_0018_0FB0A6406EDC1FD0"/>
the garden, when he cried out, "What ſhall I ſay! Father deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver me from this hour?" (No) 'For this cauſe came I to this hour:' (But this I will ſay) "Father glorify thy name." Here was the travel of his ſoul in bringing many ſons to glory. He felt for ſinners the evil of ſin, its turpitude and guilt, and the diſpleaſure of God againſt <hi>them</hi> on account of ſin, more than they could feel for themſelves, by reaſon of his great love to them. No tender and indulgent parent could feel ſo much for a beloved child, when juſtly expoſed to ſuffer a moſt ſhameful, dreadful death from the hand of juſtice, as Chriſt now felt for ſinners; as they were polluted, guilty and juſtly expoſed to the wrath and vengeance of Almighty God. And thus by ſympathy, as well as otherwiſe, he bore our ſins; when he made <hi>ſatifaction for them.</hi> And what great love and benevolence to ſinners muſt it argue, for the Son of God to engage in ſuch a war, with all the powers of earth and hell for the ſake of redeeming ſinners, enemies, when he knew it would coſt him his liberty, life and glory! "Greater love hath no man, than that a man lay down his life for his friend; but God hath commended his love to us, that while we were enemies Chriſt died for us."</p>
            <p>And the <hi>inflexible juſtice</hi> of God (which is another branch of his righteouſneſs) is manifeſted and declared, in that God will not pardon, juſtify and releaſe the ſinner from the puniſhment, unleſs a ſatisfaction be made by the ſurety, adequate to the damages he hath ſuſtained by ſin, in the honour of his character and the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of his kingdom, as moral governour.</p>
            <p>And his <hi>truth</hi> expreſſed in the threatening, is declared to be <hi>inviolable</hi> in that no ſinner can be pardoned and juſtified on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of this ſatisfaction, 'till he is united to the Redeemer by faith in his blood, and ſo is intereſted in his merit. And then God can exerciſe his grace freely in pardoning and juſtifying the ſinner, conſiſtent with his juſtice, as you may ſee Rom. iii. 23, 24, 25, 26. "For all have ſinned, come ſhort of the glory of God; being juſtified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Chriſt Jeſus: whom God hath ſet forth to be a propitiation thro' faith in his blood, to <hi>declare his righteouſneſs</hi> for the remiſſion of ſins—that he might be juſt, and the juſtifier of him that believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in Jeſus." And by this law of faith all boaſting is excluded, becauſe the believer receives the righteouſneſs by which he is juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by <hi>faith alone</hi>: "It is by faith that it might be by grace"</p>
            <p>And God the Son, by thus declaring his Father's righteouſneſs in being made a propitiation (i. e. a victim and ſacrifice) for ſin hath judged, condemned, conquered and deſtroyed all God's ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; and decided the grand moral controverſy; and layed a ſure foundation to put an eternal end to the war. By this mean <hi>ſin,</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:020704_0019_0FB0A6422FCCADD8"/>
that implacable enemy to God and his moral kingdom, is condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and the dominion and power of it deſtroyed. Every one that really believes that Chriſt was the Son of God, muſt be convinced, by his death, that ſin is an infinite evil in its nature and tendency— that it is pregnant with moral enmity to God, and miſchief to his moral kingdom; and would dethrone God, and deſtroy him as moral governor, and ruin his kingdom, if it had ſufficient power on its ſide. The devil knew that Chriſt was the holy one of God, that he was the <hi>heir</hi> of the kingdom, and that he came to be the Saviour of the world, and this was his motive in putting him to death: and it was in the devil's kingdom, by his ſubjects, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his influence that the Lord of Life and Glory was crucified. See Rev. xi. 8. And ſin, or the temper of the devil, and his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to oppoſe God and his righteouſneſs, was never acted out in perſecuting the ſaints, or in ſlaying the prophets, or at any other time, as it was in the crucifixion of the Son at God. Satan and his ſubject ſay, "This is the <hi>heir,</hi> come let us kill him and ſeize on the inheritance." Now doth not this evidently ſhow ſin to be an infinite evil? and conſequently that it is a holy, juſt and good law, that threatens it with an infinite or endleſs puniſhment, in miſerably deſtroying Satan's kingdom and ſubjects.</p>
            <p>And in the death of Chriſt the <hi>devil,</hi> as the prince of this world, is judged, condemned, conquered and deſtroyed in a moral ſenſe. See John xii. 31, 32, and xvi. 11. And how this is effected by the death of Chriſt, appears in that ancient prediction of this war, Gen. iii. 15. "It ſhall bruiſe thy head, and thou ſhall bruiſe his heel." Here it is foretold how the devil, by making the Son of God, in human nature, his victim and ſacrifice for a time, bruiſed Chriſt's heel; and by conquering and ſlaying Chriſt, the ſeed of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, the devil, deſtroyed himſelf in a moral ſenſe. Jeſus Chriſt by ſubmitting to be conquered and ſlain in the devil's kingdom broke the ſerpent's head, laid open all his wicked deſigns againſt the character and kingdom of God; and deſtroyed Satan's power and dominion over the hearts of men. The Son of God by his death upon the croſs, and his reſurrection from the dead, conquered the devil, expoſed him openly, and diſarmed him at once, of all three of his weapons, the curſe of the law, the ſtrength of ſin, and the power of death; and led him at his chariot wheels, as a victim and captive.

               </gap>. ii. 5. And thus he deſtroyed him that had the power of death; and delivers thoſe who through fear of death were all their life time ſubject to bondage. And Samſon, in this, was a lively type of Chriſt: by being conquered himſelf, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered the enemies of his people; and by being ſlain he ſlew them.

               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:020704_0020_0FB0A643DED77E18"/>And the Son of God carried on this war in a manner diverſe from all others, and of which the devil was not aware. "For every battle of the warrior is with confuſed noiſe and garments rolled in blood, but this ſhall be with burning and fuel of fire—" without any noiſe or violence; and yet effectual to deſtroy his enemies, See Iſa. ii. 5.</p>
            <p>"He did not cry nor ſtrive, neither did any man hear his voice in the ſtreet—he did not break the bruiſed reed nor quench the ſmoaking flax, 'till he brought forth judgment unto victory." See Iſa. xl. 1, 2. compared with Mat. xii. 17, 18.</p>
            <p>And in Iſa. lxiii. we have a remarkable prophecy of this war, and how it was decided, and all his enemies ſlain—and a feaſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a victim or ſacrifice prepared in Bozrah. Here the Son of God appears in dyed garments, red with his own blood firſt, and then the blood of his enemies is ſprinkled upon his garments, and he ſtains all his raiment, by treading them down in his anger and trampling them in his fury<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to recompence them for their iniquities, and work out redemption for his people.</p>
            <p>And Pſal. xlv. we have a prediction of this battle and conqueſt, and the conqueror returning with the ſpoils of his enemies—his garments ſmelling of myrrh, and aloes and caſſia. And Pſal. cx. contains a clear prophecy of this battle and the victory obtained.</p>
            <p>And we have an account of the proſecution of this ſame battle after the controverſy was decided on the croſs. And now it is carried on by the <hi>truths</hi> manifeſted by this tranſaction, See Rev. vi. 2. "And I ſaw, and behold a white horſe, and he that ſat on him had a bow; and a crown was given unto him; and he went forth conquering and to conquer." This white horſe repreſents the goſpel. He that ſat on him the Son of God, in the power of his ſpirit; the bow the word of truth; and the arrows the truths of the goſpel exhibited in the croſs: And the conqueſts he makes are ſouls converted by his word and ſpirit of truth.</p>
            <p>And Rev. xix. We have an account of the deſtruction he makes by his word and ſpirit of truth, of all his implacable and incurable enemies; who will not ſubmit to the ſceptre of his grace. The battle here deſcribed is a deciſive one; and the moſt bloody and awful battle that ever was or will be fought: and this is of a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al kind. The <hi>ſword</hi> by which this mighty ſacrifice of God's ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies is made, is the <hi>word</hi> of truth, which proceedeth out of the <hi>mouth</hi> of him that ſat upon the horſe. And all the ſpirits are called to feed on theſe victims or ſacrifices; the fleſh of kings and captains and mighty men, and all men both free and bond, ſmall and great. And all this victim and ſacrifice is made by virtue and efficacy of the blood of the Lamb of God ſhed upon the croſs by his enemies, when he was by them made a victim and ſacrifice in the devil's
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:020704_0021_0FB0A64519D0B808"/>
kingdom; that great city, ſpiritually called Sodom and Egypt, where our Lord was crucified, See Rev. xi. 8. And all the angels and ſaints in heaven are called to this ſacrifice made by Chriſt of God's enemies; and to feaſt on theſe victims. And this feaſt conſiſts in a <hi>diſplay of the vindictive juſtice of God,</hi> in the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous judgment executed on his obſtinate and finally impenitent and implacable enemies, which will be a feaſt to holy beings in heaven to all eternity.</p>
            <p>The deſign of the Son of God's coming into this world, and being made a victim and ſacrifice in the devil's kingdom, was not only to open a way for God to diſplay his free and ſovereign grace, in the ſalvation of all that believe in him, but alſo that he may diſplay his wrath and vindictive vengeance in executing judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon devils, and upon all among the children of men that ſhall obſtinately reject his Son, and finally continue in ſin and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief. And in what a ſtriking light muſt the infinite diſpleaſure of God againſt ſin, and ſinners, and his love of righteouſneſs, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in this view of the matter! For God to deliver up his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely dear and moſt glorious Son to engage in ſuch a hazardous and bloody war, for the cauſe of condemning ſin, and puniſhing ſinners, according to their demerit! This ſhews how determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God is to ſupport the honour of his law by executing the threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on ſinners. Had we ſeen eternity run through, and the threatening executed according to the truth and juſtice of it, it could not afford a more convincing proof of the juſtice and truth of the Legiſlator; and his <hi>diſpoſition</hi> and <hi>determination</hi> to execute the threatening, notwithſtanding his infinite benevolence to his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, than is now manifeſted to every believer in the death of Chriſt, and the deſign of it.

That ſin, under the influence of which, the Lord of Life and Glory was ſlain, by the devil and his agents, muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear an infinite evil: And the wrath of God and the Lamb againſt it, muſt appear moſt awful; ſince God delivered up his Son, and did not ſpare him: and the Son ha<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

            <p>O, who can ſtand before their indignation, or eſcape their wrath! What can expreſs God's infinite hatred of ſin more clearly, than his being at ſuch an infinite expence, to deliver mankind from the guilt, power and conſequences of it; and to execute his wrath and diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure upon ſinners!

               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We are to ſhow, wherein the worthineſs or merit of the Son of God doth conſiſt. And the worthineſs or merit of the Son of God conſiſts in three things,—</p>
            <p>Firſt, in the dignity of his perſon—Secondly, in the honour brought to God, and the good brought to his moral kingdom—And, thirdly, the means and method by which he procured this honour, and obtained this good.— And all theſe being conſidered, will make it appear, that the worthineſs and merit of the Son of God is infinite—and that the <hi>value</hi> God the Father hath received of him is <hi>infinite</hi>—and it was procured and obtained at an infinite price.— The infinite dignity of the Son of God, conſiſts in his being God equal with the Father, and independent on his Father's <hi>will</hi> or <hi>act</hi> for his exiſtence or happineſs; being in himſelf ſelf-exiſtent, ſelf-ſufficient and independent, and poſſeſſed of every divine perfection. And he brought infinite honour to God and good to his kingdom, by declaring his righteouſneſs and executing judgement on his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. And in order to procure and obtain theſe, he ſacrificed his own liberty, life and glory.

            <p>Now this <hi>merit</hi> of Chriſt was the <hi>price</hi> of our redemption; by this our ranſom was paid; and hence we are ſaid to be <hi>bought</hi> with a <hi>price</hi>; "and redeemed, not by corruptible things, ſuch as ſilver and gold, but with the <hi>precious blood</hi> of Chriſt; as of a Lamb with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blemiſh, and without ſpot. See 1 Pet. i. 18.19.</p>
            <p>We were led captive by ſatan, and have loſt our liberty, life and inheritance—and this <hi>merit</hi> of the Son of God is the <hi>price</hi> of our redemption—and in this ſenſe, he may be ſaid to redeem us to God by his blood.</p>
            <p>And the other ſenſe, in which his blood is the mean of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption is, as by the truths manifeſted in his croſs, attended by the holy ſpirit, ſin is condemned, and the power of ſatan in the ſoul deſtroyed, by convictions of ſin, and in our converſion to God; and ſo we are <hi>reconciled</hi> to God, to his character, law and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the heart is gained.</p>
            <p>The Son of God, by his blood, hath not only paid the <hi>price</hi> of our <hi>ranſom</hi>; but made an infinite <hi>purchaſe</hi> for believers by an equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent. He hath purchaſed the holy ſpirit in all its gifts and graces —and the kingdom of heaven in all its glory and felicity.</p>

               <head>IMPROVEMENT.</head>
               <p>BEFORE we proceed to the next head of this diſcourſe, we ſhall make the following inferences from what hath been ſaid—</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="unknown:020704_0023_0FB0A647EEE0A410"/>Firſt, From what hath been ſaid upon the origin of moral evil, we may learn, that God is in no ſenſe the maker, creator, or au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of that <hi>mode</hi> of exerciſe called ſin, or moral evil, either by his decrees, efficiency, commands, or by tempting his creatures with evil. God cannot be the creator or author of ſin, <hi>in forming</hi> his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees in eternity, becauſe this implies no <hi>cauſeality</hi> in them—as hath been ſhewn. He cannot be the maker or author of ſin by his <hi>efficiency,</hi> or <hi>executing</hi> his decrees in time, becauſe this is to deſtroy the idea of <hi>moral</hi> government; as it ſuppoſes that God governs the <hi>moral</hi> world as he doth the <hi>material</hi> world, without inſtructions or motives, or any <hi>moral law</hi>: And that the <hi>obliquity</hi> or <hi>retrograde</hi> motion of a <hi>planet</hi> is as <hi>ſinful</hi> as the <hi>tranſgreſſion</hi> of a <hi>moral agent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and that <hi>moral agents</hi> are no more blame-worthy or <hi>accountable</hi> for their <hi>exerciſes,</hi> than a <hi>machine</hi> for <hi>its motions.</hi> Sin is enmity againſt God; and can God <hi>create</hi> enmity and oppoſition, and rebellion to himſelf? Sin is <hi>confuſion</hi> and war in God's kingdom; but God is not the <hi>author</hi> of <hi>confuſion</hi> and war, but of peace. 1 Cor. xiv. 33. And ſin could not poſſibly exiſt before there was a <hi>creature imperfect</hi> in knowledge, and ſo liable to conceive or form error in his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and <hi>mutable</hi> in his nature and ſo liable to change in his preceptions and choice. And when God had created the heavens and the earth, and all their numerous hoſts, upon the firſt ſix days, no ſin was then created, nor did exiſt among all God's works; for they were all very good. But God created angels and men free moral agents, but <hi>imperfect</hi> in their knowledge and <hi>mutable</hi> in their nature, and ſo <hi>liable</hi> to form <hi>error</hi> in their underſtandings and <hi>ſin</hi> in their hearts. And they could not be created otherwiſe than im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect and mutable. And he introduces his firſt begotten Son, (i. e. one that was of the ſame nature and eſſence, and <hi>likeneſs</hi> in all perfections with himſelf, and infinitely near and dear to him, and heir of all things, and worthy of equal honour with himſelf) with this command—Let all the angels of God worſhip him!—Some of the angels refuſed to put an <hi>implicit</hi> faith in God's word, and yield an <hi>implicit</hi> obedience to his commands, and ſo became tranſgreſſors of a <hi>known</hi> command of their infinitely wiſe and benevolent Creator. And in conſequence of tranſgreſſion, they became ſinners, and were by <hi>ſin transformed</hi> into devils, and filled with error, pride and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to God and holineſs. God never made a <hi>ſin</hi> or a <hi>devil</hi>—God made thoſe who are now <hi>devils, holy angels,</hi> in his own moral image; but <hi>they made</hi> ſin, by tranſgreſſion, and ſo <hi>made themſelves devils.</hi> And the ſcripture no where tells us, that ſin is the <hi>work</hi> or creature of <hi>God,</hi> but expreſsly tells us that it is the <hi>work</hi> of the devil. See John viii. 44. "The devil was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, becauſe there is no truth in him. When he ſpeaketh <hi>a lie,</hi> be ſpeaketh of his <hi>own</hi>; for he is a liar, and the <hi>father of it."</hi> And the devil is in this ſenſe the <hi>father</hi> of error, ſin
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:020704_0024_0FB0A6495FE65220"/>
and ſinners. And he that <hi>maketh</hi> ſin is of the devil; for the devil ſinneth from the beginning. For this purpoſe the Son of God was manifeſted, that he might deſtroy the <hi>works</hi> of the devil." But if <hi>error</hi> and <hi>ſin</hi> are the <hi>works</hi> of God, <hi>created</hi> by him; then we ſhould read thus—" For this purpoſe the Son of God was manifeſted, that he might deſtroy the <hi>works of God</hi>—works which God <hi>created</hi> and <hi>made:"</hi> but who doth not ſee the <hi>blaſphemy</hi> of this? (But this is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Home's ideal ſcheme.)</p>
               <p>And as God did not make or create ſin in <hi>forming</hi> or executing his decrees, or by his immediate efficiency; ſo neither is he the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of it by his <hi>commands,</hi> or by <hi>tempting</hi> his creatures with evil. "Out of the <hi>mouth</hi> of the Moſt High doth not <hi>evil</hi> and good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed." See Lam. iii. 38. "Let no man ſay, when he is tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted, neither tempteth he any man, with evil." "But every good gift, and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights," &amp;c. See James i. 13.17 All <hi>error</hi> and <hi>ſin</hi> or <hi>wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> is from the devil, the father of <hi>darkneſs</hi>; and all <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> is from God, the <hi>Father of lights.</hi> If God created the ſin and enmity of wicked men and devils, and all their rebellion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he muſt carry on <hi>both ſides</hi> of the war, and act in direct <hi>oppoſition</hi> to himſelf; and if he is the <hi>author,</hi> he can manifeſt no glory of vindic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive juſtice in <hi>puniſhing</hi> the ſinner for it. God permits ſin, and overrules it for his own glory. But God made angels and men holy and upright—and he was not <hi>acceſſary</hi> to their original ſin or apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. He did not create their ſin by his decree or efficiency; nor did he <hi>command them to ſin</hi>—nor did he induce or incline them to ſin by tempting them with evil—nor did he <hi>corrupt</hi> their <hi>moral prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,</hi> or withdraw or withhold from them, that fell, any divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences that were neceſſary to their ſtanding, (which he granted to thoſe that ſtood) until they did wilfully tranſgreſs a <hi>known,</hi> poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive command. The angels might take the Son of God to be a creature; and for that reaſon refuſe to pay divine worſhip to him; but this was to ſet up their <hi>own reaſon</hi> in oppoſition to an <hi>known, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs command</hi> of God, which is ſubverſive of all moral government. And man, under the influence of ſatan, <hi>diſbelieved</hi> the threatening, and ſo was embolden to tranſgreſs. But this was not becauſe God withdrew or withheld the holy ſpirit or any internal divine influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from them, before they tranſgreſſed. But immediately upon tranſgreſſion, all divine favour and influences of the holy ſpirit were withdrawn in a <hi>judicial</hi> way; and then the <hi>moral principle</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came <hi>totally corrupt.</hi> But God hath been pleaſed, in his ſovereign grace, to make proviſion for the reſtoration of mankind, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey to them the holy ſpirit by the revelation of the goſpel; ſo that all who will <hi>hear</hi> and <hi>underſtand</hi> the goſpel, and <hi>receive</hi> the truths of it by faith and love, may be ſaved: and if they do not hear and
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:020704_0025_0FB0A64E6FBEB3B8"/>
underſtand, &amp;c. they will be left without excuſe, if they enjoy the <hi>means</hi> of knowledge and grace.—And ſhould any enquire, why did not <hi>all</hi> the angels tranſgreſs, if they all were equal as to divine influences?—To this I anſwer, it is probable ſome waited till they ſaw the effect of apoſtacy in others before they refuſed obedience; and this opened their eyes and prevented their fall, and confirmed them in obedience. And it is probable, that if Adam had waited 'till he ſaw the effect of tranſgreſſion in Eve, and the angels that ſinned, he never would have tranſgreſſed, but been confirmed in holineſs, as the ſaints will in heaven, to all eternity, by the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of ſinners in hell. This is perfectly conſiſtent with <hi>moral</hi> government.</p>
               <p>Second, We may infer from what hath been ſaid upon redemption, that thoſe do greatly err, who ſay, that the atonement and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction made by Chriſt, conſiſts only in his <hi>obedience</hi> to the moral law, and that he did not die <hi>for our ſins,</hi> or in our room and ſtead; but only for our ſakes, or for our good and benefit, to ſet us a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect example of patience and ſubmiſſion under ſufferings. But if Jeſus Chriſt was made a propitiation for ſin; if he was ſlain for us as our ſacrifice; if he offered up himſelf to be a victim and ſacrifice in order to declare God's righteouſneſs, and conquer and deſtroy his enemies, that by the merit of his blood, the <hi>price</hi> of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption might be paid, before our ſins could be remitted conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with the juſtice of God—if he died, not only <hi>by</hi> the ſins of men, but <hi>for</hi> them: and his <hi>death</hi> is to be conſidered, not merely as a pledge to aſſure us of the mercy of God, but as a real, proper vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim and ſacrifice, wherein the legal victims and ſacrifices had their final accompliſhment; then he muſt have died in our room, and as ſubſtituted in our place, to diſcharge our <hi>immenſe debt</hi> to juſtice, which we contracted by our rebellion. The ends for which atone-were deſigned, could not have been anſwered by <hi>mere obedience,</hi> (as hath been ſhewn) The infinite evil of ſin, and the infinite diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God againſt it; and his diſpoſition and determination to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh it to all eternity; and the love of God and Chriſt to ſinners, and many other important truths, could not have been expreſſed by the <hi>mere obedience</hi> of an holy being to a holy law. And unleſs theſe truths had been manifeſted, ſin could not have been pardoned, or one ſinner juſtified in the ſight of God, conſiſtent with his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs as moral Governor: So, true it is, that, "Without ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of blood, there can be no remiſſion." The blood of Chriſt (not typical blood) doth truly and properly atone for, and take away ſin. He died for our ſins, as our ſubſtitute, in our ſtead, as the ſacrifices under the law, did for the ſins, and in the ſtead of the offenders.</p>
               <p>Third, We may infer, that there is a trinity of perſons in the God-head. This is a doctrine denied by many at this day, becauſe
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:020704_0026_0FB0A65029B4AA90"/>
they cannot ſee its conſiſtency with reaſon. The being and perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of one God, may be fully proved from the light of nature; but the <hi>trinity</hi> of perſons or agents in the divine eſſence, depends upon <hi>immediate revelation</hi> for its proof. And this doctrine is often repreſented as a ſpeculative point, of no great importance, whether it be believed or not: ſo myſterious and curious that it had better be let alone. But it is evident that it enters into our ſalvation in all its parts—into all the doctrines of the goſpel, and into the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of the ſaints. As ſoon as ever a man is convinced of his ſinful and miſerable ſtate by nature, he ſees that there is a Divine Perſon offended, and there needs another Divine Perſon to make ſatisfaction for his offences, and a third to ſanctify him.</p>
               <p>And it is no more repugnant to reaſon, that three diſtinct agents ſhould depend for their exiſtence upon one eſſence; and exiſt eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and neceſſarily in one eſſence—than that one infinite agent ſhould exiſt eternally and neceſſarily without any cauſe of his exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; or that thouſands of diſtinct agents ſhould depend on one will (the will of God) for their exiſtence. And when the ſecond perſon in the ſacred trinity is called a SON, <hi>an only begotten or firſt born</hi> SON, theſe, I take, to be figurative expreſſions, not to expreſs his <hi>work</hi> or <hi>office,</hi> but to denote his being of one and the ſame <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>eſſence</hi> with the Father, the expreſs <hi>likeneſs</hi> of his perſon, infinitely dear to him, and the <hi>heir</hi> of all things equally with the Father; as children are of the ſame nature and image of their earthly parents, and ſo exceedingly dear to them, and <hi>heirs,</hi> by birth, to their eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates. But theſe epithets are not deſigned, when applied to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond perſon in the Godhead, to expreſs any <hi>priority</hi> or <hi>ſuperiority</hi> in the Father, or any will or act of the Father in <hi>generating</hi> or gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving exiſtence to the Son; as if the Son depended on the <hi>will</hi> or <hi>act</hi> of the Father for his exiſtence: For <hi>eternal generation</hi> or <hi>creation</hi> is a <hi>ſoleciſm</hi> in ſpeech.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paraclet<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s,</hi> or comforter, denotes <hi>work</hi> or <hi>office</hi> in the third per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the trinity—and <hi>ſervant,</hi> Mediator, Surety, <hi>Advocate,</hi> &amp;c. denote <hi>work</hi> or <hi>office</hi> in the ſecond perſon: but <hi>Father, Son</hi> or <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> are not deſigned to expreſs <hi>work</hi> or <hi>office,</hi> but nature, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, &amp;c. And although God the Son took on himſelf the form of a ſervant, and engaged in the office of a Mediator, and became obedient to the Father in the covenant of redemption, even to the death; yet he was a <hi>Son</hi> by <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>eſſence,</hi> and <hi>heir</hi> of all things, and ſo equal with the Father, and the creator of all things, both in heaven and on earth. And where he is called the <hi>protokotos,</hi> ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered <hi>firſt born</hi> of every creature; it ſhould have been rendered firſt <hi>progenitor</hi> of every creature; "for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth, viſible and inviſible. And he is before all things, and by him all things conſiſt." See Col. i. 15.16.17. And not in reſpect to his office, but in reſpect to his
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:020704_0027_0FB0A651A0B2D1B0"/>
nature, eſſence, heirſhip, likeneſs and dearneſs to the Father, he is called a Son. But God doth not depend on his own <hi>will</hi> for his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence, nor on the <hi>will</hi> of any other being, becauſe his exiſtence is <hi>neceſſary</hi> and <hi>eternal</hi>; nor do either of the perſons in the ſacred tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity depend on their own <hi>will,</hi> or the <hi>will</hi> or <hi>act</hi> of each other, for their exiſtence; but all exiſt <hi>eternally</hi> and <hi>neceſſarily,</hi> in one and the ſame eſſence; though their agency and operations are diſtinct, free and limited by their wiſdom and will.</p>
               <p>And that there is an eternal plurality of perſons in the Godhead, ſeems to be neceſſarily implied in the perfection of their happineſs; for happineſs lies not in ſolitude, but in ſociety—and the ſacred tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity muſt have enjoyed infinite delight, communion, complacency and happineſs in themſelves, before any creature exiſted. See Prov. viii. 30. And had not our Redeemer been God, a perſon of infinite dignity and merit, and under no previous obligation to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey, he could not have merited any thing at the hand of God.</p>
               <p>No mere creature, by any thing he can do or ſuffer, can merit of God by way of condignity, becauſe he owes his all to him, and can render nothing to God, but what he firſt received from him; and he can never pay his own debt, for his exiſtence and happineſs, be he ever ſo holy and obedient. The honour he brings to God, and the good he does to his moral kingdom, is ſmall in compariſon of the benefits he receives from God—and when once he hath ſinned, the merit of all the creatures in the univerſe could not make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends for the diſhonour done to God's character by one ſin: For God could not, conſiſtent with his juſtice, pardon one ſin for a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of <hi>congruity,</hi> or <hi>out of reſpect to the tried virtue and obedience</hi> of all created beings; to do it would be an infinite reproach to his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</p>
               <p>And none but one of infinite perfections could conquer and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due ſatan, and triumph over all the powers of earth and hell, as the Son of God hath done, in order to make atonement; and who but a God could execute the office of a Redeemer? God's own arm brought ſalvation! And the ſcripture is abundant in the proof of this doctrine of a trinity.</p>
               <p>Fourth. We infer that Jeſus Chriſt, the Son of God, was well qualified for this work.—Jeſus Chriſt was one to whom the rights of the Deity muſt be exceeding dear; ſo that he upon no account would ſee them violated in the leaſt degree; for he was himſelf God; and an holy God would truſt no other in this affair, in which his own glory was ſo nearly concerned. And he was a perſon of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite dignity and merit, and none but ſuch an one could make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement for ſin. And he had a ſincere and ardent love for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and a great deſire for their ſalvation, ſo that he was willing to take their deſtruction upon himſelf, and expend as much of his own intereſt and happineſs for their ſakes, as was equivalent to the whoſe of theirs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="unknown:020704_0028_0FB0A653423B8498"/>And how wonderful is this love and grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt to ſinners! Conſider God the Son as ſelf-exiſtent and independent on all his creatures for his happineſs, but <hi>rich</hi> in all the perfections and glories of the Deity—and what great love muſt that be, that could move him to pay ſuch regard to his creatures! Conſider the world ſunk in ſin, without any good deſert, but deſerving everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing puniſhment; and what wonderful love muſt that be, that could move Him to have compaſſion upon ſuch a world, ſo as to lay aſide the robes of his glory and become <hi>poor,</hi> aſſume human nature into a perſonal union with his divine, appear in our world, now become the ſeat of the devil's kingdom! And conſent to become a victim and ſacrifice—be deprived of his liberty, life and glory, for the ſake of redeeming ſinners! It was a great thing for Him to create this world for our reſidence—and beſtow upon us the bounties of his providence continually, with ſuch a liberal hand! but what is it to ſpeak an all-creating word for our exiſtence, and to open his all-liberal hand for our ſupport, in compariſon of ſhedding the blood of his heart for our redemption!</p>
               <p>Well may you that are the children of God cry out, "Behold what manner of love the Father hath beſtowed on us!"</p>
               <p>O let the love of Chriſt conſtrain you to live not to yourſelves but to Him that hath loved you and died for you.</p>

            <p n="3">III. Conſider the honours conferred on him as the reward of his merit.</p>
            <p>The two firſt of theſe propoſitions have been conſidered.—We have ſhewn, that our redemption implies, that we are in a ſtate of bondage—and the Son of God hath delivered us from that ſtate. By our ſin and rebellion, we have reproached the character of God as moral Governor, and ſo have forfeited his favour, and our liberty, life and inheritance; and have incurred his diſpleaſure and the curſe of the law, which is a confirmed ſtate of ſin and miſery, under the wrath of God forever. We have revolted from God, and are in the kingdom of the devil, and led captive by him. And we are unable of ourſelves to pay the <hi>price</hi> of our redemption by mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good the damages God hath received or ſuſtained by ſin, in the honour of his character, as moral Governour, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are liable to ſuffer the penalty to all eternity; and we have neither inclination nor power to deliver ourſelves from the <hi>power</hi> of ſin and the <hi>tyranny</hi> of ſatan. And from this ſtate of guilt and corruption the Son of God redeems us. And in accompliſhing this work God the Son, as a divine agent, equal with God the Father, being ſelf-exiſtent, ſelf-ſufficient and independent on the <hi>will</hi> of God the Father for his exiſtence or happineſs, and unſubordinate to him, freely took on himſelf the office of a Mediator and Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and entered into a covenant of redemption. And by fulfilling
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:020704_0030_0FB0A656DC303F60"/>
the conditions of that covenant, in the execution of the offices of Prophet, Prieſt, and King, as God's ſervant and our Redeemer, hath procured an infinite, inexhauſtible fountain of merit with the Godhead, by vindicating, and bringing infinite honour to the character of God, as moral Governor, and ſo infinite good to his moral kingdom. In this affair God the Father hath received more in <hi>value,</hi> by the righteouſneſs of his Son, than he could have received by the perfect ſervice of angels, had they never ſinned, or by inflicting the penalty of the law on devils and all mankind, for ſin, to all eternity.— His benevolence, his wiſdom, his law, his juſtice, his truth, and all his perfections are manifeſted, and proved in a more illuſtrious manner.—So that God will loſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the honour of his character, law or government, by the ſin of angels or men—or by diſpenſing pardons freely to ſinners through the merit and righteouſneſs of his Son.</p>
            <p>But, the Son of God not only redeems his choſen people, by pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>price</hi> of their ranſom to God; but, by the <hi>power</hi> of thoſe truths, manifeſted by his croſs, accompanied with the influences of his ſpirit, he redeems them from the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>ſin,</hi> and <hi>tyranny</hi> of <hi>ſatan.</hi>

We proceed to conſider, the honours conferred on our Redeemer, as the reward of his merit.—And all the honours and glory conferred on Chriſt, as the reward of his merit, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in theſe words, in our text, "To take the book, and to open the ſeals thereof." God the Father, hath delivered the kingdom of the univerſe into his power, "the Father judgeth no man; but hath committed all judgment unto the Son," &amp;c And that he may be able to govern, and diſpoſe all things according to the divide plan, formed from eternity, in the divine mind, the book of God's eternal decrees, containing his whole plan of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, all the counſels of infinite wiſdom, and all divine truth, are delivered into his hand, from the right hand of God the Father; and he hath undertaken to reveal and execute all theſe decrees. For God in <hi>forming</hi> his <hi>decrees</hi> produces no effects; creates no worlds, nor creatures, nor things whatever: theſe things are produced not in <hi>forming</hi> decrees in eternity, but in <hi>executing</hi> them in time. For, forming decrees implies no cauſality in them. And this mediato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial kingdom of Chriſt extends to all parts of the univerſe, that he may manage them all, ſo as to advance his own glory, as moral Governor, and promote the good of his friends, and baffle and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm all oppoſition. And the holy ſpirit, as the fruit of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite merit, is appointed the great agent in his kingdom of grace, to reveal his will, and to operate with divine truth, to carry his purpoſes into execution. All the holy angels are miniſtering ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits in his kingdom, to execute his orders in every part of his vaſt
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:020704_0031_0FB0A6582366CA38"/>
empire. And the inanimate world is ſubjected to him; he cauſes the ſun to ſhine, the rain to fall, and the earth to yield her increaſe, to furniſh proviſion for the ſubjects of his kingdom in this world; and all times and ſeaſons are at his controul. And the <hi>moral</hi> government of the univerſe is committed to him; he <hi>overrules</hi> all the wicked deſigns of devils to promote his own glory, and the good of his friends; though he doth not <hi>form</hi> or <hi>create</hi> any of their wicked deſigns. The government and diſpoſal of the whole world of mankind, as moral agents, are committed to him, as a reward of his merit; and he will have the honour to diſpoſe of them all according to his pleaſure, ſo as to bring glory to his name. And the ſceptre of his kingdom, by which he rules moral agents, is <hi>truth</hi> —as he himſelf declares. "For this end was I born, and for this cauſe came I into the world, to be a witneſs to the truth—and all that are of the truth hear my voice." By the truth, accompanied with the holy ſpirit, he enlightens, convinces and converts ſome, and makes them holy and happy. And by the manifeſtation of the ſame truth, attended with the holy ſpirit, he hardens and torments others to all eternity.</p>
            <p>And in order to ſpread abroad the <hi>truth,</hi> and communicate the ſpeculative knowledge of it, he employs ſome of the children of men, as the miniſters of his word and ordinances, and theſe are workers together with him. And all among the children of men, that are delivered from the kingdom of darkneſs and tranſlated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the kingdom of his grace, ſhall be accounted to him for ſons, and daughters—and of theſe he ſhall have a numerous offspring at laſt to preſent before the throne with exceeding joy.</p>
            <p>And all thoſe multitudes among the children of men, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue impenitent, and in unbelief, and in rebellion to his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and enemies to his true character, belong to him as a reward of his merit, as much as his friends; he hath purchaſed theſe, and will be glorified in them—"Aſk of me (ſays God the Father) and I will give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt parts of the earth for thy poſſeſſion. Thou ſhalt break them with a rod of iron; thou ſhalt daſh them in pieces like a potter's veſſel." Pſal. ii. 8. So that the damnation of all may be as fully proved from the infinite merit of Chriſt with the Father, as the ſalvation of all. The Son of God, by a merit of <hi>condignity,</hi> hath purchaſed the honour of damning his enemies, as much as he hath of ſaving his friends. It will be a great honour to Chriſt, at the laſt day, to paſs the ſentence of condemnation on wicked men, and devils; and ſay, "Go, ye curſed into everlaſting fire." And to execute it, by ſaying. "Thoſe my enemies that would not that I ſhould reign over them, bring them hither, and ſlay them before me." And when the ſmoke of their torments ſhall aſcend up for
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:020704_0032_0FB0A65A511A72D0"/>
ever and ever, all the heavenly hoſt will aſcribe glory to him, the glory of his vindictive juſtice. So that none of the merit of Chriſt will be loſt by the damnation of ſinners; nor will Chriſt by this means loſe any of his reward.</p>
            <p>And Jeſus Chriſt received great honour as a reward of his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, when he aroſe from the dead. In his reſurrection he triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over death, and all the powers of earth and hell, and all the enemies of his people; and entered into his kingdom. In raiſing Chriſt from the dead God ſet to his ſeal, that he had executed faithfully, the important commiſſion he had received.</p>
            <p>And Jeſus Chriſt in his aſcention into heaven was diſtinguiſhed with ſignal honours. Angels appeared, who proclaimed his aſcent; and that in the ſame manner he ſhould deſcend again to judgment. See Pſal. lxviii. 17.18.19.</p>
            <p>And his reception into heaven, as a <hi>mighty conqueror,</hi> is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in lofty expreſſions, Pſal. xxiv. 7.</p>
            <p>And when he ſat down on his Father's right hand in heaven, and was glorified with the ſame glory he had with his Father be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the world was, he received great honour, as a reward of his merit. In heaven he received the worſhip and adoration of all the heavenly inhabitants, ſaying, "Worthy is the Lamb that was ſlain to take the book, and open the ſeals thereof," &amp;c. "Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and honour and glory and power and ſalvation be to him that ſitteth on the throne, and unto the Lamb, for ever and ever."</p>
            <p>In heaven he appears as the advocate of his people; ſhowing the wounds that he hath received in his Father's cauſe, but not from his Father's hand, but from the hands of his enemies. And by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his merit he makes prevalent interceſſion for all that come to God by him. And he there reigns in majeſty and glory, as King of kings; veſted with univerſal rule in the kingdom of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, providence and grace. By his ſpirit and truth he rides in the chariot of his goſpel conquering and to conquer; making his om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent power appear in the dreadful famines, peſtilence, wars and earthquakes; and all the judgments he ſends on the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the earth; to draw their attention to the truth. And he will reign till he hath deſtroyed the kingdom and power of darkneſs, by the efficacy of his word, and ſpirit of truth. And inſtead of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and wickedneſs, he will cauſe truth and righteouſneſs to prevail; "Till the kingdom, and the greatneſs of the kingdom and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion under the whole heavens ſhall be given to the ſaints of the moſt high God." And the latter day glory of the church ſhall fill the whole earth—and he ſhall become king of nations, and he ſhall reign a thouſand years.</p>
            <p>Thus hath God highly exalted him, and given him a name, which is above every name.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="unknown:020704_0033_0FB0A65B990983F0"/>And in a little time he ſhall deſcend from heaven to judge the univerſe in righteouſneſs. He ſhall come in his own glory, and in his Father's glory; and all his holy angels with him. And he ſhall have the honour to raiſe the dead; which ſhall all hear his voice, and come forth. And then ſhall he ſit on the throne of his glory, and all nations ſhall be gathered before his auguſt tribunal. And he ſhall declare the righteous judgment of God. And men, angels and devils ſhall receive their final doom from the ſentence of his mouth: Either "Come ye bleſſed," or "Go ye curſed." And when all the ſolemnities of that awful day ſhall be over, and each one ſhall receive his final and irreverſible award—The wicked ſhall go away into everlaſting puniſhment; but the righteous into life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. And theſe ſhall attend their aſcending Judge into the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt heavens; where they ſhall live and reign with him, in his ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting kingdom; ſeated on thrones of glory; with never fading crowns of victory on their heads; in joy and triumph, and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for ever and ever. And all this honour of paſſing the ſentence of condemnation, and inflicting puniſhment on his enemies, and pronouncing the ſentence of juſtification, and conferring rewards on his friends, hath the Son of God obtained by the merit of his blood.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt.</hi> WE may learn from what hath been ſaid, in what the atonement and ſatisfaction of Chriſt conſiſts. Some have ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that it conſiſted only in Chriſt's <hi>obedience</hi> to the <hi>moral law.</hi> in human nature: and they ſupport it by what the apoſtle affirms, Rom. v. 19. "For as by one man's diſobedience many were made ſinners, ſo by the <hi>obedience</hi> of one many ſhall be made righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous." And his ſufferings (ſay they) were not deſigned to make ſatisfaction, but only to expreſs the ſtrength of his obedience in the <hi>moſt trying circumſtances.</hi> Others hold that the ſatisfaction and merit of Chriſt conſiſted principally, if not entirely, in his ſuffering the individual penalty or curſe, threatened to the ſinner, in the <hi>moral law</hi> inflicted on him, by the immediate hand, decree or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God the Father; and as his human nature was in union with the divine, and a God of infinite power and perfections in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted the curſe or penalty, this rendered his ſufferings infinitely meritorious, and ſo ſufficient to make ſatisfaction &amp; atonement for ſin.</p>
               <p>But now, is it not evident that the mere obedience of an holy being to the <hi>moral law,</hi> cannot make ſatisfaction or avail for the remiſſion of one ſin: ſince without ſuffering or ſhedding of blood there is no remiſſion? It was by the virtue of the <hi>ſacrifice</hi> and <hi>death</hi> of the Son of God, in our room and ſtead, that he made ſatisfaction and atonement. And although Chriſt did yield a perfect and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:020704_0034_0FB0A65CDF7085E0"/>
obedience to the moral law in human nature, yet, his merits, by which he made atonement, did not conſiſt in his <hi>obedience</hi> to the <hi>moral law.</hi> And the curſe which Chriſt was made, was not the individual curſe or penalty threatened to the ſinner in the <hi>moral law</hi>; but the ſubſtitute of it: as hath been ſhewn; nor was it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted by the hand, decree or command of his Father; but by his enemies, in exerciſe of enmity to his divine character. Had God the Father inflicted the curſe, with his own hand, on the <hi>human</hi> nature of Chriſt thouſands of ages, this would not have rendered his ſufferings infinite; for the infinite dignity, power, and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>inflictor</hi> cannot make the ſufferings of a <hi>creature infinite,</hi> nor in any wiſe increaſe the <hi>merit</hi> of them; but really diminiſhes it. And the divine character could not ſuffer by the hand of the Father. But all theſe difficulties vaniſh, when we conſider, that neither the obedience, or ſufferings of Chriſt, by which he made atonement and ſatisfaction for ſin, and merited honour for himſelf and benefits for men, were required of him in the <hi>moral law,</hi> but in the <hi>mediatorial law,</hi> or <hi>covenant</hi> of <hi>redemption</hi>; which contained thoſe commands of God, to which he was ſubject, only as he was our mediator and ſurety. As the obedience of the firſt Adam, wherein his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs would have conſiſted, if he had ſtood, was not obedience to the moral law—but to a plain poſitive command, to abſtain from the tree of knowledge of good and evil; which was not a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand contained in the moral law, but in a <hi>ſpecial covenant</hi> or <hi>law,</hi> to which Adam was ſubject, as the moral head and ſurety of all mankind; ſo the obedience of the ſecond Adam, in which his righteouſneſs conſiſts, lies not in his obedience to the moral law, to which he was ſubject merely as a man; but to that ſpecial law or covenant of redemption, to which he was ſubject in his office, as mediator and ſurety for man. And when the apoſtle ſaith (as in the before cited Rom. v. 19.) "For as by one man's <hi>diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> many were made ſinners, ſo by the <hi>obedience</hi> of one many ſhall be made righteous." Neither the <hi>diſobedience</hi> of Adam, or the <hi>obedience</hi> of Chriſt, reſpect the <hi>moral law,</hi> but theſe ſpecial covenants or laws to which they were ſubject as public heads, and ſureties. And to this law or covenant of redemption, and not to the moral law, the Pſalmiſt hath reſpect, Pſalm xl. 6, &amp;c, "Sacrifice and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering thou didſt not deſire; my ear haſt thou opened: burnt offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſin offering haſt thou not required. Then ſaid I, lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is written of me: I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy <hi>law</hi> is within my heart."</p>
               <p>In this law or covenant of redemption the Father gave his Son commands to teach ſuch doctrine, to preach the goſpel, to work ſuch miracles, to call ſuch diſciples, to appoint ſuch ordinances, and go through ſuch humiliation, abaſement and ſufferings, and
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:020704_0035_0FB0A65FA3CB2988"/>
at laſt to lay down his life; and he did all theſe things in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the commands he had received of his Father; not in the moral law, but in the covenant of redemption. To his obedience to this mediatorial law belongs his going through his laſt ſufferings, beginning with his agony in the garden, and ending with his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection from the dead. And he performed his <hi>obedience</hi> to this covenant, freely, perfectly and univerſally, and under the greateſt trials and temptations, and in the exerciſe of infinite love to God, and the cauſe of truth and righteouſneſs, and benevolence to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. And his obedience and ſufferings, are not to be conſidered as being performed or indured by him, merely in human nature, but as <hi>God the Son,</hi> in his <hi>divine character</hi> as <hi>heir</hi> of the univerſe. It was a perſon of infinite dignity that obeyed and ſuffered in his divine character—and this rendered his obedience and ſufferings <hi>infinitely meritorious.</hi> Not that he ſuffered in his divine <hi>nature</hi> or <hi>eſſence,</hi> but in his <hi>divine character,</hi> as <hi>Heir</hi> of the kingdom. In all that reproach and ignominy caſt on his divine character by devils, and wicked men he ſuffered. Had he not ſuffered in his <hi>divine</hi> character, his ſufferings or ſacrifice, would not have been <hi>infinite</hi> or ſufficient to make ſatisfaction for one ſin, or have anſwered the purpoſes of redemption. And the infinite virtue of his obedience conſiſted in its being yielded to the covenant of redemption, as a divine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon—He, as God-man in the exerciſe of <hi>infinite love to God</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came obedient unto death. And in this <hi>obedience</hi> there was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite virtue and merit. And as his duty and work, ſo his <hi>reward</hi> was aſſigned, and aſcertained; not in the moral law, but in the covenant of redemption. And unleſs we attend to this diſtinction between the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>mediation,</hi> and the <hi>moral law,</hi> and the curſe threatened to the ſinner, and the curſe which Chriſt was made, we cannot have a clear idea how Chriſt paid the price of our redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to God by his blood. But here we can ſee how the <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> of Chriſt frees believers from miſery, as it pays their <hi>debt</hi> contrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by ſin; and how the <hi>merit</hi> of Chriſt by its <hi>intrinſic value,</hi> and by the agreement between the Father and the Son, in the covenant of redemption, procures a title to happineſs, for all that believe in him. And here we may ſee the impropriety of applying the term <hi>paſſive</hi> to any part of the <hi>obedience</hi> of Chriſt; ſince it was the <hi>obedience</hi> of God the Son to the covenant of redemption.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly.</hi> We may infer, from what hath been ſaid, that the merit of Chriſt the Son of God, is a merit of condignity. By a <hi>merit</hi> of <hi>condignity</hi> I underſtand, a merit that is <hi>equal</hi> in <hi>value</hi> to the <hi>reward.</hi> And we have heard what the reward is, which God the Father hath beſtowed on the Son; and which he <hi>promiſed</hi> to him, not in the <hi>moral law,</hi> but in the <hi>covenant of redemption.</hi> And we have heard in what his merit conſiſts. And let any one judge,
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:020704_0036_0FB0A6636768A368"/>
if the merit of the Son of God, conſidering the dignity of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as being equal with God the Father, and independent on his <hi>will</hi> or <hi>act</hi> for his exiſtence or happineſs, and under no obligation from without himſelf, to obey, antecedent to his own voluntary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the covenant of redemption, into which he entered with his Father. And conſidering the great honour he brought to God, and the good to his moral kingdom, which muſt be of <hi>infinite value,</hi> and be eſteemed ſo by God from eternity.</p>
               <p>And conſidering the means and methods by which he procured this honour, and obtained this good; even by his <hi>infinite</hi> humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, arduous ſervices and great ſufferings; in ſacrificing his liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, life and <hi>divine glory</hi>; in being made a victim and ſacrifice, in the devil's kingdom, in order to declare God's righteouſneſs, and execute judgement on God's enemies, and decide the moral controverſy, and put an end to the dreadful war; and advance God's glory, and promote the peace, proſperity and happineſs of his kingdom to an infinite degree: which great ends could by no other perſon or means be effected. I ſay, let any one judge, if this <hi>merit</hi> of the Son, is not equal to all the <hi>honours</hi> the Son hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from God the Father for himſelf, and all the benefits men receive from God through him. And if ſo, then his merit is a proper merit of <hi>condignity</hi>; and whatever he hath purchaſed of the Father, he hath purchaſed by an equivalent.</p>
               <p>But this doth not imply that God hath received any new adition to his honour or felicity, or hath any increaſe of knowlege. For theſe were all comprehended in his infinite underſtanding, and compoſed a part of his glory and happineſs, in <hi>eternity,</hi> and the <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue</hi> was <hi>then received.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor doth this imply that God is under any obligation to ſave all mankind. For, the ſalvation of mankind doth not depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>condignity</hi> or <hi>ſufficiency</hi> of the merit of the Son of God, but upon the <hi>agreement</hi> made between the Father and the Son, in the <hi>covenant</hi> of <hi>redemption,</hi> what his <hi>particular reward</hi> ſhould be. The merit is <hi>ſufficient</hi> for, and <hi>equivalent</hi> to the ſalvation of all; for it is of <hi>infinite value</hi> to God the Father, otherwiſe it would not have been ſufficient for the ſalvation of one. But God the Father did not ſee cauſe to aſſign the ſalvation of all to him as his reward, in the covenant of redemption. God might have promiſed him the ſalvation of all as his reward, if he had ſeen it to be conſiſtent with his wiſdom, and his benevolence to his moral kingdom; but we are aſſured he hath not; and that all will not eventually be ſaved; for all will not repent, and believe in Chriſt; and he that believes not ſhall be damned. God hath promiſed him the free pardon, juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and ſalvation of all that ſhall believe on him, through his word acompanied by his ſpirit of truth; and this ſhall be a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:020704_0037_0FB0A66526648590"/>
offspring which he ſhall preſent at laſt, before the throne, with exceeding joy; ſaying, "Here am I, and the children thou haſt given me." But <hi>all will</hi> not believe in Chriſt—but multitudes <hi>will</hi> remain enemies to him, and have to appear at his left hand, in the retinue of ſatan, and hear the dreadful ſentence from his mouth, "Go ye curſed into everlaſting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels." And they will feel the execution of this dreadful ſentence, when Chriſt ſhall ſay, "Thoſe my enemies that would not that I ſhould reign over them, bring them hither and ſlay them before me." And to paſs this ſentence and to execute it on his enemies, will be as real a part of the reward of Chriſt's merit of condignity, as to paſs the ſentence of abſolution and juſtification, and beſtow rewards upon his friends. But Chriſt will be conſidered as having <hi>paid</hi> the <hi>price</hi> of the redemption of all the heirs of glory, by a proper merit of condignity; and to have <hi>purchaſed</hi> their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs by an equivalent: and they will to all eternity aſcribe the glory of their redemption to the <hi>price</hi> and <hi>power</hi> of his blood, as the Lamb ſlain. Neither doth the <hi>condignity</hi> of Chriſt's merit detract any thing from the <hi>freeneſs</hi> of divine grace, in the pardon and juſtification of the ſinner. <hi>Plenary ſatisfaction</hi> and <hi>free pardon</hi> are perfectly conſiſtent on this plan. For, though what Chriſt hath done to make atonement ſecures the honour of God, the authority of the law, and the dignity and vigour of government, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the peace, proſperity and happineſs of his kingdom, in the ſalvation of all that believe in Jeſus; yet the atonement and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction made by Chriſt, and repentance of ſin, and faith in his blood, do not alter the <hi>perſonal</hi> character of the ſinner; ſo as to cauſe him to <hi>ceaſe</hi> to be a <hi>ſinner,</hi> or a <hi>debtor</hi> to divine juſtice, or to deſerve puniſhment, or give the ſinner any <hi>claim</hi> to pardon, upon the ſcore of juſtice. Even Chriſt himſelf could lay claim to the pardon and juſtification of the ſinner, notwithſtanding the condignity of his merit, <hi>only</hi> upon the foundation of the <hi>ſtipulation</hi> or <hi>promiſe</hi> made to him by the Father, in the covenant of redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; were it not for that <hi>promiſe</hi> and <hi>agreement,</hi> God the Son could lay no claim to that <hi>particular favour</hi> as his reward; though his merit was ſufficient to purchaſe it—yet God in his infinite wiſdom, and free and <hi>ſovereign</hi> grace muſt determine that <hi>this,</hi> ſhall be his reward. And it was infinite love, unpurchaſed, unmoved love (by any thing without himſelf) that determined God the Father to beſtow <hi>theſe</hi> as a reward upon his Son. The merit of the Son laid him under no obligation to make this diſtinction. He might have ſent his Son (as his reward) to condemn the whole world; they all deſerved it; but it was <hi>free</hi> and <hi>ſovereign grace</hi> that prevented it.</p>
               <p>And the <hi>believer</hi> in Jeſus can lay no claim upon the ſcore of juſtice. The merit of Chriſt, and the repentance, faith and love
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:020704_0038_0FB0A66765F19F80"/>
and good works of the believer, do not cauſe him to ceaſe to be a ſinner; or intitle him to the merit or righteouſneſs of Chriſt, on account of any <hi>moral goodneſs</hi> there is in them. The believer doth not by theſe <hi>earn</hi> or <hi>merit</hi> any favour, but by <hi>faith</hi> he lays hold on the <hi>promiſe,</hi> and <hi>receives</hi> the atonement; and all the benefits of Chriſt's purchaſe. And were it not for the free <hi>promiſe</hi> the <hi>believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> muſt ſtill remain in a ſtate of guilt and condemnation. But the believer can lay claim to theſe promiſes of the covenant of grace. But the <hi>merit</hi> of the <hi>believer,</hi> who is united to Chriſt by faith, is only a merit of <hi>congruity,</hi> i. e. <hi>a ſuitableneſs to receive</hi> favours from a <hi>righteous</hi> God. And God can as conſiſtently juſtify a <hi>believer in Chriſt,</hi> as he can <hi>Gabriel.</hi> But though a <hi>creature</hi> may have a merit of <hi>congruity,</hi> yet no creature can have a merit of <hi>condignity</hi> with reſpect to God; becauſe he is infinitely indebted to him, for his being, &amp;c. And therefore no creature could make atonement for ſin, or purchaſe any favour of God, for himſelf or any other. Adam in innocency had, and all the holy angels in heaven now have, a merit of <hi>congruity.</hi> And could God have pardoned ſin out of <hi>reſpect</hi> to the merit of <hi>congruity,</hi> or out of reſpect to the <hi>tried virtue</hi> of one who was under obligation from juſtice, or any thing from without himſelf, antecedent to his own conſent to obey; then there would have been no need of a perſon of <hi>infinite dignity,</hi> co-equal, co-eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential and co-eternal with God the Father, to undertake this work. Becauſe an holy <hi>creature</hi> by his obedience and ſufferings might have accompliſhed it with the <hi>aſſiſtance</hi> of the <hi>Deity.</hi> And to deny the <hi>condignity</hi> of the merit of Chriſt, is in effect to deny his divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and equality with the Father. For, if one that had only a merit of <hi>congruity</hi> would have anſwered, to ſubſtitute one that had a merit of <hi>condignity</hi> was not wiſe; becauſe it ſuppoſes a needleſs expence of merit. The <hi>wiſdom</hi> of ſubſtituting a perſon of infinite dignity, conſiſts in the <hi>neceſſity</hi> of it. But had not the Mediator been a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of infinite and divine dignity, and his merit a merit of condig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity with God, no atonement or ſatisfaction could have been made by his obedience and ſufferings; out of reſpect to which God could have pardoned one ſin, conſiſtent with his <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> as moral Governour. And hence infinite wiſdom and benevolence is diſplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this ſubſtitution. "When he looked, there was none to help, —none to uphold; therefore his <hi>own arm</hi> brought ſalvation unto him!" See Iſa. lxiii. 5. But God in pardoning the ſinner, out of reſpect to the merit of Chriſt, acts as <hi>freely</hi> as if no atonement had been made; ſince the atonement made by Chriſt or the condignity of the merit, laid God under no obligation to diſcharge one ſinner from his debt to juſtice, antecedent to <hi>ſtipulation</hi>: nor in the leaſt alter the <hi>perſonal</hi> character of the ſinner. Nor can God, conſiſtent: with his juſtice, pardon, juſtify or ſave one ſinner on account of the
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:020704_0039_0FB0A668E3B4ABB8"/>
infinite merit of Chriſt, 'till the ſinner believeth in Jeſus; and then he treats him infinitely more favourably than his <hi>perſonal</hi> character deſerves. But, the condignity of Chriſt's merit hath opened a way for the conſiſtent exerciſe of this <hi>free grace</hi> to the ſinner—but laid God under no <hi>obligation</hi> to exerciſe it to any one.</p>
               <p>And I would here obſerve the diſtinction between <hi>free</hi> and <hi>ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign</hi> grace.</p>
               <p>UNCONDITIONAL FAVOURS, to which the ſinner can lay no claim on the ſcore of <hi>juſtice,</hi> or by any <hi>promiſe</hi> of God made to him, are beſtowed on him in the exerciſe of God's <hi>ſovereign</hi> grace. Such are election, the gift of Chriſt, the revelation of the goſpel; and the gift of the Holy Spirit in its internal influences, and all the means of grace, and the production of regeneration, conviction, repentance, faith and love in the ſoul; theſe are all <hi>unconditional</hi> favours; and beſtowed on ſinners in the exerciſe of <hi>ſovereign</hi> grace, without reſpect to any <hi>moral</hi> qualification in them, as <hi>deſerving</hi> theſe favours. But when the ſinner by believing in Chriſt, hath complied with the <hi>condition</hi> of the covenant of grace, to <hi>which</hi> the promiſe is made—pardon, juſtification and eternal life, may be ſaid to be beſtowed in the exerciſe of <hi>free</hi> grace, more properly than <hi>ſovereign</hi> grace. For the <hi>believer</hi> in Chriſt hath a right <hi>hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly</hi> to <hi>lay claim</hi> to the <hi>promiſe,</hi> and to plead the <hi>juſtice</hi> and <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs</hi> of God, for the fulfilment of it. See 1 John i. 9. "If we confeſs our ſins, he is <hi>faithful</hi> and <hi>juſt</hi> to forgive us our ſins, and to cleanſe us from all unrighteouſneſs," i. e. If with penitent <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving</hi> hearts we confeſs our ſins, God hath obliged himſelf in cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to pardon, juſtify, ſanctify and ſave us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly.</hi> We may learn how the ſubſtitution of the Son of God, and his vicarious ſufferings, and the imputation of his merit or righteouſneſs to penitent, believing ſinners, for their pardon, juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and eternal ſalvation are conſiſtent with reaſon and juſtice. Had God the Father, with his Son's conſent ſubſtituted him to bear the <hi>individual penalty</hi> or puniſhment threatened to the ſinner, in the <hi>moral law,</hi> and had the Father <hi>inflicted</hi> this penalty on his Son with his own hand, I do not ſee how this would have been conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with reaſon or juſtice, or anſwered any ends in making atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or ſatisfaction. I do not ſee how it could be any <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> to an infinitely <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>holy</hi> God to inflict any ſufferings on his <hi>innocent, holy</hi> and infinitely <hi>glorious Son,</hi> with his own hard or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate command. And indeed for God to <hi>reproach</hi> the <hi>divine character</hi> of his Son as the Heir of the kingdom, would have been as impoſſible as for God to deny himſelf. And if God had crucified his Son, how could ſinners he told with truth <hi>or</hi> propriety, "Ye have taken and with wicked hands have crucified and ſlain the Prince of life? <hi>repent</hi> therefore," &amp;c. As in acts ii. 37. And
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:020704_0040_0FB0A66A6DA89940"/>
how would his being made a ſacrifice for ſin, have condemned ſin, in devils and wicked men; as pregnant with <hi>mortal</hi> enmity to God's character and kingdom? And how did he endure the contradiction of ſinners againſt himſelf?</p>
               <p>But conſider God the Son as being under the <hi>covenant of redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> as diſtinct from the <hi>moral law,</hi> and being <hi>ſubſtituted</hi> by the Father and his own conſent to become a ſervant, to do and ſuffer what ſhould fulfil the <hi>conditions</hi> of that covenant, and anſwer <hi>its requirements,</hi> in deciding this war; and here we ſhall ſee the agen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God the Father—the agency of God the Son—and the <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct</hi> agency of the <hi>enemies</hi> of truth and righteouſneſs, in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per light and importance. In this affair God the Father expreſſes his <hi>infinite benevolence</hi> in delivering up his only begotten, <hi>i. e.</hi> co-eſſential, infinitely dear, tranſcendently glorious, and divinely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Son from his boſom, and ſetting him forth to be a propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for ſin. God the Son diſplays his <hi>infinite grace</hi> and <hi>love</hi> in <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering</hi> up himſelf, to become a victim and ſacrifice, in the devil's kingdom. The enemies of truth and righteouſneſs manifeſt their <hi>mortal enmity</hi> to God's character, as moral Governour, and the intereſt of his kingdom, and the <hi>infinite evil</hi> of ſin, in its nature and tendency, in conquering and ſacrificing the Son of God, and depriving him of his liberty, life and <hi>divine glory,</hi> as the <hi>Heir</hi> of the kingdom. God the Father declares his <hi>inflexible juſtice,</hi> in his inſiſting on an <hi>infinite ſatisfaction,</hi> before he pardons one ſinner. God the Son makes this ſatisfaction, by declaring God's righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and executing judgement on his enemies; and laying a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for the conviction and converſion of ſinners, and the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſatan's kingdom; and the increaſing the <hi>moral</hi> kingdom of God in glory and felicity, to an infinite degree, by occaſion of ſin. And every one from among the children of men that believeth in Jeſus, and receives by faith and love the atonement he hath made, may, out of reſpect to his merit, be pardoned, juſtified, and ſaved in the exerciſe of God's <hi>free</hi> and <hi>ſovereign grace,</hi> conſiſtent with his <hi>juſtice,</hi> and to the honour of his character, law and government. And though the <hi>curſe</hi> that Chriſt was made for us, was not the individual curſe threatened to the ſinner, in the <hi>moral</hi> law, nor was it inflicted on him by the hand or command of his Father, yet, conſidering the dignity of his perſon, and the greatneſs of his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation in ſubmitting to be conquered and ſlain, in ſuch an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious manner, on the croſs, and in having his <hi>divine character</hi> reproached, and his <hi>divine glory</hi> eclipſed, by the inſults of his own ſinful creatures, that were enemies to truth and righteouſneſs; the curſe Chriſt was made, and the ſufferings he endured were greater than the curſe threatened to the ſinner in the <hi>moral law</hi>; and more than equivalent in ſupporting the rights of government, and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:020704_0041_0FB0A66BDE6186E0"/>
atonement and ſatisfaction for ſin. For, by this means God's <hi>juſtice</hi> appears <hi>inflexible</hi> and his <hi>truth inviolable,</hi> when his juſtifies the ſinner that believeth in Jeſus. And ſhould any enquire, How doth the infinite evil of ſin appear, in Chriſt's enemies conquering and ſlaying him, ſince his crucifiers did it through ignorance; they did not <hi>know</hi> he was the Lord of glory—but took him to be an impoſter! how then doth their enmity in putting him to death ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be aimed againſt his divine character as <hi>Heir</hi> of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom? To this I anſwer, That it is probable that many that had an immediate hand in his crucifixion, did not believe him to be the true Meſſiah, and Saviour of the world; if they had they would have committed the unpardonable ſin in crucifying him. And therefore the Apoſtle tells them, "Ye did it ignorantly, as did alſo your rulers; repent therefore," &amp;c. but though their ignorance <hi>alleviated</hi> their guilt, yet it did not <hi>excuſe</hi> them, becauſe they had ſufficient <hi>means</hi> of knowledge, but their <hi>love</hi> of darkneſſ and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs prevented their <hi>attending</hi> to theſe means; and in this conſiſted their condemnation. But though the immediate crucifers of Chriſt, did not know he was the true Meſſiah and Lord of glory, yet the devils knew it. "We <hi>know</hi> thee, who thou art, <hi>the holy one of God."</hi> And this is the language of the devil, as the prince of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and god of this world; and the languege of his ſubjects and agents. "This is the <hi>Heir,</hi> come and let us kill him, and ſeize on the inheritance." And all Chriſt's crucifers were under the influence of the <hi>error</hi> and <hi>temper</hi> of the devil. And if the <hi>ſin</hi> of devils contains in it <hi>mortal enmity</hi> to God's character, as moral Governour, and ſo is an <hi>infinite evil,</hi> pregnant with infinite miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief to being in general, the <hi>ſin</hi> of men is the <hi>ſame.</hi> And if the <hi>ſin</hi> of <hi>devils</hi> is condemned by the croſs of Chriſt as an <hi>infinite evil,</hi> and ſo <hi>deſerving</hi> of an infinite or <hi>endleſs puniſhment,</hi> then the <hi>ſin</hi> of <hi>all mankind</hi> ſtands equally condemned; notwithſtanding any deficiency of ſpeculative knowledge or natural powers. And one great reaſon of Chriſt's being made a ſacrifice for ſin, was thus to <hi>condemn ſin</hi> in devils, and wicked men, and ſo deſtroy the power of ſatan, over the hearts of men, and <hi>deſtroy</hi> him in a <hi>moral ſenſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly.</hi> We may infer, from what hath been ſaid, that the goſpel muſt be of divine original.</p>
               <p>Prophecies, and miracles afford us very ſtrong and convincing proofs of this truth, and ought to bear great weight upon the mind. The prophecies, ſeem to be rather deſcriptions, and hiſtories of paſt tranſactions than predictions of future events; and whoever attends to them properly, muſt be convinced that they are derived from ſupernatural inſpiration. The miracles recorded in the New Teſtament were certainly a convincing proof to thoſe that ſaw
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:020704_0042_0FB0A66E02D54010"/>
them, of the divine miſſion of Chriſt, and his Apoſtles; and come as well atteſted to us, as any other hiſtorical facts: as they were ſeen of numbers, and wrought on ſo great and wonderful an occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For it is in no wiſe incredible, that a ſupernatural revelation ſhould be foretold, and inforced by ſupernatural means. And from this book, may be collected a ſyſtem of morality or eithicks, which exceeds all others for its purity and perfection; and to which the wiſeſt philoſophers, of preceding ages, can make no pretentions. All its moral precepts are founded in reaſon—tend to improve our natures, and are conducive to the happineſs of mankind.—Read the decalogue—And what other religion, beſides the Chriſtian, ever carried the moral virtues of piety to God, benevolence to men, juſtice, charity, temperance and ſobriety to ſo high a degree of purity and perfection; and ſo ſeverely prohibited the commiſſion of the contrary vices, which tend to debaſe our natures, and by mutual injuries, introduce univerſal diſorder; and conſequently univerſal miſery?</p>
               <p>What other religion ever required of its votaries that humility and poorneſs of ſpirit, that forgiveneſs of injuries and charity to all men, as the beſt expedient to prepare them for the kingdom of heaven!—Read our bleſſed Saviour's ſermon on the mount, and hear him ſay, "Bleſſed are the poor in ſpirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.—Ye have heard that it hath been ſaid, Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour and hate thine enemy: But I ſay unto you, Love your enemies, bleſs them that curſe you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which deſpitefully uſe you and perſecute you." A new commandment give I unto you (ſaith our bleſſed Lord) that ye love one another, as I have loved you, by this ſhall all men know, that ye are my diſciples, if ye have love one to another." And did he not ſpeak as never man ſpake? And read the Apoſtle Paul's admirable deſcription of charity; "Charity ſuffereth long and is kind; charity envieth not; cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity vaunteth not itſelf; is not puffed up; doth not behave itſelf unſeemly; ſeeketh not her own, is not eaſily provoked; thinketh no evil; rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth; bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all things; hopeth all things; endureth all things.</p>
               <p>But the prophecies and miracles contained in the ſcriptures, and the excellency and purity of the morals therein preſcribed, though they are very weighty and good arguments, and demand our moſt ſerious attention and admiration, yet they are by no means the <hi>on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> or even the <hi>principal</hi> proofs of their divine origin. But, the principal and moſt concluſive evidences of the divine origin of the goſpel, are the doctrines peculiar to divine revelation; ſuch as the trinity of perſons or agents in the divine eſſence—the apoſtacy of angels and man. The grand conteſt that commenced upon this
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:020704_0043_0FB0A6705F42C6F0"/>
apoſtacy between heaven and hell, concerning the truth and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of God's character as moral Governour, and how this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controverſy hath been carried on from age to age; and how it was decided by God the Son upon the croſs; and his reſurrection from the dead; the appointment of the eternal <hi>Logos</hi> to engage in this controverſy, when it was impoſſible for any other to decide it. The covenant of redemption, into which he entered with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the terms of that covenant. The incarnation of the Son of God, his amazing humiliation, arduous ſervices and great ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings; when he was made a victim and ſacrifice in the devils kingdom; by which means he declared the truth and righteouſneſs of God's character as moral Governour, and ſo made atonement, and paid the price of man's redemption, and opened a way for God to juſtify him that believeth in Jeſus, conſiſtent with his juſtice; and by the ſame means layed a foundation for the convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and converſion of ſinners, and to condemn ſin as an infinite evil, pregnant with infinite miſchief to God's character and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment—and deſtroy ſatan in a <hi>moral ſenſe,</hi> and finally ruin his kingdom and dominion over the hearts of men, and prepare the way for the manifeſtation of the righteous judgment of God at the laſt great day. And all that is required of ſinners in order to their being intereſted in all the precious benefits of his purchaſe is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in <hi>faith,</hi> which is a ſelf emptying, Chriſt magnifying and God exalting grace: which <hi>brings</hi> nothing but <hi>receives</hi> all of <hi>free</hi> and <hi>ſovereign grace.</hi> In exerciſe of faith in the Mediator, the ſinner gives up all created wiſdom, and depends only upon divine revelation for direction. Gives up all righteouſneſs of his own; and depends on the merit of Chriſt for righteouſneſs and life, grace and glory. Gives up ſelf government, and depends on Chriſt to rule in and reign over him, and expects to overcome his enemies only by the blood of the Lamb, and the teſtimony he holds.— Now theſe are things that no created benevolence could ever conceive, no created wiſdom ever deviſe, or created power accompliſh; and do as fully prove the divine origin of the holy ſcripture, as the marks of infinite wiſdom, power and goodneſs manifeſted in the works of creation, do that this world is of divine original; and could not be planned or made by any creature: becauſe no created wiſdom or power is equal to ſuch a production.</p>
               <p>The devil never invented this plan of ſalvation; for it is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſive of his kingdom and intereſt. It is inconſiſtent with the character of any good creature to put ſuch a cheat upon mankind (if he was able) as to attribute that to God, of which he himſelf was the author. But no created being was able to lay out ſuch a plan, thus to diſplay the perfections of God by the occaſion of ſin; and even render them more illuſtrious, than if ſin had never enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:020704_0044_0FB0A6753A228D98"/>
into his kingdom; and thus to bring the greateſt good out of the greateſt evil! bring righteouſneſs out of ſin, and life out of death! to conquer by being conquered, and ſlay his enemies by being ſlain by them! and by being ſacrificed, to enter into his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom! at one and the ſame time to appear as a lamb, and a lion! a victim and a conqueror!</p>
               <p>This plan of ſalvation hath never been corrupted; if it had, it never could have been rectified, and appear as it now doth, in its divine glory and perfection! Let any <hi>rational</hi> infidel read and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand</hi> the goſpel, and he will be obliged to confeſs, that not one doctrine it contains is repugnant to reaſon, but the whole is harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious and conſiſtent.</p>
               <p>Infidels impute the miſtaken notions of fallible men, and their corrupt explanations of the ſcriptures, to the ſcriptures themſelves; and then villify and reproach the ſcriptures, as containing ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable doctrines; which is very unfair: It would be much more rational, if they would firſt <hi>ſtudy</hi> the ſcriptures, and well <hi>underſtand</hi> them, and the doctrines they contain, before they reject and villify them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Let all be exhorted and prevailed upon to receive the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement, and be reconciled to God immediately. God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath manifeſted his infinite benevolence to ſinners, and his willingneſs to be reconciled to them, and hath opened a way for reconciliation, conſiſtent with his righteouſneſs, by ſending his Son to die.</p>
               <p>The Son hath diſcovered his infinite love and grace to ſinners, and his intereſt in the court of heaven, by making a complete atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſatisfaction; ſo that the honour of his Father's law and government may be ſupported, and advanced, in the ſalvation of all that will receive the atonement. God the Father hath already received the atonement, and ſet to his ſeal, that he hath approved all that his Son hath done and ſuffered, as our Mediator and Surety. He hath raiſed him from the dead, and declared with a voice from heaven, that Chriſt is his beloved Son in whom he is well pleaſed; and commanded all to <hi>hear</hi> him and believe in him.</p>
               <p>And all that remains to compleat the union is, that you give your hearts to Chriſt, and cordially receive Him as your Mediator, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing all merit or righteouſneſs in yourſelf, and owning the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the law juſt, and relinquiſh the kingdom of ſatan, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Chriſt's friend, and lay hold on his covenant; and all that he hath done and ſuffered ſhall be made over to you for your everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing advantage. Theſe benefits coſt the Father dear, and the Son dear; but they will coſt you nothing: you may <hi>freely receive</hi> them, and they will become yours without money and without price: they are as free and unmeritted as to you, as if no atonement had been made: God requires no good deſert in you, previous to your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving his Son.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="unknown:020704_0045_0FB0A67667110D88"/>And will you not heartily approve, and fall in with this way of ſalvation, which God in infinite love and wiſdom hath provided for ſinners? Will you not give your hearts to Chriſt, and declare him to be your beloved Saviour, in whom you are well pleaſed? Do not all created and uncreated glories center in him? If you reject the atonement, do you think you can deviſe ſome wiſer, eaſier and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter way of ſalvation than this? or that any other prince or ſaviour hath a better claim to your hearts?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> We learn how impoſſible it is, that he who neglects this ſalvation, and finally rejects Chriſt Jeſuſ, ſhould eſcape the eternal wrath and vengeance of God. It is inconſiſtent with the <hi>righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of God, as moral Governor of the univerſe, that any ſuch ſhould eſcape. The righteouſneſs of God (as we have obſerved) conſiſts in his <hi>benevolence, juſtice</hi> and <hi>truth</hi>; and ſhould he violate either of theſe he would ceaſe to be righteous; and his government muſt fall into contempt among his ſubjects, and tend to annihilation. And this would introduce confuſion and ruin into his moral kingdom. And if God ſhould pardon one ſin till adequate ſatisfaction be firſt made, he muſt violate his righteouſneſs; for he hath threatened death to every ſin: "The ſoul that ſins ſhall die;" and his <hi>truth</hi> ſtands engaged for the execution of this threatening; and his truth muſt appear <hi>inviolable</hi>: and his juſtice, as well as his truth, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands that this threatening be executed; and this muſt appear <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexible</hi>; for ſin, as it is committed againſt God, and is pregnant with <hi>mortal</hi> enmity to his character, as moral Governor, and tends to dethrone him and ruin his kingdom, deſerves an infinite or end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs puniſhment; and to remit this penalty in one inſtance of diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, is inconſiſtent with <hi>inflexible juſtice.</hi> And <hi>infinite bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence</hi> to his moral kingdom, and the beſt good of all the moral ſubjects of it, demands that the rights of moral government be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported: for the whole of the peace and happineſs of a kingdom de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the righteouſneſs of the character, law and government of the Supreme Ruler. He muſt appear the ſame in execution that he is in legiſlation, or his government will fall into contempt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his ſubject. And it was this that rendered an infinite atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or ſatisfaction neceſſary, in order to open a way for God to exerciſe his mercy to ſinners, conſiſtently with his juſtice. Had not God ſet forth his Son to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteouſneſs, he could not have juſtified one ſinner conſiſtently with his juſtice. But ſince Chriſt hath taken our law place, ſo as to make ſatisfaction for our ſins, God can juſtify the greateſt ſinner that by faith in Jeſus Chriſt <hi>receives</hi> the atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which he hath made, as conſiſtently as he can the moſt holy an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel in heaven. And God's inſiſting on ſuch an infinite ſatisfaction being made, and the ſinner's being intereſted in it, before he par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons him, declares that ſin is an infinite evil in God's eſteem; and
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:020704_0046_0FB0A67872C9CCF0"/>
that every ſinner that is not intereſted by faith, in the ſatisfaction which his Son hath made, muſt ſuffer an infinite or endleſs puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: for there is no way far the truth and juſtice of God in the threatening to be vindicated, and the rights of government to be ſupported, but one of theſe two—an infinite ſatisfaction, or an end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs puniſhment. And there was no being in the univerſe that could make this infinite ſatisfaction but God the Son; and it coſt him his liberty, life and divine glory; which was an infinite ſacrifice. And this was the only remedy. And the ſinner can receive no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit from the infinite ſatisfaction Chriſt hath made, any way but by being united to him, and one with him in a covenant relation. The rights of government muſt be ſupported by inflicting on all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers a puniſhment adequate to their crime. There is no other name or way in which we can be ſaved but by Jeſus Chriſt; and if we neglect this way, and reject this Saviour, there remaineth no more ſacrifice for ſin. And in neglecting this way, we offer the greateſt affront to God, who hath in infinite mercy provided this Saviour for us!—What a ſtrange puniſhment, then, will be inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on them who deſpiſe and reject God's own eternal Son; turn a deaf ear to his goſpel, and ſtifle and grieve his ſpirit! Verily, though he that believeth on him is not condemned, yet he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth not is condemned already, becauſe he hath not believed on the name of the only begotten Son of God. Unbelief, or rejecting Chriſt, is the formal cauſe of the ſinner's damnation: It is that ſin which binds the guilt of all his other ſins upon him, and conſigns him over to damnation. This ſin not only procures damnation, but no damnation like it. Wherefore we may juſtly conclude, that whoſoever finally neglects or rejects Chriſt and the common ſalvation purchaſed and offered by him to ſinners, ſhall in no wiſe eſcape the eternal wrath and vengeance of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Let all unregenerate, chriſtleſs ſinners, be exhorted, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected and prevailed upon, to attend to the goſpel, and hear and underſtand the ſaving truths therein contained, and receive them by faith and love, as the only means of being made partakers of this ſalvation.</p>
               <p>I have endeavoured to ſet before you, your own true character, as you are ſinners in ſatan's kingdom and intereſt, in a ſtate of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity and rebellion to God, juſtly condemned to eternal miſery; helpleſs and hopeleſs in yourſelves; deſtitute of all righteouſneſs: dead in law, and ſpiritually dead; and entirely in the hands of a ſovereign God.</p>
               <p>I have repreſented to you the character of God, as he is infinite in his benevolence, and yet inflexible in his juſtice, and his truth is inviolable; and he will in no wiſe clear the guilty. And I have prohibited to you the character of Jeſus Chriſt, as he is the true Meſſiah and the only Saviour of the world. And I have opened un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:020704_0047_0FB0A67963239EE8"/>
you the only method by which you can be ſaved; the only me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod that can afford the leaſt gleam of hope to a convinced periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſinner. And this ſalvation is brought to your very door by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine revelation; and put in the power of every ſinner that lives un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the light of the goſpel, and hath capacity and opportunity to hear and underſtand the truths therein contained. God the Father hath deviſed this method of ſalvation; God the Son hath purchaſed it; and God the Spirit hath revealed it: and the miniſters of Chriſt exhibit and explain it to you. But neither God the Father, Son, or Holy Spirit, or the miniſters of Chriſt, can <hi>receive</hi> it for you. This muſt be your own act, as free and diſtinct moral agents. And it is the wiſeſt, the eaſieſt and beſt method, for the ſalvation of a ſinner, that can be deviſed or deſired. And if you underſtand, and cordially fall in with this method, you may be ſaved in a way that will bring honour to God's character, law and government.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, How can we be entitled to this ſalvation, ſince we have no righteouſneſs of our own, and are dead in law? To this I anſwer, That the righteouſneſſ of Chriſt is ſufficient to juſtify you in the ſight of God, and free you from condemnation, and entitle you to this ſalvation. And you muſt come to Chriſt and receive his righteouſneſs by truſting in his merit alone by faith. But you will ſay, How can we come to Chriſt, and by faith receive his righteouſneſs? You tell us we are <hi>ſpiritually</hi> dead, and have no <hi>pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> to change our hearts. And our Saviour tells us—"No man can come to me except the Father which ſent me draw him."—To this I anſwer, That though you are ſpiritually dead, and have no power to change your hearts; and you cannot come to Chriſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs drawn by the Father; yet the ſpirit of God is able to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate ſpiritual life to your ſouls. And the Father is able to draw you to Chriſt, by his word and ſpirit of truth. And what you have to do is to receive this word and ſpirit of truth, by hearing and learning of the Father, by attending to the truths of divine revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. We have no need to make uſe of any metaphyſical diſtinction between <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>moral</hi> power, in order to underſtand our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's meaning here, or to faſten blame upon the ſinner that is not drawn by the Father, and ſo cannot come to Chriſt. The blame of the Scribes and Phariſees, is their not attending to divine reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and to the inſtructions of our bleſſed Saviour, and being <hi>taught</hi> of God; or <hi>hearing</hi> and <hi>learning</hi> of the Father: their inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate love of worldly honour, and ſtrong prejudices in favour of error, and conceit of their own knowledge and righteouſneſs, kept them in <hi>ignorance</hi> of the truth of their own character, the character of God and his righteouſneſs, and the character of Chriſt and the way of ſalvation by him. And it was impoſſible this ignorance, error and prejudice ſhould be removed, and they brought to receive the truth in the love of it, and give up their own righteouſneſs, and
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:020704_0048_0FB0A67B01D91178"/>
depend upon the righteouſneſs of Chriſt alone for ſalvation, 'till they could be prevailed upon to hear and learn the goſpel, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the truths of it. <hi>They erred, not knowing the ſcriptures</hi>: and it was not becauſe God withheld any <hi>internal influences,</hi> or was wanting as to the means of inſtruction; but it was becauſe they would not hear and learn the goſpel, and receive the ſpirit in its vital influences, by obtaining the <hi>knowledge</hi> of the truth. Had they <hi>heard</hi> and <hi>learned</hi> of the Father, they would have received the ſpirit of truth; and the knowledge and ſpirit of truth could ſoon have removed their ignorance, corrected their errors, humbled their pride, mortified their ſelf-righteous ſpirit, changed their hearts, and drawn them to receive his truth and righteouſneſs, and eternal life, through faith in his name. But they periſhed for <hi>lack of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> becauſe they would not hear and learn of God the Father— See John vi. 44.45.</p>
               <p>It is the excellency of the holy ſcriptures, above all other wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, that they contain and reveal to us the <hi>knowledge</hi> of this ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: and it is the excellency of the goſpel that it is the <hi>miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the ſpirit to ſinners, in its vital influences, by means of this <hi>knowledge.</hi> And it is this that cauſes the power of divine truth to be ſo omnipotent, when it takes hold of the mind. <hi>The words of Chriſt are ſpirit</hi> and <hi>life.</hi> And when divine truth enters the mind, how ſoon are the clouds of ignorance, darkneſs and error diſpelled from the underſtanding? What divine light doth it diffuſe through the ſoul? It gives life to the dead, and calls dead ſinners from their tombs; and gives light to the blind. This divine truth converts the ſoul—makes wiſe the ſimple—rejoices the heart—enlightens the eyes, and endures forever. By receiving the knowledge of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine truth, the poor will find gold tried in the fire, to enrich them! The naked will find white raiment to clothe them! And the blind find eye ſalve to reſtore their ſight! The truths of the goſpel are a feaſt provided by infinite wiſdom for hungry, periſhing ſouls: and they are offered to all; and if ſinners obtain the <hi>knowledge</hi> of them, they may expect that the ſpirit of truth will accompany them, and by his powerful influences, remove the corruption of the principle of the heart. Regeneration is produced in the <hi>principle</hi> of the ſoul, by an <hi>immediate, inſtantaneous, irreſiſtible</hi> operation of the ſpirit of God: but to obtain this knowledge, is a work of time and pain<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>: and all ſuch as arrive to a high degree of perfection in this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, free from errors and prejudices, before regeneration, will be full grown chriſtians, and able alſo to teach others, upon their firſt receiving this ſaving change by the ſpirit of God. But ſuch as have been regenerated forty years, but have made but ſmall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments in this orthodox knowledge of the ſcriptures, will be but <hi>babes</hi> in Chriſt, and <hi>novices</hi> in religion. "And when for the time they ought to have been teachers, they have need that one teach
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:020704_0049_0FB0A67CAF119750"/>
them again, which be the firſt principles of the oracles of God; and are become ſuch as have need of milk and not of ſtrong meat." See Heb. v. 12. But let their attainments in knowledge, before regeneration, be ever ſo high, unleſs they attain that <hi>pure</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or underſtanding of the truths of the goſpel, which is eſſential to ſalvation, all their attainments in knowledge will but ſerve to increaſe and aggravate their damnation. And they will not be able to excuſe themſelves by ſaying, that God withheld from them thoſe influences of his ſpirit that were needful to change their hearts. For unleſs they firſt obtain this knowledge themſelves, by attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the goſpel, they have no reaſon to expect the ſpirit will ever change their heart. But the blame will lie at their own door for neglecting theſe means and opportunities. And never think you have obtained this knowledge 'till you find a love to the truth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in your hearts. And none may expect to receive the ſpirit in its vital influences, and a love to the truth, but thoſe who firſt obtain this <hi>knowledge,</hi> in the exerciſe of their <hi>natural</hi> principles and powers. And this is called <hi>divine</hi> knowledge, as it is obtained only from the light of <hi>divine</hi> revelation, and not from the light of nature, by <hi>human</hi> reaſon. The moral law, and the light of nature, are a <hi>miniſtration</hi> of death and condemnation; but the goſpel is a <hi>miniſtration</hi> of the ſpirit of life and of <hi>righteouſneſs</hi>—See 2 Cor. iii. And this cauſes the goſpel to exceed all other diſpenſations in glory. And it is by <hi>hearing</hi> the goſpel, ſo as to obtain the <hi>knowledge</hi> of it, that the holy ſpirit of life is <hi>received</hi> by ſinners—See Gal. iii. 2. And faith comes by hearing the word of God—Rom. x. 17. And all ſaving bleſſings are communicated to ſinners through the <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt. Through this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge ſinners receive the holy ſpirit, in its regenerating influences, and ſo are made partakers of a divine nature, and eſcape the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the world—See 2 Pet. i. 2.3.4.</p>
               <p>After ſinners have obtained this knowledge of the truth, and ſo have received the ſpirit of truth, in its vital influences, and are regenerated by the ſpirit, they have the love of the truth; and this is called <hi>ſpiritual</hi> knowledge, as it is produced in <hi>principle, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately</hi> by the ſpirit of God, in what is called <hi>paſſive regeneration,</hi> and it is a <hi>ſenſe</hi> of <hi>heart,</hi> or <hi>perception</hi> of the <hi>ſpiritual beauty</hi> and <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency</hi> of divine objects, that are formed firſt in the underſtanding. But that knowledge, of which I am now ſpeaking, is very differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent from this <hi>ſpiritual</hi> knowledge: and it is called <hi>ſpeculative</hi> or <hi>doctrinal</hi> knowledge: and is not produced in the ſoul by the holy ſpirit in regeneration, as ſpiritual knowledge is; but by objective light let into the underſtanding, and it may be produced before the <hi>ſpirit</hi> is <hi>received</hi>; but <hi>ſpiritual</hi> knowledge cannot. And it is this <hi>ſpeculative,</hi> divine knowledge of the ſaving truths contained in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine revelation, that the Pſalmiſt eſteemed above gold, yea above
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:020704_0050_0FB0A67E35204BC8"/>
much fine gold. And the wiſe man commends ſo highly, in his writings under the name of <hi>wiſdom</hi> and <hi>underſtanding,</hi> and exhorts ſinners to ſeek to obtain, with the greateſt vigour and perſeverance. This is that knowledge which the Apoſtle Paul prefers to all the wiſdom of this world, and all the knowledge of the learned Grecian and Heathen princes and philoſophers. This is not the knowledge which man's wiſdom teacheth, but which the holy ghoſt teacheth, not in regeneration, but in divine revelation.</p>
               <p>This knowledge is called <hi>life eternal,</hi> by our bleſſed Saviour. And wherever this ſpeculative divine knowledge is received into the ſoul, by ſaith and love, eternal life is already begun in that ſoul. And for the neglect of the means of obtaining this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, God had a controverſy with his people; and for lack of this knowledge his people were deſtroyed; and for rejecting it, God rejected his prieſts, See Hoſ. iv. This was all <hi>ſpeculative</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the ſcriptures, for theſe things could not be predicated of <hi>ſpiritual</hi> knowledge or <hi>love</hi> of the truth. And though this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and conviction of <hi>revealed</hi> truths, by means of which the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is at firſt received in its vital influences, is not in itſelf ſaving to the ſinner that obtains it, 'till embraced by faith and love; but may be rejected by enmity and unbelief, and ſo increaſe his dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: yet it is eſſential to the exiſtence, exerciſe, and increaſe of every ſaving grace and virtue. There can be no ſaving con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, repentance, faith, love or ſpiritual knowledge, or well grounded hope, or joy, or happineſs in time, or in eternity with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it. Without it, ſinners cannot move one ſtep towards heaven; nor can ſaints grow in grace, or increaſe in happineſs any faſter than they grow in this knowledge.</p>
               <p>And all who have capacities, means and opportunities, may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this <hi>divine</hi> knowledge before they receive the ſpirit in its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generating influences, or have any <hi>ſaving</hi> change of heart, if they will but only apply their minds to the ſtudy of the goſpel, as of any other book, and make uſe of thoſe means and advantages for inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that all may enjoy, who live in a land of goſpel light. And it needs no very great capacities or great degrees of learning and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, in other things, in order to obtain this ſaving knowledge, if the mind be but free from error and prejudice. Not many wiſe men after <hi>the fleſh</hi> obtained this hnowledge, in the days of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour and his apoſtles; becauſe they were ſo conceited of their own knowledge and goodneſs, and prejudiced in favour of error, that they would not attend to divine inſtruction. But babes and ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and publicans and harlots and Peter's bearers, many of whom, it is probable, could not read a word, and had but ſmall na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural capacities, but free from prejudicies and errors, could obtain it in a ſhort time, by attending in earneſt to the means of inſtruction. And by obtaining this knowledge, they received the ſpirit, and
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:020704_0051_0FB0A6827410EB20"/>
were regenerated and converted by his preaching. And the firſt ſtep that you muſt take, in order to your being made partakers of this ſalvation, is, to obtain this <hi>ſpeculative</hi> knowledge of the truths contained in divine revelation. This is the <hi>key,</hi> by means of which, ſinners enter into the kingdom of Chriſt; and till this is obtained, no ſinner can enter the <hi>ſtrait gate</hi>; or go one ſtep to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards heaven, or ever ſee, receive or enjoy any of the benefits of the goſpel. But ſuch as obtain this knowledge, are not far from the kingdom of God, but are lifted up to heaven, though they may be caſt down to hell at laſt, for not receiving it with faith and love. But none may expect to receive the ſpirit of truth, or any ſaving change of heart by the influences of the ſpirit, or to receive the truth with faith and love, 'till they firſt obtain this ſpeculative knowledge of the truth. And therefore, when God deſigns to communicate his ſpirit, in its vital influences, he firſt ſends the means of this knowledge to that people, by the diſpenſers of the goſpel; and in this way, he is often found of them that ſought him not, and made manifeſt to them that aſked not after him.</p>
               <p>As in Ezekiel's viſion, "whither the ſpirit was to go, there the living creatures went." Theſe living creatures are the diſpenſers of the goſpel; and theſe always go before the ſpirit of truth; that they may communicate the truth, and make manifeſt the ſavour of the <hi>knowledge</hi> of Chriſt, in every place. And where the teachers are eſſentially ignorant or erroneous in their inſtructions, they take away the <hi>key</hi> of knowledge from the people that depend upon their inſtructions. And they enter not into the kingdom of heaven them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and thoſe that are entering they hinder. And if ſinners will neglect to <hi>hear</hi> and <hi>read</hi> and attend to the goſpel, where it is diſpenſed in the power and purity of it, but will read corrupt books, and having itching ears, will run after ignorant, enthuſiaſtic erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous, corrupt teachers, they muſt periſh for lack of ſaving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, however learned and knowing they may be, in other things. "For, if the blind lead the blind they will both fall into the ditch." And though many may eſteem this knowledge of ſalvation by the croſs of Chriſt, <hi>unintelligible</hi> or <hi>myſterious</hi> fooliſhneſs, and ſo may periſh in their ſin, rather than attend to it, and ſeek to underſtand it; yet, it pleaſes God by the preaching of this <hi>fooliſhneſs</hi> to ſave them that believe. And it is the great buſineſs of the miniſters of Chriſt to exhort, and ſtir up unregenerate, chriſtleſs ſinners, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend and ſeek with the greateſt earneſtneſs and perſeverance, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this knowledge in the firſt place. Miniſters cannot produce re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, love of the truth, repentance, faith or any grace in the hearts of ſinners, by their inſtructions or exhortations; this is the <hi>ſole</hi> work of the ſpirit: but miniſters can communicate this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and ſtir up ſinners to obtain it. — But you will ſay, are not all theſe exerciſes and endeavours of the unregenerate, chriſtleſs
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:020704_0052_0FB0A683E22ED2F0"/>
ſinner in obtaining this knowledge ſin? And does God require any ſuch exerciſes and endeavours? To theſe objections I anſwer, that theſe exerciſes are not ſin, in themſelves conſidered. The ſin of the unregenerate doth not conſiſt at all, in their attending on means; hearing, and ſeeking, and praying, and crying for mercy, and deliverance from hell, <hi>only</hi> from <hi>natural</hi> principles. Their ſin doth not conſiſt at all in the <hi>light</hi> or <hi>knowledge</hi> of the truth, which they obtain, before regeneration, but only in that enmity and unbelief which attends theſe exerciſes and endeavours; the ſtrength of which increaſes, as their light and knowledge of the truth increaſes. And more ſin may attend the exerciſes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, faith and love, in true believers, than attends the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, praying and ſeeking of the unregenerate; ſo that when we exhort unregenerate ſinners to exert theſe exerciſes and endeavours, while they have a wicked heart, we no more exhort them to ſin, than we exhort them to ſin, when we exhort them to repent and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, &amp;c. when we know that great enmity of heart to God, and aggravated ſins will attend theſe exerciſes. And it is no more <hi>for,</hi> or <hi>on account</hi> of the <hi>moral goodneſs</hi> that there is in faith, that the righteouſneſs of Chriſt is imputed to the believer; than it is <hi>for,</hi> or <hi>on account</hi> of the moral goodneſs that there is in the hearing, praying, and ſeekings of the unregenerate, that the holy ſpirit is communicated to them. And God can as conſiſtently communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the holy ſpirit, in its vital influences, to the unregenerate ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, in conſequence of his obtaining this orthodox knowledge of divine truth, and crying for mercy, as he can impute the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Chriſt to the believer, in conſequence of his faith in Chriſt. In Pſal. cvii. 6.13.19.28. we have inſtances of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable temporal deliverances granted to ſinners <hi>in conſequences</hi> of their prayers and cries to God for mercy, when it doth not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that their cries or prayers, proceeded from love or friendſhip to God; but purely from their ſenſe of their own danger, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction that there was no help for them but in God alone. And though this is act a <hi>moral,</hi> yet it is a <hi>natural preparation</hi> in ſinners to receive mercy from God.</p>
               <p>And God doth require theſe exerciſes and endeavours of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate. For this orthodox knowledge is as eſſential to ſaving repentance and faith as love is. And therefore, when God requires repentance and faith, he neceſſarily requires this knowledge, and every exerciſe and endeavour of obtaining it; and every thing that is eſſential to theſe graces, as much as he doth love, or the exerciſes of the graces themſelves. God never required a ſinner to repent and believe without this knowledge, for this would be a <hi>natural</hi> impoſſibility. And the ſoul cannot be good without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or have any holy exerciſes. And for any to ſay, they exhort
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:020704_0053_0FB0A685CEC324F0"/>
ſinners to repent and believe, but they do not exhort them firſt to obtain that knowledge which is eſſential to repentance and faith, is a ſoleciſm in ſpeech. And moreover, God expreſly commands ſinners to exert thoſe exerciſes and endeavours, which they may exert before regeneration; and which they muſt exert in order to obtain this knowledge, before they can receive the ſpirit of truth, or have any ſaving change. God calls upon the whole world to hear his word, Jer. xxii. 29. "Oh! earth, earth, earth, hear the word of the Lord."—And he expreſly commands the worſt of ſinners to <hi>hearken</hi> to him without any mention of their previouſly having a good heart. See Iſa. xlvi. 2. "Hearken un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, ye ſtout hearted ſinners that are far from righteouſneſs." And our bleſſed Saviour exhorts the ſelf-righteous Phariſees to <hi>ſearch the ſcriptures,</hi> in order to find eternal life. And numerous texts might be quoted, in which ſuch exerciſes are required, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined by God himſelf, as unregenerate ſinners may perform with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doing any <hi>duty acceptable</hi> to God. And ſinners are condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and deprived of great favours, for not exerting ſuch exerciſes and endeavours. But we cannot find one inſtance in the goſpel where God forbids theſe exerciſes, and commands ſinners, firſt to obtain a good heart, to love him, and a righteouſneſs of their own, or any morally good qualification, before they <hi>hear</hi> and <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand</hi> the goſpel—and ſeek and pray and cry for mercy. But ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are expreſſly exhorted to come to this fountain of knowledge and grace, without money and without price. Sinners ſhould come empty handed, deeply ſenſible that they have no righteouſneſs, no good heart, no <hi>moral</hi> qualification to bring with them; and utterly unable to change their own heart, or exerciſe love, or any grace: ſenſible that they are wretched, and miſerable, and poor, and blind, and naked; and cry unclean, unclean— God be merciful to me a <hi>ſinner!</hi> They muſt come to <hi>receive</hi> that which is <hi>freely given,</hi> and not to <hi>earn</hi> or <hi>purchaſe</hi> it with their <hi>good</hi> heart or <hi>good</hi> works. To ſay, <hi>I do not exhort you to come to hear the word, unleſs you come with a good heart,</hi> is <hi>legal</hi> preaching; and exceeding dangerous to the ſouls of ſinners: and tends to diſcourage the uſe of means, and tends to baniſh the <hi>knowledge of the goſpel,</hi> and all true religion out of the world.</p>
               <p>Supreme love to God, and perfect ſinleſs obedience to his will, were required in the covenant of works, as <hi>duties,</hi> and the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of eternal life. But hearing and obtaining the knowledge of of the goſpel, conviction and repentance of ſin, and faith in the Mediator, or love to God, or any act of obedience, are not requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under the goſpel as <hi>duties</hi> or <hi>conditions</hi> of obtaining the holy ſpirit, in its vital influences, or of pardon, juſtification and eternal life, but only as <hi>graces</hi> or the <hi>means of receiving</hi> theſe benefits.
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:020704_0054_0FB0A686EE595758"/>
And ſhall we exhort ſinners firſt, in the neglect of theſe means, to wait 'till they receive the holy ſpirit, and a good heart, and then to hear and uſe the means appointed by God, in the uſe of which they are to receive them? Is not this to pervert the order that God hath eſtabliſhed? Faith comes by hearing: but ſhall ſinners be exhorted to wait for faith before they hear?—The ſpirit comes by hearing, but ſhall ſinners wait 'tilll they receive the ſpirit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they hear? or ſhall ſinners be told that there is no <hi>probability</hi> of receiving the ſpirit or faith by hearing, unleſs they firſt have that good heart which the law requires?</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, If unregenerate ſinners may do that before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, by which the holy ſpirit is received in its vital influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and ſo hath a connection with eternal life, will they not have reaſon to boaſt as <hi>making themſelves</hi> to differ from thoſe who do not obtain ſalvation?—To this I anſwer, That the Apoſtle clears this objection—See 1 Cor. iv. 7. "For who maketh thee to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from another? And what haſt thou that thou didſt not <hi>receive?</hi> Now, if thou didſt <hi>receive</hi> it, why doſt thou glory as if thou hadſt not <hi>received</hi> it?" If we do not earn, procure, merit or purchaſe any fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, by all we do, but only <hi>receive</hi> it, as a beggar doth a free gift, what reaſon have we to glory or boaſt as if we made ourſelves to differ from others, who do not <hi>receive</hi> it? If we <hi>procured, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed</hi> or <hi>meritted</hi> it by what we do, then we ſhould have whereof to glory. The truth, the ſpirit, the Saviour and his righteouſneſs, and pardon, juſtification and eternal life, are all procured by God, and ſent down from heaven in the goſpel; and ſinners have nothing to do but to <hi>receive</hi> them as they are therein offered, by receiving the knowledge of the truth; and this none can do for them. But their <hi>merely receiving</hi> them by <hi>hearing</hi> and by <hi>faith,</hi> gives them no reaſon to boaſt or glory. It is by <hi>hearing</hi> and by <hi>faith,</hi> that ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is <hi>received,</hi> that it may be by grace; and thus the Apoſtle ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues, Eph. ii. 8.9. By grace are ye ſaved <hi>through faith,</hi> and therefore not of yourſelves; ſalvation is the gift of God. Not of works leſt any man ſhould boaſt. We do not change our heart our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, nor work faith in ourſelves, nor work out any righteouſneſs of our own, but they are all the <hi>gift</hi> of God, and the work of his ſpirit.</p>
               <p>Hath a condemned rebel any reaſon to glory, when a pardon is offered to him freely by his prince, and the prince inclines him to embrace it, (upon his hearing it) merely becauſe he received and heared it? It is true, if he never had heard and underſtood it, he never could have felt the influence of the truths contained in it; but this gives him no reaſon to boaſt.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, Is there not danger of promoting and encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging a ſelf-righteous ſpirit by ſuch exhortations?—To this I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:020704_0055_0FB0A6892193EE98"/>
That ſuch as are directed, exhorted, and prevailed upon to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, hear, and underſtand the truths of the goſpel, ſo as to obtain this ſpeculative, orthodox knowledge, and under the direction and influence of this, are praying, ſeeking, and crying for mercy, are in <hi>no danger</hi> of entertaining a ſelf-righteous ſpirit: but it is thoſe who cannot be prevailed upon to attend, hear and underſtand, ſo as to obtain this knowledge of the truth, that are in danger of this. The reaſon why the Phariſees, in our Saviour's time, entertained ſuch a ſpirit, was their <hi>ignorance</hi> of the goſpel method of ſalvation. And the reaſon why the Jews in the Apoſtle's time indulged this ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, was their <hi>lack</hi> of this knowledge; and they could not be prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon to hear and learn, ſo as to obtain it. The reaſon why they went about to eſtabliſh a righteouſneſs of their own, and did not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the righteouſneſs of God, was becauſe they were <hi>ignorant</hi> of God's righteouſneſs, as revealed in the goſpel—See Rom. x. 3, Remove this ignorance, by obtaining this orthodox knowledge, and a ſelf-righteous ſpirit will be ſoon cured; but it cannot be cured without this.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, Are there any <hi>promiſes</hi> made in ſcripture to theſe exerciſes and endeavours of unregenerate, chriſtleſs ſinners? And if not, what encouragement have they to exert them?—To this I anſwer, That I grant there are no <hi>abſolute</hi> promiſes made to theſe exerciſes and endeavours, and there is no <hi>indiſſoluble connection</hi> between ſinners exerting theſe exerciſes and endeavours, and their obtaining any ſaving benefit: yet there is ſuch a <hi>probable connection</hi> as gives them ſufficient encouragement to exert them in the moſt vigorous and perſevering manner, in order to obtain this orthodox knowledge of the truths of divine revelation, free from errors and prejudices; ſince this is the only way in which ſalvation can be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by ſinners. And if they receive it not in this way, they muſt periſh for the lack of this knowledge. Do we not all exert our endeavours in worldly concerns upon ſuch a probability? Doth not the farmer riſe early, and ſet up late; till his land, and plant and ſow? Doth not the merchant venture his whole intereſt to ſea, and the ſoldier face death in all its formidable ſhapes, upon a leſs probability? And is not this accounted a part of wiſdom in them? And is it not then a part of wiſdom in periſhing ſinners, to uſe thoſe means, and improve thoſe opportunities, in the uſe of which alone, they can expect to <hi>receive</hi> the ſalvation of their ſouls? When the probability of obtaining in this way is ſo great, and the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of their obtaining or not obtaining are ſo very important. If ſinners watch daily at wiſdom's gates, and wait at the poſts of her doors; if they attend to the holy ſcriptures, and incline their ear to wiſdom and apply their heart to underſtanding; if they ſeek her as ſilver and ſearch for her as for hid treaſure; they need not
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:020704_0056_0FB0A689E52D6908"/>
fear but they will obtain this orthodox knowledge: and if they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this <hi>knowledge</hi> of ſalvation, there is a <hi>great probability</hi> that they will obtain the ſalvation itſelf. There is a great probability (if not a certainty) that by obtaining this knowledge of the truth, they will <hi>receive</hi> the ſpirit of truth; and ſo convictions, repentance, faith and <hi>love,</hi> through the influences of the word and ſpirit of truth, and then eternal life will be begun in their ſouls. And it is highly probable, that not one in ten thouſand, who have obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this knowledge free from eſſential errors, in this life, ever fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of eternal ſalvation: and, perhaps, none ever fail but ſuch, as through an inordinate love of the world, and of error and ſin, and out of enmity and malice to the truth itſelf, ſin wilfully after they have received the knowledge of it; and to them there remains no more ſacrifice for ſin. And if any think they have obtained this knowledge, when they do not feel theſe effects upon their ſouls, they deceive themſelves: for our Saviour tells us expreſsly, <hi>"Every man,</hi> therefore, that hath heard and learned of the Father cometh unto me."—See John vi. 45.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, If this ſpeculative knowledge of the truths con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in divine revelation, muſt be obtained, before any one can receive the holy ſpirit in its vital influences, ſo as to be regenerated, or exerciſe repentance, faith, love, or any ſaving grace, what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of infants, who die before they are capable of receiving this knowledge; and of heathen, who have not the means of this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge?—To this I anſwer, That we have an account in ſcripture, of a certain <hi>ſupernatural, ſpiritual change,</hi> of which all the <hi>corrupt</hi> race of Adam muſt be the ſubjects, before they enter heaven: all that die in the moments of death, and all that ſhall be alive and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, till the ſecond coming of Chriſt, at the ſound of the laſt trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet: and all who are the ſubjects of this change, at death, in the moment in which the union between the ſoul and body is diſſolving, all <hi>moral corruption</hi> and <hi>evil</hi> ſhall be removed from the ſoul, and it ſhall be made perfect in holineſs, and prepared to paſs immediately into glory. And in order to the producing this change, no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth in the underſtanding of the ſubject of it, is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary; but it is produced by the <hi>immediate</hi> almighty power of the ſpirit of God. And the believer in Chriſt, who hath by faith in his merit given up himſelf and offspring to God, according to the covenant of grace, hath as good a foundation, from the declarations and promiſes of the covenant of grace to hope, that his infant child, that dies before it is capable of receiving the knowledge of the truth, may be the ſubject of this change as himſelf, who hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the knowledge of the truth. But none have any warrant from ſcripture (that I can ſee) to expect any other ſaving change will be produced in their own ſouls, or the ſouls of their children that
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:020704_0057_0FB0A68BD81373C0"/>
live to be capable of <hi>moral</hi> exerciſes, unleſs they firſt attend to the truth, as it is in Jeſus, and receive the ſpeculative knowledge of it, in ſome degree, ſo as to receive the ſpirit and exerciſe faith in the atonement. I doubt not but God is able, before death, to rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify the principle, and change the heart of thoſe who have no degree of this knowledge in their underſtanding: but I do not find that he hath any where declared in his word that he will; and I know of no inſtance in which he hath done it: for tho' it is ſaid concerning Jeremiah, that, before he came forth put of his mother's womb, God ſanctified him, and ordained him to be a prophet unto the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. And concerning Paul, that God ſeperated him from his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's womb to reveal his Son in him; yet theſe declarations do not imply that either of them were regenerated in their infancy; but only that they were by divine appointment ſeperated, ſanctified or ſet apart to office. But it appears inconſiſtent with the method of divine operation, to produce a principle of ſpiritual life in the ſoul <hi>long</hi> before provision is made for the ſupport of it, by the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth. And if this moral corruption is <hi>removed,</hi> by the ſpirit of God in infancy, then ſuch a child is free from original ſin and moral corruption, and different from the reſt of mankind, none of whom are freed from it till death.</p>
               <p>But I think parents have no warrant from ſcripture to hope that any of their children, that live to be capable of receiving this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, will receive the ſpirit, or be regenerated, till this knowledge of the truth is obtained by <hi>hearing</hi> and <hi>learning</hi> inſtruction from the word of God.</p>
               <p>And it is of the laſt importance, in this view of the matter, that parents begin early to inſtruct their children, and indoctrinate them in the truths of the goſpel, as they value their ſouls; and uſe theſe beſt endeavours to prevent their minds being corrupted by reading <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ad books, and hearkening to inſtructions which tend to prejudice their minds againſt the truth, and the orthodox miniſters of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. Parents ſhould train up their children in the <hi>nurture</hi> and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition of the Lord. "Whom ſhall he teach knowledge? (ſaith the prophet) Whom ſhall he make to underſtand doctrine? Them that are weaned from the milk, and drawn from the breaſts; for precept muſt be upon precept; precept upon precept; line upon line; line upon line; here a little and there a little."—Iſa. xxviii. 9.10.—And if parents would thus train up their children to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, hear and learn the <hi>truth,</hi> which is the <hi>way</hi> in which they ſhould go, they have great reaſon to hope, that they will <hi>receive</hi> the Knowledge of the <hi>truth,</hi> and the <hi>ſpirit of truth,</hi> and the love of the truth; and when they are old they will not depart from <hi>it.</hi> Some children have obtained ſo much knowledge of the truth at four years old, as hopefully to receive the ſpirit in its ſaving influences; where
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:020704_0058_0FB0A68CDDFE3CE8"/>
their attention to the truth hath been excited, in ſuch early life, by the converſation of thoſe under convictions, and ſerious impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
               <p>And children ſhould conſider of what importance it is, in this view, to attend to religious inſtructions in early life; when their minds are moſt free from prejudices and errors. And then it may be ſaid of you that are young, to your great honour and everlaſting happineſs, as it was of Timothy, That from children you have <hi>known</hi> the holy ſcriptures, which are able to make you wiſe to ſalvation, through faith which is in Chriſt Jeſus. But if you will not attend and obtain this knowledge now, you will mourn at the laſt, when your fleſh and body is conſumed, ſaying, "How have I hated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and my heart deſpiſed reproof? And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined my ear to them that inſtructed me? (I was whiſpering, or laughing, or ſleeping, or my eyes and heart were wandering) and I was almoſt in all evil, in the midſt of the congregation and aſſembly."— See Prov. v. 11 &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But to return from this digreſſion. As to the heathen, or thoſe who have not the written word; though God is under no obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſend the <hi>means</hi> of knowledge to any people, yet, the apoſtle aſſures us, that the goſpel hath been preached to every creature which is under heaven—See Col. i. 23. "And have not they all heard (ſaith the apoſtle) their ſound went unto all the earth, and their word unto the ends of the world."—See Rom. x. 18. So that all nations may have the <hi>means</hi> of knowledge, though they have not the written word. But ſuch as have not capacities, means or opportunities of obtaining this knowledge, will not be condemned for not receiving the ſpirit, or not repenting, or not believing in Chriſt; but for the want of that <hi>principle</hi> of love to God, and <hi>obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> to his will, which is required in the moral law, or in the law of nature, written on men's hearts. But all thoſe who are favoured with the goſpel, and have capacities to obtain this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and do not improve the capacities, means and opportunities they have, will have this for their aggravated condemnation; that light is come into the world, and they have loved darkneſs rather than light, and would not come to the light.</p>
               <p>But to conclude, We are all ſenſible that ignorance of the ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing truths of the goſpel prevails at the preſent day; notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the <hi>means</hi> of knowledge we enjoy. And by reaſon of this ignorance and error is overſpreading the chriſtian world like a flood: and iniquity abounds; and the love of many waxes cold. And what method ſhall be taken for a remedy? The only probable method is this; The miniſters of the goſpel, like the living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in Ezekiel's viſion, muſt take the lead in this affair. They muſt wake up, and preach the law, and goſpel diſtinctly; and
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:020704_0059_0FB0A6909781AB70"/>
not blend them together; but rightly divide the word of truth, and exhort, and ſtir up the attention of ſinners to the truth, by the manifeſtation of it to every man's conſcience; and by this means remove the darkneſs, and ignorance and error that overvails their their underſtandings, and communicate to them the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the ſcriptures: for this is not the work of the ſpirit, but of the word of truth. And withal pray earneſtly that the law may prove a miniſtration of condemnation and death to their ſins; and the goſpel a miniſtration of the ſpirit, of righteouſneſs and life to their ſouls. And then exhort ſinners under theſe bleſſed influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to repent of ſin, believe in Chriſt, love God, and bring forth the fruits of the ſpirit.</p>
               <p>Should we excite in ſinners minds ſtrong conditions of their ſin and danger, by ſetting before them the terrors of the law, and exhorting them to repent; yet unleſs by obtaining this knowledge of the goſpel method of ſalvation, ignorance and error are remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from their underſtandings, they will be in imminent danger of ſettling down on a falſe foundation; and receiving a falſe hope and joy; notwithſtanding any internal influences of the ſpirit that they can receive by hearing the law. To attend to the goſpel, and read it, and hear it preached; and ſeek to have a right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the truths contained in it; is the firſt and principal direction to be be given to ſinners, that are under awakenings and convictions. For by the knowledge of the truth, the ſpirit muſt be received, in its regenerating influences; and this knowledge muſt lay the foundation for the exerciſe of every grace in the ſoul. And the hope and joy of ſinners, if not founded in the knowledge of the truth, will finally leave them aſhamed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If we are wiſe preachers, we ſhall teach the people knowledge. And if we are paſtors according to God's heart, we ſhall feed them with knowledge and underſtanding:</hi> and with Paul, <hi>we ſhall reaſon with them out of the ſcriptures.</hi> And to arreſt their attention, we are not firſt to addreſs ourſelves to their <hi>love</hi> of the truth, but to their fears of hell; and endeavour to convince them of the neceſſity and importance of their receiving the knowledge of the truth, as the only means of preſerving the life, and reſtoring the health of their precious and immortal ſouls. And ſinners muſt hear and ſeek to obtain the knowledge of the truth with ſilent attention; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on the word, and ſpirit of truth to move their affections; excite convictions, repentance, faith and love in their hearts; and then they will be genuine.</p>
               <p>And all ſinners, who have capacity, means and opportunity of obtaining this knowledge, are under infinite obligation to repent of ſin, believe Chriſt Jeſus, and love God, and give themſelves up to him with all their heart <hi>immediately,</hi> and be baptized, and come
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:020704_0060_0FB0A691877FFBA0"/>
to his table; and their want of this knowledge doth not excuſe their neglect one moment. Jeſus Chriſt and his apoſtles exhorted ſinners to repent, believe and love God, and become friends to Chriſt <hi>immediately,</hi> and made no allowance for their <hi>want</hi> of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; though it is eſſential to the exerciſe of every grace.—But inſtead of making the <hi>want</hi> of it an excuſe for their continuing impenitent and in unbelief, under the light of the goſpel, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it as the formal cauſe of their blame, and moſt aggravated condemnation.—And they exhort them to repent and believe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, though at the ſame time they let them know that they cannot come to Chriſt 'till they <hi>hear</hi> and <hi>learn</hi> of the Father. But their not hearing and learning and obtaining this knowledge, where they have the means, is no excuſe for their impenitency and unbelief.—And their hearing and learning and obtaining this knowledge, will not ſave them in their impenitency and unbelief, or be any alleviation of their condemnation; but will greatly ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate it if they finally periſh.</p>
               <p>The holy ſcriptures are a compleat and perfect rule; and the only rule to direct ſinners to happineſs; as you may ſee, 2 Tim. iii. 15.16.17. Let no man, therefore, that deſires to be a preacher of the goſpel, depend on the light of natural reaſon, or on human wiſdom, or on the internal light or influences of the holy ſpirit in regeneration, or on his ſpiritual knowledge or love of the truth, or on any new revelation, to teach and inſtruct him what to ſay, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to excite affections in others: but firſt ſeek to obtain this ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox knowledge of the holy ſcriptures, which Timothy had before he was regenerated; and keep up his attention to this, 'till he finds he hath obtained a large degree of it, and alſo received the holy ſpirit in its vital influences, and the ſpiritual knowledge, or love of the truth, and ſaving faith in Jeſus Chriſt; before he begins to preach: for the light of natural reaſon, or human wiſdom, or this internal light or <hi>love</hi> of divine truth, qualifies no man to preach the goſpel, unleſs he firſt obtain a good degree of this orthodox know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the holy ſcriptures. "To the law and to the teſtimony, if they ſpeak not according to this word, it is becauſe there is no light in them."—Iſa. viii. 20. For miniſters to tell their own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences, or the experiences of others, or dreams or viſions, and impulſes and feelings, to excite affections in others, is not preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the word of God, which is the only <hi>infallible rule</hi>; but ſuch preaching cauſes people to err and think light of the word of God, and forget his name—See Jer. xxiii. 26.27.28, "The prophet that hath a dream, let him tell a dream; and he that hath my word, let him ſpeak my word <hi>faithfully</hi>: what is the chaff to the wheat? ſaith the Lord. Is not my word like a fire? ſaith the Lord; and
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:020704_0061_0FB0A6930D013D28"/>
like a hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces?" By this rule, every ſpirit muſt be tried, to know whether it be of God or not. "The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the ſoul—Pſal. xix. 7.</p>
               <p>By the law of the Lord here, we are not to underſtand the <hi>moral law</hi> excluſive of the goſpel; but the word of God including both: for the moral law is only a miniſtration of condemnation and death, and all that this law can do, is to <hi>convince</hi> and <hi>condemn</hi> the ſinner: it cannot <hi>convert</hi> without the goſpel, which is the only miniſtration of the ſpirit, of righteouſneſs and of life; and unleſs a ſinner hath the knowledge of Chriſt, and faith in him, he never will be converted from the love of ſin to the love of holineſs, by the preaching of the moral law. It is only where the goſpel comes that ſinners are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated and converted.</p>
               <p>But if deiſts or infidels, arians, ſocinians, ſelf-righteous moral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts, anti-nomians, univerſaliſts and enthuſiaſts, who are led away by ſuch errors and deluſions at the preſent day, could but be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon, ſo to attend to the goſpel as to obtain an orthodox knowledge and underſtanding of it, what a great alteration it would cauſe in their minds? How ſoon it would remove their ignorance, errors and prejudices; humble their pride, overcome their enmity, mortify their ſelf-righteous ſpirit, convert their ſouls, and make them wiſe to ſalvation? But if they cannot be prevailed upon to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the goſpel, and underſtand the truths of it, they muſt periſh for lack of this knowledge and conviction, tho' they have means in plenty, becauſe they will not make uſe of them!</p>
               <p>And ſinners, by turning a deaf ear to the truths of the goſpel, ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their eyes againſt the light, and rejecting the means of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, vex the holy ſpirit of God, ſtifle his bleſſed motions on their hearts, quench his influences, and ſend him away grieved; and ſo reject God and Chriſt, and his goſpel, and judge themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of eternal life; and provoke God to ſay, "My ſpirit ſhall no longer ſtrive with them; but I will give them up to their own hearts luſts, to walk in their own counſels."—See Pſal. lxxxi. And God will become their irreconcileable enemy, and fight againſt them; and ſwear in his wrath, that they ſhall never enter into his reſt. "And becauſe they received not the <hi>truth</hi> in the love of it, that they might be ſaved, God ſhall ſend them ſtrong deluſion, that they ſhould believe a lie; that they all may be damned who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not the truth; but had pleaſure in unrighteouſneſs." And when they go down to hell, their <hi>neglect</hi> of <hi>particular</hi> opportunities of attending and ſeeking will haunt their guilty conſciences for ever and ever. And they will not be able then to relieve their minds by caſting off any blame from themſelves upon the decrees of God, as the <hi>cauſe</hi> of their not being regenerated and ſaved—
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:020704_0062_0FB0A6946100E9E0"/>
To ſay, the reaſon why they were not regenerated was, becauſe they were not elected, or becauſe they were decreed from all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to damnation; and therefore God could not regenerate them, would be blaſphemy againſt God; —ſince the only cauſe will appear to be, their not improving their capacities, means and opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of attending to the holy ſcriptures, ſo as to obtain the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the ſaving truths therein contained, or rejecting them with enmity and malice.</p>
               <p>And how great muſt be the ſin and guilt of thoſe, who ſay any thing that tends to diſcourage unregenerate ſinners in uſing the means, or attending on a preached goſpel? Such are acceſſary to the great evil of deſtroying ſouls; by cauſing them to provoke God to withdraw his holy ſpirit.</p>
               <p>And what great reaſon have ſinners to condemn themſelves, and lament their folly, that they have neglected ſo many means and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of obtaining the knowledge of theſe divine and ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing truths!—And for the time to come to double their diligence!</p>
               <p>And if you want <hi>evidence</hi> for faith, look into the word of God, and ſee how all the types and prophecies are fullfilled in Chriſt. The types have a peculiar reſpect to his being delivered up by his Father; and offering up himſelf, his liberty, life and <hi>divine glory</hi>; to be conquered, ſlain and reproached by his enemies, and ſo by them be made a victim and ſacrifice. And the prophecies have a peculiar reference to his conquering and ſlaying his enemies, by means of his being thus conquered and ſlain by them; and ſo final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly making them his victims and ſacrifice. And who could have pointed out this wonderful affair, in ſuch a clear manner, in ſuch early ages, but a God of infinite wiſdom? Attend to this plan of ſalvation, and you will find it carries its own evidence with it. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the true knowledge and underſtanding of it, and ſee what a ſtrange effect this knowledge and conviction of divine truth will have upon your minds; when attended with the ſpirit of truth!—What a wonderful effect it had upon the mind of <hi>Soame Jenyns,</hi> Eſq. He was once a ſtrong deiſt, but he tells us, that when he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied his mind to the ſtudy of the holy ſcripture, "on a candid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry he ſoon found that its pretenſions of a ſupernatural revelation from God were founded on the moſt ſolid grounds." And what a wonderful effect hath this knowledge had upon the minds of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, erroneous, ſelf righteous and ſtout hearted ſinners, that were far from having a good heart, or any righteouſneſs that could ſave them, when they firſt attended to it?</p>
               <p>And if you want <hi>power</hi> and <hi>ſtrength</hi> to remove the moral corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your hearts, and enable you to repent of ſin, and believe in Chriſt, and work out your own ſalvation: attend to the goſpel;
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:020704_0063_0FB0A695E05121E0"/>
hear and underſtand the truths therein contained. This is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly way to have the ſpirit of God work in you, to will and to do, of his good pleaſure. It is only through the knowledge of the truths of the goſpel that you can receive from God grace to pardon or ſtrength to help. You can derive no ſaving influences but in this way.—O prize divine revelation! Bleſs God for the goſpel! give heed to it, as to a light that ſhines in a dark place! On the word of God you muſt truſt. On this you muſt found all your hopes. From this the believer derives all his comforts—all his ſtrength and all his joys! Improve the goſpel, as you value your ſouls eternal peace and happineſs. Sell all to purchaſe this field, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains this treaſure of great price! Love to the word is the beſt evidence of love to God.</p>
               <p>And if you want motive to repent and believe, attend to the truths of the goſpel. The goſpel contains ſufficient motives, and they will prove effectual if you attend to them; and they are accompanied by the efficacious influences of the ſpirit of God: and you cannot expect theſe efficacious influences in any other way, but by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining this knowledge.</p>
               <p>And will you neglect and miſimprove all your preſent privileges and opportunities of receiving this great ſalvation, upon a vain preſumption that you will have another ſtate of probation, and time of trial, after this life is ended? And that your puniſhment will not be eternal though you die under the power and guilt of ſin, in impenitency and unbelief.—It is very evident that the doctrine of universal ſalvation, or another ſtate of probation for ſinners is not from God; and is not contained in divine revelation—Chriſt and his apoſtles never preached it; if they had, the contrary doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine never could have had ſuch a ſpread in the world; nor would they have been perſecuted as they were; becauſe this doctrine is ſo agreeable to the corrupt taſte of mankind, and gives them ſuch a high ſecurity for another world; that they would have held faſt the doctrine upon ſo great an authority, and carreſſed the diſpenſers of it. And if it had been true, undoubtedly our bleſſed Saviour could and would have taught it plainly, without any reſerve, Jeſus Chriſt taught the contrary. He declares, that he that believes not ſhall be damned. But as the devil contradicted the expreſs decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of God to our firſt parents; ſo he doth now the expreſs decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of our bleſſed Saviour.</p>
               <p>But if what hath been ſaid upon this ſubject is true, ſin is an infinite evil, and the ſinner doth deſerve an endleſs puniſhment, and God cannot remit it conſiſtently with his righteouſneſs, as mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Governour, unleſs the ſinner is united to Chriſt by faith and ſo intereſted in that infinite atonement and ſatiſfaction which
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:020704_0064_0FB0A69762FF88A0"/>
he hath made at ſuch an infinite expence. And ſinners may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this atonement new, if they will; and it is ſufficient for all. And the offer is made to all that hear the goſpel. And all that have ſufficient capacities, means and opportunities to obtain the knowledge of it muſt be without excuſe, if they do not believe in Chriſt, and receive this ſalvation immediately. And if they <hi>will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully</hi> miſimprove. all theſe now, what reaſon can be given why they ſhould have another ſtate of probation; God hath no where revealed any other ſtate of probation; and reaſon forbids there ſhould be another. And all the perfections of God ſtand oppoſed to it. God hath declared in his word, that whom this ſtate is at an end with ſinners, his ſpirit ſhall no longer ſtrive with them. He that is filthy muſt therefore remain ſo ſtill. And that ſinners are expoſed to <hi>eternal damnation</hi>; and that their puniſhment ſhall be <hi>everlaſting</hi> and have no end, cannot be expreſſed in any ſtronger terms, of which we can conceive. The <hi>eternity</hi> of ſinners torments are expreſſed in the ſame words by which the eternity of God's exiſtence, and the duration of the ſaints happineſs in heaven are expreſſed. And had God revealed another ſtate of probation for thoſe who are diſpoſed <hi>willfully</hi> to neglect and miſimprove the preſent, he muſt future ſtate the whole deſign of this ſtate. And you cannot expect any future ſtate of probation, unleſs God ſhould deny himſelf, prove <hi>falſe</hi> to his threatening, and <hi>flexible</hi> in his juſtice, and <hi>unkind</hi> to the loyal ſubjects of his kingdom; by deſtroying the very foundation of moral government. But if you believe not, "God abideth faithful, he cannot deny himſelf."</p>
               <p>And is it poſſible that Doctor <hi>Chauncy,</hi> with all his learning, and corrupt criticiſm—or that the deiſts, and univerſaliſts can perſuade men, that have the holy ſcriptures in their hands, and are endued with reaſon and underſtanding, capable of judging and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining what is beſt, to believe that they are acting a wiſe part, when they <hi>willfully</hi> neglect and miſimprove the preſent glorious opportunities and advantages for ſecuring to themſelves a bleſſed immortality; upon the <hi>preſumption,</hi> that God will grant them an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other ſtate of probation; if they <hi>wilfully</hi> abuſe this!—But O look forward to the great day—when Chriſt ſhall be revealed from heaven to take vengeance on them that now <hi>know</hi> not God and <hi>obey</hi> not the goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who muſt be puniſhed with <hi>everlaſting</hi> deſtruction from the preſence of the Lord and the <hi>glory of his power!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And do you not believe there will be ſuch a day! when the heavens ſhall be on fire, and the elements ſhall melt with fervent heat, and the earth and all things that are therein ſhall be burnt up. And the Judge ſhall deſcend, with all his angels; and the
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:020704_0065_0FB0A6992029F2A0"/>
trumpet ſhall ſound, and the dead ſhall be raiſed, and all nations ſhall be gathered before his auguſt tribunal; and the righteous ſhall be placed on his right hand, and the wicked on his left—and each one hear his final and irreverſible ſentence proceed from his mouth!</p>
               <p>And oh how happy will be your caſe then, if you ſhall be found to have ſo well improved your preſent opportunities, and ſtate of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, as to <hi>receive</hi> the knowledge and ſpirit of truth, and the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; and be cloathed with his infinite righteouſneſs and merit, and adorned with the graces of his ſpirit? Then will you lift up your heards with joy, at the proſpect of your compleat redemption from all ſin, ſorrow and death! Then will you hear that heart-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving ſentence, "Come, ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom prepared for you from the foundation of the world" And them you will be admitted into the joy of your Lord; where you will ſpend an eternity in ſinging anthems to Him, who hath loved you and waſhed you in his own blood from all your ſins. To which bleſſed ſtate and employment, may God of his infinite mercy, in Jeſus Chriſt, bring us all. AMEN.</p>
