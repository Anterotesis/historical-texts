            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>CONSIGNED to the benignant ſmile or a capricious frown of a diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted public, theſe humble pages are preſented as the genuine dictates of the moment of imagination, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biaſſed by the aſſiſtance of compila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to frame their fable, or veil its imperfections; traced by the pen of juvenility, and ſacred alone to the inſpiration of compaſſion that excit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the idea of attempting a ſimple tale free from the corruption of guile, for the ſole endeavour of raiſing a trivial ſum for the benefit of a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſed Orphan, deprived of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of ſight, and thereby rendered
<pb facs="unknown:029134_0003_0FDFAC8A32DBD238"/>
incapable of maintaining herſelf, conſequently dependant on the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity of thoſe whom Heaven has deigned to crown with affluence, and inſpired their hearts with libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality to relieve the child of ſorrow.</p>
            <p>Under the auſpices of a generous public ſhould this humble attempt meet a favourable reception, the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venile Authoreſs can alone impute its ſucceſs to their benevolence, and trembling at the critic's glance of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precation, conſoles herſelf only with the hope that reflection will whiſper the unfeigned reality of its deſign, and the tear of pity fall on its errors, while the ſoul of ſenſibility will anticipate the tortures of ſuſpenſe for its fate under ſuch intereſting circumſtances.</p>
            <p>Conſcious deference ſhrinking like the tender ſenſitive, droops with fear, and the ſunſhine of approbation can alone revive it; but if blighted by the breath of cenſure, alas! the

ſtorm that levels the fancy-nurſed embryo will deſolate all future bloom. Relying on the humanity of an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging public, the orphan's devot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed prayer ſhall riſe to heaven as the grateful incenſe of a heart overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the effuſion of ſenſibility, indebted to their generoſity, and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply recompenced by the lenient ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, the honeſt gleam of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude will ever glow in the heart of their</p>

               <p>AUGUSTUS Tankerville, Marquis of Sevig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, was a native of Switzerland, the laſt deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant of an ancient and noble family, who on the deceaſe of his Marchioneſs, came over to reſide in England, in o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r to try if by changing the ſcene he could divert the melancholy which was his inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable companion, in the ſouthern clime.</p>
               <p>The Dowager Lady Mentoria, his aunt, who was fondly endeared to him during the whole courſe of his life, determined to accompany him and his charming offspring; the eldeſt of whom,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:029134_0006_0FDFAC947B041BC8"/>
a ſon, had very lately taken the title of St. Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens, and the ladies, Adela and Louiſa, were then in their ſeventeenth and eighteenth years, charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accompliſhed women, who had improved an elegant education by a refined underſtanding mould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to every impreſſion of virtue and genius; in ſhort it was an arduous deciſion to adjudge the prize of beauty or ſenſibility to one in preference to the other.</p>
               <p>Lady Adela was tall and of exquiſite pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, and her complexion beautifully tranſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent; and the roſeat bloom of health diffuſed its beauties on her cheek, her profuſe hair of the pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt brown, and the benignant ſoftneſs that beam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from her fine blue eyes, gave her the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a celeſtial divinity.</p>
               <p>Lady Louiſa was rather ſhorter than he ſiſter, yet ſufficiently tall to be a gracefully elegant figure. Her hair was auburn, and ſported in the fantaſtic luxuriance of nature on a boſom and ſhoulders of the fineſt form; her complexion clear, her teeth beautifully white and regular, and a thouſand dimples played round her coral lips; her eyes were dark and expreſſive, yet tempered with ineffable ſweetneſs; her voice exquiſitely melodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and her genius lively and expanded; of the French and Italian languages ſhe was perfect miſtreſs; the ſcience of muſic was her chief delight,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:029134_0007_0FDFAC96473C6AC0"/>
and ſhe touched the piano and harp to perfection; in the dance ſhe was the ſprightly aerial of the ſcene, where her inimitable attitude and grace captivated every beholder.</p>
               <p>Lady Adela with a conſtitution more delicate, had never ſtudied to excel in that accompliſhment, yet ſhe joined the feſtive group, with a peculiar degree of graceful eaſe, but her principal perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion conſiſted in copying minutely elegant draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, from the choiceſt collection of the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent proficients, add to which her natural taſte, and the pictureſque views that bounded the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines of the caſtle, gave unlimited ſcope to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lific and accurate traces of her animated crayon.</p>
               <p>Her amiable brother, Lord Edwin St. Laurens, poſſeſſed a noble ſpirit, a generous expanſion of ſoul, and an underſtanding chaſte and refined, while liberality, gratitude, and generoſity were the aſpiring virtues of his heart. He was now juſt of age, and was preparing to make an excur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="10" facs="unknown:029134_0008_0FDFAC989CC0FE10"/>
"for there," ſighed he, "in a romantic cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, on the mountains dwells my ſweet little Marcella, and if you will indulge me, honoured Sir, in this requeſt, my life and ſervices ſhall be ever devoted in gratitude." A manly tear was haſtily bruſhed away, and Lord Edwin's acquieſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent ſmile ſealed his hopes.</p>
               <p>The morning of departure arrived, and the Marquis embracing his ſon, bid him write often, and never forget he had left a parent in England, anxious for the welfare of a dear and loved child, the pride and glory of his declining years.</p>
               <p>Lord Edwin preſſed his hand, uttered an affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate avowel of obedience, and tenderly ſalut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his lovely ſiſters, departed from the caſtle.</p>
               <p>The faithful Carlos, all gratitude for the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of attending his maſter, redoubled his aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duity on every occaſion. Carlos, though the ſon of a Swiſs peaſant, poſſeſſed great natural abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and had been inſtructed in the early part of his life in many neceſſary accompliſhments, to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil the duties of his preſent ſtation, by a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man reſiding in Savoy, who had recommended him to the patronage of Lord Edwin about two years ſince, poſſeſſing great good nature and a natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lively diſpoſition: Lord Edwin would often wonder at the viſible gloom that ſometimes over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:029134_0009_0FDFAC9A57588C18"/>
his countenance, in ſpite of every endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to conceal it, but ſince the name of Marcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la had eſcaped his lips, he was all life, all happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and merrily paſſed the hours with due defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and diſtinction to his noble maſter, who was now at no loſs to gueſs the cauſe of his ſuſpicions.</p>
               <p>About the ſecond week they arrived at the foot of the mountain, on whoſe ſummit the well known cottage of Marcella's parents reared its humble ſhelter; Carlos ſwiftly darting to the door, peep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through the caſement, and gently tapped, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly the latch was drawn and Marcella flew to the arms of Carlos.—Lord Edwin ſeated at a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance on an impending jut of the craggy ſteep, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held with delight the faithful and ſincere raptures of theſe artleſs lovers. Marcella was a pretty little figure, habited in a pale brown ſtuff jacket, with a ſhort blue petticoat, that diſplayed one of the prettieſt legs and yellow ſlippers in Savoy; her dark ringlets were confined by a blue ſilk net, through the folds of which many ſportive curls wantoned o'er her poliſhed forehead, a ſmall hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchief of lawn ſhaded her boſom, and on her arm was ſuſpended a baſket of luxuriant grapes juſt gathered from the vineyard behind the cottage.</p>
               <p>After the moment of ſurpriſe was over, ſhe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced with Carlos towards Lord Edwin, and
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:029134_0010_0FDFAC9F25B6E458"/>
modeſtly offering the produce of her baſket, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated his Lordſhip to walk in and take ſhelter from the meridian ſun-beams, as the day was grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſultry. A cluſter of the purple vintage was as gratefully accepted as beſtowed, but the viſit to the cottage was declined; Lord Edwin in fact did not mean to intrude on the worthy inmates, but wiſhed to ſtroll and amuſe himſelf for half an hour, he then promiſed Carlos he ſhould return in three days and paſs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Marcella's eyes glowing with delight ſeemed to thank him, and Carlos, filled with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of his kindneſs, bowed his grateful ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments of the favour conferred with ſo much real condeſcenſion.</p>
               <p>Lord Edwin kept his promiſe of ſparing the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raptured Carlos, but his departure mightily plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him, the poor fellow had ariſen by day break, and at five he crept down ſtairs to wake the ſer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vants, and ſaddle his mule, which he faſtened to the back gate, and entering the hall was met by Lord Edwin, who, tempted by the beauty of the morning, had aroſe to give him ſome orders for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got the preceding evening.
<q>Are you already equipped, Carlos?</q>
                  <q>Yes, my Lord, I ſhall now be off in five minutes,</q>
anſwered he, very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberately, tying up his little bundle of linen, in which he had actually packed up one boot: Lord

               <p>"Stop, Carlos," cried Lord Edwin, "do they uſually travel here with one boot?"—Carlos in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly caſt his eyes on his right leg, and beheld it only equipped with a ſtocking and ſlipper:
"'Tis very true my Lord," anſwered he, <q>but heaven knows where I have left it.</q> 
                  <q>Why, if you ſhould have occaſion to make uſe of it,</q>

                  </gap>,

Carlos inſtantly laid his hand on the handkerchief and to his great confuſion felt the truth of his conviction: "Bleſs my heart," cried h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<q>'twas Walter's fault, for he was aſking me ſo many queſtions about Marcella all the time, that I could attend to nothing but the pleaſure of gratifying his inquiries.</q>
Lord Edwin en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed a hearty laugh at the buſtle that detained the anxious traveller, who had not even waited to ſwallow a morſel of breakfaſt, but a few mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

               <p>LORD EDWIN's tour again commenced and he determined viſiting the Vale of Chamouny, he therefore hired a guide and bent his courſe to that beautifully romantic ſcene. Here he reſted to contemplate the roſeat tints of morn interſperſed with golden fluids, reflecting its glowing beam on on the ſummit of the mountains: A murmuring caſcade broke the ſolemn ſilence that reigned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round; the dulcet notes of a ſhepherd's pipe waft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the boſom of the breeze ſounded from the valley; here a huge cliff bent its lowering brow majeſtically grand; there one more fertilized ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited the traces of the plough, on its rugged ſides, while blooming wild weeds luxuriantly hung in waving wreaths from innumerable im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending projections of rocks; many beautiful va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant rills gently ſtole through various crevices, while ſome impeded in their courſe by rude frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſtone impetuouſly broke a paſſage and precipitated the ſparkling foam down a tremendous
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:029134_0014_0FDFACAC16C0B118"/>
declivity 'till it pauſed in the mazy windings of a gentle ſtream.</p>
               <p>"How ſublimely beautiful is this wild luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance of prolific nature," exclaimed the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raptured ſpectator. The ſun was riſing to ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate each pictureſque beauty, but the heat was great; "Let us deſcend the mountains," "ſaid Lord Edwin,
<q>I am very thirſty, and perhaps at thoſe diſtant cottages I could procure a draught of milk,</q>
                  <q>Aye plenty, your honour,</q>
replied the guide,
<q>if you will condeſcend to accept ſome at the cottage of Reuben and Giraldine Deſmoulines, where the ſweet girls will be up, and can ſupply your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour with an excellent breakfaſt, for I am al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways welcome as a prince, and any compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny I conduct are ſhewn the greateſt reſpect.</q>
"proceed," ſaid Lord Edwin,
<q>my curioſity may poſſibly be yet more gratified.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Slowly they deſcended a winding path 'till they reached the valley, and here they again reſted. On every ſide the towering Glaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers reared their ſnow-crowned heads in a thouſand fantaſtic forms, and proudly contraſted their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable ſuperiority of magnificence with the fertilized mountains beneath, while ſcattered on their ſummit and various tracts of the acclivity in irregular romantic ſhelterings of the ſteep peeped the white cottages of the peaſants; in
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:029134_0015_0FDFACADE95D4F48"/>
ſhort, no ſituation could exhibit a ſcene more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſified and pleaſing; here the eye wandered from one beauty to another more enchanting, and when it ſeemed to have diſcovered ſome ſtill more ſuperior view, the ſlighteſt glance preſented ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther if poſſible more inviting and wonderful, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parantly raiſed by the power of magic to capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate the aſtoniſhed beholder.</p>
               <p>The ſhining bee ſtole from her hive, and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring through the air was buſily extracting from the bloom her liquid ſweet; two or three hovels only ſituate in perilous apertures of the mountain, had ſuffer devaſtation by the falling of the ſnow from the tremendous heights, where a coagulated maſs had lately been driven by the winds, bearing in its paſſage mouldering fragments of rock, whoſe inevitable direction had cruſhed and partly ſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered the deſolated roofs. Lord Edwin ſhudder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet the ſpectacle was truly grand, for part of the maſs had fallen in different directions, ſome on the edge of the ſteep, ſome in the meandering ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulet, and part reſted on the ruſtic one-railed bridge that croſſed the ſtream, from whoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth ſtructure ſuſpended innumerable iſicles of the moſt curious form; the aerial choriſters were warbling their oraiſons, and the inhabitants of the vale ſeemed the only undelighted enjoyers of the ſcene, becauſe to them it exhibited no novelty,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:029134_0016_0FDFACAFAC0CB7D8"/>
conſequently but little allurement; the eye of the ſtranger alone beheld it with admiration, and the heart of ſenſibility could alone feel the exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite ſenſations of delight its contemplation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired.</p>
               <p>By the moſt inviting paths, bordered with flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, ſtrewn by the hand of nature, they at length arrived at the cottage; nothing could be more centrically ſituated to command the ſurrounding beauties of this magic ſpot: The door was open, and a charming girl had juſt entered with a lap full of flowers to deck her burniſhed caſement, whoſe chequered pane glowed with the refulgence of the riſing ſun.</p>
               <p>"Ah! Madelon," ſaid the guide, "is dame Giraldine up? Can you furniſh his honour with a cup of milk, an oat cake, or a glaſs of your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent mead?" Madelon dropped a curtſey, and bluſhing more beautiful than the roſes ſhe held in her hand, modeſtly entreated Lord Edwin to walk in and accept their humble fare. Not at all diſpleaſed at his guide's perſpicuity in whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering that Madelon was a pretty girl, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templated, as he walked by her ſide, the ſweet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

you her boſom was the receſs of tranquility, the manſion of peace.</p>
               <p>She then led him to a neat apartment, where a ſecond female was merrily turning the ſpinning wheel, and ſweetly ſinging ſome rural ballad, but the moment Lord Edwin entered, the ſong ceaſed, and the wheel was ſtopped, while the enchanting countenance of the induſtrious peaſant preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him her chair with a graceful curtſey, made him ſtart with aſtoniſhment, her ſtraw Hat, which hung on the back of it was inſtantly tied on, and modeſtly intended to ſhade the deranged plaits of a neat lawn cap, which confined part of her luxuriant light treſſes, while a few ſtraggling ringlets played on her lovely face; her ſparkling blue eyes beamed the very ſoul of ſenſibility through the ſhades of the fineſt dark eye laſhes, that reſembled fringe of the moſt beautiful gloſs and texture, and the exquiſitely traced arches of the ſame colour, penciled by the hand of nature, added a ſtill ſuperior elegance to her features; her dreſs was ſimple yet the very model of neat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and while Lord Edwin gazed with rapture, his fancy compared her to a flower of exquiſite beauty and delicacy, reared in an uncultivated ſoil by the hand of Providence, blooming in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Entranced by the delightful contemplation, he was rouſed from his reverſe by the voice of his

guide, addreſſing a pretty little girl about twelve years old, who was tenderly gazing on a neſt of young birds ſhe humanely was endeavouring to feed. In tears my little Joſephine, reiterated he. "What have you there, ſweet cottager," aſked Lord Edwin, peeping over her ſhoulder, "that cauſes that compaſſionate tear?</p>
               <p>"A neſt of unfledged birds, your honour," replied ſhe, wiping off the chriſtal pendant on the back of her worſted mitten, "I bought them this morning of there cruel boys, who were going to torment them; I had but one florin which they gladly took, ſo I popped them into my apron, and tying up the bundle of faggots I had been to pick up, placed them on my head, and come home pretty well loaded; but what vexes me moſt is, they wont eat, and I can't help ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a tear they ſeem ſo pitiful."</p>
               <p>Well, thought Lord Edwin, what perfection ſhall I next diſcover in this enviable vale; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready have I been enchanted with the beauties of nature, and the aſpiring virtues of generoſity and humanity have juſt preſented themſelves to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete the picture.</p>

               <p>Reuben, who had ſhrunk behind Lord Edwin's chair, reluctantly took his ſeat at the earneſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitation of his noble gueſt, though he would much rather have kept his ſtation in the rear.
<q>This breakfaſt is to me ſuperior to the moſt ſumptuous treat!</q>

               <p>Lord Edwin, who did not want perſpecuity to diſcover the reality of this little ſtrategem, repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he thought he ſhould alter his rout, and not paſs the vale on his return. "Ah! then," repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Roſalie with faltering voice, while the roſe vaniſhed from her cheek, "we ſhall never ſee you again, and this delicate handkerchief muſt be waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through while you ſtay." Lord Edwin was now convinced of the reality of his ideas; he had obſerved her fine eyes earneſtly fixed on his unknowing the magic influence their luſtre beam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—and gently taking her hand, "don't trouble yourſelf about ſuch a trifle," ſaid he, "keep it 'till I call again, 'tis very probable I may return in the courſe of a fortnight, and if the pain of your arm will permit you to enjoy a walk, you and your ſiſters ſhall be the directreſſes of my foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps to explore the farther beauties of this charming elyſium: Lead on then, ſweet girls, and give me proof of your taſte in the different views you each ſhall point out."</p>

Reuben led the way, and Madelon ſoon arrived at her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite ſpot, which Lord Edwin acknowledged to be well worth remark and admiration. "Then you'll not approve my choice," ſighed Roſalie, "for every body ſays its a pleaſing proſpect but too dull, turn on the left and deſcend to that ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulet."—Lord Edwin obeyed in ſilence, 'till his wandering ſteps brought him to the moſt beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully romantic receſs among the cliffs, art or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture could deviſe.

faſten it," Saying which ſhe drew a piece of blue ribbon from her boſom and twiſting it through the plaiting lifted it upon the ſaddle whilſt Lord Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win transfixed to his ſeat, had obſerved with a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of pleaſure this laſt act of Roſalie. "God bleſs you, ſweet cottagers," ſaid he, "and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, Roſalie, not to remove the bandage too ſoon," then waving his hand rode off. Ah! thought Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalie, I needed not that injunction, 'tis too ſoft to remove for a coarſer, and I ſhall never, never have ſuch an honour again. Alas! poor girl, little did thy innocent boſom ſuſpect a deeper wound was pierced within thy heart.</p>
               <p>From the ſmall caſement of her chamber ſhe ſecretly watched the track of the mules 'till the envious mountain's obtruding ſteep hid the ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcernable objects, and cloſing the window with an unuſual ſullen reluctance, ſhe deſcended to her ſpinning, but ſhe did not ſing; once ſhe attempted the balled ſhe was warbling when Lord Edwin entered the cottage, but her voice failed and the ſong was never repeated.</p>

               <head>CHAP. III.</head>
               <p>IT was the tenth evening, as Lord Edwin pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed, when he returned to Chamouny; Roſalie and Madelon had ſtrolled to the top of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to diſcover if the traveller approached; their beſt grey ſtuff jackets had been neatly put on, and their clean lawn caps were faſtened with primroſe top-knots, each took their ſpindles and ſeated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on the ſummit of the ſteep, to watch his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival; the ſhades of the evening veiled the fading landſcape, and the moon was riſing in faint ſilvery gleam. Roſalie grew reſtleſs, ſhe tangled the flax, threw the ſpindle aſide, took it up again, and again the flax broke: her patience was every way exhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and once more 'ere ſhe returned to the cottage, ſhe climbed an impending part of the mountain, and with earneſt and outſtretched eyes, ſhe at a great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance deſcried the mules ſlowly pacing the winding track; inſtantly the blood forſook her cheek—re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned—fled—and returned again. Madelon obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved her agitation with the deepeſt regret, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:029134_0030_0FDFACDE7B1E9520"/>
concealed her thoughts, determined however to mark the reception on all ſides, and Lord Edwin ſoon after gained the ſummit. "How are my ſweet girls?" ſaid he, extending a hand to each, "I have a trifle for Madelon, a charming bird for Joſephine, and a lute for Roſalie, who, I am informed, plays delightfully." Roſalie thanked him more eloquent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with her eyes than her lips, and they deſcended to the vale.</p>
               <p>Impatient to impart the pleaſing news, Roſalie tripped quickly on to appriſe Giraldine, while Lord Edwin chatted with Madelon, and paſſing a whithered roſe-tree. "Bleſs me" ſaid he, "how the roſes have faded in Chamouny, and even the cheeks of Roſalie have loſt their uſual bloom ſince I ſaw them. "Ah!" replied Madelon, "they have drooped indeed, but I ſtill entertain a hope, <hi>ſome</hi> of them may revive."</p>
               <p>The peculiar emphaſis reſted on the word <hi>ſome,</hi> accompanied by an arch look and half a ſmile, did not eſcape Lord Edwin, and he would have aſked an explanation had not Roſalie and Joſephine at that moment joined them.</p>
               <p>"Where are your little birds?" aſked he, tap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the roſy cheeks of Joſephine." "Oh, all dead, my Lord," anſwered ſhe, ſhaking her head, they did not live two days after you left us;
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:029134_0031_0FDFACE0C1D6B400"/>
poor Roſalie's arm was ſo painful<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſhe could not ſpin, ſo I was obliged to help her, and perhaps neglected them."</p>
               <p>"Never mind," replied Lord Edwin, "Carlos has a ſweet bird for you." At that moment the faithful domeſtic entered with the portmanteau and bird: Joſephine eagerly examined its beauty, but wiſhed it had been a parroquet, that ſhe might have taught it the name of the generous donor. "Do you ſing?" aſked Lord Edwin. Joſephine again ſhook her head; "aſk Roſalie, my Lord, ſhe's our ſweeteſt nightingale, though ſhe has not ſung a ſong this week paſt." Lovely innocent, thought Lord Edwin, how ſweetly haſt thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed the ill ſecreted thorn that rankles in the boſom of thy charming ſiſter.</p>
               <p>Supper was ſerved by Madelon ſoon after, and Lord Edwin entreated to ſtay and accept a ſpare bed they ſometimes accommodated travellers with, while Carlos was provided with another at a neighbouring cottage.</p>
               <p>The bluſhing tints of roſy morning ſcarcely dawned when Lord Edwin was awakened by the plaintive melody of Roſalie's lute under his win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, and riſing he peeped through his caſement; ſhe had taken her ſeat in a little arbour which half concealed her by the profuſion of roſes that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:029134_0032_0FDFACE270DE2990"/>
from the rural lattice, while the expreſſive beauty of her countenance depicted her to the eye of fancy the moſt perfect ſemblance of the queen of love repoſing in her Paphian bower. She had faſtened the lute to a violet ribbon which hung at her ſide, and when ſhe had finiſhed her plaintive air, gently let it fall to its appropriate ſituation, and remained ſome moments in a deep reverie 'till the approach of Joſephine with a fine baſket of peaches rouſed her from the attitude of contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation.</p>
               <p>Some few words, uttered in a low key eſcaped the attentive ear of Lord Edwin, but as they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the houſe he plainly diſtinguiſhed the voice of Roſalie, utter the following words.</p>
               <p>"Don't, touch them Joſephine, 'till his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip comes down, I dare ſay he likes peaches, and at leaſt we can give him our ſhare; 'twas lucky Lindor ſhould ſend them, ſtep up and liſten if his Lordſhip is ſtirring, while I gather a few bloſſoms to ornament the parlour."</p>
               <p>The voice was then ſilent, and Lord Edwin drawing aſide the little muſlin curtain that had cautiouſly concealed him, finiſhed his dreſs, when caſting his eyes round to admire the neatneſs of his apartment, he obſerved a miniature ſuſpended on a ſmall hook by a piece of black ribbon much

worn. Curioſity was on the wing, he approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and taking it in his hand, ſtrictly examined it. "Whoſe could it be," it was rather improbable it ſhould belong to any of the family, and he had never yet ſeen any one in this cottage whom it reſembled, certain he was if it proved a real copy, the original muſt be a moſt beautiful woman, and the robe ſhe wore, added to the band of pearls which confined part of her flowing treſſes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoke her at leaſt a perſon of dignity; in ſhort, it was a myſtery his penetration could not unfold<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he hung it up and viewing it at a diſtance, fancied he could trace the bewitching ſmile of Roſalie, yet the idea ſeemed ſo abſurd he inſtantly altered his opinion, when a tranſient thought recalled to his memory the promiſed explanation of the little ſhrine he had viſited in the receſs of the mountain, and half convinced him this miniature tended to elucidate his ſurmiſe, and he deſcended the ſtairs with a full determination of claiming Reuben's promiſe.</p>

               <p>CICELY, the notable girl who performed the drudgery of the family, ſmoothed her clean yarn apron, and dropping a very low curtſey, uſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered him into the little parlour, where the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt awaited his deſcent. The family were all aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled and each hoped he had reſted well. "Perfectly ſo," anſwered Lord Edwin, "if the nightingales in this part of the world did but lull one to ſleep by their evening ſong, inſtead of chaunting ſo merrily of a morning."</p>
               <p>Roſalie's cheek inſtantly felt the force of his addreſs, Madelon ſmiled, and Giraldine nodded at Roſalie, expreſſive of her condemnation, in hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſturbed the ſlumberer.</p>
               <p>"I hope your Lordſhip will excuſe it," ſaid the worthy Reuben. "Roſalie would deem her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ungrateful not to delight in her new preſent, the charming proof of condeſcention and polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:029134_0035_0FDFACECB75709B8"/>
in ſo illuſtrious a ſtranger as your Lordſhip, 'tis an early hour I preſume with your honour, but for us peaſants 'tis almoſt noon day."</p>
               <p>"True," replied Lord Edwin, "but it was not ſleep occaſioned my abſence, for in fact I have been this half hour contemplating an elegant mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niature up ſtairs, and if it would not be deemed impertinent, I ſhould like to know whoſe reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance it was."</p>
               <p>Madelon looked earneſtly at her mother, while Roſalie's cheek turned pale, and a ſtarting tear irradiated her eye; every one was ſilent but the innocent and loquacious Joſephine, who, claſp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her hands, and gazing tenderly on Roſalie, cried, "Oh! my Lord, don't you think it very like our ſweet Roſalie, why its her own dear mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma's picture."</p>
               <p>Confuſion and ſurpriſe prevented Lord Edwin's reply, and as no one appeared able or willing to contradict the aſſertion, he was pretty well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the reality of the ſtory. At length re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering the power of articulation, he ventured to inquire a few particulars, and Joſephine being ſilenced, Giraldine proceeded to relate the narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of Roſalie, "who, ſhe ſaid, was born in that cottage about ſeventeen years ſince, that M. Tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:029134_0036_0FDFACEE6C4F7D98"/>
their noble landlord, one evening, at a late hour, brought a moſt beautiful lady wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in a cloſe veil, in a chaiſe and four, that a gentleman accompanied them, and an elderly ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant on horſeback. M. Tourville told her the Lady was a widow in very unhappy circumſtances, and near her time, earneſtly begging Giraldine to undertake the charge of the infant, if it lived, and alſo be faithful and diligent to the lady, for whoſe board ſhe ſhould receive an ample compenſation, as her health was in a very precarious ſtate, and ſhe wiſhed to live recluſe.</p>
               <p>Giraldine added, the lady appeared almoſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted at parting with her companions, and as the carriage drove off ſhe heard the ſervant aſk the poſtilions if the Marquis meant to croſs the mountain with guides and lamps, or if he ſtaid in the vale 'till morning; but they replying they had orders to proceed, drove on; by this ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived her lovely inmate was ſome perſon of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence in diſguiſe, and did not doubt but one day this ſtrange adventure would be cleared up; that ſhe paſſed by the name of Madam Lavinia de St. Clair, and was brought to bed of the charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing daughter he now beheld, to whom the enrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured parent gave the name of Roſalie; but, alas! continued the worthy Giraldine, the dear affable lady was never cheerful, and a viſible and haſty decline ſoon ſucceeded.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="unknown:029134_0037_0FDFACF0CABF24F8"/>M. Tourville came often to ſee her, and at his earneſt entreaty ſhe was removed to Montpelier for change of air: Ah! never ſhall I forget our parting; the ſweet babe was left, drowned in tears, to my care, for I could not leave my fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and as ſhe took a laſt kiſs, ſhe tied that minia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture round the boſom of the infant, "take care of it Giraldine, for my child," ſaid ſhe, "it may one day be uſeful, I need not ſay it is the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful reſemblance of her wretched mother, ſhe was then helped into the chaiſe, and drove off in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agony of grief.</p>
               <p>Since that time our ſweet change has never left us. M. Tourville conſtantly vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Tourville and the gentleman who brought her firſt here, but being a great perſonage, he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver condeſcends to pay us a viſit, but ſends his old ſteward once a year with a handſome ſalary for her board, and it is now near three months ſince we have received news of M.

                  <pb n="40" facs="unknown:029134_0038_0FDFACF7E7089590"/>"God avert ſuch a misfortune!" exclaimed Roſalie, "It is much about the time our annual vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitor arrives, Oh, methinks I long to ſee good Mr. Montague."</p>
               <p>"Montague," cried Lord Edwin, "pray what ſort of a man may he be, is his hair remarkable white, and has he a ſmall red mark on the left cheek?"</p>

               <p>"And does he not live with the Marquis of Sevigne?" anſwered Lord Edwin, with apparent agitation.</p>
               <p>"Oh, I don't know," replied Roſalie, "he tells us he is bound to ſecrecy, and we muſt not aſk, but he hopes one day to convey me to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land in all the ſplendour I deſerve, and frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he ſheds tears as he fits gazing on me; in vain have I conjured him on my knees to reveal my hapleſs tale, but he always evades my requeſt, and while my penſion is conſtantly remitted I am happy in the protection of my adopted parent, who has faithfully and tenderly guarded my help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs infancy, and ſorrowful will be the day if I ſhould ever leave them; but 'tis ſtrange, my Lord, you ſhould know Mr. Montague, I wiſh

               <p>"I wiſh he may," replied Lord Edwin, much embarraſſed, "and I will prolong my ſtay a day or two in conſequence; for ſhould he prove to be the perſon I ſuſpect, it may be in my power to render myſelf ſerviceable to you; but tell me, ſweet girl, how that miniature came to be left in a ſtranger's chamber, ſuppoſe they had purloined it?"</p>
               <p>"Oh lack-a-day," anſwered Giraldine, "we have no thieves in Chamouny, and 'tis hard to ſuſpect; but you muſt know, my Lord, that cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber is our dear young lady's, but ſhe is ſo affable and kind that ſhe frequently ſleeps with Madelon, to accommodate ſtrangers whom the guide often calls with, to taſte my mead; for though we are private cottagers, we are always happy to oblige any traveller who will honour us with their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany."</p>

when the piper and the villagers retired, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily turned into their cottage to partake of their ſimple ſupper which Giraldine had prepared, and at an early hour they ſought the ſoothing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibility of tranquil ſlumber ſacred to the ſoul of peace.</p>
               <p>The night was majeſtically beautiful, a ſolemn ſilence prevailed—Lord Edwin gently opened his caſement, ſilvered by the moon, which exactly beamed on the miniature; a ruſtling gale agitated the poplars, and gently waved the dew-weighed heads of the full blown roſes that encircled the chequered pane, and the perfume they exhaled was exquiſite. Sleep's magic fillet could not veil his eye, Montague was hourly expected, Montague, the ſteward of his father! 'Twas ſtrange! 'twas myſterious! He knew Montague conſtantly viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Italy every ſummer, but he always underſtood his own private affairs demanded his attendance; his father too had been very circumſpect in his conduct, for he had never heard the moſt diſtant hint that could awaken ſuſpicion, he would there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wait the event of Montague's arrival; and with ſuch reflection he cloſed his window, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired to his cleanly coarſe pillow, 'till the voice of Roſalie, and the trampling of mules under his window awakened him from his diſturbed and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular ſlumbers.</p>

                  <pb n="45" facs="unknown:029134_0043_0FDFAD05F4A58DE8"/>He was not long dreſſing, for the voice of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague maddened his impatience, and faltering yet reſolute, he deſcended to the parlour, where the good old man had ſeated Joſephine on his knee, and was anſwering her quick-repeated queſtions concerning a favourite lap-dog ſhe had given him laſt year, when the voice of Lord Edwin com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plimenting him jocularly on his ſafe arrival at the cottage, petrified him to his chair. "You are a man of taſte, Montague," cried he, "to prefer the hoſpitable reception of theſe worthy peaſants in preference to any accommodation you could receive in the vale of Chamouny; Giral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine's cream cheeſes ſuit your palate, Roſalie's grapes are more luſcious than any vineyard here produces, and the dried tongues and oat cakes of Madelon's preparing, are a moſt inviting bon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>LORD EDWIN then left the room with a countenance expreſſive of unuſual ferocity, and ſuch as the faithful Montague during a ſervice of twenty<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>five years had never ſeen clouded with the furious ſtorms of anger; for his young Lord he would readily have braved every danger, but to betray the confidence repoſed in him by the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis, after being ſo ſtrictly enjoined to ſecrecy, was a point of honour he could not reconcile himſelf to give up, and he conceived himſelf plunged in an inextricable labyrinth, yet as Lord Edwin had diſcovered this charming protegee, and ſeemed to be perfectly acquainted with great part of the affair, doubtleſs his information had been accidentally obtained from Giraldine or Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalie, conſequently, on a moment's reflection, he concluded the Marquis could never reproach him for explaining the remainder, which would ever
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:029134_0046_0FDFAD0FC2F08C58"/>
reflect honour on himſelf, and could be no farther prejudice to Lord Edwin; he therefore determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to diſcloſe every circumſtance within his knowledge, and leave the event to Providence.</p>
               <p>He then ſnatched up his hat and croſſing the lawn entered the vineyard, where he beheld Lord Edwin reclining on a ruſtic bench, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutely examining the miniature of Madame de St. Clair. "Come hither," ſaid he, ſeizing the arm of Montague with a degree of impetuous energy, "Do you know the original of this copy?" The poor old man (who knew an eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive anſwer would only tend to irritate Lord Edwin) replied he had ſeen the lady whoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance it bore, but did not know who ſhe was, or ever ſhould." "Why not?" aſked his Lordſhip, "you muſt be more explicit; where did you firſt ſee her, and, with whom?"</p>
               <p>"With my Lord the Marquis," anſwered Montague, "about ſeventeen years ſince, and all I know of the tranſaction is, I was one evening at ten o'clock ordered to pack a ſmall portman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teau, in conſequence of a letter my Lord had juſt received from a private hand, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to have agitated him greatly; the carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age was immediately ordered with poſt horſes, and myſelf the only perſon permitted to attend him, and we purſued our jour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ey to Paris as
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:029134_0047_0FDFAD1188806058"/>
faſt as carriages and veſſels could carry us, but the Marquis obſerved a ſolemn ſilence the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of the way, and when he did condeſcend to aſk a queſtion, 'twas ſullen and ſnappiſh."</p>
               <p>"At length we arrived at an obſcure inn very late in the evening, where a very elegant lady faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on my maſter's ſhoulder, and I was ordered by a French gentleman to leave the room; in half an hour freſh horſes were ordered, and the above lady and gentleman ſtepped into the carriage with the Marquis, and drove quickly off.</p>
               <p>Shall I confeſs my curioſity was awakened, and I ventured to aſk Janette, the bar-maid, if ſhe knew the parties, but ſhe, poor girl, ſpoke very little Engliſh, and that in ſo complicated a dialect, I could not gain one particle of the deſired infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, for they were perfect ſtrangers, and "Je ne ſcais pas," was the prevalent anſwer from the Maitre d'Hotel to Le Valet d'Ecurie.</p>
               <p>About three days after, the carriage ſtopped one evening at this cottage, good dame Giral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine's candle would have been extinguiſhed in another moment, (for the good folks were juſt undreſſing) when I was ordered to tap at the door, out popped the head of Reuben to inquire who diſturbed them, and the voice of M. Tourville
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:029134_0048_0FDFAD13418B2FF8"/>
from the carriage inſtantly brought him to the door.</p>
               <p>"I know the remaining circumſtances of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame St. Clair's ſtory, therefore abridge that part and proceed from the Marquis's departure." Montague bowed and continued.</p>
               <p>We then returned to the confines of Paris, where we left M. Tourville and made the beſt of our way to England, where about five weeks after the Marquis's ſiſter, who was a nun in ſome convent, died, and the next poſt brought account of the death of Madame St. Clair. Ah! I ſhall never forget being called into the Marquis's chamber; Montague, ſaid he, poor Madame St. Clair has paid the debt of nature, after giving birth to a lovely daughter; I truſt you have never revealed the circumſtances of our tour, or her departure from Paris, after the ſecrecy I enjoined you to obſerve; you, and you only, are acquainted with the buſineſs, ſwear you will never divulge the confidence I am going to repoſe in your boſom, as it is of the utmoſt importance to be concealed at preſent; to your hands then I ſhall remit proper ſums for the maintenance of this infant, to whom I am left guardian you ſhall convey it every ſummer, and bring me proper information how ſhe is, and
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:029134_0049_0FDFAD15A48CF2E8"/>
when it is in my power to bring her to England, I ſhall feel myſelf happy in having her under my more immediate care, which at preſent her infant ſtate prevents me.</p>
               <p>Such was the promiſe I engaged to fulfil, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>"To the ſolitudes of Thornley," cried Lord Edwin, "is my father going to immure this bloſſom, amidſt the reſt of his ſecluded ſweets, bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in oblivion there?"</p>
               <p>"Why ſhe was to have ſtaid at the caſtle, but when I told the Marquis how handſome ſhe was, he inſtantly altered his mind."</p>
               <p>"She goes to Thornley then," ſaid he, "'till the departure of Edwin, for ſhould he ſee her with the ſame partial eyes you do, I know not the conſequence, and then the meaſure of my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs would be complete."</p>
               <p>"A charming plan," replied Lord Edwin, "but ſome deep myſtery remains, which I will endeavour to elucidate: Charming Roſalie! if ſhe loves like me, no power on earth ſhall ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate us; take her to England, I will follow every
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:029134_0050_0FDFAD1BC442AED8"/>
ſtage in diſguiſe, to protect her, and by the time ſhe has inhabited the antique abbey about a week, I ſhall make my formal entre, by popping in upon lady Mentoria and her fair companion, in the midſt of their dinner, when leaſt expected."</p>
               <p>"Mercy defend me," exclaimed Montague, "is it poſſible my Lord will riſk the Marquis's eternal diſpleaſure, by fixing his affection almoſt inſtantaneouſly on the very object his caution would conceal, and utmoſt vigilance ſeparate?"</p>
               <p>"Every remonſtrance is vain," replied Lord Edwin, riſing haſtily from his ſeat, "I am going in ſearch of Roſalie, and in the mean time do you inform Giraldine." He then turned into the cottage, and found Roſalie at her buſy wheel. "Lay your ſpinning aſide," ſaid he, "we muſt have a few moments converſation: You are going to England, charming Roſalie, with Montague, in two days, he has brought a letter expreſſive of the Marquis's commands, and you muſt obey them. Roſalie involuntarily laid her hand on his arm, "Oh, my Lord, how ſhall I reconcile my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to leave this peaceful home, theſe dear-loved protectors of my infancy," and a tear trembled in her eye. "Make yourſelf happy," replied Lord Edwin, "I will conduct you, ſweet inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, my arm ſhall guard you ſafe from every danger to the ſhores of England."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="unknown:029134_0051_0FDFAD1D6E19CDB8"/>"Ah no, my Lord, you jeſt but with my ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, how is it poſſible?" cried ſhe, claſping her hands, "at any rate, I am moſt probably going to be ſtationed in ſome menial capacity in the Marquis's family, for an orphan dependant on his bounty can expect little elſe, my gratitude then ſhall lead me to obey with cheerfulneſs the commands of my benefactor; but the taſk of parting will I fear much grieve poor Giraldine, ſhe is old, and I ſhall never perhaps ſee her more."</p>
               <p>Lord Edwin now found it neceſſary to explain the myſtery, by declaring himſelf the ſon of the Marquis, avowing his ardent love for her, and declaring ſhe alone ſhould ever ſhare his happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. "Why then ſo reluctant, ſweet girl, more pleaſing proſpects ſhall unveil to your view, and the ſunſhine of proſperity ſhall ſhed its ray, and renovate my beauteous bloſſom though tranſplant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from its native ſoil," and he kiſſed the tear that fell upon her hand.</p>
               <p>Roſalie appeared much agitated: "Alas! that I am every way unworthy the honour your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip has conferred," ſaid ſhe, "I am perfectly convinced, retract then your vow, my Lord, and view only with the eye of beneficent friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, the ill-fated cottager of Chamouny; ah<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If I ſolicit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main with this happy family, I fear I ſhall never enjoy the peace I once knew, for a continual dread of having offended my benefactor, and the idea of ingratitude to your Lordſhip would break my heart, yet perſiſt not in accompanying me to the Abbey, after the ſtrict injunctions the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis has enjoined Montague."</p>
               <p>"Say not a word," replied Lord Edwin, "my plan is formed, and I am determined to execute it; go to Giraldine, who is appriſed of your depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, take only one dreſs with you, for Montague has orders to furniſh you with a genteel habili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as ſoon as you arrive in England, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member when we meet at the Abbey neceſſity will compel us to be ſtrangers 'till the myſtery of your parentage can be explained."</p>
               <p>Thus ended the diſcourſe, and Roſalie promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to obſerve diſcretion on her part, ruſhed to

"Would to heaven thou could ſpeak," ſighed ſhe, "I ſhould then be acquainted with my deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; miſerable girl that I am, thus to be ignorant of every circumſtance relative to my family."</p>
               <p>Again ſhe would have indulged a moment's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, if the foot of Madelon had not rouſed her reverie; ſhe opened the door, Madelon was in tears; ſhe kiſſed the cheek of Roſalie, and wept on her ſhoulder:—"Thurſday," ſobbed ſhe, "we loſe our dear ſiſter."</p>
               <p>Roſalie endeavoured to pacify her, aſſuring her ſhe would write as often as poſſible, for Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague had promiſed her a conveyance at leaſt four times a year. "Ah! that will be poor conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to me," replied Madelon, "but we muſt ſubmit."</p>
               <p>What a mixture of pain did theſe charming girls ſtruggle to ſuppreſs, 'twas the real ſorrow.

               <p>Montague to hide his feelings, and prevent join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in converſation, had taken his ſolitary ſeat at the door: The prattle of Joſephine no longer en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livened him: Roſalie's ſpinning wheel ceaſed to turn: Madelon's little garden had not received its evening viſitor's refreſhing care, to renovate and tie up the drooping plants, and Giraldine's baſket of knitting hung neglected on the branch of a roſe tree that encircled the caſement.</p>
               <p>Carlos muſing on the thoughts of his ſeparation from Marcella, in like manner was no very live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly companion to Montague; as he was penſively lolling over the gate of the vineyard, contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plating the arrival of a group of peaſantry, who were advancing in proceſſion, but not one ſmile beamed on their countenance. They were come to take leave of Roſalie, each had brought ſome little pledge of eſteem: A curious oſier baſket, a purſe, a pair of mittens, a ſilk net for her hair, a variegated pincuſhion, a curious jar of the choic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt honey, a few pomegranates, with various other trifles according to the age and diſtinction of the donor.</p>

               <p>"A ſimilar ſhower may perhaps lave the flinty roads of Savoy," replied Montague, "'ere Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los returns to England, and recounts the drops that fell in Chamouny."</p>
               <p>The chord of ſympathy was touched, and its vibration was ſtrong and ſevere. "Montague's raillery might amuſe and cheer our hoſpitable friends within," anſwered Carlos, "ſuppoſe we ſee if we can render ourſelves ſerviceable?"</p>
               <p>Montague aſſented, and they turned into the cottage, where Roſalie was packing her preſents in a ſmall portmanteau, which, with a baſket of refreſhment, was to be faſtened on Carlos's mule.

               <p>AFTER the departure of Lord Edwin from the Caſtle, the Marquis, as was his uſual cuſtom, retired to his library—'twas much about the time Montague paid his annual viſit to Chamouny, and a certain preſentiment, inſtilled by apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, darted acroſs his imagination. "Gone to France, and means to paſs through Italy," ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed he as he ſhut the door, "Ah! heaven avert he ſhould diſcover the concealment of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalie, but ſurely Edwin's diſpoſition is not ſo ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantic as to ſearch the obſcure cottage to gratify his taſte: No, no, the gallant and noble anceſtry of his father will prevent my ſon from falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the errors of commonality."</p>

                  </gap>, now reigned in full force, and ringing his bell with a degree of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, he ordered Montague to attend. The faithful ſteward obeyed the ſummons: He was the choſen regulator of the Marquis's plans, and had lived in the family twenty-five years, he was now in his fifty-ſeventh year, beloved and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected by every one in the family, and gratitude and obedience to his ſuperiors, gentleneſs and courteſy to his fellow ſervants had gained him the eſteem he ſo juſtly merited; the moſt implicit confidence ſealed his lip where neceſſity required, and the moſt noble ſentiments of liberality and compaſſion flowed from the dictates of his honeſt heart; he was ſtill active and diligent, though he was ſtealing through the autumnal vale of life to the winter of a happy old age.</p>
               <p>"Shut the door" ſaid the Marquis, "and ſit down," Montague obeyed in ſilence.—</p>

Italy, and by that time ſhe will perhaps be diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of, for you alarmed me when you ſaid ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded your expectation in perſon and manners, and that ſuch was the general opinion of every body, and if Edwin ſhould diſcover her in his tour through thoſe mountains, who can tell the conſequence?"</p>
               <p>"Good my Lord," cried Montague ſmiling,
<q>don't raiſe imaginary evils, for ſhould Lord Edwin meet with her, who is to unraval the myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery known now only to God and yourſelf?</q>
               </p>
               <p>"Why true," anſwered the Marquis, "I did not reflect on that improbability: however, as the poor girl will be expecting you ſet off on Thurſday, Edwin cannot reach that part of the world this fortnight, as he goes to Paris and makes ſome ſtay: Here," continued he, open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his eſcrutore, "is a ſufficient ſum to defray all expenſes."</p>
               <p>"I wiſh," ſaid Montague, "the ſweet lady, her mother was alive." The Marquis's colour mantled on his cheek, and he fetched a deep ſigh. "I can aſſure you," reſumed Montague, "Miſs Roſalie is far handſomer than her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's picture." "Her mother's picture! cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Marquis how for God's ſake ſhould ſhe come by it?" "Why Madam gave it to Giral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:029134_0062_0FDFAD41403ACEB0"/>
for the child when ſhe went to Montpelier," "I charge you then," ſaid the Marquis, "the moment you arrive, to demand it in my name, ſeal it inſtantly, and reſtore it ſafe and unſeen by mortal eye to my hand; go, Montague ſtrictly obey this injunction, and return ſoon as poſſible." He promiſed to obſerve his directions, bowed, and withdrew.</p>
               <p>The Marquis remained ſome time ruminating, and then entered the breakfaſt parlour, where Lady Adela and Lady Louiſa were winding ſome cotton for their tambour, very much tangled: The Marquis ſmiled at their perplexity, "I am much in your ſituation, my dear girls," ſaid he, "for I am about to unravel a delicate ſkein, myſteriouſly tangled."</p>
               <p>Lady Louiſa let fall her hand to liſten to the Marquis's ſtrange addreſs, and the winding ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. "What aenigma have you to puzzle us with, dear Sir" anſwered her lively Ladyſhip, "do give us the moſt eaſy clue to diſcover it, for real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly our patience is almoſt exhauſted, with this troubleſome ſkein."</p>
               <p>"The myſtery I am going to unfold, my children, is not yet arrived at the proper criſis of explanation, nor muſt you require it 'till time

               <p>"The lovely ſiſters involuntarily looked at each other in amaze. Adela then penſively caſt her eyes on the ground, and waited the procedure, while Lady Louiſa more ſuſceptible, caught his hand, and fixing her fine eyes on his averted coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, cried, "Pray dear Sir, relieve our ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe."</p>
               <p>Expectation was on the wing, 'twas the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of explanation, as the veil of ſecrecy gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly devolved the myſtery long conſigned to the receſs of faithful ſilence, a moment elapſed, and the Marquis continued.</p>
               <p>"I am going to introduce to your favour and protection a delicate plant, reared in an uncul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated ſoil, though ſprung from a rich and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile ſtem, which torn by the ruthleſs and capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious winds of fate, withered, drooped and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, leaving to the more favourable breeze of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the nurture of its ſole-ſurviving bloſſom; the ſoil of Italy was deſtined to fear this deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated flower, and now luxuriance and perfection mark the opening beauties of this tender vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nurſed lily, I ſhall tranſplant it with aſſiduous care to the protection of my amiable daughters, cheriſhed by their foſtering hand, it will, I truſt, repay, with grateful bloſſom, their watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful attention<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Such is the plant I wiſh them to

               <p>He ceaſed, and the ſtarting tear that gliſtened in his eye, reflected back the chryſtal pendant that impearled the cheeks of his attentive audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, but Lady Louiſa's dimpled ſmile baniſhed the tear, 'twas the incenſe of exquiſite ſenſibility from hearts whoſe monitor was humanity.</p>
               <p>"I perfectly underſtand you, my dear Sir," ſaid ſhe, "and conceive the plant you have ſo ſweetly and intereſtedly deſcribed, partakes the ſenſitive nature, if ſo, when committed to the charge of Adela and myſelf, it ſhall at leaſt be exempt from the rude preſſure of deriſive inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, whoſe unfeeling curioſity might be tempted to cenſure, where compaſſion ſhould predomi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nate."</p>
               <p>"And after the inviolate ſecrecy which ſeals our father's lip," replied Lady Adela, "his daughters will ever prove themſelves worthy the confidence repoſed in them, by never ſeeking to explore the ſecret unpermitted, 'tis ſufficient to

               <p>The Marquis preſſed them to his boſom, and, relying on their diſcretion, informed them he was guardian to the lovely orphan, that a genteel for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune was left in his hands for her maintenance, and that he wiſhed every affection to be ſhewn her as the relic of a friend dearly revered, but to whom he had ſworn never to reveal her birth or connections 'till a convenient opportunity; he then wiſhed them a good morning and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew.</p>
               <p>His horſe was ſoon after ordered, and he bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them as he croſſed the lawn — The charming ſiſters, left to their own reflection on this intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſubject, formed a thouſand conjectures; La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Adela wondered what friend's child it could be whoſe concerns required ſuch ſtrict ſecrecy. "I long to ſee her," ſaid Lady Louiſa; "I ſhould like to know if ſhe is handſome," continued ſhe, adjuſting her beautiful treſſes through the ſolds of her muſlin turban, while a ſpark of envy dart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through her boſom at the idea of a rival, though her natural ſweetneſs of temper would have forgiven ſuch a ſuperiority, even to her moſt inveterate enemy, yet the ſuggeſtion was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry apt in the boſom of a young female.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="unknown:029134_0066_0FDFAD4D989EFE68"/>Sir Henry Lanſdowne's elegant phaeton and four greys, at that moment croſſing the lawn, caught the eye of Lady Louiſa, "Good heavens!" exclaimed ſhe, "here is Sir Henry's greys enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the gate, how ſhall I eſcape, for poſitively he ſhall not ſee me en diſhabille, for as he is moſt probably your ſwain, and I am on my preferment, it may mar my fortune, and I ſhould be ſorry to interrupt ſo charming a tete-a-tete, ſo adieu, dear Adela." The window invitingly open to the garden was low, and Lady Louiſa inſtantly leaped out and flew for refuge to a receſs in the ſhrubbery.</p>
               <p>Sir Henry enquiring for the fair fugitive, was told ſhe was dreſſing; by the ſide of the window hung a beautiful landſcape, juſt framed, which attracted his admiration, and he placed himſelf with his back to the light in order to view more accurately ſome beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Lady Adela was pointing out, when turning to the window to enjoy the perfume of the gerani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums that encircled it, he perceived a pale green ſlipper hanging on the branch of a roſe buſh, with a ſmall fragment of muſlin floating on the briar.</p>
               <p>"Bleſs me," cried he, "the owner of this ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per has encountered the thorns, whether in ſearch of the roſe I can't ſay, but ſurely the fugitive, by leaving ſuch evident traces had ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar

               <p>Lady Adela's cheek fluſhed crimſon: To have diſcovered her ſiſter's retreat would have offended her, and yet the embarraſſed ſtate in which ſhe had ſo precipitately left her demanded it, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate her from the capability of raiſing a falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; Louiſa's ſarcaſm alſo of Sir Henry being her lover, had ſo much deranged her for the moment, ſhe ſcarce knew how to receive him, and to be left tete-a-tete was a double mortification, for never had the ſlighteſt partiality been viſible in his conduct to Lady Adela; on the contrary, ſhe had regarded her ſiſter as the object of his repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed viſits, and whilſt thoſe ideas crowded her imagination, ſhe ſcarce knew what anſwer to make.</p>
               <p>"If the ſlipper is yours," repeated he, "per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me to reach it." "Oh no," anſwered Lady Adela, 'tis Louiſa's, pray let it remain," catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſleeve as he ſtept over the Dutcheſs. "As 'tis Lady Louiſa's," ſaid the delighted Lanſdowne, I will venture to reſtore it." Lady Adela's vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation increaſed, "Pray return, Sir Henry," cried ſhe, "probably Sylvio may have ſtolen it from my ſiſter's dreſſing room, he is very miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous."

               <p>The fact was now too evident to be denied, and Lady Adela could only intreat him to return; "For heaven's ſake, Sir Henry," cried ſhe, fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the door, and well knowing Louiſa could not be concealed far off, by the deprivation of her ſlipper, "Stay, at leaſt 'till I have enquired if Andrew has removed the ſteel traps."</p>
               <p>"O, I fear them not," replied Lanſdowne, bowing ſaucily, and perfectly ſeeing through this excellent ſtratagem of his fair ſuppliant, "traps of ſteel nor chains of iron don't prevent my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering the retreat of this lovely fugitive, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, as I have a preſentiment ſhe has juſt trod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den the path before me, tis moſt probable from the ſilence which reigns ſhe has eſcaped all ſuch danger as your fears tend to magnify, or ſhould ſhe have fallen the victim of ſuch a diſaſter, I will be the champion to extricate her, though a dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon guarded the ſhrubbery; yet dont attempt to follow 'till I have explored every avenue to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure your ſafety," added he, with a ſarcaſtic ſmile.</p>
               <p>Lady Adela turned her head to conceal her too viſible confuſion, while Lanſdowne darting thro'

"I have been guilty of a weakneſs," ſaid ſhe, "but the intention was a harmleſs frolic;" and as ſhe paſſed the glaſs the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of her error from the appearance of her robe brought an involuntary tear in her eye: Adela's admonition was kind, thought ſhe, as ſhe deſcended the ſtairs, and I will for the future ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs my volatile ſpirits.</p>
               <p>Agitated and vexed ſhe gently opened the door, Lady Adela nodded a ſmile of approbation, and Sir Henry placed her on the ſofa: "Had Lady Louiſa attempted her agility in running for the celebrated apple, ſhe had ſurely vanquiſhed the ſwift footed Atalanta, and obtained the prize."</p>
               <p>Lady Louiſa bluſhed: "Which of us do you think was moſt to blame," cried ſhe, "me for flying you in this ridiculous race, or you for pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing me when you muſt naturally ſuppoſe I had my reaſon for abſenting myſelf, and I did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive my ſiſter's attractions ſo few as not to be able to render you any amuſement during my ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and I honeſtly declare my flight wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

have intruded on my retirement, by boldly inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on forcing me to diſcover myſelf when it was not agreeable."</p>
               <p>Sir Henry ſtung with the ſeverity of this laſt word, repelled as much as poſſible, the fiery glance that darted in his eye. "To err is human," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied he, "to forgive divine; and as I now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to a divinity, whoſe characteriſtic is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion and benevolence, thus let a ſuppliant ſue for pardon," gracefully dropping on one knee, and preſenting the ſaſh and ſlipper: "The ardent deſire of having one peep at ſo charming a fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, whom I had never conſciouſly offended, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced me to explore your retreat, one faſcinating ſmile ſeals my pardon, and Lanſdowne vows ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to intrude again 'till the benignant eye of Lady Louiſa marks his fond wiſh, and permits him ſo great an indulgence."</p>
               <p>"Sir Henry's elegant apology has ſufficiently atoned for his frolic, and Louiſa truſts forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs beams as ſincerely in her eye as it expands in her heart." An eloquent look at that moment confirmed the reality of her addreſs, yet it conveyed to the boſom of Lanſdowne an idea not eaſily for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, for Sir Henry's partiality had long ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted, and he waited only to be aſſured his hopes were not founded on a baſeleſs fabric; thus the
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:029134_0072_0FDFAD5CA27E0460"/>
information he wiſhed to obtain he conceived the eloquent eyes of Lady Louiſa had powerfully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt: That ſhe entertained a reſpectful eſteem was all he could at preſent flatter himſelf with, and as he well knew ſhe poſſeſſed every ſocial vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, he did not doubt but in time ſympathy would raiſe the ſpirit of friendſhip to the exalted and ſervent paſſion of love, for every perfection, in his opinion, centered in this paragon of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and if an error ever blazed in her conduct, it could only be imputed to a peculiar flow of good ſpirits, the incenſe of a heart which knew no guile, and a quick ſenſibility and imagination unreſtricted by prudery or affectation: ſhe was youthful, innocent and gay, her heart had never known a pang of real ſorrow, every hour had glided on the wing of happineſs, nor had ſhe ever been tempted to pluck the roſe of love, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently its thorns had never wounded her boſom.</p>

               <p>THE reſt of the morning paſſed in chat 'till the Marquis's return, who, pleaſed with his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitor, begged he would ſtay to dinner, for Sir Henry, as the ſon of his moſt favourite youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful companion, who trod with him in childhood the paths of learning, always found a hearty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation at the caſtle: "About a fortnight hence," ſaid the Marquis, "is the united birth-day of my daughters, which I intend to celebrate with all poſſible feſtivity; the neighbouring nobility and gentry will have general invitations, and the peaſantry ſhall enjoy every harmony and pleaſure their hearts can wiſh; I intend to form a fete champetre, and your preſence will add to our felicity."</p>
               <p>The high blood that flowed in the Marquis's veins had ever panted for an alliance with this noble youth, and he flattered himſelf one of his
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:029134_0074_0FDFAD6508995310"/>
daughters might be able to captivate, in his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, ſo glorious a prize. The ample eſtate of Sir Henry, the elegant education he had receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and improved to every advantage; the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his anceſtors ſhining in every action, and flowing in every ſentence, had ſo inflated the pride of the Marquis, that every hope reſted on this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorite ſcheme.</p>
               <p>Every elegance was preparing at the caſtle, and the moſt ſumptuous luxuries procuring; every belle in the vicinity was racking her inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to appear the moſt attractive object, and not a domeſtic but equally enjoyed the delightful an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of the approaching feſtival, and even the old gardener, whoſe venerable locks ſtraggled in ſilvery threads on his wrinkled temples, was half perſuaded to ſuffer his niece Agness, who was waiting maid to Lady Adela, to have them faſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a new black ribbon, and, wear a little powder on the occaſion, but in vain did ſhe endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to rally and tell him he would look ſo young he ſhould be her partner on the lawn.</p>
               <p>"Don't teaze me Agnes," ſaid he, "you nor any other female ſhall ever have the honour of decking my head."</p>
               <p>Agnes ſmiled for the moment at his ſhrewd reply, yet as ſhe recollected her worthy uncle had once loved and met a ſevere diſappointment, ſhe pitied
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:029134_0075_0FDFAD66D925B2C8"/>
him from her ſoul, as ſhe was well convinced his attachment to a ſingle life had not ariſen from a froward diſpoſition, or an abſolute averſion to the ſex in general, a ſigh ſacred to his ſorrows eſcaped her, and Andrew perhaps at that moment felt a ſimilar ſenſation, as he walked ſlow and pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively out of the ſervants hall.</p>
               <p>"Well, I never liked old bachelors," ſaid the little thin houſe-keeper, drawing up her head and ſmoothing her apron, "but I muſt ſay Andrew is the beſt tempered creature I ever lived with in my life, yet, as I often tell him, his genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity out-runs his pocket, poor good ſoul."</p>
               <p>At this laſt ejaculation, uttered with a deep ſigh, Agnes raiſed her eyes and fixed them on Mrs. Gertrude's little grey orbs, peeping over the dark circles of an ancient pair of green-glaſs ſpectacles.</p>
               <p>"Was you ever in love?" aſked the facetious Agnes, "or do you ever mean to marry?</p>
               <p>"What is paſt," cried the little notable dame, "bears no very pleaſing retroſpect, and what's to come one muſt be more than mortal to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe."</p>
               <p>"Why I can tell you," anſwered Agnes, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to enjoy her frolic, and aſſuming the
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:029134_0076_0FDFAD688B756150"/>
predelictive air of a fortune-teller, earneſtly ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed on the palm of her hand—"What's to come is, Andrew—"</p>
               <p>Gertrude ſtarted and withdrew her hand, half angry, yet half determined to forgive<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> "What of him for God's ſake."</p>
               <p>"Nay," replied Agnes, having ſlily obſerved Andrew croſſing the lawn with a baſket of fruit, what would you wiſh more than a preſent of ſome peaches this morning, which I propheſy will ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive in a few minutes for your acceptance."</p>
               <p>Poor Gertrude, who had placed a different con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction on the firſt hopeful words uttered by the miſchief-loving Agnes, ſcarce knew how to extricate herſelf from the cenſure her agitation had incurred, and therefore thought it moſt proper to trip out of the room, and leave Agnes to receive the peaches and bearer; foralthough ſhe conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed herſelf much paſt her prime, there was a degree of pleaſure in knowing herſelf eſteemed by ſo worthy a man as Andrew ſhe could not forego.</p>
               <p>"Love indeed" muttered ſhe to herſelf as ſhe trotted up ſtairs, "I ſhould be an old fool to be in love now a-days; to be ſure I have a great regard for Andrew, but I dare ſay he never had the leaſt thoughts of me more than civility."</p>
               <p>Thus argued Gertrude, yet ſhe half wiſhed to perſuade herſelf Andrew's opinion might be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:029134_0077_0FDFAD6AE25784E8"/>
to her conjecture, and as ſhe croſſed the looking glaſs vanity tapped her on the ſhoulder, and turning her head ſhe conceived a pin was ſtill wanting to adjuſt her ribbon which probably had never been thought of if Agnes's bewitching con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation had not inſtilled the idea of attraction, but the bell ringing terminated her reflection, and ſhe briſkly deſcended to obey its ſummons.</p>
               <p>The Marquis had as yet received but one letter from his ſon, and that arrived before he left Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and his ſilence was a myſtery he could not explain. "'Tis probable his friends engroſs ſo much of his time," thought he, "that every hour not dedicated to them is devoted to refreſhing ſlumber, to recover him from the exceſſes of diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation; yet methinks he might have ſtole half an hour to gratify me, by hearing of his welfare; however, I truſt as pleaſure is his purſuit, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence will conduct him ſafe."</p>
               <p>The day following brought him a ſecond letter, expreſſing Lord Edwin had changed his route, and had proceeded to Italy.</p>
               <p>Had a ſpectre, the moſt horrible imagination could depict, preſented itſelf at that moment, it could not have produced a greater agitation than the Marquis experienced—every nerve <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated, every feature was marked with ghaſtly aſtoniſhment—the very project he wiſhed to ſtifle in embryo had burſt forth, and preſented the moſt
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:029134_0078_0FDFAD70EBF65948"/>
formidable picture or vexation, tinged with the higheſt colouring the power of imagination could ſhade. Yet Montague's late converſation dart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ray of comfort and compoſed his irritable mind.</p>
               <p>When he met the ladies he ſlightly mentioned the ſubject, by ſaying Edwin was by this time in Italy. "Probably," ſaid the lively Lady Loui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa, "he may chance to meet our little Chamouny cottager."</p>
               <p>The Marquis ſhrunk with apprehenſion;
<q>if he does,</q>
anſwered he unguardedly,
<q>What im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion could a peaſant make on him?</q>
               </p>
               <p>"Impreſſion!" repeated the lively Louiſa, "Why, ſuppoſe I was a handſome peaſant-girl, and you a Marquis, a ſlight impreſſion of the lip might be no great degradation, and as Edwin loves to contemplate beauty, ſuch a circumſtance might occur."</p>
               <p>Rage tinged the Marquis's cheek: "Ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous!" cried he, "Do you ſuppoſe the girl would ſuffer ſuch an inſult, or Montague permit it?"</p>
               <p>"Well," ſaid Lady Adela, "I cannot think a cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tager would conceive it an inſult; and as to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague's prevention, what are the remonſtrances of
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:029134_0079_0FDFAD729D0788A8"/>
an old man to the abſolute determinations of a young one, to whom obedience and reſpect demanded his ſilence,"</p>
               <p>The ſting of an aſp had not more ſeverely wounded the boſom, than this applicable ſpeech had the peace of the Marquis.</p>
               <p>"I truſt," ſaid he, recovering his chagrine, "Roſalie has too much good ſenſe ever to make me ſuſpect her of ſuch an imprudence, much more that occular demonſtration ſhould convince me the ſuggeſtion was become a reality; ſhe is now chaſte as the unſullied ſnow that crowns her native mountains, and it ſhall be my care too warm a ſun does not diſſolve and contaminate that purity it now ſo eminently poſſeſſes."</p>
               <p>"If I ſhould ever feel myſelf diſpoſed to be in love," ſaid the arch Louiſa, "I'd take a trip to Lapland, and bring home my heart ſo thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly chilled and caſed with an impenetrable ſhield of ice, that ſhould repel and defy the meridian beams of India's burning ſun to diſſolve it."</p>
               <p>"Time will convince us, Louiſa," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned the Marquis, "your intrepidity of being held captive, liberty is your motto, and a chain, even of gold, would be to you a galling fetter;

               <p>IT only wanted two days of the fete and the elegant arrangements of every device exhibited the taſte of the ladies; innumerable fancies decorated every part of the caſtle: Sir Henry Lanſdowne, and his friend, Lord Carlton, ſoon after arrived in the Baronet's elegant phaeton, and beautiful greys, followed by two ſmart little lads in ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let jackets and velvet caps, which rendered the equipage an intereſting and charming object from the windows, but, alas! the ladies were not there to admire them as they daſhed over the lawn.</p>
               <p>Lord Carlton's manly features loſt their uſual penſoroſo on his arrival at the caſtle: He was the darling ſon of an Iriſh nobleman, well educated, poſſeſſing an ample fortune, and inferior to few
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:029134_0081_0FDFAD76C3307F70"/>
in gentility of deportment, elegance of addreſs, or amiability of diſpoſition, but when compared to the lively and ſpirited Sir Henry, he was juſtly and frequently ſtiled the virtuous and benignant Mentor; and was his friend's ſuperior in age, about two years, but the contraſt of their diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions entitled them to the difference of ten.</p>
               <p>The elegant Lady Adela and faſcinating Louiſa, were ſtrolling on the arm of the Marquis, in a diſtant avenue of the ſhrubbery, when Sir Henry and Lord Carlton advanced to meet them.</p>
               <p>They were dreſſed in their morning muſlin robes, their hair wildly diſordered by the wind, waved on their ſhoulders in irregular luxuriance, while the beams of the ſun caſt a pleaſing reflection on their beautiful features, through the texture of ſmall chip hats negligently faſtened with a plain ribbon; on the arm of Lady Louiſa hung a baſket of flowers juſt ſelected from the green-houſe, while the delicate fingers of Lady Adela twined through the wires of a ſmall cage that impriſoned an exquiſite Virginia nightingale, which ſhe was removing from a too ſultry ſituation in a porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co of oranges, where its enchanting ſong delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every liſtening ear.</p>
               <p>Lord Carlton held the arm of his friend: "One moments pauſe, Lanſdowne," cried he "to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:029134_0082_0FDFAD7D02946A68"/>
the moſt charming group I ever beheld: are thoſe the divinities I am to be introduced to? And which is the lovely goddeſs at whoſe ſhrine you worſhip? What elegance and beauty! Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks had there been one more, my fancy had not unjuſtly conceived the graces had ſtrolled to this charming ſpot; that little floral deity ſeems to tread on air, as if her magic feet would ſcorn to cruſh the bloſſoms that invade her path, while the majeſtic and graceful carriage of the other preſents one with the expreſſive reſemblance, of the dignified Minerva, each reclined on the arm of a venerable and benignant ſage, who ſeems diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſing ſmiles and happineſs, blended no doubt with ſome precept of inſtruction, as appears by his pointed finger and earneſt converſation."</p>
               <p>"Why, Carlton, you are quite in heroics this morning," anſwered Sir Henry, "but recollect you are to ſacrifice only at the ſhrine of Minerva, for that angelic Hebe, Flora, Thalia, or what you pleaſe to call her, is alone dedicated to wing each hour with roſy bliſs for Lanſdowne's future days, but they approach, and you ſhall judge far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther."</p>
               <p>"My friend, Lord Carlton, Sir," continued he, preſenting him to the Marquis, "of whom impartially converſing your goodneſs permitted me to introduce."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="unknown:029134_0083_0FDFAD7EBAA35E28"/>The Marquis cordially extended his hand, and politely welcomed him to the caſtle, while a glow of confuſion embarraſſed the ladies at the ſurpriſe of ſo unexpected a viſitor.</p>
               <p>Carlton ventured a glance at the forbidden fruit, thought its temptation delicious, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately fixed his eyes on the ſerene features of Lady Adela, offering to convey the cage into the houſe, a politeneſs acknowledged by a graceful compliment quite her own.</p>
               <p>"Sweet priſoner," cried he, admiring his beautiful plumage, "captivity with thee muſt loſe its rigours, the attention of thy lovely miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs ſurely repays thy loſs of liberty; fed by her gentle hand, and courted by her dulcet voice to warble thy ſweet note, who would not envy thee, gay ſongſtreſs?"</p>
               <p>Lady Adela ſmiled. "His native clime had ſurely yet more charms, my Lord, where liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, delightful liberty, was all his own, when at the evening hour he ſweetly poured his plaintive melody, to hail his mate within the well known grove, but now captivity deſires thoſe joys the little ſolitaire ſoftly diverſifies his notes with tender thrilling ſtrains, which oft' to fancy's ear ſeems to repeat ſome mournful plaint of ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated love."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="86" facs="unknown:029134_0084_0FDFAD806FED2E28"/>Carlton was delighted with the ſweet beam of compaſſion that animated her countenance, each ſentiment ſeemed ſo congenial to his own, and her ſoft and pleaſing addreſs rendered her the more captivating object of his eſteem, whilſt in the converſation of Lady Louiſa he conceived he could diſtinguiſh a predominance of levity, though biaſſed by extreme politeneſs and affabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity: Such were the impartial ideas he formed of each, and Lord Carlton's opinion ſeldom de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viated from the moſt favourable yet real points of true diſcernment.</p>
               <p>The moſt pleaſing converſe beguiled that day, and on the third the natal morn was uſhured in by the five twinkling bells from the ſteeple of the romantic church about half a mile diſtant. A public breakfaſt in the Park commenced the fete, and the company aſſembled in elegant diſhabille, numerous tables were ſpread under the ſhade of ſome venerable majeſtically-towering elms, while a band of muſic artfully concealed amid the luxurance of a portico of oranges and odo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riferous ſhrubs, at once delighted and ſurpriſed; profuſive refreſhments and delicacies furniſhed a ſuperb dejune, and the repaſt ended at two o'clock, when an elegant gondola with flags, bearing the Marquis's arms, decorated with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral emblematic devices, and cuſhions of pale blue ſattin covered the ſeats to receive the
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:029134_0085_0FDFAD82F9F4A798"/>
delightful group, who choſe to enjoy the refreſhing breezes, under an awning on the ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious canal, to the ſoft notes of the enchanting horn.</p>
               <p>Others, whom timidity prevented joining the aquatic group, rapaired to a Turkiſh marquee, purpoſely erected for an accommodative ſhade to the ladies, as ſpectators of a ſelect company of gentlemen, who were to exert their ſkill in ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery to obtain the ſilver arrow, and the rich bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle horn, prizes beſtowed on the conqueror by the lovely directreſſes of the amuſement.</p>
               <p>The tent was compoſed of buff and green ſattin in broad ſtripes, looped at the entrance by large taſſels of ſilver, and feſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Sir Henry proved the fortunate claimant of the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle horn, and the fair hands of Lady Louiſa in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted him with his trophy.</p>
               <p>While the ſilver arrow was next adjudged to the Honorable Frederic Waldegrave, a reſident in the vicinity of the caſtle, an orphan, of noble an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtry, juſt returned from a ſhort trip to his pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal

ſeat, about five miles diſtant. He was po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite, amiable, and engaging, his countenance pleaſing, his converſation intereſting, nineteen ſummers only had bloomed upon his brow, and as a young man totally left to follow the bent of his own inclination at that early period of life, could it be wondered if, diſtant from the reſtricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a moroſe guardian, his naturally lively diſpoſition ſometimes led him into error, yet ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry few had yet blazed in his conduct; inſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively inclined to cultivate a capacious, fertile and riſing genius; his penetrating dark eyer beamed with delight, while his luxuriant hair of rich brown flowed on his well turned ſhoulders, as yet unconfined by the regulation of faſhion, no ribbon confined it, no powder ſullied its gloſs: His jacket was compoſed of green ſattin, his waiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coat buff, his hat black ſattin, looped in front with a ſuperb brilliant, and a green feather, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him the ſuperior object of general admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for dignity, affability, and grace ſeemed to have combined their powers to complete the the perfection of this noble youth.</p>
               <p>As he advanced to receive his reward, he drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped gracefully on one knee, and kiſſing the fair hand that beſtowed the arrow, placed it in the front of his ſaſh.</p>
               <p>Lady Louiſa, who ſometimes amuſed herſelf with drawing the bow, choſe to preſide over the
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:029134_0087_0FDFAD8A5B9B0440"/>
archers' party, whilſt Lady Adela, in compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the reſt of the aſſemblage, took her ſeat in the gondola.</p>
               <p>The dreſſes of the lovely ſiſters were exactly alike: looſe Grecian robes of tranſparent French lawn over ſarſenet petticoats, the waiſt and ſleeves claſped with bands of pearls, and their beautiful treſſes ſhaded only by a veil of the ſame texture, thrown gracefully back and faſtened with a lily of pearls, while the lower fall deſcended to the waiſt and joined the ceſtus. The ſimplicity and becomingneſs of this elegant diſhabille is ſcarcely conceivable, and the ſublimity of their countenances heightened by their charming bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es created by the encomiums of the company, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry aptly entitled them to the Ducheſs of Montre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville's remark, who obſerved, they reſembled the expreſs character of veſtal virgins, both from their real diſpoſitions and negligently graceful dreſs.</p>
               <p>Two hours thus devoted completed the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing amuſement, and the company retired to dreſs for the maſked ball in the evening. The grand drawing-room was hung on the occaſion with white ſattin, over which in various forms ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wreaths of roſes, while columns of variegated foils entwined with oak leaves and golden wheat divided the compartments: Three ſuperb chande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers

of different colours, repreſenting emeralds, rubies, topazes, amethiſts, &amp;c. gave a moſt beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful appearance; they were ſupported by ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melled doves, ſuſpended with chains from a rich painted ceiling; the ſofas ducheſſes and chairs were covered with white ſattin fringed with ſilver, and in various parts of the room were diſpoſed golden eagles ſupporting on their backs delicate fillagree pedeſtals, on which were placed the moſt curious exotics, while ſmall incenſe vaſes of fragrant aromatics blazed their magic flame on the chimney pieces, whoſe exquiſite and matchleſs petrifactions formed a moſt beautiful ſpectacle.</p>
               <p>On a portion of the lawn was erected a platform for the dancers, ſhould the evening prove fine, and beautiful Luna in compliment ſhed her moſt refulgent beam to invite the harmonious and ſprightly group: innumerable lamps were ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended and encircled the trees, which almoſt uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at the top formed a vernal canopy, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted through the waving branches by contraſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moon-light: To complete the pictureſque ſylvan ſcene, a band of muſic ſtationed in a diſtant pavilion, and the beautifully illuminated grotto immediately oppoſite acroſs the lake, furniſhed an intereſting object of admiration to the dancers, for the reflecting mirrors, burniſhed foſſils, ſhells
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:029134_0089_0FDFAD8EAE95D3B8"/>
and brilliants, gave to fancy the idea of enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, while irregularly flowing down a craggy flight of marble ſteps a murmuring caſcade broke its paſſage from the moſſy carpet of the grotto to the lake, where the trembling moon-light clearly diſtinguiſhed its circling form in rapid deſcent, concordantly joining its murmur to the inſpiring notes of the diſtant horn.</p>
               <p>Sir Henry ſupported the character of a pilgrim —Lord Carlton a magician—the Hon. Frederic Waldegrave, as cupid, with an elegant bow and arrows tipt with gold, which he dexterouſly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to every youthful female, while to the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried ladies he diſtributed fetters of roſes, which he aſſured them "were thornleſs." One arrow only miſſed its aim, it was levelled at an elegant nun, her foot ſtepped on it, and its texture being light and brittle, it ſnapped, and diſconcerted the ſly archer.</p>
               <p>"I never refuge an enemy," cried the Relige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe; "although no enchantreſs, I poſſeſs a ſpell more powerful than your arrow, gentle Cupid, 'tis a heart defying thy magic, becauſe every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs is guarded by reaſon, thy moſt dreaded foe; take thy aim amid the circles of gallantry, for my devoted ſiſterhood ſhrink from thee, vain boy, and every thought ſoars ſuperior to thy influence." Cupid obediently drew the ſilken bandage acroſs his eyes, and mingled with the group.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="92" facs="unknown:029134_0090_0FDFAD94622030D8"/>A flower-girl next addreſſed the magician, to explain her fortune: "Beauty," anſwered he, "fades like the bloſſoms in thy baſket, caſt them away and ſelect others, among which chooſe the aloe, to watch its bloom will teach thee patience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> add the bloſſoms of time, and place next to them the roſe of happineſs, carefully dividing the thorn from the heart's-eaſe, mingle the evergreens of truth and fidelity, and preſent the ſelection to the moſt generous purchaſer." Promiſſing to obſerve his advice, ſhe tripped away.</p>
               <p>A beautiful figure of Hope courted univerſal-admiration, who proved to be Lady Adela. "Wilt thou, ſweet maid, by thy magic inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, deign to lighten my burthen?" aſked Cupid. "Apply to prudence to fledge your arrows, and beg conſtancy to ſtep them in her pureſt eſſence, and my beſt exertion ſhall effectually crown your wiſhes," anſwered ſhe.</p>

               <p>As he glided away, Lady Louiſa's appearance, as the goddeſs of fortune with her ſplendid wheel drew the whole aſſembly's admiration, and her dulcet voice inſtantly claimed attention. "I have ſelected a few prizes," ſaid ſhe, "the keep-ſakes of hope and fortune, which I ſhall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute as chance directs, the humble memorials of this day."</p>
               <p>A ſultana advanced and the fickle deity pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the wheel, from which ſhe drew a card, which adjudged her the embroidered handkerchief; a general congratulation was whiſpered round on the applicable prize, but as prudence and modeſty ſealed the lip of the donor, animadverſion ceaſed.

               <p>LORD EDWIN and his lovely protegee purſued their journey over the mountains and environs for ſeveral days, 'till they reached the cottage of Marcella, where they reſted and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took ſome humble refreſhment, while Carlos again repeated his faithful adieus.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="95" facs="unknown:029134_0093_0FDFAD9AD6EF2F70"/>The ſpot that ſurrounded the cottage was ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantically beautiful; from the protruding ſides of the mountains depended cluſters of the purple vintage in rich feſtoons, while in various parts of the acclevity the traces of the plough divided the velvet ſlopes, between whoſe chaſms lofty water-falls in diamond ſhowers ſpangled the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truding ſhrubs and flowers with its radiant cryſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, as morn in ſaffron veſture tinted with her reflected orient beam the waving pines, that clad the mountain ſteep.</p>
               <p>Marcella bade a thouſand adieus as ſhe wiped the intruding tear on the corner of her apron; her ſpinning was placed at the door, and as the mules ſlowly paced on ſhe took her ſeat, her head reſted on the arm that ſupported the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>active ſpindle, while her eyes were fixed on the leſſening objects, and the hand that lay in her lap ſtill held the little gold croſs, the treaſured keep-ſake of her lover, conſecrated with the heart-ſprung tears that ſaved its burniſhed ſides.</p>
               <p>Roſalie involuntarily looked back a few paces diſtance; Carlos was transfixed to his mule a ſtatue of deſpair, gazing a laſt look with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended hand that meant to wave, but the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe of activity was ſuſpended and the uſeleſs limb dropped by his ſide.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="96" facs="unknown:029134_0094_0FDFADA081CC4808"/>"Poor fellow," ſaid Roſalie, her fine eyes abſorbed in the tear of ſenſibility, "theſe are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned ſorrows of the heart."</p>
               <p>"I pity them from my ſoul," added the benig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Lord Edwin, "Carlos in general poſſeſſes great fortitude, yet I find he is not proof to the innovations of love."</p>
               <p>No particular circumſtance occurred worthy obſervation 'till they arrived at Dieppe, where Carlos humbly petitioned to beſtow his mite by a young female mendicant, inſtinctively ſtopped to liſten to the voice of diſtreſs, while Mademoiſelle Roſalie and his Lordſhip were taking lemonade vis-a-vis in a ſmall room from whence they could obſerve his motion.</p>
               <p>"Ah, the poor unfortunate," ſaid Carlos ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his pocket for a few ſous, very willingly drawn, while ſhe preſented a ſmall baſket of tooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pics, "Le Souvenir," ſaid Carlos, modeſtly tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one, "I ſhall take this trifle to England, and when I look on it I ſhall be reminded of Janette: But I will not look to explore ſorrows it is not in my power to alleviate—Adieu then, the tear that in ſpite of every effort to retain it bedews my cheek, is the incenſe of a heart that has nothing more to give, yet 'tis conſecrated to the child of miſery."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="unknown:029134_0095_0FDFADA25936F4C0"/>Jannette's tear mingled her thanks as ſhe walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed penſively on, and Carlos with folded arms ſtood contemplating her neat figure, and waſted a ſigh to her ſorrows 'till the voice of Lord Edwin ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering him a few Louis rouſed him, and he light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſkipped after Jannette, and chucking them into her baſket pointed to his Lordſhip and returned.</p>
               <p>Jannette curtſied low three times, and tying her little fortune up in a ſmall leather purſe, looked earneſtly at it, claſped her hands, and raiſed her eyes in ſilent ejaculation to heaven for the unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected bounty of the benevolent ſtrangers, put it in her pocket, wiped another tear, yet another ſtill ſucceeded, 'twas the drop of ſincere gratitude, it would intrude—the feelings of nature were not to be commanded, and the tooth-pick girl poſſeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them refined only by the hand that planted, not nurtured them, yet were they eminently imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and her expreſſive eyes had repeated the whole hiſtory of her misfortunes to Carlos, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out one ſyllable eſcaping her lips; eloquent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealers, beaming the impartial truth, though oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en preſſed by baſhful modeſty to conceal the unpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied ſorrows they relate, yet ſweet compaſſion marks the timid glance, and joys to cheer the ſad dejected eye long wandering o'er the gloomy che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered landſcape ſhaded by tempeſtuous clouds of human life.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="98" facs="unknown:029134_0096_0FDFADA406808918"/>The packet in which the travellers were to ſail for England was very full, and Roſalie drew her veil cloſe over her face, while Lord Edwin wrapped himſelf in a large cloak, and permitted his fine dark hair to ſhade his countenance, as a diſguiſe more favourable to his ſtratagem, and which ſo much altered his features as to elude the reſemblance he formerly bore the family, and as Signior Carlini and La Bella Roſara his ſiſter, they took their ſeats in the cabin.</p>
               <p>Roſalie ſoon found the motion of the boiſterous wave agitate her ſtomach, and ſhe fainted on the ſhoulder of Lord Edwin: This indiſpoſition ſo alarmed him that he had nearly thrown off his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe to aſſiſt her, and bearing her in his arms on deck for the benefit of air, blundered over a young buck who impeded the paſſage, and unfortunate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly trod on the gouty foot of an old moroſe bache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, which compliment was returned by a hearty oath and a violent thruſt. "Manners, you brute; have you no compaſſion you friſking Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian devil?" exclaimed he, limping into the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin.</p>
               <p>Lord Edwin enraged at this invective, now thought proper to addreſs him in the Engliſh language, and in fact to procure ſome aſſiſtance for the lovely burthen now ſenſeleſs in his arms. "I ſhall teach you manners, friend," cried he,
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:029134_0097_0FDFADA689B62908"/>
"when I come down again, at preſent I am too much engaged in the charge of my ſiſter."</p>
               <p>"Siſter?" exclaimed the buck ſarcaſtically ſneering, "A mighty polite brother, methinks if he poſſeſſed a little more manners for ſtrangers it would better become him; Oh, 'tis an abſolute boar to be treated thus, my hair, my coat, my neckcloth bear teſtimony of the ſavage's feroci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty."</p>
               <p>Theſe laſt words echoing in the ear of a ſtiff-ſtarched little old maid, inſtantly made her buſtle up. "Mercy defend us, a boar in the packet did you ſay, Sir? Gracious God! the fierce creature may tear us all to pieces, I hope he is chained; I would not have come for the world if I had known it."</p>
               <p>"Oh you need not be alarmed, replied the buck, taking her brown ſhrivelled arm and ſeating her again, "it is only a two legged ſavage, that has cauſed this confuſion, by ſtumbling over half a dozen of us with his prey in his paw."</p>
               <p>"A ſavage with his prey?" reiterated the prim virgin, whoſe ſtupidity could not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand his rhodomontade, "what is it any thing like a monkey?"</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="100" facs="unknown:029134_0098_0FDFAEC3E71CDCF8"/>"Oh yes! returned he, enjoying the joke at at her expence, while her features ſtiffened with terror, "It certainly is of that <hi>ſpecie,</hi> though it ſtiles itſelf a man; in ſhort to calm your fears, Madam, 'tis the famous Signior, who has juſt left the cabin: I am ſure if my ſiſter, like his, had ſhammed dead, I ſhould not have thought proper to clamber up with her weight at the danger of my own legs, and cruſh half a dozen others.</p>
               <p>"Aye, aye, you are right," cried old ſquare toes, "ſelf-preſervation is the firſt law of nature, I never riſked my precious limbs gadding after a parcel of pert toads, not I, fal-lal dangling non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe."</p>
               <p>By this time the antiquated Miſs had drawn a ſmall caſe bottle from her pocket, declaring her ſtomach, in conſequence of the flurry ſhe had juſt experienced, to be rather qualmiſh, and ſtrongly recommended the old gentleman to taſte it, aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him it was very fine and unadulterated.</p>
               <p>"It may, Madam," replied he, "but I am no dram drinker, however I thank you for your of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer."</p>
               <p>The little dame reddened with vexation, the odium of a dram-drinker had not eſcaped her no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. "Old churl," muttered ſhe, applying it to

her lips, and ſwallowing a ſmall but uſual porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> again conſigned it to the bottom of her long pocket.</p>
               <p>Lord Edwin had now left Montague and Carlos to attend Roſalie, as ſhe preferred ſitting on deck, while he deſcended in ſearch of the two choleric gentleman he had ſo unintentionally offended.</p>
               <p>"I hope your ſiſter is better, Signior," aſked the buck, with the moſt ſarcaſtic effrontery.</p>
               <p>Lord Edwin ſurveyed him from head to foot with an air of the moſt ſovereign contempt, and then paſſed on to the old codger, "I am come to apologize as a gentleman to you, Sir, if in the hurry of conveying my ſiſter up I was ſo unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate to do you an injury, but you muſt excuſe me if I add, the haſty and ill-mannerly retaliated thruſt and oath ill became a perſon of your years, and which perhaps makes me draw a concluſion of your birth and education probably unjuſt, but for which you muſt thank yourſelf: for the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent I readily apologize, and I hope, as my ſenior, you will be induced politely to pardon, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the ungentleman-like expreſſions you made uſe of where the reſult of a moment's paſſion, urged by an unlucky preſſure of your lame foot, which I am ſorry ſhould have felt an additional pang from me."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="102" facs="unknown:029134_0100_0FDF6DC9F97EA0C0"/>"As for you, Sir," added he, turning to the young man, "I conceive far too contemptible a perſon to converſe with, a mere compoſition of malice, foppery, and ignorance, quite beneath the notice of a gentleman."</p>
               <p>To this addreſs the pitiful ſpark thought fit to make no other reply than a ſarcaſtic ſmile, and humming a tune<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> marched out of the cabbin, ſecretly mortified at betraying his folly; while the old gentleman finding Montague and Carlos deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending to receive the Signior's orders, began to think his companion of more conſequence than he at firſt ſuſpected, and therefore extended his hand in token of forgiveneſs, which Lord Edwin's placid benignity accepted, and animoſity ceaſed on all ſides.</p>
               <p>His curioſity being rouſed, the old gentleman determined to try what he could make of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, as he had an inconceivable partiality to high connection, being a rich but miſerly Don; he therefore watched the Signior's abſence to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh his ſcheme, and firſt addreſſed Montague with enquiring where his maſter and miſtreſs were going.</p>
               <p>"To England of courſe," replied the cautious domeſtic.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="103" facs="unknown:029134_0101_0FDFADABA009A900"/>"Ah pray, friend, where might they laſt come from?"</p>
               <p>"Paris," anſwered Montague, conning over the news-paper.</p>
               <p>"Humph!" cried the old man, "that I knew before, but tell me if they are brother and ſiſter; whether people of conſequence, fortune or note in the gay world, and where they reſide in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; come let's hear, let's enjoy half an hour's chat over a tiff of punch."</p>
               <p>"Excuſe me, Sir," ſaid Montague, "I have not lived in the Signior's family twenty-five years, to turn tattler in my old age, and evince myſelf unworthy the confidence ever repoſed in me, and which I have faithfully ſupported."</p>
               <p>"Nay," cried the other, reddening with paſſion at the baulk of his project, "there's no harm in a civil queſtion, it muſt be a matter of indifference to me to know who your maſter is, and if I had not taken a liken to him, I ſhould not have trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled my head about him, pray is he married?"</p>
               <p>Montague uttered his favourite monoſyllable, and the diſappointed enquirer walked away. Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the door of the lower cabin he eſpyed Carlos, "I hope your Lady's better," ſaid the intruder,
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:029134_0102_0FDFADADDF43A980"/>
taking a ſeat, "and your maſter too ſeems a mighty affable pleaſant companion, and a warm one too, I dare ſay.</p>
               <p>"Why yes," anſwered Carlos, ſeeing the drift of his impertinent curioſity, "few men more ſo; 'tis warmiſh weather in our country."</p>
               <p>"Aye you fly rogue," cried he tapping his his ſhoulder, and ſagaciouſly winking, "I mean warm in the pocket."</p>
               <p>"Perfectly ſo, and in every other reſpect," rejoined Carlos, "for generoſity warms his hand, friendſhip his heart, virtue and gratitude his ſoul, while compaſſion blazes in his eye for every child of misfortune, and the cottage that ſhelters the victim of poverty feels the warmth of his benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence in the blaze of the cheering faggots that form his little fire."</p>
               <p>By every artful kind of ſtratagem did the old gentleman ſtrive to obtain the wiſhed intelligence, but Carlos's ingenuity evaded every poſſible diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very and he left him to his own contemplation."</p>
               <p>Finding himſelf baffled and derided, he again ventured to the cabin, where he conſoled himſelf with ſmoaking a pipe, to the annoyance of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral females, whoſe coughs and whiſper were lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:029134_0103_0FDFADAF9A68B630"/>
noticed by him, ſelf-comfort being his only conſideration.</p>
               <p>A plump dame ſurrounded by three ſhuffling boys, complained loudly of the offenſive tobacco. "Bobby will certainly be ſick," cried ſhe, hug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging up a roſy cheeked chub, the expreſs image of herſelf, "you muſt either go a top of the deck, Sir, or I inſiſt the window ſhall be open, for we ſhall be poiſoned and ſtifled alive, as bad as thof we were ſtuffed in the black-hole at <hi>Calcoretta</hi> What d'ye callum place, I ſhall be a fine figure by the time I gets to <hi>Brighthamſted;</hi> this is my laſt clean apron, and it looks rare and <hi>ſmudgey,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide we ſhall ſmell like pole-cats; God bleſs Bob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, he's ſick as death."</p>
               <p>"If Bobby had ſtuffed leſs cold gooſe juſt now, his ſtomach would have been in a better ſtate to bear theſe wholeſome fumes," cried the old gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, "ſo a natural caſcade won't do him much harm, pop him upon deck he'll do very well."</p>
               <p>"Who aſked your advice, ſquire nettletop?" returned ſhe, clawing up the boy on one hip and waddling out of the cabin.</p>
               <p>"Lord Edwin and Roſalie were ſeated on deck, praying for the hour that would diſcover the long expected ſhore, and free them from the diſguſting

               <p>MONTAGUE had been ordered by the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis to appriſe him of their arrival at Brighton, which injunction being punctually obeyed, the family where anxiouſly awaiting the appointed hour—the morning had paſſed and the traveller not arrived. The Marquis ſtrolled with his daughters to a pavilion in the park, a beautiful edifice erected and ornamented entirely to the taſte of the fair ſiſters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Its form was octagon, and the columns that ſupported it of curious marble, and a flight of ſteps with white and gold railing led to the Portico, the door of which was inlaid with pannals of looking-glaſs, reflecting the beautiful proſpect, and deluding the eye with an imaginary view through the pavilion, which produced a charming effect. The window opened in the Ital<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ſtile, lattices of green wire ſupported the cluſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering roſes that encircled one window, while as

round the oppoſite one luxuriant paſſion-flowers correſponded their beautiful ſhade.</p>
               <p>The door opening diſcovered a ſpacious room, around whoſe ſides in various receſſes the muſes were beautifully repreſented; in one part an elegant piano forte, in another a noble library, while va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious capital drawings, the performance of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Virginia Philomel, ſuſpended at a third win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow over a bowl of gold-fiſh; and at a fourth was fixed to a camera-obſcura. The matting which covered the centre of the floor was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of coloured ſtraw, wove to the fancy in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious devices, and formed by the fair hands of the ladies, a charming ſpecimen of their taſte and abilities: Several pieces of embroidery, cloth, bead, fillagree, and various other curious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances were arranged in different ſituations, and the delighted Marquis had given it the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation of "the Pavillion of ingenuity."</p>
               <p>Boundleſs was the landſcape on either ſide, and from this delightful retreat Lady Adela's pencil traced the pictureſque beauties of nature; here they conſtantly devoted ſeveral hours every morning, to indulge the wanderings of fancy, while ſome new invention formed an admirable chief d'ouvre from the fertility of their imagination, which furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them a continual ſource of amuſement.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="110" facs="unknown:029134_0108_0FDFADBE0C911250"/>'Twas here the Marquis had taken a book at one of the windows, while Lady Adela was adding the laſt tints to a beautiful landſcape, and Lady Louiſa practiſing a new Italian air, on her piano, when Montague opened the door of the pavilion and preſented Roſalie.</p>
               <p>The Marquis ſtarted and the book dropped— the ladies inſtantly roſe and conducted her to their father, where the lovely girl reſpectfully dropped on one knee, and ſuffuſed in bluſhes raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her fine eyes abſorbed in tears, as the Marquis preſſed her hand, and bid her riſe.</p>
               <p>"My noble generous protector," cried the charming creature, "May the ill-fated girl your bounty has cheriſhed, reward, by her grateful af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, the duty ſhe owes her benefactor, long may ſhe ſhare the tender affection he has faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhewn her helpleſs infancy, ſacred to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of an honored parent once poſſeſſing his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and eſteem."</p>
               <p>The Marquis claſped her hand, "Grateful Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalie," replied he, "the memory of thy valued mother ſteals from me an avowal of equal affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for her lovely child, come then to my boſom and receive that bleſſing and protection no longer hers to beſtow, while her angelic form hovers over us, and guards thee pure and ſpotleſs as her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>He then retired from the pavilion to his libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and ſummoned Montague, from whom he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the miniature carefully ſealed, which he inſtantly opened, and beheld indeed the moſt accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate reſemblance of his adored Lavinia; thrice he preſſed it to his lips, and then conſigned it to the inmoſt receſs of his eſcrutore, encloſed in a packet of papers, expreſſing every particular of of the birth of Roſalie, with ſeveral letters from Lady Lavinia, theſe were carefully ſealed with the Marquis's arms, and directed for Roſalie."</p>

               <p>Paſſing the green-houſe, Andrew, whoſe curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity was ever alive, was purpoſely refreſhing his blooming parterre, and on their approach had gathered a beautiful roſe, from which his ruſty ſciſſars were clipping the thorns, "Would the lady do me the honour to accept a roſe?" aſked he, making a low bow, while his ſilver-threaded locks waved on his ſun-burnt cheek.</p>

               <p>Returning to the houſe they were met in the hall by Mrs. Gertrude, Agnes, and Wilſon, the attendant of Lady Louiſa, to whom the news of Mademoiſelle's arrival had been announced by

               <p>"Why, yes, Ma'am ſo I have heard my Lord the Marquis ſay; and our young maſter Lord Edwin, they ſay, is now gone over to enjoy them; Heaven preſerve him, a better gentleman never was born; God help me, I remember his chriſtening, and rare doings we had; he was always a lovely child, and now he's a man eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry body adores him he's ſo charitable and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcending."</p>
               <p>Andrew had jarred a tender ſtring, and it vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated on the heart of Roſalie, who begged he would ſhew her the way to the pavilion, that ſhe might indulge an hour in reading. They then proceeded through the ſhrubbery, and Andrew opening the door, "hoped he ſhould not diſturb her by pruning part of the foliage that obſcured

one of the windows, as the company were coming through the grounds that morning.</p>
               <p>"I muſt ſet theſe geraniums too out of the way," continued he, "for one of the ladies is very fond of a greyhound, who always follows her horſe, and ſuffers him to ramble over every thing in his way; the laſt time he ſcampered over theſe geraniums like mad, and ſnapt the head of my fineſt auricula, ſo if I dont take care we ſhall have a ſecond part of the ſame tune<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> My Lord too was not pleaſed, but Miſs Villars did not care, ſhe only whiſtled him off."</p>
               <p>"Whiſtled!" replied Roſalie, aſtoniſhed at the idea.</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes, my Lady, ſhe can whiſtle vaſtly well, and rides a hunting with Lord Edwin's hounds, in a ſcarlet jacket and a jockey cap, and our huntſman, Robin, ſays ſhe leaps a five-barred gate better than any woman in England; but my Lord don't aſk her to ride when he can help it."</p>
               <p>A ſecond bluſh ſuffuſed the cheek of Roſalie, not that ſhe dreaded the idea of a rival in a heart that had manifeſted its faithful unintereſted at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment in every inſtance, nor would ſhe for the world have drawn from Andrew the ſlighteſt queſtion tending to curioſity, though had ſhe been ſo diſpoſed ſhe could not have found a more

intelligent being for her ſubject, but her noble ſoul ſcorned ſuch mean artifice, and therefore telling Andrew ſhe would not detain him longer, he went merrily to work with his ſhears, while Roſalie opening the library, drew from thence by chance Thomſon's beautiful Poems; the book opened exactly on the ſtory of Lavinia. The charming tale excited a tear—it reminded her of a far-diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant and valued friend. Palemon's generoſity impreſſed the idea of Lord Edwin, and the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of Lavinia ſeemed nearly incident to her own: She ſhut the book, and raiſing her eyes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Andrew ſtedfaſtly gazing in apparent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhment at the tear ſhe thought private and imperceptibly ſhed, and a ſigh eſcaped her, which was anſwered by an involuntary reſponſive one from Andrew, as he deſcended the ladder with his ſhears and baſket.</p>
               <p>Roſalie touched the guitar, but not knowing its art hung it up again. A port folio of draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings lay open on the table, and ſhe ventured to peep at a few, when turning the leaves, the wind being very briſk, wafted a ſmall vellum medal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion into a thicket of woodbines. Terrified and fearful another breeze ſhould catch it, ſhe haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened down the ſteps to regain it, but what was her delight and ſurpriſe on beholding the moſt perfect reſemblance of Lord Edwin, ſketched by the pencil of his ſiſter. "Ineſtimable treaſure!"

cried ſhe, "would I dared ſteal thee, or that I could trace ſuch another, but that's impoſſible, yet would Lady Adela condeſcend to inſtruct me, I do think by conſtant practice I ſhould ſoon be able to make an humble attempt, and if ſo, it ſhall be the firſt favour I ſolicit; however incapable I may be of attaining any degree of perfection, I will at leaſt exert my beſt endeavours."</p>
               <p>Again ſhe examined every feature and then replac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it exactly in the ſame ſituation, when turning a few more leaves a profile drawing of Lady Louiſa preſented itſelf, and the dreſs being ſomewhat ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar to her mother's miniature, reminded her of the Marquis'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The hour of nine was now proclaimed by the clock from the chapel, an elegant edifice for the private uſe of the family, erected on an eminence in the park, terminating in a grove of lofty elms, and forming a moſt pleaſing ſpectacle from the windows of the caſtle, and reminding her it was time to return to the breakfaſt parlour, where ſhe found the family juſt aſſembling: Roſalie bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beautiful as the enchanting morning, curtſied and took her ſeat."</p>

               <p>SOFTLY ſweet the plaintive ſtrain broke on the attentive ear, and ſhe played with exquiſite taſte a paſtoral air, whoſe beautiful ſimplicity de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted Lady Louiſa.</p>
               <p>'Pray who taught you, Roſalie?" aſked ſhe, charmed with her taſte and execution.</p>
               <p>"Lindor, the mountaineer," replied Roſalie, "the humble admirer of Madelon, conſequently ever eſteemed by me: Madelon could not learn, indeed ſhe had not time, but my fancy was ever ſo delighted and inſpired by muſic that I begged Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor to become my inſtructor: Oh! how did I uſe to long for the hour of evening, that brought our lively youth to the cottage."</p>
               <p>"Giraldine then took her knitting to the little bench at the door, Madelon and I purſued our ſpinning, Joſephine wound our cotton, while Reu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ben

Thus paſſed the hours in inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent amuſement 'till the riſing moon warned him to depart, and as it lighted him home ſilvered the pain of our little caſement, and guided us by its clear and beautiful beam to our pillows.</p>
               <p>"Charming ruſticity!" exclaimed Lady Adela, "I am delighted with your deſcription." At that moment one of the windows became ſhaded, and Sir Henry tapped at it, mounted on Andrew's ſhort ladder, which ſtood invitingly fixed, had been forgot to be removed, and climbing up with the agility of a ſquirrel, he popped in his head, but ſeeing Roſalie coming to remove a ſtand of flowers to facilitate his entrance, he drew back, begging pardon for his abrupt intruſion, not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting to meet the eye of a ſtranger.</p>
               <p>"Pray ſtep in," ſaid Lady Louiſa, "Sir Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry's temerity ſeldom finds an obſtacle his ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity and addreſs cannot ſurmount, and as a fluent and eloquent apology would be no puniſhment to him to repeat impromptu, do not let us be depriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of it—on thoſe conditions we pardon, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore make an elegant entree."</p>
               <p>Sir Henry obeyed. "I truſt," ſaid he, Lady Louiſa will not deem it an impropriety to follow a good example, and as ladies now-a-days ſhew

their dexterity in leaping out of windows, it is but proper gentlemen ſhould keep them in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, by evincing their agility in climbing in; do not then blame a ſelf-raiſed action, charming fair; Miſs Villars and her beaus are juſt behind, and probably they may be inclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to try the ſame method by way of novel exerciſe."</p>
               <p>"How ridiculous!" ſaid Lady Louiſa, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing half angrily away.</p>
               <p>At that moment a loud peal of laughter burſt from the ſhrubbery, and Miſs Villars, her brother, Colonel Ardvine, and Lord Carlton aſcended to the pavilion; Miſs Villars took her ſeat on the ſteps, declaring ſhe was tired to death, and too hot be ſtived up in a cloſe room, "So let me alone, Ardvine, you tireſome toad," continued ſhe, ſtretching out her legs three parts diſplayed, "Do unlace my boot, I have hurt my ancle, and the confinement makes it painful.</p>
               <p>Shocked at her indelicacy, Roſalie politely of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered her aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>"No, thank you, anſwered the Amazon, with her arms croſſed and her foot extended to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel, "Ardvine is a very uſeful animal on ſuch occaſions, I will not trouble you."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="128" facs="unknown:029134_0126_0FDFADF8C1224880"/>Then leering at Lord Carleton in a half whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, "I preſume this bluſhing Miſs is the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis's ward I lately heard of, quite a compoſition of inſipidity methinks, good eyes enough too, but not the leaſt tincture of vivacity about them, mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as if God had placed them in her head only to look with, not to expreſs the paſſions of the ſoul, moves like clock-work, or as if the poor thing was afraid of damaging a baſket of eggs every time ſhe ſteps or turns round."</p>
               <p>This ſpeech finiſhed by a toniſh ſtare of impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, accompanied with a rude loud laugh, much irritated Lord Carlton.</p>
               <p>"Upon my word," replied he, "you are very ſevere, Miſs Villars, and in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion where 'tis quite needleſs, I have heard much of Miſs St. Clair's beauty and ſenſibility, and I confeſs I think the deſcription of the former by no means partial, nor do I conceive I ſhall be much diſappointed in the latter, at leaſt from ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances, however I ſhall draw no harſh conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, nor ſuffer myſelf to be biaſſed by ſo tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient a view, my motto is "lenity," and I always cautiouſly avoid cenſure, leaſt I incur the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a malicious ſcandalizer; and were I a fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, the idea of envy might alſo be attached; for, alas! that is become ſo glaring and predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant a paſſion with them, that it moulds every vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue

to its own jaundiced impreſſion: for, like a nettle planted by a roſe, you cannot attempt to admire or touch its innocent beauty but you feel the ſting of its malicious and envious competitor, who, conſcious of its inattractive powers, waves its poiſon to contaminate the harmleſs bloſſom, and undermines its tender leaves where leaſt ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected; If ſuch a weed rankles in the boſom of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalie St. Clair, Ethelbert Carlton will endeavour to eradicate its pernicious root. Miſs Villars may applaud or condemn his morality, but a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's reflection will convince her the lecture, however, unpleaſing, is founded on truth, and I truſt her candour and good ſenſe will coincide to clear him from the imputation of prejudice or ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gidity to the errors of levity."</p>
               <p>This fervently addreſſed ſpeech by no means pleaſed his auditor. "I think," cried ſhe, Carl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton would write a mighty good ſermon, and if he will make an attempt to preach it alſo, I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend to nod ſome Sunday afternoon in an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite pew, for the ſake of a moralizing dream."</p>
               <p>Lord Carlton, diſguſted with her inſolent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort, walked away, and took his ſeat by Lady A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dela, and Miſs Villars finding herſelf abandoned by the beaus, ſoon after entered the pavilion, with her boot in one hand and her hat in the other, and without regarding the preſence of any one, ran

               <p>"Well then, plat them up again," replied ſhe, "I believe I ſhall be cropped for Newmarket, it will be ſo convenient to hunt too with Lord Edwin. Ah! a-propos, when does he return?</p>
               <p>"Very ſhortly," anſwered Lady Adela, "but he means to ſell his fine hunter, for the laſt chace was ſo infringed on by the farmers, whom Edwin did not like to reprove, that it rendered it diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable, and as he is not very partial to that cruel diverſion, he was eaſily prevailed on to give it up.</p>
               <p>A ſecond glance at the mirror diſcovered a fault in the adjuſtment of her neck-cloth and off it came, folded in an enormous ſtuffing and two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra handkerchiefs.

               <p>They ſoon after adjourned to the ſtable to give their opinion of a fine horſe late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly purchaſed, in whoſe commendation Miſs Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars was very eloquent, to the no ſmall amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the grooms, to whom ſhe made ſeveral obſervations: They then returned to the houſe to take chocolate, and departed, earneſtly entreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ladies to favour her with their company at the villa, but cautiouſly avoided inviting Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalie, whom ſhe treated with the very eſſence of hauteur, and making her only a ſlight inclination of her head en-paſſant, mounted her horſe and let off in full trot for a wager with the Colonel.</p>
               <p>Many and various were the opinions concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Miſs Villars:—To the men ſhe was a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral object of deriſion—to the women a diſguſting Amazonian: Yet, even while they viewed her conduct, carried to a pitch of abſurdity, their le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient boſoms could not help pitying her errors.

and ill-nature, was her perfect character. yet though her behaviour warranted every free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, her virtue caught the moſt tranſient alarm.</p>
               <p>Poſſeſſed of a fine fortune and the only daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a noble family, every one bowed to the dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates of Georgina, and thus trained up in the practice of ſelf-will, could it be wondered ſhe now reigned the haughty tyrant of uncontrouled power.</p>
               <p>The fair ſiſters beheld her with diſguſt; ſhe was by no means a pleaſing aſſociate, whoſe aſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing virtues could direct or emulate their own, yet as Mr. Villars, her father, was a man of general ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance and reſpectability, and frequently vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited at the caſtle from buſineſs or pleaſure, it was neceſſary to be diſtantly polite to his daughter, who occaſionally intruded, but ſeldom had her vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſits returned; yet to the ladies ſhe always behav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as polite and friendly as her irritable temper would permit.</p>

               <p>A FEW days elapſed when a letter from Lord Edwin announced his intended arrival at the caſtle in three or four days.

ſome friends were expected at the Caſtle in a day or two, for whoſe accommodation her apartment would be wanted, and it was the Marquis's wiſh ſhe ſhould go on a viſit to the Abbey during their ſtay, for ſome private reaſons they could not aſſign.</p>
               <p>"When our viſitors are gone" ſaid Lady Ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la, "we will come and partake your ſociety at Thornley, where our good aunt will make you an excellent companion, her ſpacious library will ſerve to amuſe you. and your lute will ſound ſweetly, and delight Lady Mentoria in her ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtered ſhades, while, various other amuſements will charm the fleeting hours and not leave you a languid moment."</p>
               <p>Roſalie bowed obedience with a heart far more inclined to undertake her journey than they ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, and in the evening ſtepping into the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis's poſt chariot and four, ſhe ſet off blithe and happy, waving her hand in reſpectful adieus as the carriage drove down the avenue, and the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis felt a degree of pleaſure tempered by the hope of ſecurity, as he watched the carriage out of ſight.</p>
               <p>The evening of the ſecond day ſhewed her the turrets of the Abbey peeping through the ivy that encircled their baſis, and the thick and gloomy-ſhading plantations that emboſomed the gothic

pile: the lambent fires of day darted a burniſhed gleam on the high arched windows, and eve's laſt roſy tints were juſt expiring, while ruby ſhadows in fantaſtic forms played in the empurpled weſt, and the wild poet of the glade joined her ſoft dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet note to animate the paſſing woodman's rural ſong, who, homeward trudging to his little cottage in the neighbouring hamlet, diſplaced the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable pipe to chaunt his ruſtic ballad, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his tattered hat in token of civility to the lovely ſtranger.</p>
               <p>The element was ſerenely beautiful, innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fleecy clouds, tinged with ſoft golden fluid, in fantaſtic forms floated on the azured canopy, and in the wide expanſe of aether the moon's tranſparent ſilver-ſeeming maſk peeped forth its myſtic and refulgent form.</p>
               <p>At length the chaiſe ſtopped at the antique porch; pondrous arches ſupported the maſſy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bric, and from the ivy-twined pillars deep ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creted the little chearful robin peeped his head and hailed the ſtranger with a welcome ſong. The maſſy hinges hoſpitably opened, and received the timid gueſt.</p>

the memorials of at leaſt two centuries; the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn gloom and the ſound of her own feet echoing up the great ſtair-caſe made her ſhudder, and ſhe cloſely followed Montague, not daring to turn her head, paſſing through a long range of gallery, and peeping into ſeveral large apartments, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague opened an enormous door and Roſalie ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>On a high chair of crimſon velvet, curiouſly cut, ſat Lady Mentoria; a diminutive figure about ſeventy-ſix: habited in a rich brown tabby ſacque and treble ruffles with a ſhort black lace apron and hood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhe aroſe and politely ſaluted her fair gueſt, who preſented a letter from the Marquis, which the Dowager read with attention, often glancing a look at Roſalie, who was ſurvey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with aſtoniſhment the pondrous window frames and dark wainſcot, againſt whoſe chequered pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel ſeveral family portraits in lumbering frames ſtarted their gruff countenances, and chilled her beating heart.</p>
               <p>"Mercy on me," thought ſhe, "I wiſh I was in my native cottage, or ſafe out of this place, I have often heard of haunted caſtles and towers, and this gloomy Abbey brings it ſtrongly to my remembrance."</p>
               <p>"Lady Mentoria finiſhed the letter and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring into the moſt pleaſing and intereſting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:029134_0135_0FDFAE12C6CC3818"/>
totally diſſipated every diſlike from the boſom of her fair viſitor; in ſhort it was hard to ſay which was moſt pleaſed with their companion, for Lady Mentoria ſubjoined the moſt amiable, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the many virtues ſhe poſſeſſed, and never forgot the ſunſhine of eighteen could cheer the chill winter of ſeventy, tampered with the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial contraſt of acquieſcent politeneſs and good nature retaliated from youth to age, tenderly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved by all who knew her, and reſpected by every claſs of ſociety, ſhe had bent the youthful minds of her neices to the perfect model of her own eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble character.</p>
               <p>The hour of retiring drew nigh, and Lady Mentoria, with the alacrity of youths tripped along the gallery, and led Roſalie to her apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where wiſhing her refreſhing ſlumbers ſhe withdrew.</p>
               <p>Roſalie left alone began to examine every part of her ſpacious chamber; the ceiling was vaulted, and groteſque characters repreſented on its damp-diſcoloured ſurface exhibited the moſt hideous and non-deſcript creatures: The windows were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely high and arched in the old-faſhioned ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral ſtile, darkened at top with ſeveral pains of ſtained glaſs, one only opened low enough to obtain a view of the garden; ſhe drew up the dark green damaſk curtain that ſhaded it, and
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:029134_0136_0FDFAE1529286850"/>
threw up the ſaſh to take a ſurvey of what the trembling moonlight's palid beam would permit her to diſcover through the thick branches of ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding trees, that appeared to bound a portion of park, or lawn; all was ſilent but the hoarſe voice of a Newfoundland dog, from the porter's lodge, that growled occaſionally; ſhe now drew down the heavy frame and began to undreſs.</p>
               <p>On the oppoſite ſide of the room ſtood a high an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique bed, whoſe fringed canopy ſuſpended from the ceiling by tarniſh brackets; the hangings of the room were faded tapeſtry, repreſenting the famous ſiege of Troy, but as Roſalie was totally unacquainted with the heathen mythology, ſhe was ignorant of what it was.</p>
               <p>Her wax taper now burnt dim and increaſed the gloom, her heart beat quick and irregular, and ſhe would have given the world for a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: Something at that moment tapped at the window, and the terrified Roſalie remained im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable, with her eyes earneſtly fixed on the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, to obſerve its movement, but all being ſtill ſhe muſtered reſolution to approach it, and lifting the candle as high as ſhe could raiſe it at arms length, the ſudden light diſturbed the intruder in the form of a large bat, which fluttered down, on the floor: This was ſome relief to her terror,
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:029134_0137_0FDFAE1AA2E58478"/>
and ſhe compaſſionately gave him his liberty, and once more compoſed herſelf and undreſſed; but, alas! croſſing the room to extinguiſh the candle ſomething twitched the top of her hand, and with an involuntary ſhriek, ſhe fell on the ground, and the wax taper being in her hand was ſmothered and left her in total darkneſs.</p>
               <p>Her ſhriek ſoon echoed to Lady Mentoria's chamber, and the Dowager not being at yet in bed, though ſhe had diſmiſſed her attendant, ſlipped on a long robe de chambre and haſtened to inquire the cauſe, and opening the door, all in white, with a ſmall lamp in her hand, her groteſque head dreſs, had probably increaſed the terror of Roſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, had ſhe not fallen on her face with both hands over her eyes, 'till the voice of Lady Mentoria rouſed her ſtupor, to whom ſhe related her fright, begging a thouſand pardons for the trouble ſhe had occaſioned. Lady Mentoria ſmiling, tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſoothed her agitation, "Make yourſelf happy, little timorous girl," ſaid ſhe, "Hervey ſhall ſleep with you; however let me convince you the imaginary ſpectre that touched you was no other than the bell-taſſel, which depends from the centre of the ceiling, and which you probably did not obſerve or ſuppoſe yourſelf within its reach, therefore reſt aſſured there are no ghoſts haunt this Abbey that have not four legs at leaſt, and ſhould they moleſt you, your good ſenſe and innocence will

protect you 'till we can trace the tremendous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truders."</p>
               <p>Poor Roſalie, abaſhed and angry at her weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and expoſition, entreated Lady Mentoria to retire, ſaying ſhe was perfectly convinced of her folly, and would not trouble Mrs. Hervey to change her bed.</p>
               <p>With this perfect aſſurance of courage the old Lady retired, and Roſalie jumped into bed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect on her ridiculous timidity, which ſhe deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to conquer, and committing herſelf to the protection of the guardian angels, who hover around the pillow of innocence, ſhe reclined in the ſweeteſt ſlumber, 'till a robin, perched on a branch that ſhaded her window, waked her with his Morning oriſon.</p>

               <p>ROSALIE obeyed the ſummon of her plumaged monitor, and deſcended to the parlour juſt in time to ſee Montague ſet off home. For two hours ſhe amuſed herſelf in the grounds, and ſtrolling to the end of a high terrace that bounded the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey, ſhe aſcended a flight of ſteps that led to part of a rugged cliff, from whence on the pebbly ſhore ſhe could diſcover the hovels of ſeveral fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ermen, and their ruddy children dancing and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſing themſelves on the ſands, while their chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful voices chatting and laughing broke upon the ſilent breeze and waſted every ſyllable to her ear.</p>
               <p>A beautiful ſerene ocean was bounded by a fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilized country on one ſide, and a noble ſhore guarded by impending cliffs on the other. Here ſhe amuſed herſelf half an hour and then return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

reſolving to ſpend every leiſure hour in this romantic and beautiful ſpot, as a favourite re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat from the glooms of the Abbey, when Lady Mentoria would indulge her with a ſtroll.</p>
               <p>On entering the parlour Mrs. Hervey made her appearance, begging to know if ſhe choſe to breakfaſt, as her Lady always took her cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colate in her own room, which ſhe never quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted 'till twelve, therefore deſired her young vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitor would amuſe herſelf as ſhe pleaſed.</p>

               <p>Proceeding to the cliff where Roſalie had taken her morning ſeat, ſhe diſcovered a winding path, guarded by ſmall green rails, which Lady Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toria <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="144" facs="unknown:029134_0142_0FDFAE28E7EF7708"/>Three neat looking women and ſeven chubby children now welcomed their noble benefactreſs: One produced her ſpinning, another her knitting, and the third conſtantly made and repaired the fiſhing nets; while their huſbands at various hours when they were on ſhore, were each fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with a loom, and wove<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dowlaſs for their own wear, and the neighbouring villagers, to whom her Ladyſhip permitted them to ſell any requiſite quantity, by way of perquiſite and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of their induſtry.</p>
               <p>The boat ſoon after arrived, and the fiſhers leaping on ſhore preſented ſome beautiful prawns which were received with a benignant ſmile of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, and after making a few inquiries, and diſtributing the fruit among the children, (whoſe ſparkling eyes beamed expectation on the baſket's ſtore) enjoined them to be good and dutiful, and ſlipping a ſhilling into each of their hands, told them it was the gift of the young lady they ſaw with her, to whom they muſt be reſpectfully obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient as to herſelf.</p>
               <p>Slowly they re-aſcended the cliff, often pauſing to enjoy the healthy breezes of the ocean, and contemplate the reſtleſs wave daſhing its ſtarry foam along the pebbly ſhore, while at a diſtance the inflated white ſails of a paſſing veſſel burniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the meridian ſun, glided on the boſom of

the parted wave, and dazzled with its brightneſs the attentive eye that watched its leſſening ſight —Roſalie was charmed.</p>
               <p>"As you love to contemplate the beauties of nature and innocence," ſaid Lady Mentoria, "I ſhall now lead you to an inland ſcene; I have ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven cottages in the village which contain inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of every deſcription, among them are the youthful and the aged: in one dwells a young in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious couple juſt married, in a ſecond an aged pair, in a third a deſolated elderly widow, who inſtructs and protects two little orphans, in a fourth a couple in the autumn of life, ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by four charming children, whoſe notability furniſhes and aſſiſts their tender parents; in the fifth lives a venerable old warrior, and two ſons, ſprightly, clever lads, now his only glory, though the field of honour has inveſted him with many badges of valour, and though deprived of one leg, his crutches are in his opinion trophies he has never regretted to exchange; my ſixth cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage contains a poor blind man and one daughter, innocent, mild, and beautiful as the morn, the moſt dutiful affectionate girl the fondeſt parent could delight in; while in my ſeventh and laſt rural habitation lives a diſtreſſed curate, with a la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>"This is Philip Stanley's cottage," ſaid Lady Mentoria, "and the faithful Ellen, his new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>made bride I ſee is buſy at work, let us ſtep in."</p>
               <p>Ellen roſe with a baſket of ſtockings ſhe was repairing, and Lady Mentoria complimenting her jocularly on her improving looks, enquired for Philip, who was gone to cut turf and faggots, proceeded to the next, where they found Lennox, the old warrior, mending one of his crutches, and whiſtling, "God ſave the King.'</p>
               <p>"Here is a news paper for you," ſaid Lady Mentoria, "which I know is a great treat to you, but do not ſuffer the feelings of ſenſibility to agitate you too far, remember you have been poorly, yet I don't forbid you to drop a tear of humanity for the woes of a fellow ſoldier, as you read the ſad devaſtating fate of war.</p>
               <p>Lennox bowed and conſigned it to his pocket, while his eloquent eye and ſhaking head ſeemed to ſay he could enlarge on that ſubject if permitted.</p>

               <p>The neighbouring cottage ſheltered an aged pair, the poor old man crept feebly out to the door, with his ſpectacles in one hand, and a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the other: "Your Ladyſhip will excuſe the derangement of our cottage," ſaid he, wiping a tear on his ſleeve, "for we have juſt received a letter from our dear boy Ben, who has been eight years in the Eaſt Indies, come next Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas, and the good fellow ſends us the joyful news, he ſhall be down here in leſs than a fortnight, and has brought home ſomething to make our lives comfortable out of his earnings: Powers of mercy, we have been out of our wits with joy theſe three hours, and not a jot of work done for thinking on it, for we thought he might be dead, and never had a notion of ſeeing him in this world again."</p>
               <p>"Well, ſaid Lady Mentoria, "don't flurry yourſelf, I will provide a bed for him in your back room, let me know when he comes, ſend him to the Abbey, his dutiful attention pleaſes me."</p>
               <p>The old man bowed, and Lady Mentoria con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued her walk.</p>

               <p>"Always full of employment!" ſaid her La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyſhip, taking up ſome platted ſtraw his ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty had wove together, and formed into ſmall mats and baſkets.</p>
               <p>"'Tis merely amuſement," ſaid Orford, "but laſt night I finiſhed a large baſket as a preſent for your Ladyſhip, 'twill hold grapes or peaches, if you will honour me by accepting it from a poor blind man; Maria arranged the coloured ſtraw,

               <p>"Make me two or three more, Orford, and I will give you half a crown a piece for your trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble."</p>
               <p>"Oh! heavens bleſs my good lady, the honour of making them will be quite ſufficient, do I not conſtantly live on your bounty, and while I enjoy that bleſſing God forbid I ſhould be covetous; permit me then to make them only as a ſmall but grateful return for the abundant favours you have heaped on me, and my heart in conſequence will feel lighter, by the idea of retaliating in ſome trifling meaſure, the gratitude I owe you."</p>
               <p>"Excellent man!" ſaid Lady Mentoria, "pleaſe yourſelf, and finiſh them at your leiſure: Maria's jacket wears faſt, and I mean to give her a new one."</p>
               <p>A fluſh of joy paſſed Maria's cheek, and ſhe poured her thanks. Lady Mentoria ſoon after returned through the village with every one's bleſſing waſted around her.</p>

               <p>THREE days had elapſed, and Roſalie and Lady Mentoria were juſt partaking a fine pine af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter dinner, when the door opened, and Lord Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win limping in, ſhook hands with his aunt, and bowed gracefully to Roſalie.</p>
               <p>"My dear Edwin," cried the aſtoniſhed and confounded Lady Mentoria, "what can poſſibly have brought you to the Abbey, is any accident the occaſion of this unexpected viſit?"</p>
               <p>"A flight one," anſwered he. "My horſe being reſtive, bruſhed too cloſe by the wheel of a waggon, and has bruiſed my leg, the pain of which encreaſing, I thought it moſt prudent
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:029134_0153_0FDFAE4B4AC27C70"/>
to make the beſt of my way to Thornley, and not endanger it by proceeding to the caſtle; but had I known you was engaged with company, I ſhould not have intruded."</p>
               <p>"Oh, that young lady is only my companion, the ward of your father, an amiable orphan, Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win, who has been bred in an obſcure part of Switzerland, Chamouny, I believe 'tis called: our diſpoſitions ſeem exactly to ſuit, and I truſt we ſhall enjoy many happy years at the Abbey, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally viſiting my nieces at the Caſtle."</p>
               <p>Luckily for Roſalie, Lady Mentoria had been too much engaged and flurried by the entrance of her nephew, to obſerve the emotion that agitated the boſom of her fair companion. Delighted to ſee him—fearful of diſcovery—doubtful if he had really experienced the accident he complained of, and unconſcious how to gain a moment's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation—a thouſand perplexities baniſhed and recalled the roſe on her cheek, but very fortunate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to relieve her ſuſpenſe Lady Mentoria begged he would make uſe of ſome embrocation, which ſhe retired to fetch from her private laboratory, and the intermediate moment of her abſence fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed Roſalie with a full explanation of the art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſtratagem he had uſed to prevent ſuſpicion, by aſſuring her that he was perfectly free from acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and had flown on the wings of love to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy her ſmiles.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="156" facs="unknown:029134_0154_0FDFAE4D6CD64D50"/>Lady Mentoria juſt then entering with her em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brocation, ended the momentary converſation, and thankfully taking the bottle, he retired to bathe the imaginary contuſion, and ſoon after return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>"'Tis ſtrange, ſaid he as he entered, my boot ſhould have given me ſo much pain, and yet not the leaſt ſign of external injury is perceivable." This he thought a ſufficient excuſe, ſhould his aunt, as the famous village doctreſs, inſiſt upon examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it and preferring her judgment and ſkill, ſo limping as naturally as poſſible, the Dowager's credulity was eaſily impoſed on.</p>
               <p>In the courſe of the evening Lord Edwin diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantly polite and ſedate, introduced the topic of Italian. "You are, no doubt, a proficient Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>amſelle," ſaid he, addreſſing Roſalie by the moſt tender epithet in that language, which being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely unknown to the venerable companion, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed them the beſt contrivance poſſible, "Will you," continued he, "do me the favour to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect any imperfections in that elegant language; converſing with a native I ſhall doubtleſs much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the little I at preſent know."</p>
               <p>"Nay," replied her Ladyſhip, "you are reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned to ſpeak it very fluent, why then talk of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:029134_0155_0FDFAE4F201FDC98"/>
and correction of error; but don't you mean to write to your father?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly not, why ſhould I alarm him," anſwered he, "you know his timidity would cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate a hundred enſuing evils, a day or two will e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable me to proceed, and he will eaſily make an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe for my detainment on the road, as travellers are never certain where curioſity is the deity they ſeek, and reſtriction does not clip the wings of time in her purſuance."</p>
               <p>Every point of apparent propriety being thus ſettled, Edwin remained three days at the Abbey, and was then unable to plead longer excuſe, while Lady Mentoria, who watched with the moſt rigid circumſpection the conduct of his Lordſhip, was perfectly ſatisfied he entertained no other ſenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for her fair charge than what his natural polit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and affability inſpired, and therefore ordering her low cabriolet, took her ſeat by the ſide of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalie, and accompanied him part of the way for an airing.</p>
               <p>Time had hobbled lamely with the Marquis, but when the long expected moment arrived, and Lord Edwin mentioned his delay at the Abbey, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis's blood changed told; but recovering himſelf he enquired how his ſiſter was.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="158" facs="unknown:029134_0156_0FDFAE50DC658800"/>"Perfectly well, and happy in the ſociety of her fair charge."</p>
               <p>"And what do you think of her? aſked the Marquis, fixing his eyes intently on his ſon's.</p>
               <p>"I think her a pleaſing and intereſting compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion," replied Lord Edwin, aſſumming all poſſible ſang froid, "a brilliant, the ſhades of obſcurity has not deprived of its luſtre, and I don't doubt a little emulative poliſh will ſoon render it a moſt perfect and admirable acquiſition to the envied poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor: She is a pleaſant Swiſs girl, charmingly liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet modeſt and politely diffident, by what lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle I obſerved, and I really think ſhe will be a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry delightful companion for my aunt, if the gloomy Abbey does not inſtil too much of the penſoroſe, for 'tis a wretched dull place and would ſoon give me the horrors."</p>
               <p>"My aunt tells me ſhe is the daughter of ſome humble friend of yours, on whoſe deceaſe you was appointed guardian: Fortunate orphan! to have the protection of ſo benevolent a man: Excuſe me, Sir, nor think me guilty of adulation, you have ever evinced yourſelf the beſt of fathers, and my heart would be ungrateful not to acknowledge your worth."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="159" facs="unknown:029134_0157_0FDFAE589EA3DF40"/>"She is, alas! the child of misfortune in every ſenſe," anſwered the Marquis, ſecretly rejoicing to have extracted the ſentiments of his ſon, "but I ſhall take care of her with the anxious ſolicitude of a parent, 'till I can marry her to ſome worthy and amiable man deſerving her affection, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>trating look, if poſſible to confuſe him.</p>
               <p>"Humph, yes," anſwered the cautions Edwin, "tolerable; what can you expect in fact from a complexion expoſed to the beams of the meridian, or the keen blaſts of the mountainous climate, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guarded by the ſhades of art or faſhion, to repel thoſe extremes ſo pernicious to a delicate ſkin; all the beauty Roſalie can boaſt is the glow of health, that ſhe eminently poſſeſſes, and nature has cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly traced her pencil in the pureſt bloom to ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate her cheek, like the wild roſe expoſed to each inclement ray, ſtill boaſting lovelineſs and purity, while the rude wind that whiſtles round its head bends with ſeverity its feeble ſtem, but cannot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt it of its charms: Yet I do not wiſh to call her handſome, her amiability of diſpoſition will ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently endear her to thoſe whoſe generous and ſeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hearts participate her fate."</p>
               <p>The Marquis now left him with a mind relieved from ſuſpicion, and feſtivity preſided the evening

circle, 'till Lord Edwin ordering Carlos to unpack his portmanteau, delivered his father a letter from his friend at Paris, informing him his ſon could not ſail for India with Lord Edwin, as propoſed, from ſome particular occurrence, and therefore totally declined the voyage. This was a ſecond annihilation to the Marquis's projects, and ſullen and dejected he retired to reſt.</p>

               <p>THE morning brought a number of friends to the Caſtle, to congratulate Lord Edwin's return, and inquire how ſoon he intended to ſail on his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian expedition, amongſt them was the Ducheſs of Albermarle, and her daughter Lady Cecilia Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verie, to whom the Marquis's partiality of genea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy hoped to command the affection of Lord Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win, as his future bride.</p>
               <p>She was too tall to be elegant, her countenance pallid and unintereſting, her diſpoſition haughty,
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:029134_0159_0FDFAE5C28E26670"/>
and her partiality to the follies of dreſs extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly outre: yet to theſe imperfections was the Marquis totally blind; to unite the blazoned eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutcheon was his ſole wiſh, and, alas! the finer feelings of ſenſibility were eclipſed by the dazzling allurement of grandeur, even founded on the baſis of total diſregard; he thought the ſacrifice of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs amply ſubſtituted by the idolatry ſuch ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour would revert on his family from the antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated alliance; love had loſt its potent charm in his boſom, the flame was extinct that once blazed, with the ſpirit of congeniality, and now the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roding worm of inſatiate ambition ſupplied its place. Fatal tyrant! whoſe uncontrolled power ſways every precept; love ſhrinks from thy bane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful influence, pity diſolves in tears at thy predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, while friendſhip half withdraws the extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hand of unity, and ſuſpects a lurking thorn concealed beneath the blooming yet fallacious roſe of happineſs; and every virtue is impriſoned by this deſpot, in its deep receſs: But for thy influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the venerable Tankerville was the tendereſt parent, the moſt faithful friend, and generous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactor. His pillow was this night ſtrewn with the ſharp thorns of ſuſpicion and vexation, which every reminiſcentia ſerved but to augment, and his ſleepleſs eyes were languid and heavy when he deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended to breakfaſt.</p>

                  <pb n="162" facs="unknown:029134_0160_0FDFAE5E6859A2B8"/>After the repaſt was ended Lord Edwin was ſummoned to the library, and the Marquis deve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loped the burthenſome ſecret that rankled in his boſom, by declaring his ſentiments in favour of Lady Cecilia, and earneſtly recommending ſuch conſideration to his ſon.</p>

               <p>"Ah! my dear Sir," ſaid he, reſpectfully ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his hand, "Edwin avows his real ſentiments when he declares, Lady Cecilia boaſts no charms to captivate his affection, love alone muſt bind the fetter that retains his heart; yet, reſt aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, prudence, honour, and virtue ſhall unite the roſy links of his bondage, when inclination ſolicits the ſacrifice at the ſhrine of fidelity, and parental affection ſmiles an approving conſent; yet, I beſeech you never aſk me to beſtow that heart on Lady Cecilia, while its inmoſt feelings reject with painful anxiety its inability to retali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate a mutual impreſſion."</p>
               <p>"You are reſolved then never to comply," ſaid the irritated Marquis.</p>
               <p>"Never while my ſoul revolts could I be the impious wretch to violate the ſacred oath record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

on the page of futurity, under the ſpecious ſanction of pretended love, while duplicity alone veiled my diſguſt."</p>
               <p>"Enough, enough," anſwered the enraged pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, "ſeal your lips on the ſubject, nor dare in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade my ear with your high-flown phraſes more; yet remember, the hour you diſobey my wiſh, by uniting yourſelf without my approbation, ſhall diſinherit you from every poſſible ſource of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune I can curtail: Retire and reflect on the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy of your refuſal, and when reaſon cools your heated imagination you may probably relent, and ſtudy my happineſs as well as your own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt."</p>

               <p>The Ducheſs and Lady Cecilia were unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately invited to dinner, which was no ſmall em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſment to Lord Edwin after the ſubject juſt diſcuſſed; the ceremony of dinner being ended without any particular occurrence, the Marquis propoſed an evening ride, and as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

through mortification: Lord Carlton and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Frederic Waldegrave mounted their horſes; Sir Henry was to lead the way, the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricle followed, and the Landau and horſemen brought up the rear.</p>
               <p>Lord Carlton's horſe had not proceeded above two miles when taking fright at a water-mill it conquered the ſkill of the rider and threw him. Lady Adela, who ſaw the inevitable danger, ſhrieked and fainted on the Ducheſs's ſhoulder, and the whole cavalcade inſtantly ſtopped; the Ducheſs's ſalts were ſucceſsfully applied, and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Adela revived amidſt the confuſion of catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the furious animal, who was now too mettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to mount, and at the earneſt deſire of the Ducheſs and lady Adela he agreed to take his ſeat in the landau, though much wiſhing to continue his equeſtrian exerciſe, but to calm the terror of the ladies who ſo earneſtly entreated his forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, his polite condeſcenſion obediently adopted their plan, and the vicious ſteed was to be led by the ſervants.</p>
               <p>Lady Cecilia, whoſe companion had probably not entertained her on the moſt pleaſing or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſting ſubject, tired with his non-chalance, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to mortify herſelf no longer, but put her reſolution of quitting her ſeat in practice, and thereby convince herſelf of the reality or fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy

of her ſuggeſtion, not doubting from his cool inſipid behaviour her company was totally, indifferent to him, and begged to exchange her ſeat with Lord Carlton, as one of the curricle horſes had become very mettleſome ſince the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid flight of the other, and declared her agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would not permit her to go any farther.</p>
               <p>Lord Edwin ſecretly rejoicing at her riddance, inſtantly offered his hand to alight, aſſuring her, he was apprehenſive of the animal's becoming ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unruly.

               <p>"Oh dear," replied ſhe, "I have ſeen none yet worthy of admiration, and Lord Edwin complains of the head-ach, which, of courſe, rendered our goſſip very inſipid; I deteſt to hear of ennui, much more endure it, it vapours me to death in five minutes, therefore I thought it beſt not to increaſe it by my chat, ſo we have not uttered more than <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Not for the world," replied the voice of Lord Carlton at the carriage wheel, while Lady Adela glowed like crimſon.</p>
               <p>"Surely," returned the Marquis, "the men are moſt proper objects to encounter difficulties, and if any ſhould ariſe Providence by <hi>your</hi> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers will preſerve them no doubt."</p>

                  <pb n="167" facs="unknown:029134_0165_0FDFAE6CA0CDDB90"/>"Inſenſate!" thought Lord Edwin, as he handed her to the carriage, "How would Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalie's eye have wandered o'er this charming ſpot, and diſcovered a thouſand beauties my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuity had never remarked, while this inſipid mortal finds no perfection from the circle of her toilet, nor acknowledges a beauty ſhe does not conceive centred in her own imaginary ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance."</p>
               <p>Carlton ſat lolling home in the curricle, muſing on the energy of Lady Adela's ſolicitation, to brave the apparent danger, and reſign her ſafer ſeat to him.</p>
               <p>"Moralizing Mentor!" ſaid Lord Edwin.</p>
               <p>"Yes," anſwered he, "on human virtues in their moſt captivating form."</p>
               <p>"And I on human frailties in their moſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable and diſguſting view; thus we differ: I wonder which reflection will turn to moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage."</p>
               <p>"That we muſt profit by on mature inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation," replied Lord Carlton, "every vice has its moral, from which we may improve as pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and inclination ſhall direct, did we always aſſociate with the amiable part of mankind we

ſhould be at a loſs to preſerve ourſelves from the ſnares and corruption of the evil diſpoſed, and fall a prey to their ingenuous duplicity, under the ſpecious ſanction of candour and virtue; morality is the moſt intereſting, yet leaſt obſerved ſtudy of nature, and thus it is we entail calamity by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions daily practiſed on credulity; but what ſhall we ſay of the man whoſe view of vice is ſhaded only by a veil, whoſe texture is thinner than the fineſt gauze, if he obſtinately fears 'tis too much trouble to examine the picture, by raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the film that obſcures it, and therefore truſts to the judgment and honour of ſome by-ſtander to explain its properties, as beſt ſuits his own digeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed plan: Such a character is ſurely as pitiable as it appears contemptible, and dear bought experience too ſoon convinces him he has become the dupe of artifice when too late to retract."</p>
               <p>"Bravo," exclaimed Lord Edwin, "I ſhall record theſe ſentiments with a golden pen, on the tablet of friendſhip, thou excellent Monitor."</p>
               <p>Various ſubjects enſued, till they reached the Caſtle, and Lord Edwin, though very polite, could not obtain one ſmile from Lady Cecilia, he was not the man of gallantry to her taſte, and ſhe therefore haſtened the Ducheſs's departure, as early as poſſible.</p>

               <p>"I hope I do not diſturb you," ſaid he.</p>
               <p>"No," replied Lady Adela, much flurried, and cautiouſly drawing a paper over a ſlight ſketch ſhe had juſt made, placed it in the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but unfortunately the lock would not turn, and Lord Carlton offered his aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>"Something prevents it ſhutting," ſaid he, and pulling it open, the paper ſlipped from the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and diſcovered his own picture; but with the greateſt preſence of mind he avoided diſcloſing his ſurpriſe, and ſhutting the drawer turned and preſented the key to Lady Adela, who, unconſcious he had ſeen it was perfectly collected: Not ſo the boſom of Lord Carlton, who had not wanted this proof to confirm his ſuſpicions and utmoſt wiſh, and he now determined to gain the advice of Lord Edwin, and ſolicit him to reveal his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to the Marquis; 'twas now the fortunate moment of explanation, and he determined to

               <p>ROSALIE in the mean time was become the Angelic Divinity of the Abbey, beloved by La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Mentoria with the affection of a parent, and adored by every ſoul who knew her: once ſhe had created an alarm amongſt the peaſants on the ſhore, by ſtrolling one evening to the cliff with her late, whoſe ſoft and dulcet note juſt reached their ear in fainteſt ſound, and brought them from their ſuppers to liſten; ſhe was ſeated on the cliff, and being dreſſed in white the reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the moon on her countenance gave her a palid appearance, and juſtified the expreſs idea of an apparition: The alarm ſoon ſpread, unknown and unheard by Roſalie, who deeply occupied in

muſing on a very different ſubject, ſuddenly roſe and turned away, while the cottagers variouſly gave their opinions on the wonderful appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, while timidity inſtilled innumerable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures as the elevation of the cliff prevented diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct obſervation, and before they had time to diſcover what it could be, the figure vaniſhed.</p>
               <p>Lady Mentoria was writing in her ſtudy when Roſalie returned, and not wiſhing to diſturb her, ſhe thought the moonlight ſo inviting that ſhe bent her ſteps to a large balcony, on the flat part of the Abbey roof, between the battlement; it was formerly erected to command the proſpect, but had been ſeldom viſited for many years paſt; the door that led to it at the end of the gallery having been accidently diſcovered by Roſalie, ſhe had choſen this opportunity of exploring the boundary, and therefore ſtrolled out to gratify her curioſity.</p>
               <p>Here ſhe amuſed herſelf half an hour, and then deſcended to the parlour, where Lady Mentoria willing to amuſe her, rung the bell, and ordered her attendant to fetch down a port-folio of maps, and an old terreſtrial globe from a lumber-room in the Eaſt wing of the Abbey.</p>
               <p>Martha took the keys but turned pale as death. "Thomas, or Auſtin, can help me to bring it

down, my lady, I ſuppoſe?" aſked ſhe, while the keys jingled from the tremulous motion of her hand.</p>
               <p>"And why not go alone?" ſaid her Ladyſhip, "you know the room."</p>
               <p>"Yes, my Lady, but then I muſt paſs the door that leads to the balcony."</p>
               <p>"Well, what of that?" replied Lady Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toria.</p>
               <p>"Oh, the ghoſt!—Indeed, indeed, Madam, Auſtin and I was walking in the court yard this very evening, and we ſaw, by the light of the moon ſomething as white as ſnow whiſking be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the battlements, without a head; I am ſure I was not deceived, for though our folks have often ſaid that wing of the Abbey was haunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I never believed ſuch nonſenſe 'till now my eyes have convinced me; and Auſtin watched it, and put on his ſpectacles; but he could not make it out."</p>
               <p>"My good Martha," ſaid Roſalie, laughing heartily at her deſcription, "Do not alarm yourſelf, for I was the formidable ghoſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a head, upon my honour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but I am ſorry my innocent walk ſhould have created ſuch unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>A few days after a ſevere touch of the gout at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked the venerable Dowager, who conſtantly at thoſe periods repaired to the Caſtle, for the particular attendance of a favourite phyſician, in conſequence of which they immediately ſat out, travelling by ſhort ſtages 'till they reached the Caſtle on the third evening.</p>
               <p>Miſs Villars was that day or a viſit to the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, when the invalid arrived<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Lord Edwin flying to the carriage, aſſiſted the Dowager to alight, while his countenance could ſcarce aſſume the ſemblance of ſorrow due to the ſufferings of his aunt, as Roſalie followed Lady Mentoria into the parlour, ſupported between her nephew and Montague. Lord Edwin chair ſtood vacant by the ſide of Miſs Villars, but was inſtantly remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to the oppoſite one between the Dowager and Roſalie.</p>
               <p>Miſs Viliars's eyes were fixed on the tranſient exchange, while Roſalie had as intently obſerved the ſituation of the vacated chair. "Upon my word you are an excellent nurſe, and indeed ſhine
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:029134_0177_0FDFAE9386671960"/>
ſuperior in that character to any other," ſaid the imperious Amazon.</p>
               <p>"I always was," replied Lord Edwin, "Lady Mentoria will vouch for me, I have frequently devoted my evenings to backgammon, for her amuſement, while my ſiſters have joined ſome ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venile party in the neighbourhood."</p>
               <p>"A fine compliment to the belles and beaus," rejoined Miſs Villars.</p>

               <p>"I hope I ſhall never have the gout," anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the haughty fair, "or at leaſt if I have, I hope my ill temper will never add to the trouble I ſhall then be to every body."</p>
               <p>"It muſt undergo a thorough and ſpeedy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form," replied the offended invalid, "for the impetuoſity of youth will never be ſoftened by the infirmities of age; it will tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>"Ah, do," cried Lady Mentoria, "and take Roſalie with you, it will revive her after the confinement of a cloſe carriage." Lady Adela joined the requeſt, and Lord Edwin eſcorted them.</p>
               <p>Lady Mentoria now aſked the Marquis if he had any objection to Roſalie's remaining at the Caſtle, or if he choſe ſhe ſhould return.</p>
               <p>"No," replied he, "let her ſtay, I think I have probed the heart of Edwin, and found no wound to penetrate, I am therefore eaſy on that ſubject."</p>
               <p>The evening paſſed merrily away, and Roſalie retired to a new apartment facing the portico of oranges, the evening was fair and clear, myriads of diamonds ſtudded the azured veil of night, and fragrant odours embalmed the breeze, when ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing lightly tapping at her window called her attention, and ſhe opened the ſaſh, when a ſmall note, faſtened to a ſtring, was thrown up and
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:029134_0179_0FDFAE97E4854610"/>
reached her hand; it was Lord Edwin, whoſe billet earneſtly entreated ſhe would allow him half an hour's chat in the pavilion, by ſeven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Roſalie nodded aſſent, but ſpoke not, ſhocked at his temerity, as Lady Mentoria's chamber join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her's, and he might have been diſcovered, ſhe therefore cloſed the blind and prudently with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew.</p>

               <p>THE Dowager recovered from her ſlight at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack, and was perſuaded to paſs a month at the Caſtle, during which time Roſalie improved ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidly in her drawing and muſic, and her ſoft me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodious voice was to give its firſt ſpecimen of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light at a private concert, performed at the Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle; numerous friends and neighbours were invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and among the reſt the Honourable Frederic Waldegrave paid his firſt viſit ſince Roſalie's ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival:

Struck with the charms of her perſon, he loſt his uſual ſprightlineſs in the pleaſing contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, and was her conſtant ſhadow the whole evening, while Lord Edwin, who ſilently obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his motions, was deeply concerned and much agitated.</p>
               <p>Lady Louiſa preſided at the grand piano forte, Lady Adela exquiſitely touched her harp, Lord Carlton performed on the violoncello, and Lord Edwin took his animating mellifluous flute, while Sir Henry flouriſhed the ſprightly horn, and two ſtrangers ſubjoined their enlivening violins, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalie choſe the fantaſtic tamborine, and two ſongs, with an inimitable charming compoſition, adapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for her favourite lute, conſtituted her ſhare of the performance; ſhe was purpoſely habited in the Savoyard ſtile, and captivated every beholder; her beautiful ſolo on the lute received unbounded applauſe, and when ſhe dropped it negligently by her ſide, Waldegrave inſtantly caught and appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to his lip.</p>
               <p>"Do you play, ſir?" ſaid the ſweet girl.</p>

               <p>"Roſalie," ſaid he, lay by your magic lute, your next enchantment will be a ſong."</p>
               <p>"What is it?" aſked Waldegrave, touching the leaves of a roſe placed on her boſom, "The Manſion of Peace?"</p>
               <p>"No," anſwered Lord Edwin, perfectly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding the queſtion, "that privilege is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for a choſen few; the ſong ſhe favours us with is to aid the inſpiration of Adela's harp, and will convince you 'tis not ill adapted to the ſoul of the enchantreſs."</p>

The aſſembly obſerved a profound ſilence, and the beautiful Roſalie and elegant Adela drew for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and began Mrs. Crouch's favorite ſong in the Heireſs; 'tis true, the warbler had often practiſed it, but to night ſhe excelled every for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer attempt: The benignity of her countenance, and the forcible expreſſion laid on every line, captivated each attentive auditor, and a general
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:029134_0182_0FDFAEA1FB44CA60"/>
whiſper of praiſe buzzed in every part of the room.</p>
               <p>Waldegrave rouſed from his enchanting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verie with a profound ſigh, and again repeated his encomiums; the Marquis paſſing at the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment preſſed her hand, "you are a good girl, and have pleaſed every body."</p>
               <p>"She has enchanted them!" replied Walde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave, "every body as if inſpired by magic, repeats but the name of this bewitching ſyren."</p>
               <p>The Marquis aſtoniſhed at this rhapſody, led him away, and the evening paſſed cheerfully on, but the ſucceding day brought Waldegrave to the Caſtle, on ſome frivolous pretence, while Lord Edwin was airing, and Roſalie was unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately alone in the pavilion, finiſhing a ſmall drawing, while the ladies had retired to dreſs. Waldegrave delighted beyond expectation, ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the happy moment to explain his raptures, offered her his hand and fortune, and aſſured her of his unalterable attachment.</p>
               <p>"Silence, Mr. Waldegrave," ſaid ſhe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing her half-devoured hand, "you honour me too far, reflect for a moment to whom you are imparting your ſentiments, bordering ſurely on unguarded extravagance, I muſt not, dare
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:029134_0183_0FDFAEA3A8D49748"/>

               <p>"Perfectly ſo, charming Roſalie, nor time nor abſence ſhall eraſe the faithful fond impreſſion, tell me then lovely angel, if Waldegrave's hopes may live in thy bewitching ſmile; or doomed to meet thy frown, muſt he reſign that treaſured heart to ſome more happy rival?"</p>
               <p>"Alas!" ſaid Roſalie, "I boaſt no heart to give, 'twas loſt in the peaceful vale of Chamouny, 'ere I knew theſe plains."</p>
               <p>Waldegrave turned pale, his lips trembled, his hand grew cold as he graſped hers:—"Ah! tell me then," ſaid he, "whoſe boſom guards the ineſtimable treaſure, and I will fly to hear the tale, where if I find him, as perhaps I may, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burthened with the gifts of fortune, my ample purſe ſhall well ſupply the ſame deficiency, 'till it has rendered his more humble roof completely worthy of ſo fair an inmate; then may I live to hear my Roſalie is bleſt, and Waldegrave, wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Waldegrave, aſks no farther recompenſe."</p>
               <p>He now turned from her to hide the manly tear that flowed in ſpite of every effort to retain
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:029134_0184_0FDFAEA613C97DA0"/>
it; and Roſalie, ſtung to the ſoul, remained a perfect ſtatue of aſtoniſhment."</p>
               <p>"Permit me to retire," ſaid ſhe, in a low and tremulous voice, "unable from the overflow of gratitude to thank you as I ought, and incapable of expreſſing what my lips would fain utter; yet, may every bleſſing, every tranquil joy ſurround you, and may the heart your fondeſt love ſhall chuſe, return with equal rapture and ſincerity thy matchleſs generoſity and affection, while the poor humble Roſalie ſhall waft her pureſt prayer to heaven for your felicity—wretched boon I grant, but 'tis the ſacred incenſe of a heart that would give more if love and honour did not hold it cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive."</p>
               <p>"Generous girl!" anſwered the ſtill more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raptured Waldegrave, "And muſt I reſign thee? Oh! cruel fate: Yet tell me, I beſeech you, the name of my rival, and I will cheriſh the envied robber with the affection of a brother, while he returns the fond careſſes of my Roſalie, but if a ſhade of ſlight, however tranſient, croſs the ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine of thy happineſs, then Waldegrave's arm ſhall plunge a dagger in the monſter's heart, and free the angelic ſufferer from his frown."</p>
               <p>Roſalie ſhuddered with horror, for his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance during this energetic ſpeech had aſſumed every fury of real ſenſation. "We muſt meet
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:029134_0185_0FDFAEAD45C9CFC0"/>
no more then," ſaid ſhe, "you grow furious, aſk no further queſtions, I beſeech you, but leave me to my fate."</p>
               <p>"Never, 'till you tell my rival's name and reſidence, that I may accompliſh my promiſe," rejoined Waldegrave.</p>
               <p>"That I cannot reveal at preſent, I have co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent reaſons, but when time ſhall develope my fate, the heart that claims the humble Roſalie's, ſhall generouſly own, and ſtrive to imitate the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent virtues and gratitude of a Waldegrave; Adieu then, I muſt fly to my chamber, or my length of abſence will create ſuſpicion."</p>
               <p>"Adieu too lovely Roſalie, a few days will convey me to the aſylum of a faithful friend, whoſe tender admonition will conſole my wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed peace." Once more he kiſſed her hand, and darting through the ſhrubbery with the air of a maniac, mounted his horſe, which he had faſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a tree at the entrance of the park, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired unſeen by any ſoul.</p>
               <p>Roſalie was transfixed to the gate over which ſhe had leaned, her eyes filled with tears, her hands claſped and raiſed to heaven in ſilent ejacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, when the ſound of Sir Henry Lanſdowne's phaeton rouſed her lethargic ſtupor, and turning
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:029134_0186_0FDFAEAF2D0B3060"/>
quickly back into the houſe ſhe entered her own apartment, where the moſt painful reflections agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated her palpitating heart. "I muſt aſſume du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity at the expence of diſcretion," ſighed ſhe, "for ſhould the tale ever be revealed, what mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery might it not entail on ſuch a dreadful diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very to Lord Edwin! O, heaven avert it; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready he obſerves the partial praiſes of Walde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave with the keen eye of ſuſpicion, and ſtrictly repels them: Fatal ſecret! repoſe then in my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, where I will cautiouſly guard thee, and all will yet be well."—</p>
               <p>"All did I ſay? Alas! no—poor Waldegrave, where wilt thou find the balm to heal a wounded heart? Not on the frozen mountain—not on the burning ſands of India—nor in the foſtering clime of peaceful happy England; for, Oh! no balſam can extract the venom, bloom in what ſoil it may!"</p>
               <p>Her eyes had loſt their uſual luſtre, when ſhe deſcended to dinner, and Lord Edwin obſerved it, but Roſalie aſſuring him he was miſtaken, and aſſuming a gaiety of heart foreign to her feelings, it all paſſed off.</p>

               <p>"So Waldegrave has left his manſion ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, on a trip to his friend Ellers, at Lime Park, and the beautiful eminence that overlooks Roſe Vale is put in immediate deſign, ſeveral work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are employed, and as I paſſed, ſeeing them very buſy, I aſked for what the ſtructure was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. 'Why 'tis for a hermitage, Ma'am,' ſays a grey-headed ſhrivelled old man, 'his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour intends it to be very curious and complete, he has given us orders to proceed in the outer work, and then he will lay out his plan as his fancy ſtrikes him."</p>

               <p>"O dear yes, my Lady," continued he, "and it will be a vaſt <hi>ſolontory</hi> place; I told his honour the birds would make pretty free, for there's a power of all ſorts thereabouts; O, ſays he, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver trouble yourſelf about them, their company will amuſe me, and their ſong will amply repay their intruſion."</p>
               <p>"Why yes," ſays I, "your honour was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways good natured to every body, but you will have a few ſongs from the rooks as well as the larks, and that mighty diſmal."</p>
               <p>"That too I ſhall equally enjoy," replied he, "ſo don't diſturb them if they hover about."</p>
               <p>"It is a mighty odd notion we think, but to be ſure we have only to obey orders."</p>
               <p>"Thus ended the elegant harangue, and I rode off; don't you think it a fine romantic ſcheme; what a blooming hermit he will be, Lord Edwin, ſuppoſe we make a formal viſit."</p>

               <p>Roſalie gave the letter and ſonnet into the hand of Lady Adela, and Lord Edwin, as he peruſed them, ſmiled with tearful eyes at this proof of affection, while he traced in imagination every anxious eye peeping into the contents, willing to add a thouſand tender expreſſions had the paper been capable of containing them.</p>

Lady Louiſa, in conſequence of her ſwain's abſence, became dull, and her charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſiſter could only alleviate their ennui, by chatting and rambling with Lord Carlton, the only remaining beau, whoſe engaging ſenſibility had ſo far gained the Marquis's favour, that he had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, acceded to his wiſh, by permitting the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing paſſion to cement between him and Lady Adela, and the next ſpring was to confirm the happy union, as alſo the nuptials of Sir Henry and Lady Louiſa, an event anticipated by the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis with the greateſt delight, and his felicity had attained its ſummit, if Edwin too had accepted the hand of Lady Cecelia, but that was not to be, and a very different circumſtance was reſerved to prove the affection of the Marquis.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="203" facs="unknown:029134_0201_0FDFAED257AF7A00"/>Several little parties had been formed to inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and amuſe the lingering hours, when Frederic Waldegrave arrived at the Caſtle, and invited the family to partake of a farewell dinner at the Manor, which was readily accepted by the Marquis, who earneſtly enquired his motives for leaving England.</p>
               <p>"I wiſh," ſaid he, "Edwin would accompany you, but he is ſo bigotted to his Pariſian friend, that becauſe he declines going this year, no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion can induce him to make the trip."</p>
               <p>"And probably I ſhall not ſtay long in the Weſt," replied Waldegrave, "therefore I ſhould only lead him aſtray, for I ſhall be a wanderer at large, where fancy or inclination directs."</p>
               <p>Such a negligent reply ſilenced the Marquis's inquiry, and Thurſday was the appointed day for the viſit to the Manor, Roſalie dreſſed herſelf as plain as poſſible, though ſhe was convinced Miſs Villars and every belle in the vicinity would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to out-rival each other.</p>
               <p>At four the company aſſembled, and were enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with an elegant dinner, feſtivity and hilar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity prevailed without alloy, and the evening being very inviting, the Marquis propoſed ſailing on a fine canal, that ran through the extenſive plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure grounds; the ſailing-boat was ordered out, and the party took their ſeats.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="204" facs="unknown:029134_0202_0FDFAED411A6F778"/>After an hour ſpent in the moſt agreeable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, a threatening cloud preſaged a violent ſtorm, which ſoon veiled the atmoſphere. Roſalie terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, ſunk on the ſhoulder of Waldegrave, and the company landed as faſt as poſſible, and made the beſt of their way to the houſe, but as Walde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave ſupported the trembling Roſalie, a vivid flaſh croſſed the path, and again ſhe ſunk on his arm: Each gentleman fully employed with their reſpective charges, haſtened on, all equally fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened, and ſaw not the relapſe of Roſalie, who hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to bring up the rear, and Waldegrave, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collecting the hermitage to be but a few paces diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, bore her thither, and as it was probable the ſtorm would encreaſe, had endeavoured to prevail on the reſt to take ſhelter in its receſs—but in vain, as they thought beſt to retreat before the ſhower fell to prevent their flight, as they were at leaſt a quarter of a mile diſtant from the houſe.</p>
               <p>Waldegrave now carried his lovely burthen to the ſolitary ſtructure, ſo lately completed, laid her on a couch, and flew to get ſome water, when ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting her head to raiſe it on his arm, a ſmall pearl croſs, confined by a ribbon, diſcovered itſelf on her boſom; inſtantly Waldegrave ſlipped the ſtring, and, purloining the treaſure, ſecreted it in his own boſom, as the only memorial of her he ſhould be able to obtain, inſtinctively he preſſed
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:029134_0203_0FDFAED66E2FB330"/>
it to his lips, and then conſigned it to its future repoſitory.</p>
               <p>Scarce had he recovered the agitation of his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion when Roſalie opened her eyes, and wildly enquiring where ſhe was, expreſſed the greateſt terror at her ſituation.—The hermitage grew dark, the ſtorm increaſed, and Waldegrave ſooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her fears by every tender aſſiduity; But equally alarmed at being alone, and ſubject to his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes, ſhe earneſtly entreated to brave the ſtorm and venture on.</p>
               <p>"Impoſſible!" cried he, it pours in torrents, patience, lovely Roſalie, you are perfectly ſafe; we ſhall ſoon be miſſed, and the ſervants will be ſent to accommodate you with ſhelter of ſome kind, I cannot leave you alone or I would fly thither; be compoſed, I think I ſee ſomebody coming through the viſta, but the flaſhes are ſo vivid I cannot diſcern who it is."</p>
               <p>A few moments brought Thomas and Gregory, With the family ſedan, and a coat and umbrella for their maſter; for the company terrified at their abſence, were fearful ſome accident had happened, and the fury of the tempeſt prevented any but the ſervants from coming to their aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>Waldegrave inſtantly placed her in the chair, and walked ſlowly by her ſide to pacify her fears; at
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:029134_0204_0FDFAEDDFB952C80"/>
length they reached the houſe, and entered the drawing-room, where the party were aſſembled; every one but Miſs Villars expreſſed their concern at Roſalie's indiſpoſition.</p>
               <p>"Was not the hermitage a mighty ſnug re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat," cried ſhe, "I wonder Miſs Roſalie ſhould faint there; methinks in the protecting arms of Mr. Waldergrave there was little occaſion to <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi> terror, for my part I began to think you both inclined to paſs the night there, 'twas deviliſh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky Gregory ſhould think of the old mouldy ſedan, to interrupt ſo charming a tete-a-tete,</p>
               <p>"I conceive it a very lucky thought of Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry," anſwered Roſalie, and feel myſelf much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to his civility and good nature."</p>
               <p>"Had he been as maliciouſly diſpoſed as the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious part of mankind," replied the Marquis, (leering at Miſs Villars,) "he would not ſo readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have invented a burthen for his own ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; but I am ſorry to ſee malice ſo expert in ſharping her arrows on a female lip, yet, I truſt, the feathers they are fledged with are ſo light and frivolous, that though a breath ſends forth a vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>y in every direction, they ſeldom wound; for, depend on it, the ſhield of innocence repels the miſapplied dart, and the diſappointed archer feels the point retaliated with the venom of vexation to her own miſchievous boſom."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="207" facs="unknown:029134_0205_0FDFAEDFE91DE4E8"/>Waldegrave's eyes thanked the Marquis moſt eloquently, while Miſs Villars, ſmiling deriſion, yet completely and juſtly ridiculed, replied, he was an excellent monitor, but would probably meet with very few ſcholars from the ſeverity of his precepts.</p>
               <p>"And yet, I dare avow," rejoined the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis, "I ſhall very ſeldom have occaſion to uſe my correction a ſecond time if my pupils are as ſuſceptible of the ſting as I wiſh them to be, though I ſhall never inflict it improperly or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſerved."</p>
               <p>Some of the ladies whiſpered, and ſome of the bea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s ſmiled, for the ſubject had been moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely handled at the ſole expence of Miſs Villars, who, unable longer to ſupport his ſeverity, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly took her leave, mortified to the ſoul, and determined never to paſs another moment in his preſence.</p>
               <p>The ſtorm now abated, and the carriages drew up to convey the company home, when Roſalie faſtening her cloak, miſſed her pearl croſs, the gift of Lady Adela: confuſed and vexed, an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate ſearch ſucceeded, but in vain, and Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>degrave aſſuring her every part of the grounds ſhould be ſearched where it was probable ſhe could

have dropped it, handed her into the carriage, and took a final leave.</p>
               <p>On the ſecond day he departed for London, where he met Lord Edwin, and Sir Henry, from whom he received every friendly wiſh of a proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous voyage, and a few letters of recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſome friends of Sir Henry, in the Weſt-India ſettlements, and early in the following week they acompanied him on board, while Lord Edwin, as he quitted the ſhip's ſide, (from whoſe gallery Waldegrave waved his hat) found his heart relieved of a heavy ſuſpicion that had long rankled there, grounded on the dread of rival<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>

               <p>ROSALIE unſuſpicious of the innocent rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery committed by the hapleſs wanderer, often regretted her loſs, although the generous Lady Adela had ſupplied its place, with an elegant fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy

medallion; little did ſhe think that croſs was daily bedewed with the tears of faithful love; little did ſhe know how oft' it preſſed the feveriſh lip of hopeleſs paſſion, as it reſted on the panting agitated boſom of deſpair.</p>
               <p>Lord Edwin and his companion returned on the appointed day to the Caſtle, his countenance was cheerful as the fineſt ſummer' morn, his ſoul ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene and happy as its ſofteſt balmy breeze. Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalie was delighted at his return, yet a ſoft ſigh ſometimes heaved to the ſorrows of Waldegrave.</p>
               <p>The winter wore away its languid hours in the pleaſure of agreeable ſociety, ſometimes ſhared at the Caſtle, or paſſed at the Abbey, and when the joyous ſpring peeped forth and ſmiled, Lady Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toria conducted her young companion again to the Caſtle, for the ſummer receſs. In its beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful bloſſomed groves Roſalie and Lord Edwin of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſtrolled in pleaſing converſe of an evening, when the fragrance of the bloſſom embalmed the breeze, and Philomel, wild poet of the glade, thrilled her ſoft cadence half concealed, amid the mazes of her foliaged neſt, while the majeſtic creſcent encircled by her floating ſilver fluid, mantled the vagrant rill, and tinged the drooping elegance of numerous willows, ſheltering the roſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringed banks, and reflecting its ſylvan beam on
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:029134_0208_0FDFAEEAF2A6BC60"/>
the enraptured countenance of Lord Edwin, as he gazed, the luſtre of Roſalie's bewitching eyes vy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their contraſt with its feebler ray.</p>
               <p>"My Lord, the Marquis approaches," whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered Montague, from a thicket of Seringos one evening, "turn through the ſhrubbery while I detain him." Inſtantly they followed the admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of their kind protector, and eſcaped ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately to the houſe.</p>
               <p>The ſummer now drew on her roſy veil and ſhaded the retiring ſpring, who left her bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoms to the foſtering hand of her maturer care, and Roſalie, Lady Adela, and Lady Mentoria had juſt returned from a viſit at the Abbey, and all the little circle were again cheerful and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py; the caution of Lord Edwin, had eradicated every ſuſpicion from the boſom of the Marquis, who, although not perfectly reconciled to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of Lady Cecilia, loved his ſon too well to render him miſerable by enforcing his commands, when a circumſtance deſtined to unveil the long-ſecreted myſtery, preſented itſelf when leaſt ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed.</p>
               <p>The ſultry ſun of July had emitted an almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable heat through the day, and with the ſhades of evening followed a ſucceſſion of black clouds, impregnated with bituminous matter, deep
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:029134_0209_0FDFAEECADB439D0"/>
ſtreaks of red fringed their lowering inflamed edges, and foretold an approaching tempeſt.</p>
               <p>The ladies alarmed at the exceſſive loud peals of thunder that ſoon followed, and the vivid flaſhes of blue lightning, had retired to the inner apartment, leſs expoſed to its direction, when a loud ringing at the lodge gate demanded attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and Montague announced the ſervant of a ſtranger earneſtly ſoliciting aſſiſtance for his maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whoſe horſe taking fright at the lightning, had thrown him with the greateſt violence againſt a projecting rugged branch of an ancient oak that overhung the park railing, where he had been obliged to leave him in ſearch of aſſiſtance, as he was unable to proceed; and to add to his misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, the horſe had fled, but ſeeing a light in the lodge it encouraged him to hope for ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief.</p>
               <p>This ſudden alarm created the compaſſion of the whole family, and three of the ſervants were inſtantly diſpatched with orders to bring the ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to the Caſtle, and when their voi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

in the ſide of the head. Lady Mentoria drew near to offer her advice and inſpect the wound, while the three beautiful girls, like benignant an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, ſtood weeping o'er the hapleſs ſufferer, with upraiſed hands and countenances expreſſive of the deepeſt horror.</p>
               <p>A ſurgeon was immediately fetched, though at the diſtance of five miles, and at Lady Mentoria's requeſt the ſtranger was laid under the rich canopy of crimſon velvet, in the ſtate bed-chamber, where life again revived with languid pulſation, but not the faculty of reaſon; that alas! ſeemed chained by heavy ſtupor, and he remained many hours in a ſtate of torpid inſenſibility.</p>
               <p>On the ſurgeon's arrival he pronounced the contuſion dangerous, but not ſo near the brain as was apprehended, nor could he aſcertain the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences which might enſure however, he hoped the beſt, ordered him to be kept in a ſtate of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect tranquillity, but declared that removing him would be of dangerous tendency. Mrs. Gertrude was deputed to ſit by him, while his ſervant un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>packed his portmanteau, and the Marquis could gain a little information of the rank and charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his invalid, but of this the domeſtic de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared himſelf ignorant, he only knew his maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's name was Spencer, and that he was juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from the Weſt-Indies, had hired him about

three weeks ſince in London, during which time he had reſided at an hotel, but was now on their tour to N—, at the houſe of ſome very inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate friend of his maſter, from whence they were going to ſome part of Italy and France.</p>
               <p>This account, though plauſible, was by no means ſatisfactory, and as the ſervant proceeded to unpack, the delicacy and fineneſs of the linen, marked with the initials of E. W. created a ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion of fallacy in the Marquis's breaſt, which he carefully concealed, and Gertrude reſigned her ſituation to his own ſervant, and one of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis's for the night, which was paſſed in tolerably tranquil ſlumber.</p>
               <p>The Marquis, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>"Sure 'tis illuſion, or my eyes beheld the fair reſemblance of my faithleſs love:—Angelic form! ſweet placid innocence, if ſuch thou wert, caſt one ſoft ſmile of pity on the wretched Walſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham!—Adored Lavinia!

               <p>The Marquis ſhuddered with horror, the name of Ethelbert Walſingham had been engraven on his heart, with a pencil of Adamant, dipped in poiſon. He advanced one ſtep and peeping through an aperture in the curtain, beheld the feeble in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valid raiſed from pillow, his hands claſped in the attitude of imploring pardon, and his eyes fixed on a half-length portrait of Lady Lavinia, which hanging immediately oppoſite the foot of the bed, convinced him of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality of his ſuggeſtion, and, overpowered with confuſion, ſurpriſe, and diſtreſs, the Marquis ſunk on a chair, and, drawing aſide the curtain, fixed his eager eyes on the ſtranger, whom he was unable to addreſs at the moment.</p>
               <p>"To whom Sir," aſked the feeble man, "am I indebted for the compaſſion and indulgence I have apparently received, tho' alas! the ſuſpenſion of recollection deprives me of the idea of what fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor my hapleſs ſtate has experienced; I have do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed the night away, and juſt rouſing from an ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritated unconnected dream, I recall my ſcattered ſenſes, and find myſelf alone in the manſion of a

               <p>"You are now in the Caſtle of the Marquis of Sevigne," replied the agitated Marquis."</p>
               <p>"Sevigne!" reiterated the breathleſs ſtranger, "And that portrait Lady Lavinia his ſiſter? Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious heaven! do I in you behold the noble owner of this Caſtle too?"</p>
               <p>The Marquis bowed aſſent, and the ſtranger continued:</p>
               <p>"Alas! then let this devoted head ſink in eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſlumber on your ſoothing pillow: fly me, for I have been a murderer, but, culprit as I ſeem, I yet ſhall ſue your mercy. I could unfold a tale that would harrow up your ſoul, if you will grant me but an hour's explanation, then wouldſt thou ſpurn me like a miſcreant from thy roof, I will not call thee harſh, I will not murmur."</p>
               <p>A convulſive motion prevented his articulation, as he violently graſped the hand of the Marquis, but recovering he begged the door might be faſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened

to prevent interruption, and then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded.</p>
               <p>"Firſt draw the curtain," ſaid he, "and veil that angelic face, my brain is frantic, and every ſenſe diſordered while I gaze on it."</p>
               <p>The Marquis, ſoftened by his agony obeyed, and begged him to proceed with compoſure.</p>

               <p>"Fail not to return to Paris to-morrow evening, at the hour of nine, conceal yourſelf in the ſhrub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery near the temple, and witneſs the virtuous deſignation of the Chevalier Morency, and the art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

abandoned Lavinia:—Victim of duplicity, 'tis thine to puniſh."</p>
               <p>"My blood froze with horror, my brain was on fire—could it be poſſible?—Ah! no, Yet love, honour, juſtice demanded me to attend the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and I obeyed, previouſly concealing a poig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard to avenge my unmerited injury, ſhould I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the cruel fact."</p>
               <p>"Punctual at the moment I arrived, diſguiſed and concealed, I awaited the dreaded appearance, when through the branches of the trees I ſoon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the white robe of Lavinia, advancing by her ſide in all the rhapſody of love, walked the the ſpecious villain, one of whoſe arms encircled her waiſt, while the other graſped her hand to his lips: Lavinia 'tis true, repelled the freedom, but as they paſſed I diſtinctly heard her utter theſe words. "Leave me, Chevalier, 'tis imprudent we ſhould longer abſent ourſelves from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, fly me, I conjure you, e'er your preſence is too fatal to us both; ſhould Walſingham return and find you here, what miſery might we not be involved in; you know my reſolution, which neither time nor circumſtance ſhall make me break, and as you value the peace of Lavinia be diſcreet.</p>
               <p>"But to-morrow," cried he, "will you ſuffer me to enjoy half an hour's chat in the morning?"</p>

               <p>"Morency again preſſed her to his boſom, and retired, while ſhe ſtrolled back heaving the deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſighs, alas! too ſurely for Morency, for to a mind inflamed as mine, every ſpark brightened to a blaze, and had I not heard ſufficient to warrant my ſuſpicion, and convince me of her baſeneſs?"</p>
               <p>"Inſtantly I darted from my concealment, and hurrying to my horſe rode on full ſpeed to the confines of a thicket I knew he muſt paſs, and as he entered alone, I ſeized his bridle, diſcovered myſelf, and demanded reſtitution for my wrongs, but the ſneering villain mocking my agony, aſked me for whom Lavinia's heart moſt glowed with love? For whom ſhe ſhed the penſive tear, or heaved that parting ſigh, but for himſelf?"</p>
               <p>"If 'twere indeed for thee, villain!" anſwered I, "thou never more ſhall boaſt; this to thy heart, an injured huſband plunges but one poig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard, while in his breaſt thou haſt implanted thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands never to be extracted."</p>

Lord Edwin was all agitation: Roſalie, diſſolved in tears, and would have flown to her parent's apartment while the lovely ſiſters ſweetly ſoothed her woe, and breathed the ſigh of pity to the ſad, ſad tale.</p>
               <p>Lady Mentoria, who doated on her unhappy niece, felt the unexpected ſtroke of miſery moſt poig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: "Lovely ſufferer," exclaimed ſhe, as ſhe peruſed the explanatory letters of Lavinia, which the Marquis had conſigned to her care, previous to delivering them to Walſingham, and though ſhe poſſeſſed the firmeſt principle of humanity and commiſeration for the diſtreſſed, a harſh invective at firſt eſcaped her lip, as ſhe condemned the fero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of Walſingham.</p>
               <p>On the following morning Roſalie followed the Marquis to the chamber of the invalid, whoſe

                  </gap> although the ſurgeon pronounced any irritation would encreaſe his fever, and protract the effect his aid tended to produce.</p>
               <p>He was juſt riſen when the lovely girl, ſcarce able to conceal her joy, entered his chamber, and flying to embrace him, ſunk on her knees; a copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous torrent of tears luckily relieved the full bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of Walſingham, as he tenderly raiſed and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced her.</p>
               <p>"Alas!" ſaid he, "is it thus I fold to my heart the angelic image of a dearer ſelf? Here let me trace the bluſhing beauties of my ſweet Lavinia, thou ſole bleſt gift of Heaven:—Oh! her expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive eye ſtill beams in thine, her dimpled ſmile yet lingers on thy roſy cheek, and thy ſoft dulcet voice recals her animating tone.

               <p>Roſalie claſped his hand, in ſilent agony, and preſſed it to her boſom, "I will be all obedience, all affection, deareſt Sir," ſaid ſhe, "and may you long live to trace in me the virtues of my ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured

mother," pointing to the portrait, from which the diſtreſſed Walſingham hid his eyes.</p>
               <p>"Talk not of injured innocence," cried he "for, alas! that conviction would unman a ſtoic, much more a wretch like me."</p>
               <p>The ſcene grew too affecting, and the Marquis begging Roſalie to retire, ſoon after left him.</p>
               <p>Three days elapſed, during which time Walſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham was confined to his bed, in conſequence of his irritation of mind having heightened the fever, and Roſalie attended him with the moſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate care: he had alſo ſolicited the letters the Marquis had promiſed him, the effect of which ſo agitated him, he was obliged frequently to lay them aſide, at the requeſt of the tender Roſalie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whoſe tears flowed with equal poignancy as his own, and almoſt overpowered her drooping ſpirits:</p>
               <p>One page in particular, read by Roſalie, whoſe voice could ſcarce articulate, almoſt drove him frantic; 'twas a full confeſſion from Lady La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinia, recounting the reaſon of her meeting the Chevalier that fatal evening which terminated his exiſtence and her happineſs.</p>

Lavinia, terrified for the ſafety of her huſband, conjured him to baniſh the idea of revenge, and on pain of her eternal diſpleaſure ever to reveal, or cauſe Walſingham to ſuſpect his partiality, thinking<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by this means to avoid the dreaded encounter of an innocent, yet offended huſband, and a furious and reſolute lover, whom in reality her ſoul abhorred; but her placid amiable diſpoſition, ever void of offence, ſtrove if poſſible by gentle entreaty to prevail on Morency, while her terror depicting every calamity from ſo fatal a determination, had, in order to conceal it under the ſolemn threat ſhe had made, met him on the terrace that evening, to extort the performance of his promiſe, and by that means inſure the ſafety of her ever valued love, and what diabolical fiend could have diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the aſſignation, known only to themſelves, was a myſtery her utmoſt vigilance could never develope.</p>
               <p>This proof of affection ſtung Walſingham to the ſoul. "Is this the dreadful truth?" cried he, "Fatal victim of credulity: Alas: how the fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zy of jealouſy veiled my ſenſes: Yes, I heard her repeat every ſyllable this letter avows, but deaf to reaſon or a moment's reflection, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrued

every ſentence in the moſt different light, and can only recompenſe her wrongs by promot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the happineſs of my child, which ſhall be the ſtudy of my exiſtence."</p>
               <p>Roſalie now laid aſide the papers, and Walſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham giving her the key of his portmanteau, beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged her to take out his pocket book for ſomething he wiſhed to find, and turning over ſeveral letters a ſmall piece of paper fell to the ground, which Roſalie picking up preſented to her father. "I do not recollect what it can be," ſaid he, "open it, my love<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>" Roſalie obeyed, but it inſtantly fell from her hand and ſhe turned pale. "Oh, 'tis the pearl croſs," ſaid Walſingham, "the ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Waldegrave's legacy: But obſerving the agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of his child, (who ſtood almoſt petrified, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing alternately on him and then on the bauble) he caught her hand, and inquired the cauſe of her aſtoniſhment. "Only do me the favour, dear Sir, to inform me how you came in poſſeſſion of this trinket, and I will then anſwer any queſtion you pleaſe to aſk."</p>
               <p>"I received it" ſaid he, "from the hands of a Mr. Waldegrave, a handſome comely youth who was unfortunately ſhipwrecked, but ſaved by the timely aſſiſtance of our boat, he had floated four hours when he hailed our veſſel, and we happily preſerved him, but a ſever enſuing in conſequence,

a few days terminated his exiſtence: I muſt own I was particularly ſtruck with his figure and affa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble deportment, and never left his bed 'till he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired; a few minutes before which he took from his boſom this croſs, preſſed it to his lip, and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me ever to keep it as the ſacred relic of a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful but unhappy lover.</p>
               <p>"My ſtory," ſaid he, "like myſelf, will be conſigned to oblivion, nor ſhall I reveal the name of the angel from whoſe boſom I purloined this treaſure, as it is very improbable you ſhould ever behold her, yet ſhould chance ſo ordain it, ſhe will inſtantly recogniſe it when you repeat the hapleſs poſſeſſor of it was Frederic Waldegrave."</p>
               <p>Roſalie burſt into tears. "Alas! cried ſhe, "'tis mine: And didſt thou, hapleſs Waldegrave, treaſure to the laſt moment of thy exiſtence, this humble memorial of poor Roſalie?"</p>
               <p>Walſingham ſoothed her, "More myſteries then have I elucidated," ſaid he, "but tell me, my lovely girl, the whole affair, in which your heart, alas! ſeems deeply intereſted."</p>
               <p>Roſalie obeyed, and repeated every minute cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, much to the ſatisfaction of Walſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, who was delighted with her prudence, while ſweetly bluſhing, ſhe faintly acknowledged the prevalent partiality of Lord Edwin.</p>

               <p>The Marquis now began to perceive with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret, the partiality of his ſon, and taking him one day into his ſtudy, reprimanded his terror, on Roſalie's being ſtung by a hornet, as it plainly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered an unuſual degree of alarm and attention in the agitation of his anxious countenance, when Lord Edwin, unable to conceal his ſentiments, confeſſed his interviews at Chamouny, and ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,

with the unfeigned tear of earneſt love, his bleſſing and conſent to an union of heart and ſentiment Heaven only could diſſolve.</p>
               <p>"Is it thus, Edwin, your duplicity has exult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?" aſked the Marquis ſternly, glancing a look of ferocity on his ſon; "And has the fallacious ſnake I foſtered in my boſom thus planned its grateful retaliation, by leaving its ſting in the receſs that protected it? Ah! Edwin, I much fear the whole blame of this unfortunate attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment reſts with you, for ſure the heart of Roſalie is too pure, too tender, to harbour a thought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious to my peace; ſpeak then, confeſs yourſelf culpable, if you have led the little ſtray lamb from its native vale, over each tempting flow'ry path, will you abandon it on a thorny precipice, from whoſe impending cliff it muſt periſh in the gaping abyſs, or gradually linger, like the ſtricken deer, forlorn and deſolate, ſtill bounding from ſteep, to ſteep in ſearch of comfort and protection, yet ſtill augmenting but its miſery: Part of the tale is now explored that long concealed her fate, but the clue is ſtill tangled, and requires to be unra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled, and 'till elucidation explores every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of diſguiſe, Edwin ſhall never be united to Roſalie, for though I revere her virtues, and love her with the affection of a parent, no ſtigma ſhall reſt on the offspring of Tankerville, no calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niate lip ſhall repeat corruptive cenſure, I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

rely on your diſcretion, 'till a farther expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and confeſs your temerity aſtoniſhes me; your indulging a paſſion for an object totally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, and ſo humbly bred, muſt, if you had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected a moment, have convinced you of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriety of your conduct: Suppoſing Roſalie had been the cottager in reality ſhe was repreſented, would your unbounded paſſion have gratified itſelf by ſubjoining the diſtaff with the creſted helmet of your illuſtrious anceſtry?"</p>
               <p>Lord Edwin pauſed, fearful of irritating the Marquis, who ſeemed to be impatiently waiting his reply, and therefore ſummoning courage, and couching his ſentiments in the moſt ſubmiſſive form, he thus replied.</p>
               <p>"If you require me to expreſs the real effuſions of the ſincerity I feel," anſwered he, "the virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſoul, graceful amiability, and unfeigned gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, I diſcovered in the lovely girl, had ſurely made me forget the properties of nobility, and in her cottage the ſplendour of high life had, in compariſon, excited my pity and diſguſt, for I could there trace ſuch intereſting ſcenes of nature in her boundleſs luxuriance, as would have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panded your heart with every ſublime inſpiration it did mine. Chamouny was then to me a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, and Roſalie the benignant angel to guide and explain the myſterious powers of creation, that

raiſed my adorative ejaculation to the bountiful divinity, whoſe prolific hand had thus raiſed the wonderful and admirative beauties of this Elyſian vale."</p>
               <p>"You are mighty romantic," ſaid the Marquis, "moralize no more, let prudence ſeal your lip, you know my ſentiments; for though Roſalie is a woman I think perfectly formed to create hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, yet, remember, conſanguinity is my aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; however, I neither give nor extort a promiſe, for your happineſs is too nearly allied to my heart to wiſh ever to ſubvert it, retire then, and leave me to my reflection, for my heart is at preſent too full to converſe any more on this ſubject."</p>
               <p>Edwin bowed and was opening the door, as Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalie gently tapped, unknowing the Marquis was in converſation, much leſs conceiving ſhe was the ſubject of the tete-a-tete.</p>
               <p>"I hope I don't intrude," ſaid the lovely girl, the expreſs picture of beautiful innocence, with a ſmall baſket of roſes, "Permit me to requeſt your acceptance of this charming roſe, for I know it is your favourite flower as well as mine: I have juſt gathered a few, and am come to place it in your boſom as ſoon as I have diveſted it of its thorns," and ſeating herſelf on a dutcheſs by the ſide o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <pb n="237" facs="unknown:029134_0235_0FDFAF3B6A43F628"/>The Marquis turned his eyes on Lord Edwin, who ſtood rapturouſly gazing on her in the atti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of admiration, with the door half cloſed, who catching his father's glance, ſilently pointed to Roſalie, preſſed his hand to his heart, and ſighed as he reluctantly drew the envious blank between them.</p>
               <p>Roſalie's hat ſhading her eyes as ſhe was buſily employed, had concealed the reciprocal glance that had been exchanged, and ſhe wondered at the Marquis's unuſually-cool reception. "Why ſo ſilent, dear Sir?" aſked ſhe, modeſtly placing the roſe in his boſom, and making a ſmiling courtſey.</p>
               <p>May you, Roſalie, be ever as careful of plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a thorn in my boſom as you have been to guard me from the wound of theſe; but retire, my love, I am engaged with my writing, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be interrupted; take charge of your preſent again, and preſerve it till we meet at dinner, when I ſhall be more at leiſure to admire it, and thank the attentive donor.</p>
               <p>Roſalie ſealed the pardon of her intruſion by kiſſing his hand, and wiſhing him good morning, left him to his private meditations.</p>
               <p>"What could the Marquis mean," thought ſhe, as ſhe ſtopped to admire the geraniums in the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery

               <p>Such were her reflections, when her father paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through the anti-chamber, diſturbed her.</p>
               <p>"Roſalie," ſaid he, "I have juſt received let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from London, in anſwer to thoſe I wrote three days ſince, and am ſorry to ſay, I have very unpleaſing accounts of a conſiderable debt, by the failure of a capital merchant, and muſt in conſequence ſet off to-morrow for the Metropolis, if the Marquis is in his ſtudy I muſt ſpeak with him, as the merchant is a friend of his, and he in conſequence, can adviſe me what meaſure is moſt expedient to adopt."</p>
               <p>Roſalie expreſſed her concern, and Walſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham paſſed on to the ſtudy, where delivering the letter he almoſt petrified the Marquis, who after deliberating in the moſt judicious manner, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to accompany him, and render every poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſervice to both parties; his chaiſe and four was ordered by ſeven the next morning, in which the travellers taking their ſeats drove off.</p>

               <p>LORD EDWIN had now opportunity to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe his father's converſation to Roſalie, and each ſecretly rejoiced at the favourable aſpect of their future hopes.</p>
               <p>The Caſtle vacated by its ſenior inmates, the juve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nility of the remaining group formed numerous ſprightly amuſements, unbiaſſed by the contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Lady Mentoria, who, although too far ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced in years to join the feſtive dance, ſtill loved to preſide and enjoy the delight they partook.</p>
               <p>When the travellers arrived at the Hotel they retired to reſt, and the next morning pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to the houſe of Mr. Stanley, where the dreadful complication of his affairs baffled all hopes of compoſitive adjuſtment, and at the ſuit of a mercileſs peremptory creditor, he was ſeized, ſent to a ſpunging-houſe and all bail refuſed; thither they immediately repaired, and found the forlorn object a prey to miſery, ſevere reflection's accute pang, and the victim of extortion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="240" facs="unknown:029134_0238_0FDFAF4530A75280"/>The Marquis making himſelf known, offered bail, and a perſon was diſpatched with a note to the creditor begging the favour of half an hour's converſation.</p>
               <p>During the interval of his abſence a hackney coach drew up to the door, and a number of voci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous tongues in the paſſage rouſed the Marquis's attention, and he opened the door where he diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered ſeveral men inhumanly dragging a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teel-looking female, who was ſtruggling to draw the hood of her cloak over a face that bore the veſtiges of ſorrow and oppreſſion.</p>
               <p>"Why, you need not be ſo fearful of ſhewing your face," cried one of the ſavages," "'twill be pretty well known in a few days at the priſon, where it is my thoughts you'll be glad to make your market of it for a meal's meat, or egad you'll ſoon be ſtarved."</p>
               <p>"Never inſult diſtreſs," ſaid the Marquis, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving his huge paw from her delicate arm. "Suffer me," continued he, "addreſſing the head officer, to enquire the fate of this poor helpleſs creature."</p>
               <p>"Why ſhe is placed here for half a year's lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, at the ſuit of her landlord, anſwered he, and it ſeems no one can give bail for her, but its no wonder, this is always the fruit of wicked deeds."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="241" facs="unknown:029134_0239_0FDFAF46DCE293B8"/>"Morality from a perſon of your deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on," rejoined the Marquis, "ill ſuits, and I ſhall only form my opinion from the circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces I collect from her, whatever inference you may have drawn from them I am inclined to be lenient, would you were alſo; however, let the coach wait half an hour, during which time I will be anſwerable your priſoner does not eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape diſhonourably."</p>
               <p>The officer bowed and conducted the female to a private apartment, the Marquis and Walſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham followed, and the door was cloſed, when the female not wiſhing longer to conceal her face, threw back her cloak, and to the fancy of Walſingham diſcovered a ſet of features not to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally unknown, though much impaired by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, nor could he at the moment recollect where they were once ſo familiar to him."</p>
               <p>"If an account of my unfortunate life can claim any pretenſion to your ſavour, gentlemen," ſaid ſhe, "I ſhall conceive it an obligation which I owe to your humane interference: Scarce need I ſay, I am enliſted on the page of deſtructive error, as a wretched victim of ſhame and ſorrow; I have ſeen thirty-ſix years, half of which, alas! could not on retroſpection af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford one inſtance of prudence, virtue, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Marquis then drawing a bank note from his pocket-book to that amount, preſented it to her." As the child of woe," ſaid he, "I beſtow my charity, but as the murdereſs of life, peace, and happineſs, I view you with an eye of abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; an injured brother cannot pardon a wretch like thee, but truſts he poſſeſſes the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite mercy of a Chriſtian, by ſnatching you from that infamous manſion of diabolical vice and deſtruction, whether thoſe harpies were dragging you, and if your contrition is real, and you would ſwear to lead a life of penitence, I will provide for you in ſome ſolitary receſs where your errors may be buried in oblivion."</p>
               <p>Miſs Bertie overpowered by ſuch unmerited generoſity, fell at his feet, and bathing them with her tears, promiſed the ſtricteſt obedience to his commands.

               <p>The Marquis, though repugnant to her cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, liſtened with a degree of ſatisfaction to her ſelf-crimination: "I ſhall remain a week longer in town," ſaid he, "therefore provide yourſelf a decent habitation 'till your friend's letter ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives, encloſe it under cover to me, and I ſhall then judge what proſpect of ſucceſs you have in view, when, if your friend is willing to receive you, I will empower my ſteward to conduct you ſafe on board the firſt veſſel that ſails, and all the recompenſe I aſk is to receive an annual letter, informing me you merit my commiſeration, by ſtrictly adhering to your ſolemn promiſe, of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming your late dreadful conduct."

               <p>"Walſingham's purſe can never be authoriſed to relieve you," continued the Marquis, "and mine only muſt be conſidered as beſtowing its mite on a ſtranger; for alas! though your crime be imprinted on the new fallen ſnow, and diſſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the firſt beam of compaſſion, ſhould me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory

               <p>Miſs Bertie now paid her grateful acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgements to the Marquis, but did not dare meet the eyes of Walſingham; her releaſe was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately procured, and ſhe drove off in the coach to an obſcure ſtreet in ſearch of an abode during her ſtay, promiſing to inform the Marquis of her ſituation, and every minute particular he had enjoined her to obſerve.</p>

               <p>By eleven the elegant group had aſſembled in the drawing-room, the bluſhing brides wore each a dreſs exactly ſimilar, a plain muſlin robe looſely faſtened over white ſarſenet, and long veils negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently thrown over their beautiful ringlets, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſullied by powder, quite in morning diſhabille by the Marquis's deſire, who arranged the proceſſion to the chapel in the following order: Lord Edwin and Roſalie led the way, Lord Carlton and Lady Adela followed, and Sir Henry and Lady Louiſa preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the three bride-maids, and their reſpective beaus, while the Marquis and Lady Mentoria, with the Count and Counteſs brought up the rear, and the attendants cloſed the proceſſion: The avenues of the park were lined with villagers, and the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel doors were thrown open to admit a view of the ceremony; on the altar was ſpread a cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of white ſattin, edged with ſilver fringe, while

three chalices of gold contained the moſt beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful exotics, and from the centre one blazed aro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic incenſe, and a wreath and branches of roſes intermixed with myrtle, richly waved in impend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing feſtoons round the table, and formed a moſt beautiful appearance, while it delighted the ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator, for Andrew alone had invented and arrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the charming decoration, to pleaſe and ſurpriſe the party; three ſtools, covered with the ſame fringed ſattin ſupported the adorative knee of each blooming bride; and returning to the Caſtle, Andrew had again evinced his ingenuity by ſtrew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the avenue with bloſſoms.</p>

               <p>Lady Mentoria, before the charming brides left their dreſſing-room exhibited her generoſity, by preſenting a caſe of jewels, from which ſhe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed elegant memorials of her affection; to Lady Adela ſhe aſſigned a ſuperb diamond creſcent for her turban; to Lady Louiſa a diamond plume; and to her charming Roſalie a brilliant bandeau of exquiſite beauty for her hair, while the genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of her father had alſo exemplified itſelf in the choice of an elegant pair of ear-rings and necklace, of beautiful pearls, with an enamelled watch ſet with the ſame, and Lord Edwin faſtened his own incomparable miniature, ſet with brilliants, round the boſom of his lovely bride, when ſhe deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in full blaze of beauty to the drawing-room.</p>
               <p>The bridegrooms were elegantly dreſſed in em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidered ſuits, but Lord Edwin's expreſſive and charming countenance added to his graceful form, rendered him the moſt captivating object of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, nor had honeſt Andrew erroneouſly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged the prize of beauty to Roſalie, who, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, far eclipſed the rival ſiſters, and was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commonly
