         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>And many ſigns and wonders were wrought among the people by the hands of the apoſtles:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> (and they were all with one accord in Solomon's portico: And none of the reſt durſt join themſelves to them;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> but the people magnified them,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> And the more were multitudes, both of men and women believing, added to the Lord:)
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> So that they brought out the ſick along the ſtreets, and laid <hi>them</hi> on beds and couches, that even the ſhadow of Peter coming by, might overſhadow ſome of them.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> And multitudes alſo of the cities round about, came together to Jeruſalem,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:046352_0023_10210A0C71037470"/>bringing perſons ſick and troubled by unclean ſpirits, and they were all healed.</p>
                     <p>But the high prieſt ariſing,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/> and all that were with him, which was the ſect of the Sadducees, were filled with zeal,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="18"/> And laid their hands on the apoſtles, and put them into the common priſon.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="19"/> But an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of the Lord opened the priſon-doors, by night, and leading them out,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> ſaid, Go, ſtand and ſpeak in the temple the words of this life.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21"/> And hearing this, they went into the temple early in the morning and taught. But the high prieſt being come, and they that were with him, called together the council, even the whole ſenate of the children of Iſrael, and ſent to the priſon,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22"/> to have them brought. But when the officers came, they found them not in the priſon; and returning they ſaid,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23"/> Truly we found the priſon ſhut with all ſafety, and the keepers ſtanding before the doors; but having opened <hi>them,</hi> we found no man within.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="24"/> When the captain of the temple, and the chief prieſts heard theſe things, they doubted of them,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> what this ſhould be? Then came one and told them, Behold, the men whom ye put in priſon, are ſtanding in the temple, and teaching the people. Then the captain going with the officers brought them,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="27"/> And having brought them, they ſet <hi>them</hi> before the council.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="28"/> And the high prieſt aſked them, Did not we ſtrictly command you, Not to teach in this name? And ſo, ye have filled Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem with your doctrine, and would bring the

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="29"/> Then Peter and the <hi>other</hi> apoſtles anſwering ſaid, We ought to obey God rather than men.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> The God of our fathers hath raiſed up Jeſus, whom ye ſlew, hanging <hi>him</hi> on a tree.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="31"/> Him hath God exalted, a Prince and a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, with his right-hand, to give repentance to Iſrael, and forgiveneſs of ſins.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="32"/> And we are witneſſes of theſe things, and alſo the Holy Ghoſt, whom God hath given to them that obey him.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="33"/> When they heard this, they were cut <hi>to the heart,</hi> and took counſel to ſlay them.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="34"/> But a certain Phariſee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, had in honour by all the people, riſing up in the council, ordered, to put the men out a little ſpace:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> And ſaid to them, Ye men of Iſrael, take heed to yourſelves, what ye are about to do, touching theſe men.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="36"/> For before theſe days roſe up Theudas, boaſting himſelf to be ſomebody, to whom was joined a number of men, about four hundred, who was ſlain, and all who hearkened to him,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:046352_0025_10210A144CD700A8"/>were ſcattered and came to nothing.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="37"/> After this man roſe up Judas of Galilee, in the days of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolment, and drew away much people after him; he alſo periſhed, and all who had hearkened unto him, were diſperſed.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="38"/> And now I ſay to you. Refrain from theſe men, and let them alone; for if this counſel or this work be of men,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="39"/> it will come to nought. But if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it, <hi>and take heed</hi> leſt ye be found even fighting againſt God.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> And to him they agreed. And having called the apoſtles, and ſcourged <hi>them,</hi> they charged <hi>them</hi> not to ſpeak in the name of Jeſus,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="41"/> and diſmiſſed them. And they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from the preſence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to ſuffer ſhame for his name.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="42"/> And they ceaſe not to teach and preach Jeſus Chriſt daily, in the temple, and from houſe to houſe.</p>

Men, brethren, and fathers, hearken</hi>—The Sum of his Diſcourſe is this; I acknowledge the Glory of GOD revealed to the Fathers, ver. 2; the Calling of <hi>Moſes;</hi> ver. 34, &amp;c. the Dignity of the Law, ver 8, 38, 44; the Holineſs of <hi>this place,</hi> ver. 7, 45, 47. And indeed the Law is more antient than the Temple; the Promiſe more antient than the Law. For GOD ſhewed himſelf the GOD of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac, Jacob,</hi> and their Children freely (ver. 2. &amp;c. 9. &amp;c. 17, &amp;c. 32, 34, 35.) and they ſhewed Faith and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to GOD. (ver. 4, 20. &amp;c. 23.) particularly by their Regard for the Law, (ver. 8.) and the promiſed Land, (ver. 16.) Meantime GOD, never confined his Preſence to this one Place or to the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the Law. For He hath been acceptably worſhipped, before the Law was given, or the Temple built, and out of this Land, (ver. 2. 19, 33, 44.) And that our Fathers and their Poſterity were not tied down to this Land, their various Sojournings (ver 4, &amp;c. 14, 29, 44.) and Exile (ver. 43.) ſhew. But you and your Fathers have always been evil; (ver. 9.) have withſtood <hi>Moſes,</hi> (ver. 25, &amp;c. 39, &amp;c.) have deſpiſed the Land, (ver. 39.) forſaken GOD, (ver. 40, &amp;c.) ſuperſtitiouſly honoured the Temple, (ver. 48.) reſiſted GOD and his Spirit, (ver. 50.) killed the Prophets and the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, (ver. 51.) and kept not the Law, for which ye contend ver. 53.) Therefore GOD is not bound to you; much leſs to you alone. And truly this ſolemn Teſtimony of <hi>Stephen</hi> is moſt worthy of his Character, as <hi>a man full of the Holy Ghoſt, and of faith and power:</hi> in which tho' he does not advance ſo many regular Propoſitions, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory to thoſe of his Adverſaries, yet he cloſely and nervouſly anſwers them all. Nor can we doubt but he would, from theſe Premiſſes, have drawn Inferences touching the Deſtruction of the Temple, the Abrogation of the <hi>Moſaic</hi> Law, the Punishment of that rebellious People: and above all, touching <hi>Jeſus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> the true <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> had not his Diſcourſe been interrupted by the Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of the Multitude, ſtopping their Ears, and ruſhing upon him. <hi>Men, brethren, and fathers</hi>—All who are here preſent whether ye are my Equals in Years, or of more advanced Age. The Word which in this and in many other Places is rendered <hi>Men</hi> is a mere Expletive. <hi>The God of Glory</hi>—The glorious GOD <hi>appeared to Abraham, before he dwelt in Haran</hi>—Therefore <hi>Abraham</hi> knew GOD, long before he was in this Land.</p>

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Therefore they that were diſperſed went every where, preaching the word.</p>
                     <p>And Philip coming down to a city of Samaria,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> And the people with one accord gave heed to the things which Philip ſpoke, hearing and ſeeing the miracles which he did.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> For unclean ſpirits, crying with a loud voice, came out of many that had them, and many ſick of the palſy and lame were healed.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> And there was great joy in that city. But a certain man,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> named Simon, had been before in the city, uſing magic, and aſtoniſhing the Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> ſaying, that he was ſome great one. To whom they all gave heed, from the leaſt to the greateſt, ſaying,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> This man is the great power of God. They gave heed to him, becauſe he had a long time aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them with witchcraft.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> But when they believed Philip, preaching the things of the kingdom of God, and the name of Jeſus Chriſt, they were baptized, both men and women.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> And Simon himſelf believed alſo; and being baptized, he continued with Philip,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> And the apoſtles who were at Jeruſalem, hearing that Samaria had receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the word of God, ſent to them Peter and John: Who being come down,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghoſt.

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/> Then they laid hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghoſt. And Simon ſeeing that thro' laying on of the hands of the apoſtles the Holy Ghoſt was given,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="36"/> And as they went on the way, they came to a certain water. And the eunuch ſaid, Behold, water: what hindereth me to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed?

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> and neither ate nor drank. And there was a certain diſciple at Damaſcus, named Ananias. And the Lord ſaid to him in a viſion, Ananias. And he ſaid,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> Behold I <hi>am here,</hi> Lord. And the Lord <hi>ſaid</hi> to him, Ariſe, go into the ſtreet called Straight, and enquire in the houſe of Judas, for <hi>one</hi> named Saul of Tarſus;

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22"/> But Saul increaſed the more in ſtrength, and confounded the Jews who dwelt at Damaſcus,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23"/> proving that this is the Chriſt. And when many days were fulfilled, the Jews conſulted together to kill him,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="27"/> But Barnabas taking him, brought <hi>him</hi> to the apoſtles, and declared to them, How he had ſeen the Lord in the way, and that he had ſpoken to him, and how he had preached boldly at Damaſcus,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="37"/> He is Lord of all. Ye know the word which was publiſhed through all Judea, beginning from Galilee, after the baptiſm which John preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="38"/> How God anointed Jeſus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghoſt and with power, who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppreſſed by the devil;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="39"/> for God was with him. And we are witneſſes of all things which he did, both in the land of the Jews and in Jeruſalem; whom yet they ſlew,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> having hanged <hi>him</hi> on a tree. Him God raiſed up the third day, and ſhewed him openly;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="41"/> (Not to all the people, but to witneſſes, choſen before of God, <hi>even</hi> to us, who did eat and drink with him) after he roſe from the dead. And he commanded us,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="42"/> to proclaim to the people, and to teſtify, that it is he who is ordained by
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:046352_0049_10210A59F3AA2A70"/>God the Judge of the living and the dead.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="43"/> To him give all the prophets witneſs, that every one who believeth in him, receiveth forgiveneſs of ſins through his name.</p>
                     <p>While Peter was yet ſpeaking theſe words,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="44"/> the Holy Ghoſt fell on all that were hearing the word. And the believers of the circumciſion,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> as many as came with Peter, were amazed, that the gift of the Holy Ghoſt was poured out on the Gentiles alſo.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="46"/> For they heard them ſpeaking with tongues and magnifying God.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="47"/> Then Peter anſwered, Can any man forbid water, that theſe ſhould not be baptized, who have received the Holy Ghoſt, even as we?
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="48"/> And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then they prayed him to tarry certain days.</p>

                     <p>And after much debate Peter roſe up and ſaid to them,

                              <hi>Blood</hi>—The eating which was never permitted the Children of GOD, from the Beginning of the World. Nothing can be clearer than this. For 1. from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Noah,</hi> no Man are Fleſh at all; conſequently no Man then are Blood. 2. When GOD allowed <hi>Noah</hi> and his Poſterity to eat Fleſh, He abſolutely forbad them to eat Blood; and accordingly this, with the other ſix Precepts of <hi>Noah,</hi> was delivered down from <hi>Noah</hi> to <hi>Moſes:</hi> 3. GOD renewed this Prohibition by <hi>Moſes,</hi> which was not repented from the Time of <hi>Moſes,</hi> till <hi>Chriſt</hi> came: 4. Neither after his Coming did any preſume to repeal this Decree of the Holy Ghoſt, till it ſeemed good to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> ſo to do, about the Middle of the Eighth Century. 5. From that Time thoſe Churches which acknowledged his Authority, held the eating of Blood to be an indifferent Thing. But, 6. in all thoſe Churches which never did acknowledge the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi>'s Authority, it never was allowed to eat Blood; nor is it allowed at this Day. This is the plain Fact; let Men <hi>reaſon</hi> as plauſibly as they pleaſe, on one Side or the other. <hi>From which keeping yourſelves, ye will do well</hi>— That is, ye will find a Bleſſing. This gentle Manner of concluding, was worthy the Apoſtolical Wiſdom and Goodneſs.

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> And as he was of the ſame trade, he abode with them and wrought, for they were

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> And he diſcourſed in the ſynagogue every ſabbath, and perſuaded the Jews and Greeks.</p>

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Paul was preſſed in ſpirit, and teſtified to the Jews that Jeſus was the Chriſt.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> But when they ſet themſelves in oppoſition and blaſphemed, he ſhook his raiment and ſaid to them, Your blood <hi>is</hi> upon your own head; I am pure: from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth I will go to the Gentiles.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> And going thence he went into the houſe of one named Juſtus, <hi>one</hi> that worſhipped God, whoſe houſe was adjoining to the ſynagogue.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> And Criſpus the ruler of the ſynagogue, believed on the Lord with all his houſe, and many of the Corinthians, hearing, believed and were baptized.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> Then the Lord ſaid to Paul by a viſion, in the night, Fear not, but ſpeak and hold not thy peace:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> For I am with thee, and no man ſhall ſet on thee to hurt thee; for I have much

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Now while Apolles was at Corinth, Paul hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paſſed through the upper parts, came to Epheſus; and finding certain diſciples,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> He ſaid to them, Have ye received the Holy Ghoſt, ſince ye believed? And they ſaid to him, Nay, we have not ſo much as heard, Whether there be any Holy Ghoſt.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> He ſaid to them, Into what then were ye baptized? And they ſaid, Into John's baptiſm.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> And Paul ſaid, John baptized with the baptiſm of repentance, telling the people to believe on him that was to come after him, that is, on Jeſus. And hearing <hi>this,</hi>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> they were baptized in the name of
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:046352_0086_10210ACA48E505F8"/>the Lord Jeſus.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> And Paul laying <hi>his</hi> hands on them, the Holy Ghoſt came upon them, and they ſpake with tongues and propheſied.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> And they were in all about twelve men.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> And going into the ſynagogue, he ſpake boldly, for three months diſcourſing and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuading the things concerning the kingdom of God. But when ſome were hardened and believed not,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> but ſpake reproachfully of the way before the multitude, he departed from them, and ſeparated the diſciples, diſcourſing daily in the ſchool of one Tyrannus.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> And this was done for the ſpace of two years, ſo that all the inhabitants of Aſia, both Jews and Greeks, heard the word of the Lord.</p>
                     <p>And God wrought ſpecial miracles by the hands of
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> Paul,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> So that handkerchiefs or aprons were carried from his body to the ſick, and the diſeaſes departed from them, and the evil ſpirits came out of them. And ſome of the vagabond Jews,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> exorciſts, undertook to name the name of the Lord Jeſus, over thoſe who had evil ſpirits, ſaying, We adjure you by Jeſus, whom Paul preacheth.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> And there were ſeven ſons of one Sceva a Jewiſh chief prieſt,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> who did this. But the evil ſpirit anſwering ſaid, Jeſus I know, and Paul I
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:046352_0087_10210ACCFA86A2B0"/>know;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> but who are ye? And the man in whom the evil ſpirit was, leaping upon them, and getting the maſtery of them, prevailed againſt them, ſo that they fled out of that houſe naked and wounded.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/> And this was known to all both Jews and Greeks dwelling at Epheſus, and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jeſus was magnified.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="18"/> And many of thoſe who believed came, confeſſing and openly declaring their deeds.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="19"/> Many alſo of thoſe who had practiſed curious arts, bringing their books together, burnt them before all men, and they computed the value of them,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> and found it fifty thouſand <hi>pieces</hi> of ſilver. So powerfully did the word of God grow and prevail.</p>
                     <p>After theſe things were ended,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21"/> Paul purpoſed in ſpirit, having paſſed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jeruſalem, ſaying, After I have been there, I muſt ſee Rome alſo.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22"/> And having ſent two of thoſe who miniſtred to him, Timotheus and Eraſtus, to Macedonia, he himſelf ſtaid in Aſia for a ſeaſon.
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:046352_0088_10210AD2CE9D4988"/>And about that time there aroſe no ſmall tumult con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the way.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23"/> 
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="24"/> For a man named Demetrius, a ſilver-ſmith, who made ſilver ſhrines of Diana, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured no ſmall gain to the artificers:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> Whom having gathered together, with the workmen employed in ſuch things, he ſaid, Sirs, ye know that our main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance ariſes from this occupation.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="26"/> But ye ſee and hear, that not at Epheſus only, but almoſt through all Aſia, this Paul hath perſuaded and turned aſide much people; ſaying, that they are not gods, which are made with hands:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="27"/> So that there is danger not only that this our craft ſhould come into diſgrace, but alſo that the temple of the great goddeſs Diana ſhould be deſpiſed, and her majeſty deſtroyed, whom all Aſia and the world worſhippeth.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="28"/> And hearing <hi>this,</hi> they were filled with rage, and cried out, ſaying, Great <hi>is</hi> Diana of the Epheſians,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="29"/> And the whole city was filled with confuſion; and they ruſhed with one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord into the theatre, dragging with them Caius and Ariſtarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul's fellow-travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers.
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:046352_0089_10210BE17733C278"/>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> And when Paul would have gone in to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="31"/> the diſciples would not ſuffer him. And ſome al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of the principal Officers of Aſia, being his friends, ſent to him and deſired, that he would not venture himſelf into the theatre.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="32"/> Some therefore cried one thing, and ſome another; for the aſſembly was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, and the greater part did not know for what they were come together.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="33"/> And they thruſt Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander forward from among the multitude, the Jews puſhing him on; and Alexander, waving with his hand, would have made a defence to the people. But when they knew that he was a Jew,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="34"/> one voice aroſe from them all, crying out, for about two hours, Great <hi>is</hi> Diana of the Epheſians.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> But the regiſter, having pacified the people, ſaid, Ye men of Epheſus what man is there who knoweth not, that the city of the Epheſians is a worſhipper of the great Diana, and of the <hi>image</hi> which fell down from Jupiter?
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="36"/> Seeing then theſe things cannot be denied, ye ought to be quiet,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="37"/> and to do nothing raſhly. For ye have brought theſe men, who are neither robbers of temples, nor
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:046352_0090_102107BB386433F8"/>blaſphemers of your goddeſs.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="38"/> If then Demetrius and the artificers that are with him, have a charge againſt any one, the courts are held, and there are proconſuls; let them implead one another.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="39"/> But if ye enquire any thing concerning other matters, it ſhall be determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a lawful aſſembly.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> And indeed we are in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to be queſtioned for ſedition, concerning this day; there being no cauſe, whereby we can account for this concourſe.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="41"/> And having ſaid theſe things, he diſmiſſed the aſſembly.</p>

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and thence to Patara. And finding a ſhip paſſing over to Phenicia, we went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board and ſet ſail.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> And coming within ſight of Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prus, and leaving <hi>it</hi> on the left-hand, we ſailed to Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, and landed at Tyre; for there the ſhip was to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>load her burden.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> And finding diſciples, we tarried there ſeven days, who told Paul by the Spirit, Not to go up to Jeruſalem.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> But when we had finiſhed theſe days, we departed and went our way; and they all at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended us out of the city, with their wives and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: and kneeling down on the ſea-ſhore we prayed. And having embraced each other we took ſhip,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> and they returned home.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> And having finiſhed <hi>our</hi> voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, we came from Tyre to Ptolemais, and ſaluting the brethren,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> we abode with them one day. And the next day, we departed and came to Ceſarea; and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering into the houſe of Philip the Evangeliſt, who
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:046352_0096_10210AE6EE349D00"/>was <hi>one</hi> of the ſeven,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> we abode with him. And he had four daughters, virgins, who were propheteſſes. And as we tarried many days,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> a certain prophet named Agabus,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> came down from Judea. And coming to us, he took up Paul's girdle, and binding his own feet and hands, ſaid, Thus faith the Holy Ghoſt, So ſhall the Jews at Jeruſalem bind the man whoſe girdle this is, and deliver <hi>him</hi> into the hands of the Gentiles. And when we heard theſe things,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> both we, and they of the place, beſought him, not to go up to Jeruſalem. But Paul anſwered,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> What mean ye, weeping and breaking my heart? I am ready not only to be bound but alſo to die at Jeruſalem, for the name of the Lord Jeſus.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> And when he would not be perſuaded, we ceaſed, ſaying, The will of the Lord be done.</p>
                     <p>And after theſe days,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> we took up our carriages, and went up to Jeruſalem.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> And <hi>ſome</hi> of the diſciples alſo from Ceſarea went with us, and brought us to
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:046352_0097_10210AE8ADBF4208"/>one Mnaſon, a Cyprian, an old diſciple, with whom we ſhould lodge.</p>
                     <p>And when we were come up to Jeruſalem,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/> the brethren received us gladly.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="18"/> And the next day, Paul went in with us to James, and all the elders were preſent. And having ſaluted them,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="19"/> he gave them a particular account of thoſe things which God had done among the Gentiles by his miniſtry.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> And having heard <hi>it,</hi> they glorified God, and ſaid to him, Thou ſeeſt, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, how many thouſands of believing Jews there are, and they are all zealous for the law.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21"/> But they have been informed concerning thee, that thou teacheſt the Jews who are among the Gentiles, to apoſtatize from Moſes, telling them, not to circumciſe <hi>their</hi> chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22"/> nor to walk after the cuſtoms. What is it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? The multitude muſt needs come together; for they will hear that thou art come.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23"/> Therefore do this that we ſay to thee: there are with us four men, who
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:046352_0098_10210AF011C1CAA8"/>have a vow on them:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="24"/> Take them and purify thyſelf with them, and be at charges with them, that they may ſhave their heads: and all will know, that there is nothing of thoſe things which they have heard of thee; but <hi>that</hi> thou thyſelf walkeſt orderly, keeping the law.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> As touching the Gentiles that believe, we have written and determined, that they ſhould obſerve no ſuch thing; ſave only that they keep themſelves from what is offered to idols, and from blood, and from what is ſtrangled,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="26"/> and from fornication. Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himſelf with them, entered into the temple, declaring the accompliſhment of the days of purification, till the offering ſhould be offered for every one of them.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="27"/> And when the ſeven days were about to be accompliſhed, the Jews that were from Aſia ſeeing him in the temple, ſtirred up all the multitude, and laid hands on him, Crying out,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="28"/> Men of Iſrael, help! This is the man, that teacheth all men every where againſt the people, and the law, and this place: yea and hath even brought Greeks into the temple, and polluted this
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:046352_0099_10210AF29223D838"/>holy place.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="29"/> For they had before ſeen Trophimus the Epheſian with him in the city, whom they ſuppoſed Paul had brought into the temple.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> And the whole city was moved, and the people ran together; and laying hold on Paul, they dragged him out of the temple: and immediately the gates were ſhut.</p>
                     <p>And as they went about to kill him,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="31"/> word came to the tribune of the cohort, that all Jeruſalem was in an uproar.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="32"/> Who immediately took ſoldiers and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turions, and ran down to them; and when they ſaw the tribune and the ſoldiers, they ceaſed from beating Paul.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="33"/> Then the tribune came near, and took him, and commanded <hi>him</hi> to be bound with two chains, and enquired, Who he was, and what he had done! But ſome among the multitude cried out one thing,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="34"/> ſome another; and when he could not know the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty for the tumult, he commanded him to be carried into the caſtle.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> But when he came upon the ſtairs,
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:046352_0100_10210AF611BF6560"/>he was borne of the ſoldiers, through the violence of the multitude.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="36"/> For the throng of people followed after crying,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="37"/> Away with him. And as Paul was about to be brought into the caſtle, he ſaid to the tribune, May I ſpeak to thee? Who ſaid, Canſt thou ſpeak Greek?
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="38"/> Art not thou that Egyptian, who before theſe days madeſt an uproar, and leddeſt out four thouſand murtherers into the wilderneſs?
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="39"/> But Paul ſaid, I am a man who am a Jew of Tarſus in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city: and I beſeech thee give me leave to ſpeak to the people.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> And when he had given leave, Paul ſtanding on the ſtairs, waved <hi>his</hi> hand to the people: and a great ſilence being made, he ſpake to them in the Hebrew tongue, ſaying, Brethren, and fathers, hear ye now my defence unto you.</p>

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> And I fell to the ground, and heard a voice ſaying to me, Saul, Saul,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> What ſhall I do, Lord? And the Lord ſaid to me, Riſe, and go into Damaſcus, and there it ſhall be told thee of all things which are appointed thee to do.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> And as I could not ſee for the glory of that light, being led by the hand by them that were with me, I came into Damaſcus. And one Ananias,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> But they that ſtood by,

And when he had ſaid this,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> there aroſe a contention between the Phariſees and the Sadducees; and the multitude was divided.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> For the Sadducees ſay, there is no reſurrection, neither angel nor ſpirit; but the Phariſees confeſs both.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> And there was a great clamour: and the Scribes of the Phariſees ſide ariſing, contended, ſaying, We find no evil in this man; but if a ſpirit or an angel hath ſpoken to him,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> let us not fight againſt God. And as a great diſturbance aroſe, the tribune fearing leſt Paul ſhould be torn in pieces by them, commanded the ſoldiers to go down, and pluck him from among them, and bring him into the caſtle.</p>
                     <p>And the night following,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> the Lord ſtanding by him, ſaid, Be of good courage, Paul: for as thou haſt teſtified the things concerning me at Jeruſalem,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> And when it was day, ſome of the Jews entering into a conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, bound themſelves by a curſe, ſaying, that they would neither eat nor drink, till they had killed Paul.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> And they were more than forty, who had made this confederacy.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> And they came to the chief prieſts and elders, and ſaid, We have bound ourſelves by a ſolemn curſe, not to taſte any thing, till we have killed Paul.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> Now therefore ye with the council ſignify to the tribune, that he bring him down to you to-morrow, as though ye would more accurately know the things concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him: and we, before he come near, are ready to kill him.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> But Paul's ſiſter's ſon, hearing of <hi>their</hi> lying in wait, came, and entering into the caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="18"/> for he hath ſomething to tell him. So he took and brought him to the tribune, and ſaid, Paul the priſoner, calling me to him, deſired me, to bring this young man to thee, who hath ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to tell thee.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="19"/> And the tribune taking him by the hand, and going aſide privately, aſked, What is it that thou haſt to tell me?
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> And he ſaid, The Jews have agreed to aſk thee to bring down Paul to-morrow to the council, as if they would enquire ſomething concerning him more accurately.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21"/> But do not yield to them; for there are more than forty

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23"/> And having called to him two of the centurions, he ſaid, Prepare two hundred ſoldiers to go to Ceſarea, and ſeventy horſemen, and two hundred ſpearmen, by the third hour of the night.

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> And he wrote a letter after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, Claudius Lyſias to the moſt excellent Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor Felix,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="28"/> And deſiring to know the crime of which they accuſed him, I brought him before their council:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="29"/> Whom I found to be accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed concerning queſtions of their law, but to be charged with nothing worthy of death or of bonds. And when it was ſhewn me,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> And he being called, Tertullus began to accuſe <hi>him,</hi> ſaying, Seeing we enjoy great peace through thee, and that very worthy deeds are done to this nation by thy prudence always, and in all places,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> We accept <hi>it,</hi> moſt excellent Felix, with all thankfulneſs.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> But that I may not trouble thee far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I beſeech thee of thy clemency to hear us a few words.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> For we have found this man a peſtilent fellow, and a mover of ſedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ring leader of the ſect of the Nazarenes:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Who hath alſo attempted to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane the temple; whom we ſeized and would have judged according to our law.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> But Lyſias the tribune coming upon us, with great violence took him away out of our hands,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> Commanding his accuſers to come to thee, whereby thou mayſt thyſelf, on examination, take knowledge of all theſe things, of which we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe him.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> And the Jews alſo aſſented, ſaying that theſe things were ſo.</p>
                     <p>Then Paul,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> after the governor had made a ſign to him to ſpeak, anſwered, Knowing thou haſt been for

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> Nor can they prove the things whereof they now accuſe me.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> But this I confeſs unto thee, that after the way which they call hereſy, ſo worſhip I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> Having hope in God, that there ſhall be a reſurrection of the dead, both of the juſt and of the unjuſt, which they themſelves alſo expect.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> And for this cauſe do I alſo
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:046352_0110_10210B14E0B638C8"/>exerciſe myſelf to have always a conſcience void of offence toward God and toward men.

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21"/> that I cried, ſtanding among them, Touching the reſurrection of the dead,

                     <p>And when Felix heard theſe things,

                     <p>Now when Feſtus was come into the province, after three days he went up from Ceſarea to Jeruſalem. Then the high prieſt and the chief of the Jews,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared before him againſt Paul, and beſought him, Begging favour againſt him,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> that he would ſend for

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> But Feſtus anſwered, That Paul was kept at Ceſarea, and that he himſelf would depart <hi>thither</hi> ſhortly.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Therefore let thoſe of you, ſaid he, who are able, go down with me and accuſe the man, if there be any <hi>wickedneſs</hi> in him.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> And having tarried among them not more than eight or ten days, he went down to Ceſarea; and the next day, ſitting on the judgment-ſeat, he commanded Paul to be brought. And when he was come,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> the Jews who had come down from Jeruſalem, ſtood round about <hi>him,</hi> bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many and heavy accuſations againſt Paul, which they were not able to prove:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> While he anſwered for himſelf, Neither againſt the law of the Jews, nor againſt the temple, nor againſt Ceſar have I offended at all.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> But Feſtus, deſiring to gratify the Jews, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered Paul, and ſaid, Art thou willing to go up to Jeruſalem, and there be judged before me concerning theſe things?
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> Then ſaid Paul, I am ſtanding at Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar's judgment-ſeat, where I ought to be judged: I have done no wrong to the Jews, as thou alſo very well knoweſt.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> For if indeed I have done wrong, and have committed any thing worthy of death. I refuſe not to die: but if there is nothing of the things whereof they accuſe me, no man can give me up to
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:046352_0113_10210B1CD43E1930"/>them.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> I appeal to Ceſar. Then Feſtus, having conferred with the council, anſwered, Haſt thou ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed to Ceſar? To Ceſar ſhalt thou go.</p>
                     <p>And after certain days,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> king Agrippa and Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice came to Ceſarea,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> to ſalute Feſtus. And when they had been there many days, Feſtus declared the caſe of Paul to the king, ſaying, There is a certain man left priſoner by Felix,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> About whom when I was at Jeruſalem, the chief prieſts and elders of the Jews appeared before <hi>me,</hi> deſiring judgment againſt him.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> To whom I anſwered, It is not the cuſtom of the Romans, to give up any man, till he that is accuſed have the accuſers face to face, and have liberty to make his defence, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the crime laid to his charge.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/> When therefore they were come hither, I without any delay ſat on the judgment-ſeat the next day, and commanded the man to be brought forth.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="18"/> Againſt whom when the accuſers ſtood up, they brought no accuſation of ſuch things as I ſuppoſed;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="19"/> But had certain queſtions againſt him, relating to their own religious worſhip, and about one Jeſus that was dead, whom Paul af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:046352_0114_10210B1E6EE82DC0"/>to be alive.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> And as I doubted of ſuch manner of queſtions, I aſked, If he would go to Jeruſalem, and there be judged concerning theſe matters?
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21"/> But Paul appealing to be kept for the hearing of Auguſtus, I commanded him to be kept till I could ſend him to Ceſar.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22"/> Then Agrippa ſaid to Feſtus, I would alſo hear the man myſelf. And he ſaid, To-morrow thou ſhalt hear him.</p>
                     <p>And on the morrow,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23"/> when Agrippa was come and Bernice with great pomp, and were entered into the place of audience, with the tribunes and principal men of the city, at the command of Feſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="24"/> Paul was brought forth. And Feſtus ſaid, King Agrippa, and all ye who are preſent with us, ye ſee this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews have pleaded with me, both at Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem and here, crying out, that he ought not to live any longer.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> But when I found, that he had committed nothing worthy of death, and he had himſelf appealed to the Emperor, I determined to ſend him:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="26"/> Of whom I have nothing certain to write to <hi>my</hi> lord: wherefore I have brought him before you, and eſpecially before thee, O king Agrippa, that after examination taken, I may have ſomewhat to write.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="27"/> For it ſeemeth to me unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, to ſend a priſoner, and not to ſignify alſo the crimes <hi>alledged</hi> againſt him.</p>

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> bound for Italy,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> put us on board of it. And when we had ſailed ſlowly many days, and were ſcarce come over-againſt Cnidus, the wind not ſuffering us, we ſailed under Crete,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> But the centurion regarded the maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and the owner of the veſſel, more than the things which were ſpoken by Paul.

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="29"/> they found fifteen fathoms. And fearing leſt we ſhould fall upon rough places, they caſt four anchors out of the ſtern, and wiſhed for the day. But when the ſailors were attempting to flee out of the ſhip,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> and had let down the boat into the ſea, under pretence that they were going to carry out anchors out of the foreſhip,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="31"/> Paul ſaid to the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion and the ſoldiers, Unleſs theſe abide in the ſhip,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="33"/> and let it fall off. And while the day was coming on, Paul exhorted them all to take food, ſaying, This day is the fourteenth that ye have tarried and continued faſting, having taken nothing.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="34"/> Therefore I exhort you to take food: for this is for your preſervation; for there ſhall not an hair fall from the head of any of you. And having ſpoken thus,

                  <p>MANY of the Writings of the New Teſtament are written in the Form of Epiſtles.

                  <p>As to the Time wherein he wrote his Epiſtles, it is probable he wrote, about the Year of <hi>Chriſt</hi> according to the common Reckoning:

                  <p>To expreſs the Deſign and Contents of this Epiſtle, a little more at large. The Apoſtle labours throughout, to fix in thoſe to whom he writes, a deep Senſe of the Excellency of the Goſpel, and to engage them to act suitably to it. For this Purpoſe, after a general Salutation, (ch.i. 1-7.) and Profeſſion of his Affection for them (ver. 8. 15.) he declares he ſhall not be aſhamed openly to maintain the Goſpel at <hi>Rome,</hi> ſeeing it is the powerful Inſtrument of Salvation, both to <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> by Means of Faith. (ver 16, 17.) And in order to demonſtrate this, he ſhews,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the World greatly needed ſuch a Diſpenſation, the <hi>Gentiles</hi> being in a moſt abandoned State; (ver. 18-32.) and the <hi>Jews,</hi> though condemning others, being themſelves no better: (ch. ii. 1-29.) As, notwithſtanding ſome Cavils, which he obviates, (ch. iii. 1-8.) their own Scriptures teſtify. (9-19.) So that all were under a Neceſſity of ſeeking Juſtification by this Method. (20-31.)</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>David</hi> themſelves ſought Juſtification, by Faith, and not by Works, (ch. iv. 1-25.)</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That all who believe are brought into ſo happy a State, as turns the greateſt Afflictions into Matter of Joy. (ch. v. 1-11.)</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That the evils brought on Mankind by <hi>Adam,</hi> are abundantly recompenſed to all that believe in <hi>Chriſt.</hi> (12-21.)</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That far from diſſolving the Obligations to practical Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the Goſpel increaſes them by peculiar Obligations, (ch. vi. 1-23.)</p>
                  <p>In order to convince them of theſe Things the more deeply, and to remove their Fondneſs for the <hi>Moſaic</hi> Law, now they were <hi>married to Chriſt</hi> by Faith in him, (ch vii. 1-6.) he shews how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able the Motives of the Law were to produce that Holineſs, which Believers obtain, by a living Faith in the Goſpel; (ch. v.i. 7-25. viii. 1, 2.) and then gives a more particular View of thoſe Things, which rendered the Goſpel effectual to this great End. (ver 3-39.)</p>
                  <p>That even the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> if they believed, ſhould have a Share in theſe Bleſſings; and that the <hi>Jews,</hi> if they believed not, ſhould be excluded from them, being a Point of great Importance, the Apoſtle beſtows the 9th, 10th, and 11th Chapters in ſettling it. He begins the 9th Chapter by expreſſing his tender Love and high Eſteem for the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation, (ver. 1-5.) and then ſhews,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That GOD's rejecting great Part of the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> yea, and of <hi>Iſaac</hi> too, was undeniable Fact (6-13.)</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That GOD had not choſen them to ſuch peculiar Privileges, for any Kind of Goodneſs either in them or their Fathers (14-24.)</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That his accepting the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and rejecting many of the <hi>Jews,</hi> had been foretold both by <hi>Hoſea</hi> and <hi>Iſaiah.</hi> (ver. 25-33.)</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That GOD had offered Salvation to <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> on the ſame Terms, though the <hi>Jews</hi> had rejected it. (ch. x. 1.-21.)</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That though the Rejection of <hi>Iſrael</hi> for their Obſtinacy was General, yet it was not Total: there being ſtill a Remnant among them who did embrace the Goſpel. (ch. xi. 1-10.)</p>
                  <p n="6">6. That the Rejection of the reſt was not Final, but in the End <hi>all Iſrael ſhould be ſaved.</hi> (ver. 11-31.)</p>
                  <p n="7">7. That mean time even their Obſtinacy and Rejection ſerved to diſplay the unſearchable Wiſdom and Love of GOD. (ver. 32-36.)</p>
                  <pb n="133" facs="unknown:046352_0132_10210B50CDF5FD68"/>
                  <p>The Reſt of the Epiſtle contains practical Inſtructions and Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations He particularly urges, 1. An entire Conſecration of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to GOD, and a Care to glorify Him by a faithful Improvement of their ſeveral Talents: (ch. xii 1-11.) 2. Devotion, Patience, Hoſpitality, mutual Sympathy, Humility, Peace, and Meekneſs; (ver. 12-21.) 3. Obedience to Magiſtrates, Juſtice in all its Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, Love the fulfilling of the Law, and univerſal Holineſs: (ch. xiii. 1-14.) 4. Mutual Candor between thoſe who differed in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, touching the Obſervance of the <hi>Moſaic</hi> Law; (ch. xiv. 1-23. xv. 1-17.) in enforcing which he is led to mention the Extent of his own Labours, and his Purpoſe of viſiting the <hi>Romans,</hi> in the mean Time recommending himſelf to their Prayers, (ver. 18-33.) And after many Salutations, (ch. xvi. 1-16) and a Caution againſt thoſe who cauſed Diviſions, he concludes with a ſuitable Bleſſing and Doxology. (v. 17-27.)</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Know ye not, brethren, (for I ſpeak to them that know the law) that the law hath dominion over a man,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> as long as it liveth? For the married woman is bound to <hi>her</hi> huſband while he is alive; but if <hi>her</hi> huſband be dead, ſhe is freed from the law of her huſband.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Therefore if ſhe marry ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man while her huſband liveth, ſhe will be called an adultereſs: but if her huſband be dead, ſhe is free from that law, ſo as to be no adultereſs, though ſhe marry another man.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Therefore ye alſo, my brethren,
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:046352_0160_10210BAE20B5DEF0"/>are become dead to the law by the body of Chriſt; that ye might be married to another, <hi>even</hi> to him who was raiſed from the dead, that we may bring forth fruit to God.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> For when we were in the fleſh, the motions of ſins, which were by the law, wrought in our members, ſo as to bring forth fruit unto death. But now we are freed from the law,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> being dead un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that whereby we were held, ſo that we ſerve in newneſs of ſpirit, and not in the oldneſs of the letter.</p>
                     <p>What ſhall we ſay then?
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> That the law is ſin? God forbid. Yea, I ſhould not have known ſin, but for the law. I had not known luſt, unleſs the law had ſaid,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> Thou ſhalt not covet. But ſin taking occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion by the commandment, wrought in me all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of deſire: for without the law ſin <hi>was</hi> dead.
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:046352_0161_10210BB16EEE9660"/>
And I was once alive without the law;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> but when the commandment came,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> ſin revived, and I died. And the commandment, which <hi>was intended</hi> for life, this I found unto death.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> For ſin taking occaſion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it ſlew me. So that the law is holy,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> and the commandment holy, and juſt, and good.</p>
                     <p>Was then that which is good made death to me?
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> God forbid: But ſin; that it might appear ſin, work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing death in me by that which is good: ſo that ſin might by the commandment become exceeding ſinful. We know that the law is ſpiritual;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> but I am carnal,
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:046352_0162_10210BB608A00200"/>ſold under ſin.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> For that which I do, I approve not; for I do not practiſe what I would, but what I hate, that I do.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> If then I do what I would not, I conſent to the law,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/> that <hi>it is</hi> good. Now then it is no more I that do it,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="18"/> but ſin that dwelleth in me. For I know that in me, that is, in my fleſh, dwelleth no good thing: for to will is preſent with me, but <hi>how</hi> to perform what is good,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="19"/> I find not. For the good that I would, I do not; but the evil which I would not, that I do.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> Now, if I do that which I would not, it is no more I that do it, but ſin that dwelleth in me. I find then a law,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21"/> that when I would do good, evil is preſent with me.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22"/> For I delight in the law of God after the inward man.

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> I thank God,

<pb n="165" facs="unknown:046352_0164_10210BBEB5EE9848"/>Now to be carnally minded <hi>is</hi> death;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> but to be ſpiritually minded <hi>is</hi> life and peace:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Becauſe to be carnally minded <hi>is</hi> enmity againſt God; for it is not ſubject to the law of God, neither indeed can be. So then they who are in the fleſh cannot pleaſe God.

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> For ye have not received the Spirit of bondage again unto fear, but ye have received the Spirit of adoption,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="19"/> For the earneſt expectation of the creation waiteth for the revelation of the ſons of God.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> For the creation was made ſubject to vanity, not willingly,

                           <p>The Works of Providence and Redemption are vaſt and ſtupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous, and therefore we are apt to conceive of GOD, as deliberating and conſulting on them, and then <hi>decreeing</hi> to act, according to <hi>the Counſels of his own Will.</hi> As if, long before the World was made, he had been concerting Meaſures, both as to the making and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning of it, and had then writ down his Decrees, which altered not, <pb n="169" facs="unknown:046352_0168_10210BCD98930400"/> any more than the Laws of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians.</hi> Whereas to take this <hi>conſulting</hi> and <hi>decreeing</hi> in a literal Senſe would be the ſame Abſurdity, as to aſcribe a real, human Body and human Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to the ever bleſſed GOD.</p>
                           <p>This is only a popular Repreſentation of his infallible Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and unchangeable Wiſdom; that is, He does all Things as wiſely as a Man can poſſibly do, after the deepeſt Conſultation, and as ſteadily purſues the moſt proper Method, as one can do, who has ſaid a Scheme before-hand. But then, though the Effects be ſuch as would argue Conſultation and conſequent Decrees in Man, yet what Need of a Moment's Conſultation in Him, who ſees all Things at one View?</p>
                           <p>Nor had GOD any more Occaſion to pauſe and deliberate, and lay down Rules for his own Conduct, from all Eternity, than He has now. What! Was there any Fear of his miſtaking afterwards, if He had not before-hand prepared Decrees, to direct Him, what He was to do? Will any Man ſay, He was wiſer before the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than ſince? Or had He then more Leiſure? That He ſhould take that Opportunity to ſettle his Affairs, and make Rules for Himſelf, from which He was never to vary?</p>
                           <p>He has doubtleſs the ſame Wiſdom and all other Perfections at this Day which he had from Eternity: And is now as capable of making <hi>Decrees,</hi> or rather has no more Occaſion for them now than formerly: His Underſtanding being always equally clear and bright, his Wiſdom equally infallible.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote to me, <hi>It is</hi> good for a man, not to touch a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Yet, <hi>to avoid</hi> fornication, let every man have his own wife: and let every woman have her own huſband.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Let the huſband render the debt to the wife; and in like manner the wife to the huſband.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> The wife hath not power over her own body, but the huſband; and in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the huſband alſo hath not power over
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:046352_0223_10210C888CF1EF30"/>his own body,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> But I ſay this by permiſſion, not by way of precept.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> For I would that all men were even as myſelf: but every one hath his proper gift from God, one after this manner, another after that.</p>
                     <p>But to the unmarried and the widows I ſay,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> It is good for them,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> if they remain even as I. But if they have not power over themſelves, let them marry; for it is better to marry than to burn.</p>
                     <p>The married I command,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to her huſband.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> And let not the huſband put away his wife. To the reſt ſpeak I, not the Lord. If any brother hath an unbelieving wife, and ſhe conſent to dwell with him, let him not
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:046352_0224_10210C8B642DD358"/>put her away.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> And the wife, who hath an unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving huſband, that conſenteth to live with her, let her not put him away.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> For the unbelieving huſband hath been ſanctified by the wife; and the unbelieving wife hath been ſanctified by the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. Elſe were your children unclean; but now they are holy.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> But if the unbeliever depart, let him depart: a brother or a ſiſter is not ins;laved in ſuch <hi>caſes;</hi>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> but God hath called us to peace. For how knoweſt thou, O wife, but thou mayſt ſave thy huſband? Or knoweſt thou, O huſband, but thou mayſt ſave thy wife?
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/> But as God hath diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to every one, as the Lord hath called e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one, ſo let him walk. And thus I ordain in all the churches.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="18"/> Is any one called being cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed? let him not become uncircumciſed. Is any one called in uncircumciſion? let him not be circumciſed.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="19"/> Circumciſion is nothing, and uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion is nothing, but keeping the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> Let every one in the calling wherein he is called,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21"/> therein abide. Waſt thou
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:046352_0225_10210C8E196DAC90"/>called; <hi>being</hi> a bond-man? care not for it: but if thou canſt be made free,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22"/> uſe <hi>it</hi> rather. For he that is called by the Lord, <hi>being</hi> a bond-man, is the Lord's freeman; and in the like manner, he that is called <hi>being</hi> free,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23"/> is the bondman of Chriſt. Ye are bought with a price; do not become the bond-ſlaves of men.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="24"/> Brethren, let every one wherein he is called, therein abide with God.</p>
                     <p>Now concerning virgins,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> I have no command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the Lord: but I give my judgment as one who hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="26"/> I apprehend therefore, that this is good for the preſent diſtreſs, that <hi>it is</hi> good for a man to continue as he is.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="27"/> Art thou bound to a wife? ſeek not to be looſed: art thou looſed from a wife? ſeek not a wife.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="28"/> Yet if thou doſt marry thou haſt not ſinned; and if a virgin marry, ſhe hath not ſinned. Nevertheleſs ſuch will have trouble in
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:046352_0226_10210C95B73EC2E0"/>the fleſh;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="29"/> but I ſpare you. But this I ſay, brethren, the time is ſhort: it remaineth, that even they that have wives,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> be as if they had none? and they that weep, as if they wept not; and they that rejoice, as if they rejoiced not; and they that buy,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="31"/> as if they poſſeſſed not; and they that uſe this world, as not abuſing it; for the faſhion of this world paſſeth away:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="32"/> Now I would have you without carefulneſs. The unmarried man careth for the things of the Lord, how he may pleaſe the Lord.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="33"/> But the married man careth for the things of the world,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="34"/> how he may pleaſe his wife. There is a difference alſo between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord, that ſhe may be holy both in body and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: but the married careth for the things of the
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:046352_0227_10210C97F03B0FA8"/>world,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> how ſhe may pleaſe her huſband. And this I ſay for your own profit, not that I may caſt a ſnare upon you, but that ye may decently wait up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Lord and without diſtraction.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="36"/> But if any think that he acteth indecently toward his virgin, if ſhe be above age, and need ſo require, let him do what he will, he ſinneth not: let them marry. Nevertheleſs he that ſtandeth ſtedfaſt in his heart,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="37"/> having no neceſſity, but having power over his own will, and hath determined this in his heart, to keep his virgin,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="38"/> doth well. So then he alſo that giveth in marriage, doth well; but he that giveth not in marriage, doth better.</p>
                     <p>The wife is bound as long as her huſband liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="39"/> but if her huſband be dead, ſhe is at liberty to marry whom ſhe will;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> only in the Lord. But ſhe is happier, if ſhe continue as ſhe is, in my judgment; and I think that I alſo have the Spirit of God.</p>

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> But if any one love God, he is known by him.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> I ſay, as to the eating of things ſacrificed to idols, we know that an idol <hi>is</hi> nothing in the world, and that <hi>there is</hi> no God but one. For though there be that are called gods,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> the Father from whom <hi>are</hi> all things, and we for him; and one Lord, Jeſus Chriſt, by whom <hi>are</hi> all things, and we by him.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> But <hi>there is</hi> not in all men this knowledge; for ſome do even until now, with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs of the idol, eat <hi>it</hi> as ſacrificed to the idol, and their conſcience, being weak, is defiled.</p>
                     <p>But meat commendeth us not to God;

<pb n="230" facs="unknown:046352_0229_10210C9E144D24C0"/>if we eat, are we the better, nor if we eat not, are we the worſe.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> But take heed, leſt by any means this your liberty become a ſtumbling-block to the weak. For if any one-ſee thee,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> who haſt knowledge, ſitting at meat in an idol-temple, will not the conſcience of him that is weak be encouraged to eat of the things ſacrificed to the idol?
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> And through thy knowledge ſhall the weak brother periſh, for whom Chriſt died. But when ye ſin thus againſt your brethren,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> and wound their weak conſcience, ye ſin againſt Chriſt. Wherefore if meat make my brother to offend,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> I will eat no fleſh while the world ſtandeth, leſt I make my brother to offend.</p>

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="28"/> But let a man examine himſelf, and ſo let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="29"/> For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to himſelf, not diſtinguiſhing the Lord's body.

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="33"/> Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="34"/> wait one for another. And if any one be hungry, let him eat at home, that ye come not together to condemnation. And the reſt I will ſet in order when I come.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Now concerning ſpiritual <hi>gifts,</hi> brethren, I would not have you ignorant.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Ye know that when ye were heathens, ye were carried away after dumb idols, as ye were led.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Therefore I give you to know, that <hi>as</hi> no one ſpeaking by the Spirit of God, calleth Jeſus accurſed; ſo no one can ſay, Jeſus <hi>is</hi> the Lord, but by the Holy Ghoſt.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Now there are diverſities of gifts,
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:046352_0243_10210CCFCB495FB0"/>but the ſame Spirit.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> And there are diverſities of miniſtrations,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> but the ſame Lord: And there are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities of operations, but it is the ſame God who worketh all in all.</p>
                     <p>But the manifeſtation of the Spirit is given to each,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> to profit withal.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> For to one is given by the Spirit, the word of wiſdom; to another by the ſame Spirit, the word of Knowledge;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> To another faith by the ſame Spirit; to another the gift of healing by the ſame Spirit;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another the diſcerning of ſpirits; to another <hi>divers</hi> kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> But one and the ſame Spirit worketh all theſe, dividing to every one ſeverally as he willeth.</p>
                     <pb n="245" facs="unknown:046352_0244_10210CD2174DF528"/>
                     <p>For as the Body is one,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> and yet hath many mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, but all the members of the body, many as they are,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> are one body, ſo <hi>is</hi> Chriſt. For we are all bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized by one Spirit into one body, whether <hi>we are</hi> Jews or Gentiles, whether ſlaves or freemen; and we have all drank of one Spirit.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> For the body is not one member,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> but many. If the foot ſhould ſay, Becauſe I am not the hand, I am not of the body, is it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not of the body?
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> And if the ear ſhould ſay, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I am not the eye, I am not of the body, is it therefore not of the body?
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/> If the whole body <hi>were</hi> an eye, where <hi>were</hi> the hearing? If the whole <hi>were</hi> hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="18"/> where <hi>were</hi> the ſmelling? But now hath God ſet the members, every one in the body, as it hath pleaſed him.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="19"/> And if all were one member, where <hi>were</hi> the body?
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> Whereas now there <hi>are</hi> indeed many members,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21"/> yet but one body. And the eye cannot ſay to the hand, I have no need of thee; or again, the head to the feet,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22"/> I have no need of you. Yea, the<pb n="246" facs="unknown:046352_0245_10210CD3D4DF46E8"/>members of the body, which appear to be weaker, are much more neceſſary.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23"/> And thoſe which we think to be the leſs honourable <hi>parts</hi> of the body, theſe we ſurround with more abundant honour, and our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comely <hi>parts</hi> have more abundant comelineſs.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="24"/> For our comely <hi>parts</hi> have no need; but God hath tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered the body together, giving more abundant honour to that which lacked:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> That there might be no ſchiſm in the body, but <hi>that</hi> the members might have the ſame care for each other:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="26"/> And whether one member ſuffer, all the members might ſuffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers might rejoice with it.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="27"/> Now ye are the body of Chriſt, and members in part.</p>
                     <p>And God hath ſet in the church,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="28"/> firſt, apoſtles, ſecondly, prophets, thirdly, teachers: afterward miracles, then gifts of healing, helps, governments, <hi>different</hi> kinds of tongues.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="29"/> 
                        <hi>Are</hi> all Apoſtles? <hi>Are</hi> all prophets? <hi>Are</hi> all teachers? <hi>Have</hi> all miraculous powers?
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> Have all the gifts of healing? do all ſpeak with tongues?
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="31"/> Do all interpret? Ye covet earneſtly the beſt gifts. But I ſhew unto you a more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent way.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> For we know that if our earthly houſe of <hi>this</hi> tabernacle be diſſolved, we have a building from God, an houſe not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> For in this we groan, earneſtly deſiring to be clothed upon, with our houſe which is from heaven:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> If being clothed, we ſhall not be found naked.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> For we who are in <hi>this</hi> tabernacle groan, being burdened; not that we would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clothed, but clothed upon, that what is mortal may be ſwallowed up of life.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Now he that hath wrought us to this very thing <hi>is</hi> God, who hath alſo given us
<pb n="278" facs="unknown:046352_0277_10210D3BC46A5F00"/>the earneſt of the Spirit.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Therefore <hi>we</hi> always behave undauntedly; knowing that while we are ſojourning in the body, we are abſent from the Lord: (for we walk by ſaith, not by ſight.)
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> We behave undauntedly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> 
                        <hi>I ſay,</hi> and are willing rather to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from the body, and preſent with the Lord.</p>
                     <p>Therefore we are ambitious,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> whether preſent, or abſent,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> to be well-pleaſing to him. For we muſt all appear before the judgment-ſeat of Chriſt, that every one may receive according to what he hath done in the body,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> whether good or evil. Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we perſuade men: but we are made manifeſt to God, and I truſt we are made manifeſt in your conſciences alſo.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> We do not again recommend ourſelves to you; but we give you an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of glorying on our behalf, that ye may have ſomething to <hi>anſwer</hi> them, who glory in appearance,<pb n="279" facs="unknown:046352_0278_10210D3E0F23F618"/>and not in heart.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> For if we are tranſported beyond ourſelves, <hi>it is</hi> to God; if we are ſober, <hi>it is</hi> for your ſakes.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> For the love of Chriſt conſtraineth us, while we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> And <hi>that</hi> he died for all, that they who live ſhould not henceforth live to themſelves, but to him who died for them,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> and roſe again. So that we from this time know no one after the fleſh; yea, if we have known even Chriſt after the fleſh, yet now we know <hi>him ſo</hi> no more.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/> Therefore if any one <hi>be</hi> in Chriſt, <hi>there is</hi> a new creation: the old things are paſſed
<pb n="280" facs="unknown:046352_0279_10210D40AF95A018"/>away;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="18"/> behold all things are become new: And all things <hi>are</hi> from God, who hath reconciled us to himſelf through Jeſus Chriſt, and hath given to us the miniſtry of reconciliation:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="19"/> Namely, that God was in Chriſt, reconciling the world to himſelf, not imputing their treſpaſſes to them, and hath commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to us the world of reconciliation.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> Therefore we are embaſſadors for Chriſt, as though God were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating by us: we beſeech <hi>you,</hi> in Chriſt's ſtead, be ye reconciled to God.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21"/> For he hath made him, who knew no ſin, a ſin-offering for us, that we might be

                     <p> 
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Moreover, brethren, we declare to you the Grace of God, beſtowed on the churches in Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> That in a great trial of Affliction, their overflowing joy and their deep poverty abounded to the riches of their liberality:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> That to <hi>their</hi> power, I teſtify, and beyond <hi>their</hi> power, <hi>they</hi> were willing of themſelves,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Praying us with much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty, to receive the gift and take a part in miniſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <hi>it</hi> to the ſaints.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> And <hi>this they did,</hi> not as we hoped; but firſt gave themſelves to the Lord, and to us by the will of God:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> So that we deſired Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, that as he had begun before, ſo he would alſo compleat this gift among you.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Therefore as ye abound in every thing, in faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and all diligence, and in your love to us,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> 
                        <hi>ſee,</hi> that ye abound in this grace alſo. I ſpeak not by way of command, but that by the diligence of others, I may prove the ſincerity of your love.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> For ye know the grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that though he was rich, yet for your ſake he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> And herein I give <hi>my</hi> advice: for this is expedient for you, who have began a year ago, not only to do, but alſo to do it willingly.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> Now therefore compleat the work, that as <hi>there was</hi> a ready will, ſo <hi>there may</hi> be alſo a performance, in proportion to what ye have.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> For if there be firſt a ready mind, a man is accepted, according to
<pb n="287" facs="unknown:046352_0286_10210D58068ECD70"/>what he hath, not according to what he hath not. For <hi>I do</hi> not <hi>mean,</hi>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> that others ſhould be eaſed, and you burthened;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> But by an equality, <hi>let</hi> your a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance <hi>be</hi> at this time <hi>a ſupply</hi> to their want; that their abundance alſo may be <hi>a ſupply</hi> to your want,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> that there may be an equality, As it is written,

                     <p>But thanks be to God,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> who putteth the ſame diligent care for you in the heart of Titus.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/> For he accepted indeed the exhortation, but being more forward,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="18"/> he went to you of his own accord. And we have ſent with him the brother, whoſe praiſe in the goſpel is through all the churches:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="19"/> (And not only <hi>ſo,</hi> but he was alſo appointed by the churches <hi>to be</hi> a fellow-traveller with us, with this gift, which is adminiſtered by us, to the glory of the Lord himſelf, and for <hi>the declaration</hi> of our ready
<pb n="288" facs="unknown:046352_0287_10210D5ED362D848"/>mind) Avoiding this,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> leſt any one ſhould blame us in this abundance, which is adminiſtred by us. For we provide things honeſt,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21"/> not only before the Lord,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22"/> but alſo before men. And we have ſent with them our brother, whom we have often proved diligent in many things, but now much more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23"/> through his great confidence in you. If <hi>any enquire</hi> concerning Titus, <hi>he is</hi> my partner, and fellow-labourer with reſpect to you, or <hi>concerning</hi> our brethren, <hi>they are</hi> the meſſengers of the churches, the glory of Chriſt.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="24"/> Shew therefore to them before the churches the proof of your love and of our boaſting on your behalf.</p>

                     <p>I marvel that ye are ſo ſoon removed from him who called you by the grace of Chriſt,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> to another goſpel,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Which is not another; but there are ſome that trouble you, and would ſubvert the goſpel of Chriſt.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> But if we, or an angel from heaven preach to you another goſpel than we have preached to you,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> let him be accurſed: As we have ſaid before, ſo I ſay now again, if any one preach to you ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther goſpel than that ye received, let him be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed.

                     <p>But I certify you,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> brethren, that the goſpel which was preached by me is not according to man.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> For neither did I receive it from man, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was I taught <hi>it,</hi> but by the revelation of Jeſus

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> For ye have heard of my behaviour in time paſt in the Jewiſh religion, that above mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure I perſecuted the Church of God, and waſted it.

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> being more abundantly zealous for the traditions of my fathers. But when it pleaſed God,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="18"/> Then after three years I went up to Jeruſalem to viſit Peter, and abode with him fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen days.

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21"/> Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22"/> And I was unknown by face to the churches of Judea which were in Chriſt.

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> added nothing to me. But on the contrary, when they ſaw that I was intruſted with the goſpel of the uncircumciſion, as Peter <hi>with that</hi> of the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> (For he that wrought effectually in Peter for the apoſtleſhip of the circumciſion, wrought like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe effectually in me toward the Gentiles:)
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> And when James, and Cephas, and John, who undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly were pillars, knew the grace that was given to me, they gave the right-hands of fellowſhip to me and Barnabas, that we <hi>ſhould go</hi> to the Gentiles, and they

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> But when Cephas came to Antioch, I withſtood him to the face, becauſe he was to be blamed.

At his taking Leave of the Church there, he forewarned them both of great Perſecutions from without, and of divers Hereſies and Schiſms, which would ariſe among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.

                     <p>Wherefore putting away lying,
