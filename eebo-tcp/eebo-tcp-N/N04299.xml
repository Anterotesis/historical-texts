            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.
      </p>
         </projectDesc>
         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

In the foregoing Chapter, he had given us a full Account, how God ſpoke the World into Being; and eſpecially how he formed Man of the Duſt of the Earth and breathed into him the Breath of Life, ſo that he became a living Soul.—A Council of the Trinity was called concerning the Formation of this lovely Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.—The Reſult of that Council was, <hi>Let us make Man in our Image after our Likeneſs.—"So God created Man in his own Image, in the Image of God created he him."—Moſes</hi> remarkably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peats the Words, that we might take particular.

giving Names to the Beaſts, and his being put into the Garden which God had planted, I think require a longer Space of Time than a Day to be tranſacted in.—However, all agree in this, "Man ſtood not long." How long, or how ſhort a while, I will not take upon me to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.—It more concerns us to inquire, how he came to fall from his Stedfaſtneſs, and what was the Riſe and Progreſs of the Temptation which prevailed over him.—The Account given us in this Chapter concerning it, is very full, and it may do us much Service, under God, to make ſome Remarks upon it.</p>

            <p>Tho' this was a real Serpent, yet he that ſpoke was no other than the Devil; from hence, perhaps, called the old Serpent, becauſe he took Poſſeſſion of the Serpent when he came to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guile our firſt Parents—The Devil envied the Happineſs of Man, who was made, as ſome think, to ſupply the Place of the fallen Angels—God made Man upright, and with full Power to ſtand if he would—He was juſt, therefore, in ſuffering him to be tempted—If he fell, he had no one to blame except himſelf—But how muſt <hi>Satan</hi> effect his Fall?—He cannot do it by his Power, he attempts it therefore by Policy—He take<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </q> Theſe Words are certainly ſpoken in Anſwer to ſomething which the Devil either ſaw or heard—In all Probability, the Woman was now near the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. (For we ſhall find her, by and by, plucking an Apple from it) perhaps ſhe might be looking at, and wondering what there was in that Tree more than the others, that ſhe and her Huſband ſhould be forbidden to taſte of it—<hi>Satan</hi> ſeeing this, and coveting to draw her into a Parley with him, (for if the Devil can perſuade us not to reſiſt, but to commune with him, he hath gained a great Point) he ſays, <q>

For, talking of the ſecond Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, in his Preface concerning <hi>caring for the Soul,</hi> ſays he, <q>This ſecond Covenant was made with <hi>Adam,</hi> and us in him, preſently after the Fall, and is briefly contained in theſe Words—<hi>Gen.</hi> iii. 15. where God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares <hi>the Seed of the Woman ſhall break the Serpent's Head;</hi> and this was made up, as the firſt was, of ſome Mercies to be afforded by God, and ſome Duties to be performed by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

are directed only to the Serpent—<hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> ſtood by as Criminals, and God could not treat with them, becauſe they had broken his Covenant. And it is ſo far from being a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, wherein <q>ſome Mercies are to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded by God, and ſome Duties to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by us,</q> that here is not a Word looking that Way—It's only a Declaration of a free Gift of Salvation through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord—God the Father, and God the Son, had enter'd into a Covenant concerning the Salvation of the Elect from all Eternity; wherein God the Father promiſed, that if the Son would offer his Soul a Sacrifice for Sin, he ſhould ſee his Seed—Now this is an open Revelation of this ſecret Covenant, and therefore God ſpeaks in the moſt poſitive Terms, <hi>It ſhall bruiſe thy Head, and thou ſhalt bruiſe his Heel.</hi>—The firſt <hi>Adam</hi> God had treated with before—He proved falſe—God therefore, to ſecure the ſecond Covenant from being broken, puts it into the Hands of the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> the Lord from Heaven—<hi>Adam</hi> after the Fall, ſtood no longer as our Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative—He and <hi>Eve</hi> were only private Perſons, as we are, and were only to lay hold on the Declaration of Mercy contained in this Promiſe by Faith, (as they really did) and by that they were ſaved.—I do not ſay, but we are to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and obey, if we are everlaſtingly ſaved—Faith and Obedience are Conditions, if we on mean that they in order go before our Salvation but I deny that theſe are propoſed by God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

For, how could that be, when <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> were now Priſoners at the Bar, without Strength to perform any Conditions at all.—The Truth is this—God, as a Reward of Chriſt's Sufferings, promiſed to give the Elect Faith and Repentance, in order to bring them to eternal Life—And both theſe, and every Thing elſe neceſſary for their everlaſting Happineſs, are infallibly ſecured to them in this Promiſe, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Perſons, who argue againſt Perſecution now, are not ſufficiently ſenſible of the bitter Enmity of the Heart of every unregenerate Man againſt God.

               </gap> the Ends of the World are come.—For this Reaſon, the Author of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> in the 11th Chapter, mentions ſuch a noble Catalogue of Old-Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Saints and Martyrs, <hi>who ſubdued King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, wrought Righteouſneſs, ſtopped the Mouth, of Lions,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and are gone before us to inherit the Promiſes.</hi> A ſufficient Confutation, I think, of their Error, who lightly eſteem the Old-Teſtament Saints, and would not have them mentioned to Chriſtians, as Perſons whoſe Faith and Patience we are called upon more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to follow—If this was true, the Apoſtle would never have produced ſuch a Cloud of Witneſſes out of the Old Teſtament, to excite the Chriſtians of the firſt, and conſequently pureſt Age of the Church, to continue ſtedfaſt and unmoveable in the Profeſſion of their Faith.—Amidſt this Catalogue of Saints, methinks the Patriarch <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhines the brighteſt, and differs from the others, as one Star differeth from another Star in Glory—For he ſhone with ſuch diſtinguiſhed Luſtre, that he was called the <hi>Friend of God,</hi> the <hi>Father of the Faithful,</hi> and thoſe who believe on Chriſt, are ſaid to be Sons and Daughters of, and to be bleſſed with faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Abraham</hi>—Many Trials of his Faith did God ſend this great and good Man, after he had commanded him to get out from his Country, and from his Kindred, unto a Land which he ſhould ſhew him—But his laſt was the moſt ſevere of all—I mean that of offering up his only Son—This, by the Divine Aſſiſtance, I

but he was taken notice of for his Gift in Prayer. And yet it ſeemed before theſe three Days <hi>Saul</hi> never prayed in his Life—And why? Becauſe, before theſe three Days, he never felt himſelf a <hi>condemned</hi> Creature—He was alive in his own Opinion, becauſe without a Knowledge of the ſpiritual Meaning of the Law, he felt not a want of, and therefore before now, cried not after a Jeſus, and conſequently, tho' he might have ſaid or made a Prayer (as many Phariſees do now a-days) he never prayed a Prayer.—But now, Behold! he <hi>prayeth indeed</hi>—And this was urged as one Reaſon why he was converted.—None of God's Children, as one obſerves, come into the World ſtill-born—Prayer is the very Breath of the new Creature, and therefore if we are Prayerleſs we are Chriſtleſs—If we never had the Spirit of Supplication, it is a ſad Sign that we never had the Spirit of Grace in our Souls; and you may be aſſured you never did pray, unleſs you have felt your ſelves damnable Sinners, and the Want of Jeſus to be your Saviour.—May the Lord, whom I ſerve in the Goſpel of his dear Son, prick you all to the Heart, and may it be ſaid of you all as it was of <hi>Saul,</hi> Behold, they pray!</p>

converſed with Chriſtians in private, but he preached Chriſt publickly in the Synagogues Eſpecially he inſiſted on the Divinity of our Lord, proving, notwithſtanding his Humiliation, that he was really the Son of God.</p>
            <p>But why did <hi>Saul</hi> preach Chriſt thus? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had felt the Power of Chriſt upon his own Soul—And here's the Reaſon why Chriſt is ſo ſeldom preached, and his Divinity ſo ſlightly inſiſted on in our Synagogues, 'tis becauſe the Generality of thoſe that pretend to preach him, never felt a ſaving Work of Converſion upon their own Souls—How can they preach, unleſs they are firſt taught of, and then ſent by God? <hi>Saul</hi> did not preach Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he knew him, no more ſhould any one elſe.—An unconverted Miniſter, tho' he could ſpeak with the Tongues of Men and Angels, will be but as a ſounding Braſs and tinkling Cymbal to thoſe whoſe Senſes are exerciſed to diſcern ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Things—Miniſters that are unconverted, may talk and declaim of Chriſt, and prove from Books that he is the Son of God, but they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not preach with the Demonſtration of the Spirit and with Power, unleſs they preach from Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, and have had a Proof of his Divinity, by a Work of Grace wrought upon their own Souls—God forgive thoſe, who lay Hands on an unconverted Man, knowing that he is ſuch—I would not do it for a thouſand Worlds—Lord Jeſus keep thy own faithful Servants pure, and let them not be then Partakers of other Men's Sins.</p>

Such an Inſtance as <hi>Saul'</hi>s Converſion was, we may be aſſured muſt make a great deal of Noiſe, and therefore no Wonder we are told, <hi>Ver.</hi> 21. <hi>But all that heard him were amazed, and ſaid, Is not this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>And thus it will be with all that appear pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly for Jeſus Chriſt; and it's as impoſſible for a true Chriſtian to be hid, as a City built upon a Hill—Brethren, if you are faithful to, you muſt be reproached, and have Remarks made on you for Chriſt; eſpecially if you have been remarkably wicked before your Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. What, (will your Friends ſay) is not this he, or ſhe, who a little while ago would run to as great Exceſs of Riot and Vanity as the worſt of us all? What has turned your Brain? Or if you have been cloſe, falſe, formal Hypocrites as <hi>Saul</hi> was, they will wonder that <hi>you</hi> ſhould be ſo deceived, as to think you were not in a ſafe State before—As, no doubt, Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers were ſurprized to hear <hi>Saul,</hi> who was touching the Law blameleſs, affirm that he wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Brethren, you muſt expect to meet with many ſuch Difficulties as theſe—the Scourge of the Tongue is generally the firſt Croſs we are called to bear for the Sake of Chriſt—Let not therefore this move you—It did not intimidate, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>But</hi> SAUL, ſays the Text, <hi>increaſed the more in Strength, and confounded the Jews which dwelt at</hi> Damaſcus, <hi>proving that this is very Chriſt.</hi>—Oppoſition never yet did, nor ever will hurt a ſincere Convert—Nothing like Oppoſition to make the Man of God perfect—None but a Hireling, who careth not for the Sheep, will be affrighted at the Approach or Barking of Wolves—Chriſt's Miniſters are as bold as Lions—It is not for ſuch Men as they to flee.</p>
            <p>And therefore (that I may draw towards a Concluſion) let the Miniſters and Diſciples of Chriſt, learn from <hi>Saul,</hi> not to fear Men or their Revilings, but, like him, increaſe in Strength, the more wicked Men endeavour to weaken their Hands.—We cannot be Chriſtians without being oppoſed—No—Diſciples in general muſt ſuffer—Miniſters in particular muſt ſuffer great Things—But let not this move any of us from our Stedfaſtneſs in the Goſpel—He that ſtood by and ſtrengthned <hi>Saul,</hi> will alſo ſtand by and ſtrengthen us. He is a God, mighty to ſave all that put their Truſt in him—If we look up with an Eye of Faith, we, as well as the firſt Martyr St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> may ſee Jeſus ſtanding at the right Hand of God, ready to aſſiſt and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect us—Tho' the Lord's Seat is in Heaven, yet he has Reſpect to his Saints in an eſpecial Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner when ſuffering here on Earth—Then the Spirit of Chriſt and of Glory reſts upon, their Souls.

of Men for the Sake of Jeſus Chriſt.</q> However little they may deſign it, my Enemies are my greateſt Friends—What I moſt fear is a Calm; but the Enmity which is in the Hearts of natural Men againſt Chriſt, will not ſuffer them to be quiet long—No. As I hope the Work of God will increaſe, ſo the Rage of Men and Devils will increaſe alſo—Let us put on therefore the whole Armour of God—Oh! let us not fear the Face of Men—Let us fear him only, who can deſtroy both Body and Soul in Hell—I ſay unto you, let us fear him alone—You ſee how ſoon God can ſtop the Fury of his Enemies—You have juſt now heard of a proud, powerful Zealot ſtop'd in his full Career ſtruck down to the Earth with a Light from Heaven, converted by the Almighty Power of efficacious Grace, and thereupon zealouſly promoting, nay reſolutely ſuffering for the Faith which once with Threatnings &amp; Slaughters he endeavour'd to deſtroy—Let this teach us to pity and pray for our Lord's moſt inveterate Enemies—Who knows, but in Anſwer thereunto, our Lord may give them Repentance unto Life? Moſt think, that Chriſt had Reſpect to <hi>Stephen'</hi>s Prayer, when he converted <hi>Saul</hi>—Perhaps for this Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon God ſuffers his Adverſaries to go on, that his Goodneſs and Power may ſhine more bright in their Converſion—But let no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <q>
                  <hi>And Jeſus ſaid unto him, This Day is Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation come to this Houſe; foraſmuch as he alſo is the Son of Abraham. For the Son of Man is come to ſeek and to ſave that which was loſt.</hi>

            <p>SAlvation every where through the whole Scripture, is ſaid to be the Free Gift of God thro' Jeſus Chriſt our Lord. Not only Free, becauſe God is a ſovereign Agent, and therefore may withold it from, or confer it on whom he pleaſeth; but Free, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is nothing to be found in Man, that can <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

<pb n="199" facs="unknown:005311_0206_10181B3C8AA5CCB0"/>
is alſo the Gift of God) makes it our own—And this Faith, if true, will work by Love.</p>
            <p>Theſe are Parts of thoſe Glad Tidings which are publiſh'd in the Goſpel, and of the Certainty of them, next to the expreſs Word of God, the Experience of all ſuch as have been ſaved, is the beſt, and, as I take it, the moſt undoubted Proof—That God might teach us every Way, he has been pleaſed to leave upon Record many Inſtances of the Power of his Grace exerted in the Salvation of ſeveral particular Perſons, that we, hearing how he dealt with them, might from thence infer the Manner we muſt expect to be dealt with ourſelves, and learn in what Way we muſt look for Salvation, if we truly deſire to be made Partakers of the heavenly Inheritance with the Saints in Light.</p>
            <p>The Converſion of the Perſon referred to in the Text, I think will be of no ſmall Service to us in this Matter, if rightly improved—I would hope moſt of you know who the Perſon is, to whom the Lord Jeſus ſpeaks—It is the Publican <hi>Zaccheus,</hi> to whoſe Houſe the bleſſed Jeſus ſaid Salvation came, and whom he pronounces a Son of <hi>Abraham.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>There's no ſeeing Chriſt in Glory, unleſs we run before the Multitude, and are willing to be in the Number of thoſe deſpiſed few, who take the Kingdom of God by Violence—That broad Way, in which ſo many go, can never be that ſtrait and narrow Way which leads to Life—Our Lord's Flock was, and always will be, comparatively a little One—And unleſs we dare to run before the Multitude in a holy Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity, and can rejoyce in being accounted Fools for Chriſt's Sake, we ſhall never ſee Jeſus with Comfort, when he appears in Glory—From mentioning the Sycamore-Tree, and conſidering the Difficulty with which <hi>Zaccheus</hi> muſt climb it, we may further learn, that thoſe who would ſee Chriſt, muſt undergo other Difficulties and Hardſhips beſides Contempt. <hi>Zaccheus,</hi> without doubt, went through both—Did not many, think you, laugh at him as he ran along, and in the Language of <hi>Michal, Saul'</hi>s Daughter, cry out, How glorious did the rich <hi>Zaccheus</hi> look to Day, when forgetting the Greatneſs of his Station, he ran before a pitiful, giddy Mob, and climbed up a Sycamore-Tree, to ſee an <hi>Enthuſiaſtick</hi> Preacher!—But <hi>Zaccheus</hi> cares not for all that—His Curioſity was ſtrong—If he could but ſee who Jeſus was, he did not value what Scoffers ſaid of him—And thus much more will it be

with all thoſe who have an effectual Deſire to ſee Jeſus in Heaven—They will go on from Strength to Strength, break through every Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty lying in their Way, and care not what Men or Devils ſay of, or do unto them—<hi>May the Lord make us all thus minded for his dear Son's Sake!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At length, after taking much Pains, and going (as we may well ſuppoſe) thro' much Contempt, <hi>Zaccheus</hi> has climbed the Tree; and there he ſits, as he thinks, hid in the Leaves of it, and watching when he ſhould ſee Jeſus paſs by—<hi>"For he was to paſs by that Way."</hi>

but <hi>I</hi> muſt <hi>abide this Day at thy Houſe.</hi> He alſo calls him by Name, as tho' he was well acquainted with him—And indeed well he might. For his Name was written in the Book of Life. He was one of thoſe whom the Father had given him from all Eternity. Therefore he muſt abide at his Houſe that Day—<hi>For whom he did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinate, them he alſo called.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here then, as through a Glaſs, we may ſee the Doctrine of <hi>free Grace</hi> evidently exemplified before us—Here was no Fitneſs in <hi>Zaccheus</hi>—He was a <hi>Publican,</hi> chief among the <hi>Publicans,</hi> not only ſo, but rich, and came hither to ſee Chriſt only out of <hi>Curioſity.</hi> But ſovereign Grace triumphs over all—And if we do God Juſtice, and are effectually wrought upon, we muſt acknowledge there was no more Fitneſs in us, than in <hi>Zaccheus</hi>—And had not Chriſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented us by his Call, we had remained dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins, and alienated from the divine Life, even as others.<q>
                  <hi>Jeſus looked up, and ſaw him, and ſaid unto him, Zaccheus, make haſte and come down; for this Day I muſt abide at thy Houſe.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>With what different Emotions of Heart may we ſuppoſe <hi>Zaccheus</hi> received this Invitation? Think you not that he was ſurprized to hear Jeſus Chriſt call him by Name, and not only ſo, but invite himſelf to his Houſe? Surely thinks <hi>Zaccheus,</hi> I dream.

               <hi>Zaccheus</hi> thought within himſelf. But what ſaith the Scripture? <hi>I will make a willing Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the Day of my Power</hi>—With this outward Call, there went an efficacious Power from God, which ſweetly over-ruled his natural Will; and therefore, Ver. 6. <hi> "He made haſte, and came down, and received him joyfully"</hi>—Not only into his Houſe, but alſo into his Heart.</p>
            <p>Thus it is the great God brings home his Children. He calls them by Name, by his Word or Providence—He ſpeaks to them by his Spirit—Hereby they are enabled to open their Hearts, and are made willing to receive the King of Glory in—For <hi>Zaccheus'</hi>s ſake let us not intirely condemn People that come under the Word, out of no better Principle than <hi>Curioſity.</hi> Who knows but God may call them?

and pleaſed himſelf frequently to be ſure, that he got ſo rich by doing ſo—But now he is grieved for it at his Heart—He confeſſes his Injuſtice before Men, and promiſes to make ample Reſtitution—Go ye cheating <hi>Publicans,</hi> learn of <hi>Zaccheus</hi>—Go away and do likewiſe. If you do not make Reſtitution here, the Lord Jeſus ſhall make you confeſs it before Men and Angels, and condemn you for it when he comes in the Glory of his Father to Judgment here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
            <p>After all this, with good Reaſon might our Lord ſay unto him—<q>

            <p>And now are you not aſhamed of yourſelves, who ſpeak againſt the Doctrines of Grace, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that Doctrine of being juſtified by Faith alone, as tho' it leaded to Licentiouſneſs? What can be more unjuſt than ſuch a Charge? Is not the Inſtance of <hi>Zaccheus</hi> a ſufficient Proof to the contrary? Have I ſtrained it to ſerve my own Turn? God forbid—To the beſt of my Knowledge I have ſpoken the Truth in Sincerity and the Truth as it is in Jeſus—I do affirm that we are ſaved <hi>by Grace,</hi> and that we are juſtified

            <p>What therefore has been ſaid of <hi>Zaccheus,</hi> may ſerve as a Rule, whereby all may judge whether they have Faith or not—You ſay you have Faith—But how do you prove it? Did you ever hear the Lord Jeſus call you by Name? Were you ever made to obey that Call? Did you ever, like <hi>Zaccheus,</hi> receive Jeſus Chriſt joyfully into your Hearts? Are you influenced by the Faith you ſay you have, to ſtand up and conteſs the Lord Jeſus before Men? Were you ever made willing to own, and humble your ſelves for your paſt Offences? Does your Faith work by Love, ſo that you conſcientiouſly lay up, according as God as proſpered you, for the Support of the Poor? Do you give Alms of all Things that you poſſeſs? And have you made due Reſtitution to thoſe you have wronged? If ſo, happy are ye—Salvation is come to your Souls—You are Sons, you are Daughters of, you ſhall ſhortly be everlaſtingly bleſſed with, faithful <hi>Abraham.</hi> But if you are not thus minded, do not deceive your own Souls—Tho' you may talk of Juſtification by Faith like Angels, it will do you no Good—It will only increaſe your Damnation—You hold the Truth, but it is in Unrighteouſneſs. Your Faith, being without Works, is dead—You have the <hi>Devil,</hi> not <hi>Abraham,</hi> for your Father—Unleſs you get a Faith of the Heart, a Faith working by Love, with Devils and damned Spirits ſhall you dwell for evermore.</p>
