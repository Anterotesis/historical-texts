            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>MATTHIAS GOTLEIB was born in Pruſſia, and early in life en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged as a Soldier, and went through various ſcenes common to that calling, which we think not worth relating here: One thing however, he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable for deſerting his poſt and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and liſting again from time to time, 'till he came to America, during the late war with Britain. After ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling and moving ſeveral times, he came to Newton, in New-Jerſey, where he perpetrated the following act, of murdering his wife.</p>
            <p>"On the 19th day of December, 1795, he was about the village as uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and returned home intoxicated; his wife being diſpleaſed to ſee him in that ſituation, began to find fault with his conduct—he immediately got his
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:030607_0003_0FE81C4051262EB8"/>
butcher-knife, and aſked his ſon for a whet-ſtone, but the boy's mother or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him to his work, which he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed. Gotleib then whet his knife on a board, and proceeded to ſtab his wife; he gave her three ſeperate ſtabs, one of which proved to be mortal, by paſſing through one of her inteſtines. He then attempted to make his eſcape, but was apprehended and confined in priſon. The unfortunate woman died the fifth day following, and a Coroner's inqueſt ſat over her body, of twenty-three good and lawful men; four ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons were called to diſſect and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the body, and gave their opinion thereon—after the jurors had heard the teſtimony of the ſurgeons and witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, they found a verdict of wilful mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, committed by the hand of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thias Gotleib. He continued in Jail 'till October 1796, when he was tried and convicted, by the moſt poſitive e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and executed accordingly.</p>

            <p>THE words that I have choſed on this occaſion, as the foundation of the following diſcourſe, are recorded in
<q>
                  <bibl>
                     <hi>Geneſis, IX, 6.</hi>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>IT appears from the latter clauſe of our text, that man was in his original formation, like his Maker, in ſome good degree; his being in the image of God, muſt denote his bearing ſome reſemblance to God, is his perfections—as we find ſome traces in man's paradiſiacal ſtate of holineſs, rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and happineſs.</p>
            <p>THUS man was a noble creature, when he came from the hands of his Creator—endowed with ſuperior faculties of mind and traquility of diſpoſition. Thus by creation all men are brethren and all nations of one blood; and indeed there are many conſiderations which ſhould make us protect and love each other, as belonging to one great family—this appears not only from creation, but by Providence, which provides abundantly for us all; eſpecially, conſidering our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as chriſtians, our obligations are ſtill ſtronger, to love and protect each other. But theſe conſiderations have not been kept in view, nor attended to—and many of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſpecies have given themſelves up to blood-ſhed and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ever ſince the ſeduction of our firſt parents. Soon after the fall, we find wicked Cain murdering his righteous bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Abel. A bare catalogue of thoſe individuals that have murdered each other, from that period to this, would form a large volume. But God has declared, whoſo ſheddeth mans blood, by man ſhall his blood be ſhed.</p>
            <p>IN farther proſecuting this ſubject, I ſhall

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>AND firſt of thoſe ſins that end in death without repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
            <p>BLASPHEMY againſt God and profane ſwearing, although diſregarded by many, not being puniſhed generally by the laws of man; but God who is jealous of his glory, has ſtrictly forbidden it, thoſe who are guilty of this vile prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, may remember that they are accountable to the great legiſlator of the univerſe, under whoſe government, without repentance, they muſt be puniſhed with eternal death. Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting or deſpiſing of the Sabbath, ſubjects every ridiculer of that ſacred day, to the juſt indignation of God, who is deſpiſed by theſe profane ſcoffers.</p>
            <p>THE deſpiſing of relative duties, come under the penalty of the divine law; as diſobedience to parents, turbulence to ſuperiors, faction and diſcord in ſociety without juſt cauſe; to which we may add, ſtealing, which is puniſhable by our laws, together with adultery, which tends to deſtroy the good order of ſociety, and was by the Jews puniſhed with ſtoneing to death, by the Congregation: Although now deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed by the vicious, will tend to their final ruin, unleſs ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere repentance takes place in the heart.</p>
            <p>IN this catalogue of ſins, lying and drunkenneſs, ſhould not be conſidered as the leaſt criminal; lying is not only odious, but tends to deface all truth, and the aſcertaining of facts; drunkenneſs gradually undermines and ruins the beſt conſtitution, it expends what Providence has allowed us, and frequently cauſes poor families to ſuffer.</p>
            <p>AND here murder comes in a ſtrong point of light. Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is baſe and unnatural, it is invading the prerogative of God's government; right of human ſociety, the perpetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors ought to be conſidered as the enemies of God and man.</p>
            <p>WE learn from the holy ſcriptures, how a juſt God, will deal with thoſe abominable ſinners.</p>
            <p>MURDERERS, whoremongers, and all lyers, ſhall have their

part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimſtone, which is the ſecond death. <note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.8.</note>
            </p>
            <p>ALL wilful ſin, of whatever kind, leads to miſery here, and miſery hereafter, baniſhment from all good, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement to all evil.</p>
            <p>THIS brings us to the ſecond propoſition.</p>
            <p n="2">II. WHICH was to ſhew the propriety of that law of God and man, that annexes death to murder.</p>
            <p n="1">1. SEVERITY is indiſpenſibly neceſſary, from the heinouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and nature of this crime. It is a<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ys conſidered among the blackeſt of crimes, to murder a fellow creature; to mark it with the greateſt diſgrace and ſhame, to deter o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers from the like offence. If this was not the caſe, maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacres would become more frequent, and no man's life would be in any degree of ſafety.</p>
            <p n="2">2. IT muſt be right and proper; as it comes from God, who is all perfection, wiſdom, power, juſtice, and mercy: His wiſdom has fired upon this puniſhment, who knows the whole nature of man.</p>
            <p>THE power of that God, who made all worlds, is able to diſcover and have it puniſhed; hence murder, by ſome mean or other, is generally found out; yes always, for if not in this world, it will ſurely be in the next. For juſtice muſt be executed, and mercy itſelf does not forbid it; for the ſame God that has declared, that, he that ſheddeth mans blood, by man ſhall his blood be ſhed, is all mercy as well as juſtice.</p>
            <p n="3">3. THE propriety of this, appears from its having been ſo general, in moſt of the nations of the earth, publicly exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute murderers; yes, many that are unacquainted with the ſcriptures. To confirm our opinion, we have the ſence of ancient and modern nations; of ſo many millions of wiſe Legiſlators and great Philoſophers. The wiſe king of Iſrael, ſays, in the multitude of counſellors, there is ſafety—and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it appears ſo, from the reaſon and nature of things;
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:030607_0007_0FE81C4FE440BF18"/>
that he who takes the life of another unjuſtly, ſhall looſe or forfeit his own in conſequence of it. It is neceſſary for the preſervation of the unalienable rights of ſociety, that every man ſhould be protected by the laws of his county; and if any body of law-givers, ſhould alleviate this puniſhment, who would be willing to be a citizen of that community.</p>
            <p n="3">3. AS we are fully convinced, of the propriety and juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of this law, as it has its ſanction from God and man; we ſhould not heſitate to do our duty in our ſeveral depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to ſee the law put in full execution, notwithſtanding our feelings of ſympathy—for a law, however juſt and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, if not put in force, proves no avail, but hardens and increaſes the offenders.</p>
            <p>THIS brings us to make an improvement, ſuitable to the preſent occaſion.</p>
            <p n="1">1. WE may learn from this ſubject, the danger of all ſin, as it leads to death temporal or eternal—God is holy, and all ſin is deteſtable in his ſight, and muſt be puniſhed here or hereafter; and if repentance is not exerciſed, both in ſome inſtances.</p>
            <p n="2">2. WE may learn from this ſubject, the danger of ſmaller ſins, as they lead to greater, till the conſcience becomes feared, and no crime is too great to perpetrate.</p>
            <p>PERHAPS few, who are brought to the gallows, for wilful murder, but what advance from ſtealing, lying, drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and various wicked practices, till at laſt they imbrue their hands in human blood.</p>
            <p n="3">3. WE might take notice, from the circumſtances before us, the degrees of wickedneſs, in murder itſelf. Is it ſinful to murder a ſtranger? A diſtant relation? It is ſtill more ſo to murder a brother, a ſiſter, a child! In a higher degree, it is abominable to murder a Father or Mother; but above all, a boſom companion—a wife—the partner of our joys— the ſoother of our miſeries! Eſpecially the huſband, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector, turning into the butcher, is horrible in every point of view.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:030607_0008_0FE7EBB4F4630A90"/>4. AND to you poor criminal, do not think that we wiſh to inſult you—no, we only wiſh to impreſs you with a feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſenſe of your crime, and the aggravated nature of your ſins. You have robbed your poor children of their Mother, and now the law of God and man, muſt take your life alſo, ſo that they are ſtripped of their Father and Mother. May God in his mercy take care of the orphans. I hope, yes believe, you feel ſorry for what you have done. Give yourſelf up to ſincere repentance and brokenneſs of heart, for your offences. Pardon may be poſſible—God is gracious to the true penitent—plead for his mercy, in and through the merits and attonement of Jeſus Chriſt—ſtrip yourſelf of all ſelf-righteouſneſs and creature performance.</p>
            <p n="8">8. YOU have juſtly forfeited your life to the ſtate and laws of our land—you have but a few moments to live—your glaſs is almoſt run—you are forbiden to behold the riſing of yonder fun again—to you it will ſet with eternal night—you muſt ſoon appear at the awful bar of Almighty God.—God pity and have mercy upon you.—Farewel.</p>
            <p n="9">9. SHALL we cloſe this memorable ſcene, without a word to the ſpectators.</p>
            <p>YOU ſee that this man muſt now die—do not ridicule him —but pray to God to keep you from thoſe ſins which led him to this horrid act—remember all ſin is deteſtable to God and Chriſt, and will come upon ſinners in an unexpected hour, when ye think not—be ye therefore alſo ready.—Avoid all ſin, eſpecially drunkenneſs, which urged on this man to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his wife and companion.—Remember an intoxicated man looſes much of his reaſon, and turns into the ſcale of the inferior animals; avoid particularly, the riſing of your paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions—an angry man is an outrageous and deſperate creature. May the example before us, ſerve as a warning to us all.— May God give us ſincere contrition of ſoul, for all our ſins, and accept of us through Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <closer>AMEN.</closer>
