            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THe Governour and Magistrates being assembled in Council, and in some measure sensible of the many tokens of the Lords displeasure against the cutting short the Fruits of the Earth for sundry years past, and otherwise bringing us low more then formerly; together with the many provoking Evils that do abound among us, to the great dishonour of God, and our Profession of his holy Name, and that notwithstanding all means used for to reclaim the same, which being in conjunction with sundry other things that are among us, threatning yet more displeasure against us, if the compassions of our tender hearted and long-suffering God do not timely prevent: Do therefore commend to all the Inhabitants of this Colony the Twenty fifth day of this instant to be kept a Publick Day of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, and spent in Fasting and Prayer to the Lord for pardon of whatever have been, or is provoking to his holy eyes, and that he will be pleased to give unto us, from the greatest to the least, truely to Repent of all our sins, and to reform the same; and that those uncomfortable Breaches made in several Societies may be again repaired, and we may obtain his favourable Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence with us this following year, and his blessing upon our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Seed-time, that so it may appear that the Lords anger is turned away from us, and that he is yet in our <hi>Zion,</hi> ruling in the midst of us, uniting the hearts of his poor people to do all his pleasure, and nothing else. Also the present low Estate of the Churches of Christ in <hi>Europe,</hi> and especially in our dear Native Country, is to be humbly presented before the Lord.</p>
