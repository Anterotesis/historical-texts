            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE evils which we have long foreſeen are now come upon this town and province, the long meditated ſtroke is now given to the civil liberty of this country? How long we may be allowed the enjoyment of our religious liberty is a queſtion of infinite moment. Religion can never be retained in it's purity where tyranny has uſurped the place of reaſon and juſtice. The bill for blocking up the harbour of Boſton is replete with injuſtice and cruelty, thouſands of innocent men, beſides women and infants, are by it reduced to indegence and diſtreſs; and though we in this town more immediately feel this diſtreſs, yet our brethren in the other towns of this province, and all the other colonies, muſt ſee that we ſuffer in the common cauſe, and that <hi>they</hi> themſelves muſt ſoon realize the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings under which <hi>we</hi> now labour, if no means are diſcovered for our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. But if any ſhould think that this town alone is to groan under the weight of arbitrary power, we are now furniſhed by our enemies, with a ſtill more glaring evidence of a fixed plan of the Britiſh adminiſtration to bring the whole continent into the moſt humiliating bondage. A bill has been brought into parliament apparently for the purpoſe of taking away our charter rights, wherein it is to be enacted that the counſellors ſhall be appointed by mandamus from the king, that our juſtices of the ſuperior court, juſtices of our inferior courts, and juſtices of the peace, ſhall be all appointed by the governor alone, without the advice of the council, and all of them, excepting the juſtices of the ſuperior court be removeable by him at his pleaſure, that our juries ſhall not be choſen by the freeholders, as they heretofore have been, but by the ſheriff of the county, and that this ſheriff ſhall not be appointed by the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and council as heretofore, but by the governor alone, ſo that our lives and properties are to be decided upon by judges appointed by the governor alone, and by juries choſen by a ſheriff who muſt be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely under the influence of the governor as he is appointed by him, and is removeable by him alone, whenever he ſhall diſcover a reluctance to conform to the will of the governor. Surely if we ſuffer theſe things we are the moſt abject ſlaves. If a favorite of a perverſe governor ſhould pretend a title to our lands, or any other part of our property, we need no doubt but a very ſmall degree of evidence in ſupport of the claim, would be judged ſufficient, eſpecially as the bill makes proviſion, that upon the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of either of the parties, it ſhall be lawful to try the cauſe in another coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty than that in which the action was brought, ſo that a man is to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into a diſtant part of the province, inſtead of having his cauſe tried in his own county, and to be tried by ſtrangers with whom the good or bad characters of the parties or of the witneſſes can have no weight, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the very ſpirit of magna charta. Of what value are our lands or eſtates to us, if ſuch an odious government ſhould be eſtabliſhed among us? Can we look with pleaſure on the inheritance left by our anceſtors, or on the fields cultivated by <hi>our</hi> induſtry? When we reflect that all our labours have made them only a more inviting prey to our enemies, will not the vine-yard of Naboth be ever in <hi>our</hi> minds? But leſt any thing ſhould be wanting to compleat our miſery, another bill is alſo prepared, which enables the governor to ſave any perſon or perſons, who, under
<pb facs="unknown:013157_0002_0F8FF97A1B1E0058"
                   rendition="simple:additions"/>the pretext of ſupporting or carrying into execution the late or other acts of the Britiſh parliament, ſhall murder and deſtroy the people of this country, from being tried in this province (even if they ſhould be indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſuch grand jurors as ſhall be choſen by the ſheriff of the county in the ſame manner that we have mentioned that petty jurors are to be returned) but the perſon indicted with ſuch witneſſes as he and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutor (which will be the crown) ſhall judge proper, ſhall be ſent to either of the other colonies, or even to Great Britain, to be tried for mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the inhabitants of the Maſſachuſetts-Bay. And proviſion is alſo made to prevent our meeting together in our corporate capacity as a town, unleſs it be once in the month of March for the election of the town officers, except the matter or buſineſs of the meeting is laid before the governor, and his leave in writing is obtained for a meeting of the town.</p>
            <p>There is but one way that we can conceive of, to prevent what is to be deprecated by all good men, and ought by all poſſible means to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, <hi>viz,</hi> The horrors that muſt follow an open rupture between Great Britain and her colonies; or on our part, a ſubjection to abſolute ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very: And that is by affecting the trade and intereſt of Great Britain, ſo deeply as ſhall induce her to withdraw her oppreſſive hand. There can be no doubt of our ſucceeding to the utmoſt of our wiſhes if we univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally come into a ſolemn league, not to import goods from Great Britain, and not to buy any goods that ſhall hereafter be imported from thence, until our grievances ſhall be redreſſed. To theſe, or even to the leaſt of theſe ſhameful impoſitions, we truſt in God, our countrymen never will ſubmit.</p>
            <p>We have received ſuch aſſurances from our brethren in every part of the province of their readineſs to adopt ſuch meaſures as may be likely to ſave our country, that we have not the leaſt doubt of an almoſt univerſal agreement for this purpoſe; in confidence of this, we have drawn up a form of a covenant to be ſubſcribed by all adult perſons of both ſexes; which we have ſent to every town in the province, and that we might not give our enemies time to counteract us, we have endeavoured that every town ſhould be furniſhed with ſuch a copy on or before the fourteenth day of this month, and we earneſtly deſire that you would uſe your utmoſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours that the ſubſcription paper may be filled up as ſoon as poſſible, that ſo they who are in expectation of overthrowing our liberties may be diſcouraged from proſecuting their wicked deſigns; as we look upon this the laſt and only method of preſerving our land from ſlavery with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out drenching it in blood, may God proſper every undertaking which tends to the ſalvation of his people. We are, &amp;c.</p>
