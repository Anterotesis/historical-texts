            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>FTER much perplexity, and in the midſt of great anxiety, reſulting from the unhappy ſituation of our national and American affairs, we once more ſee the return of an anniverſary election.</p>
            <p>On this occaſion, in which our political fathers attended with crouds of loyal ſubjects, and free-born citizens, are come up to the houſe of GOD, to recognize his goodneſs, ſpread our diſtreſſed caſe before him, and devoutly ſeek his gracious patronage, I know of no words more ſuitable to addreſs you in, than thoſe now read.</p>
            <p>They are the words of good <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> in that truly animated ſpeech, in which he addreſſed himſelf to his ſuffering brethren, at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> when he came <hi>with the good hand of his</hi> GOD <hi>upon him</hi>; and a
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:014383_0005_0F92626D14CDDDE0"/>
royal mandate from the <hi>Perſian Monarch,</hi> to redreſs their grievances and repair the waſtes of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They contain every thing ſuited to our caſe in this dark and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome day.</p>
            <p>We have here in the firſt place,</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>Our own condition exactly expreſſed, "Ye ſee the diſtreſs that we are in, how</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>lieth waſte, and the gates thereof are burnt with fire,</hi>"</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>What ſpirit we ought to ſhew in our diſtreſſed Circumſtances, "They ſaid, let us riſe up and build, ſo they ſtrengthened their hands for that good work.</hi>"</p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>The oppoſition to be expected, and embarraſſments which frequently attend benevolent endeavours to retrieve a ſinking nation and diſtreſſed peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ariſing from an evil deſigning faction. "When</hi> Sanballat, <hi>&amp;c. heard it, they laughed us to ſcorn, diſpiſed us, and ſaid, What is this thing that ye do? Will ye rebel againſt the King?</hi>"</p>
            <p n="4">IV. <hi>A good reſolution perſiſted in, fixed on a pious baſis, enſuring the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt confidence of ſucceſs, "The</hi> GOD <hi>of Heaven he will proſper us, therefore we his ſervants will go on and build:</hi>" And a proper treatment of ſuch as are unfriendly to due exertions for the public ſafety, "<hi>You have no portion, right, or memorial in</hi> Jeruſalem."</p>
            <p>The patience and candor of this numerous and reſpectable audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, will bear with me, while I touch on theſe reſpective branches, in the ſubſequent diſcourſe, apparently tending to influence to ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reflections on this ſolemn occaſion.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>We have then our own condition expreſſed, "Ye ſee the diſtreſs that we are in, how Jeruſalem lieth waſte, and the gates thereof are burnt with fire.</hi>"</p>
            <p>Jeruſalem was the capital of Judea, and "the center of unity of the Jewiſh people, both in religious and civil affairs;" the temple there erected, was an emblem of their religious and civil polity. For "thither the tribes went up to give thanks unto the name of the Lord, and there was the ſeat of judgment, even the ſeat of the houſe of <hi>David." Pſ.</hi> cxxii. <hi>v.</hi> 5. The Jewiſh perſonage, therefore, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing the afflicted condition of the people, by <hi>the waſtes of Jeruſalem,</hi> and her <hi>gates burnt with fire,</hi> ſignifies the diſtreſſed and ruined ſtate of the people, relative to their religious and civil affairs, and the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent miſeries they felt, as well the demolition of their literal tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by the ravages and flames of war.</p>
            <p>In all theſe reſpects, they were in a miſerable condition indeed. A parallel between their ſituation and ours, in every inſtance, I pretend not; but a reſemblance in ſome particulars, and in regard of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of diſtreſs, will be ſufficiently apparant from a conciſe view of our real ſtate at this day.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:014383_0006_0F92626DCE0589E0"/>In general the ground of our complaints, is ſuch things as theſe. A determined <hi>plan</hi> already puſhed on, to the aſtoniſhment of all true Engliſhmen, calculated in its natural tendency to ſubvert the Britiſh conſtitution, which for ages has ſtood the guardian of the means of her ſubject's happineſs, the envy of foreign nations, and the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the whole world, and to ſubſtitute in the room thereof, <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute deſpotiſm,</hi> and as the certain conſequence, <hi>cruel tyranny,</hi> and the <hi>total ſlavery</hi> of all America.</p>
            <p>IN purſuit of <hi>this,</hi> many cruel reſolves, and unconſtitutional acts of late parliaments, which wore a moſt threatning aſpect to the whole continent—If we would ſee their genuine operations and proper ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, we need only advert to a neighbouring province—there we ſhall find, they have made an actual ſeizure of their charter, raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed its moſt valuable and eſſential rights, without giving the people an opportunity to receive conviction of having made a forfeiture, or vindicating their innocency, from the vile ſlander and wicked miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſentations of deſigning men.</p>
            <p>In conſequence the diſtreſs and confuſion of that devoted province —their capital filled with the King's troops, their harbour with his ſhips, on purpoſe to compel the people into ſubmiſſion; their port blockaded up, their trade and buſineſs at an end, the inhabitants, by thouſands, inſtantly turned to want and beggary, having no method of ſubſiſtence but on the charitable contributions of their ſympathiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brethren, in their own and neighbouring colonies.</p>
            <p>In this ſtate have they endured with great patience and fortitude, till at length we are aſſured, by good intelligence, open hoſtility is commenced by the King's ſoldiers. In the late battle at <hi>Concord</hi> and <hi>Lexington, inglorious to the Britiſh arms!</hi> they have imbrued their hands in the innocent blood of their fellow ſubjects with a relentleſs cruelty and inhuman barbarity, too much like that which we have experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced from the mercileſs ſavages of the wilderneſs.</p>
            <p>The metropolis of that unhappy province is now become a <hi>garriſon town,</hi> the inhabitants, by thouſands, confined within its walls, in the greateſt conſternation, from fearful apprehenſions of being put to the ſword, or of periſhing by famine.</p>
            <p>The whole continent, juſtly alarmed at theſe appearances, filled with the deepeſt concern for themſelves, their poſterity, yea the whole Britiſh empire.</p>
            <p>And further, the embarraſſments laid on regular and neceſſary procedures, in the ſeveral governments, in managing their own af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:014383_0007_0F92626E8F2C00B0"/>
inſomuch that the wiſeſt ſtateſman ſcarcely knows what way to turn himſelf, any more than what will be the final iſſue of the preſent convulſion. The non-importation agreement, in prudence and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity extorted, in our own defence, the alienation of his Majeſty's affections from his loyal American ſubjects, who ever have been, and ſtill are, ambitious to aſſert and maintain their loyalty and obſtinate attachment to his <hi>royal perſon, family</hi> and <hi>government,</hi> on principles that at firſt introduced the illuſtrious houſe of <hi>Hanover</hi> to the throne, and which alone can ſupport their rights to it, conſiſtant with the Britiſh conſtitution. The interruption of that mutual confidence and affection that have for ſo long a time ſubſiſted, between the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſtate and the colonies, to the great ſatisfaction and mutual ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of both. The apparant danger of a total alienation between both countries, to the great injury of each, to ſay the beſt, and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the preſent growing appearances, the eminent danger of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing univerſally plunged into the horrors and diſtreſſes of a civil war.</p>
            <p>Nor is this machination leſs inimical to religious liberty—our reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious privileges and civil liberties are inſeperably connected and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually dependant on each other; if therefore the one fails the other cannot ſubſiſt long, and the former is in a great degree the barrier of the latter, "in ſuch a manner as nothing elſe can be." Of all our bleſſings then, we ſhould eſteem our religion the moſt valuable, and nothing ſhould ſo much alarm us, as any attempts to rob or abridge us of freedom, in a full and peaceable enjoyment of it. But the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred rights of conſcience, and the moſt precious privileges of the goſpel, are no leſs aimed at than every thing elſe dear to us. Two years ſince, in a great aſſembly, on ſuch an occaſion as this, it was juſtly complained of,<note n="*" place="bottom">TURNER's Election Sermon.</note> "how dormant the laws of <hi>England</hi> againſt Popery were known" then "to remain"—and as a ſpecimen mention was made of "a Roman Catholic Biſhop, at <hi>Canada,</hi> and a Popiſh Prieſt at <hi>Nova-Scotia,</hi> publicly ſupported." But now ſuch has been the rapid progreſs of the wicked contrivance we are ſpeaking of, as that, in reſpect of the whole country of <hi>Canada</hi> (an extent of above 2000 miles) Popery is the eſtabliſhed religion, and Proteſtaniſm is ſuffered to ſubſiſt, only by toleration, and that in ſuch circumſtances, as in all human view, the latter will ſoon be extirpated by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and effectual proviſion, for all this, is ſecured by an act of a late parliament, commonly known among us by the name of the
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:014383_0008_0F92626F34711450"/>
               <hi>Quebec Bill.</hi> What a ſhocking figure muſt this make in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> annals? And what a ſtigma of diſgrace and inconſiſtency muſt it fix on a profeſſedly Proteſtant parliament, for having enacted it: When once this ſource of national and colony woe ſhall have run its length, where are we? To what a wretched ſtate of oppreſſion and ſlavery ſhall we be reduced? That fair inheritance which our fathers, the firſt ſettlers of this country, purchaſed for us, at the expence of their treaſure and blood, left us poſſeſſed of by a clear title, confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by royal charters, in a moſt ſolemn manner, is extorted from us. The beſt religion in the world, we muſt exchange for all the barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, trumpery and ſuperſtitions of Popery; or burn at the ſtake, or ſubmit to the tortures of the inquiſition. In theſe circumſtances, who would deſire to live? Yea, who would not "chooſe ſtrangling and death rather than life?" This is a juſt and moderate account of the ſtate of things Whence a plan, that has already produced ſuch great and univerſal misfortune, and if purſued, muſt and will, in all human view, produce greater beyond all imagination, ſhould o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginate, I know but little, and ſhall ſay leſs; yet were we to judge from its natural tendency, complexion and effects, we muſt conclude it firſt ſprang from that original <hi>wicked politician,</hi> who "works in the hearts of the children of diſobedience," and has his habitation in the regions of darkneſs and cruelty.</p>
            <p>To the above we may add, as what encreaſes the gloom, and what, with great humility and deep penitence, we ſhould reflect on, the awful declining ſtate of religion and virtue, and the fearful preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of almoſt every ſpecies of immorality.</p>
            <p>From theſe alarming proſpects we cannot but ſee "the diſtreſs we are in," through the nation, and theſe colonies in particular. For relief much depends under GOD, on our taking and purſuing the courſe dictated in the paſſage under conſideration. This brings me therefore to conſider in the next place,</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>The ſpirit we ought to ſhew in our diſtreſſed circumſtances. "They ſaid, let us riſe up and build, ſo they ſtrengthened their hands to this good work."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here is every thing our caſe requires, in point of human prudence, in order to remove preſent diſtreſs, and avert impending ruin: <hi>Particularly,</hi> a firm reſolution and vigorous efforts, in oppoſition to a ſinking deſpondency, which enervates action and is often the offspring of diſtreſs.</p>
            <p>Union, in every proper method, is a thing of abſolute importance without which any plan, be it ever ſo well conceived, will prove abortive.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:014383_0009_0F92627013087B78"/>The conduct of affairs, at ſuch a critical juncture, with confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, placed in the hands of ſuch men, of whoſe character we have a lively picture, in that of <hi>Nehemiah</hi>; and the people ſupporting, to the utmoſt of their power, their leaders in the common cauſe.</p>
            <p>It was a very abject condition this ruler found his brethren in when he came to them: They were in bondage to the <hi>Perſian</hi> empire, ſtript of their invaluable priviledges, their temple thrown into heaps of ruin, cruelly oppreſſed and inſulted by the King's ſervants ſet o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them; ſome were deſtitute of the means of bare ſubſiſtence, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had "mortgaged their lands;" "ſome had borrowed money for the King's tribute upon their lands and vineyards," "others ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to ſell their ſons and daughters, to be ſervants, neither was it in their power to redeem them." Had they given way to theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements, in all probability they never would have emerged from their low and depreſſed condition; but being rouſed to vigor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous exertions, by this ſpirited addreſs, diſplayed a noble fortitude, and were ſucceeded.</p>
            <p>True indeed, we may in vain expect <hi>ſalvation from the hills, and the multitude of the mountains</hi>; nor ought our confidence to be placed mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the beſt of men or means; yet it is as true, that Heaven works by proper means and inſtruments, in the uſe of which only, we can rationally expect his interpoſition.—And when he deſigns ſalvation, he excites a proper ſpirit, directs and influences to ſuitable meaſures, as in the caſe of the Jews, in this <hi>great and good work</hi> they had ſet their hearts upon.—And has he not in many inſtances remarkably ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in our caſe, and given tokens of good, ſo far at leaſt, as to raiſe our hopes, and inſpire the moſt unſhaken reſolution? With a forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude like that diſplayed in the paſſage before us, we muſt <hi>ariſe and build,</hi> tho' we hold the ſword in one hand, our lives and liberties in the other. Our very diſtreſs dictates the moſt undaunted reſolution in all lawful meaſures:—What of this ſpirit has appeared, ſhould there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be tenderly nurſed. And has there not appeared a becoming re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution? has it not ſpread ſurpriſingly thro' all America? has it not in a proper manner manifeſted itſelf in the reſolves of Aſſemblies, in the appointment and <hi>production</hi> of the <hi>Continental Congreſs,</hi> who have performed not only to the approbation, but to the admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their conſtituents.— Of the laſt importance is the ſtricteſt union in every town, and between the towns in every colony, and between the colonies through the whole continent —</p>
            <p>It is not <hi>comparatively</hi> of ſo much importance what method we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:014383_0010_0F926270AEAE5140"/>
in (if juſt in the ſight of Heaven) provided as general and as ſtrict a union as can be expected, be inviolately maintained.—There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in human view can give us ſuch a hopeful proſpect as that u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion which has obtained—its parallel is not to be found in all hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ric exiſtence—great pains has undoubtedly been taken on one hand to effect it—great pains on the other to prevent it. To eſtabliſh and increaſe it, will be the great object of attention on one ſide,—to diſſolve it on the other.—But after all <hi>the hand of our God is good upon us</hi> in this thing.—Our enemies muſt confeſs it to be a token of good. They did not expect it,—<hi>laughed</hi> a pretence of it <hi>to ſcorn,</hi> when they ſaw it were not a little chafed, and confounded; and even our very friends were in doubt about it.—Heaven be thanked, it has been accompliſhed to ſo great a degree; to the joy of true patrons of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and to the embaraſſment of tyrants, may Heaven increaſe and eſtabliſh it!—</p>
            <p>This is the great hinge, under God, our ALL is like to turn upon,— If this is kept ſacred, it is certain, Great-Britain can never carry into execution the preſent deſpotic plan of colony adminiſtration, without the ruin of the whole Britiſh empire.—And unleſs the kingdom is ripe for deſtruction, and deſtined to be its own executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner, we may reaſonably preſume ſhe will never be ſo infatuated in the preſent controverſy, as to attempt it by fire and ſword.—</p>
            <p>Should America be urged to the laſt extremity by coercive mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, it is to be hoped we ſhall be found not to have loſt, entirely, the BRAVE SPIRIT which reſted on our Fathers, and that things unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected will in providence turn up in our favour.—</p>
            <p>It was well ſaid, near twenty years ſince, by a writer whoſe general ſentiments are ſufficiently in favour of prerogative meaſures, <hi>We have a thouſand inſtances wherein, the driving people to the laſt ſtreights, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them under the tuition of ſuch a maſter as abſolute neceſſity, has taught them inventions, and excited them to induſtry, which have compaſſed things, as much regretted at laſt, as they were unforeſeen at firſt,</hi>

            <p>It is abſolutely neceſſary, eſpecially, in times of perplexity &amp; danger, to have the beſt men to conduct in public matters.—If the people are not very careful in this inſtance, all attempts will be likely to iſſue in tumult and confuſion; the cauſe meant to be promoted will rather be injured. It is not ſafe for individuals ordinarily to aſſume the management of public affairs. By collecting into promiſcuous multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, they make themſelves important out of place, and miſplacing their reſentments, may make thoſe to become important, who, had they been on the right ſide of the queſtion, could have done no good, and on the wrong, never could have done much hurt.—</p>
            <p>True indeed, it is a <hi>good thing to be zealouſly affected in a good cauſe</hi>— but then, if zeal be not tempered with prudence, and proportioned to its object, it will become the moſt extravagant thing in the world, and it may be expected its effect will be of its own complexion.</p>
            <p>I am far from ſuppoſing inſurrections never do any good, or that they are not <hi>ſometimes</hi> even neceſſary, and as far from condemning in the groſs, every thing that has happened of that ſort, in late trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome times, and much farther yet from thinking there has not been manifeſted a truly patriotic ſpirit, however, it is no reflection to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, in ſome inſtances there may have been a miſtake—matters may have been carried too far, the innocent may have been abuſed—and no wonder, for if <hi>oppreſſion will make a wiſe man mad,</hi> it may be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it will make the inconſiderate and leſs judicious, abſolutely fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic.—However it may have been in regard of theſe things, we are all agreed, that it is of the higheſt importance, that we have at the head of affairs, men of the beſt abilities—and of ſuch we have an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of him ſpeaking in our text.</p>
            <p>Here is the portraiture of the good man, patriot, and hero.</p>
            <p>In his character and conduct we may ſee diſplayed the qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of thoſe rulers calculated to ſtand at helm in the moſt ſtormy ſeaſons.—At ſuch times, eſpecially, are to be ſought out men of good <hi>natural endowments</hi> and <hi>extenſive knowledge,</hi> men of <hi>prudence</hi> and <hi>delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, fortitude</hi> and <hi>reſolution,</hi> men of <hi>benevolence</hi> and a <hi>public ſpirit,</hi> of <hi>integrity, ſincere piety,</hi> and <hi>untainted virtue.</hi>—</p>
            <p>The affairs of ſtate are deep, intricate, and often perplexed; and therefore require men of proportioned abilities, to adjuſt and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:014383_0012_0F926272389B5540"/>
of them into a ſubſerviency of the public good—a native ſtrength of genius, lays a good foundation and gives a hopeful proſpect of an able ruler.—[Where nature has been ſparing of her gifts, it can't be expected a man will make any conſiderable figure in a public ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or be able to conduct affairs to advantage—a diſtinguiſhing judgment, a quick apprehenſion, and a deep penetration into men and things, and eſpecially, matters of ſtate policy, are neceſſary to form the character of one with whom the ſafety of the public is to be truſted in ſpecial exigencies.]</p>
            <p>Nor is it ſufficient, that a man has a good natural genius, his intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuals muſt be improved and cultivated, by application to ſtudy and meditation.—</p>
            <p>As the moſt intereſting concerns of a community are devolved on Rulers, it is neceſſary that intellectual improvement be proportioned thereto. As reaſon and underſtanding give the human race ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority to the brutal creation, and conſtitute in part, that reſemblance to the Deity, in which man was created; ſo eminent degrees of refined reaſon and improved knowledge, not only raiſe a man above the common level, but cauſe him, in public ſtation, to ſhine in a bright reſemblance of the ſupreme ruler of Heaven and Earth, and enable him, in ſome meaſure, to act up to that character with which the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty hath honoured him: <hi>Ye are Gods, and all of you are ſons of the Moſt High.</hi>—[The more extenſive and improved the Stateſman is in knowledge and underſtanding, the greater bleſſing he is like to be, if he improve his knowledge to its proper end.—Rulers, by their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, are the guardians of the people's intereſts and happineſs. It is their buſineſs to ſpy out dangers, to ward off miſchiefs, and apply remedies according as the exigencies of the ſtate require.] The ends of Government can't be ſerved where knowledge is wanting—and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, a defect here, is often, no doubt, the occaſion of great diſtreſs. Agreeable to what the wiſe man obſerves, <hi>the prince that wanteth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, is alſo a great oppreſſor.</hi> They ſhould alſo be men of <hi>pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> and <hi>deliberation</hi>; haſty procedures, raſh concluſions, in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic meaſures, often throw a community into the utmoſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, and diſtreſs.</p>
            <p>Things are ever to be treated with coolneſs and deliberation, according to the difficulty and the importance that attend them. Inconſideration and imprudence are the uſual ſource of miſchief, in common life;—when men act before they think, as they know not what they do, ſo they often have occaſion to regret what they have done, when it is too late to retrieve the miſtake. —By nothing perhaps does a community more frequently ſuffer,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:014383_0013_0F926272EE6A00F8"/>
than by the inconſiderate and imprudent conduct of rulers.— Every ſtep in adminiſtration ſhould be calmly deliberated, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively viewed in all its connections, and, as far as poſſible in all its conſequences; and when the leaders of a people are endowed with this diſpoſition, and exerciſe it, things will be like to go well, or if difficulties and perplexities happen, they will be the ſooneſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed—and, at this day, eſpecially, it is of the higheſt importance that we have men of this complexion to conduct matters—nor will this obſtruct, but rather promote reſolution and fortitude; which our condition eminently calls for.—</p>
            <p>The faithful Ruler may expect in common to meet with that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and perplexity, that will furniſh out matter ſufficient to try his firmneſs; and eſpecially when breakers are at hand: Then, if he is not a man of uncommon firmneſs, he may, thro' ſordid cowardice, ſculk from the helm, and leave the ſhip to daſh againſt the rocks. Far from ſuch a ſpirit was <hi>Nehemiah.</hi> Many difficulties attended his <hi>enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize,</hi> but ſuch was the noble ſpirit he was of, that they animated his reſolutions, and inſpired him with a fortitude ſuperior to them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Benevolence, integrity,</hi> and a <hi>public ſpirit,</hi> are great ornaments to a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic ſtation, and of abſolute neceſſity to denominate any one a good Ruler.—Theſe eminently appeared in the pattern before us.—This Jewiſh Ruler had a pungent ſenſe of the diſtreſſes of his countrymen, for when he received intelligence from <hi>Hanani,</hi> of the <hi>great affliction</hi> they were in, he <hi>ſat down and wept, and mourned, and faſted certain days,</hi> and ſo viſible were the effects of his benevolent feelings, that, from the ſadneſs of his countenance, the King read the deep ſorrow of his heart. Rulers being thus impreſſed with a ſenſe of public diſtreſs, what exertions may not be expected, even to the ſtraining of every nerve?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sincere Piety,</hi> and unſullied <hi>virtue,</hi> in conjunction with the before mentioned inſtances, compleat the character of ſuch men as we wiſh to ſee in place, at this important criſis.—</p>
            <p>Religion is a greater ornament to a public ſtation, than all enſigns of royalty, or marks of external dignity; and gives the greateſt ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of perſevering integrity.—This will ſhed a luſture upon all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther endowments, and command a reſpect and reverence. This was to JOB, <hi>a robe and a diadem</hi>; there are no principles which can give the people ſuch confidence of a good adminiſtration, as principles of real piety;—other principles, ſuch as <hi>honor, public ſpirit, natural bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence,</hi> and <hi>ambition,</hi> it is true, in ſome inſtances have influenced men to do many worthy deeds for the happineſs of the community they
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:014383_0014_0F926275063AD940"/>
ſtood related to—many among the Greeks and Romans, from theſe principles, diſplayed noble inſtances of patriotiſm.—But ſuch are not ſo ſure, nor do they bind in the ſame way, nor to the ſame degree, as principles of religious virtue.—The good man has his mind impreſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a ſenſe of future inviſible objects—he lives and acts under a ſenſe of the omniſcient eye of God, remembers the ſolemn account he muſt give, and the reward he ſhall receive for his conduct: This will be of ſuch powerful influence with him, as to bear down all temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to violate whatever truſt is committed to him, and will be a moſt powerful conſtraint to the greateſt diligence, conſtancy, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity; (influenced by theſe ſublime principles, what a diſtinguiſhed figure as rulers, do <hi>Moſes, Joſhua, Jehoſaphat, David, Solomon, Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah, Joſiah,</hi> and may others make, in the ſacred hiſtory? What zeal for God's glory? what indefatigable induſtry for the public good, did they diſplay?) And beſides, where the fear of God is prevalent with Rulers, it will lead them to exhibit ſuch examples of moral conduct, as will be like to have a happy influence on thoſe below them.—Thoſe that move in exalted ſpheres, are under ſpecial advantages to do good to all around them—for, as their conduct is more carefully obſerved than that of others, ſo there ever has appeared among mankind a diſpoſition to imitate their ſuperiors; hence it is ſo generally found, that under the adminiſtration of vitious and abandoned men, all kinds of debauchery, profaneneſs, and immorality are apt to ride triumphant.—But on the other hand, when men of public character, in civil life, maintain a veneration for religion, are careful in their lives to conform to the rules and precepts of it, virtue will flouriſh, <hi>things excellent will be approved</hi> in general:—What a rich and extenſive bleſſing, then, on this account, may godly men be to thoſe over whom they rule?—In the higheſt reaſon, then, was that good advice to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes founded, not only to <hi>take wiſe men, and underſtanding, and make them rulers, but alſo, to provide, out of all the people, ſuch men as fear God, men of truth, hating covetouſneſs:</hi>—For the ſame reaſon, it is the will of the great Sovereign of the Univerſe, that they who rule, ſhould be <hi>juſt, ruling in the fear of God.</hi>—Of ſuch a character ſhould thoſe ever be, with whom the concerns of the public are entruſted, and eſpecially at the preſent day, when we are not only in great trouble from abroad, but have embaraſſments ariſing from deſigning men among ourſelves.</p>
            <p>This reminds us in the third place,</p>
            <p n="3">IIId, Of the faction mentioned in the paſſage under conſideration. "When <hi>Sanballat, Tobiah,</hi> &amp;c. ſaw it, they laughed us to ſcorn, &amp;c." <hi>Theſe were the leaders of a wicked combination, in oppoſition to the great and
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:014383_0015_0F926276DD8E7F70"/>
good work on foot among the ſuffering Jews.</hi>—From ſelfiſh, ambitious, biggotted principles, they practiſed every artifice, to perplex, defeat, and overthrow the deſign the people were engaged in.—By their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence they excited foreign powers to alarm and diſtreſs the Jews,— revived the old Samaritan reſentments—by falſe accounts, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned miſrepreſentations, by groundleſs accuſations and unmanly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults, they prevailed to raiſe fears, jealouſies and trouble in many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects—in a ſecret manner they ſought the life of <hi>Nehemiah</hi>—howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, ſuch was his reſolution and firmneſs, that all their attempts did not in the leaſt diſhearten him.—But leaving a farther purſuit of this matter, I come to what is of more importance to our caſe, and finiſhes that part of antient ſtory under conſideration.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. <hi>A good reſolution to perſiſt, placed on a ſure and pious baſis, tending to inſpire the greateſt confidence of ſucceſs. "The</hi> GOD <hi>of Heaven he will proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per us, we, his ſervants will ariſe and build;" &amp; a proper treatment of thoſe in the oppoſition;" "you ſhall have no portion, right or memorial in</hi> Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem."</p>
            <p>This was a manly reply to the oppoſing faction. It breathes the ſame excellent ſpirit the three worthies expreſſed when the haughty monarch thought to have awed them into compliance with his adoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous edict, by his angry menaces—"O <hi>Nebuchadnezzer!</hi> We are not careful to anſwer thee in this matter, our GOD whom we ſerve HE is able to deliver us, and HE <hi>will</hi> deliver us out of thine hand O King"! In the like ſpirit and with the ſame humble confidence ſhould we eſpouſe, and perſiſt in maintaining, the liberties and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges of our country. Our cauſe is a good one, it is the cauſe of <hi>religion,</hi> of <hi>liberty,</hi> of our country, and conſequently the cauſe of GOD! If we place a humble and a penitent truſt in the Almighty, we need not fear, <hi>though the ſeas roar and the waves toſs themſelves,</hi> for with HIM are infinite power, wiſdom, goodneſs, juſtice, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs. He hath ſaid, and he will make it good, <hi>If ye be with me. I will be with you,</hi> and, <hi>If</hi> GOD <hi>be for us who can be againſt us?</hi> The Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty "is the hope," and the help "of his people in all genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions." Such are the perfections of his nature, as that he ever has a full acquaintance with the circumſtances of his ſuffering people, ability, and diſpoſition to relieve them, whenever they properly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to him. Our cauſe then we ſhould piouſly refer to him, and quietly wait the event, in the uſe of proper means.</p>
            <p>With reſpect to the treatment of thoſe whom we know to be inimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal to the common cauſe, the paſſage before us gives us inſtruction.</p>
            <p>This ruler does not, it is obſervable, threaten to attack their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons

or property; nor, does he uſe them with indecent language, but treats them with deſerved contempt, and total neglect. This is ſo proper in itſelf, and ſo agreeable to what is recommended by the wiſeſt among us, we hope and wiſh the ſame may be duly attended to, in our own caſe, <hi>ſo far as may conſiſt with</hi> abſolute ſafety.</p>
            <p>Before I come to the concluding part of this diſcourſe, I would enter one or two remarks. The firſt is, that however the day is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with clouds of thick darkneſs, many with fearful expectation may be "looking out after what may ſeem to be haſtening on our nation and land," yet we ought not to <hi>deſpond.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the one hand, to make light of our threatning dangers, would argue ſtupidity; to ſink and faint would argue criminal timidity on the other, enervate every ſpring of action, invite and haſten on the very <hi>death</hi> we fear. There are many things, after all, that wear an encouraging aſpect, for beſides that we have no reaſon to doubt of the righteouſneſs of our cauſe, we have many worthy patrons beyond the Atlantic, who have generouſly eſpouſed, and nobly plead, and no doubt will perſeveringly exert their abilities in our cauſe.</p>
            <p>Among ourſelves, a ſurpriſing union, and that firm reſolution which breathes the ſame ſpirit that reſted on our fathers, influenced them to encounter and vanquiſh the greateſt deaths and dangers, in this, then, an inhoſpitable wilderneſs, in order to purchaſe, and leave ſecured to us, a moſt invaluable inheritance, too precious in itſelf, too dearly bought to be given up on any terms whatſoever, much leſs not to be exchanged for the vileſt ſlavery. In theſe things <hi>the hand of our</hi> GOD <hi>has been good upon us.</hi> So far ſhould any threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning appearances be from diſheartening of us, as that they ſhould rouſe to vigorous exertions, in proportion as they ſeem to encreaſe. This (Heaven be thanked) has hitherto been the caſe, and in him we hope will be, though we ſhould be called to ſpill our blood in our own defence, ſhould there be need. Then, let <hi>The hands that hang down be lifted up, and the feeble knees ſtrengthened.</hi>—But our main ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and confidence is in him <hi>who looketh down from Heaven, and behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all the ſons of men,</hi> is able and ready to vindicate the cauſe of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering innocency, <hi>diſappoint the devices of the crafty, ſo that their hands cannot perform their enterpriſe, and the council of the froward he carrieth headlong.</hi> Let us not be diſmayed, but come and take ſhelter under the <hi>wings of the Almighty, caſt our cares on him,</hi> for <hi>He careth foru.</hi> Mmany a time has he appeared in the mount of difficulty, reſcued our nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and this land eſpecially, from the very brink of ruin. Time

would fail me to mention the inſtances of this which our fathers have told us, and which we have ſeen with our eyes: Let us <hi>Stand firm in the liberty wherewith we have been made free, while we wait for thy ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> O GOD! <hi>as they that watch for the morning! For the mercy of the Lord hath been upon us according as we have hoped in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in order to increaſe and eſtabliſh us in ſuch a humble truſt in GOD, as may afford a well-grounded aſſurance of ſucceſs, it becomes us to ſearch and try our hearts and ways, which have not been right in the ſight of the Lord, and with true penitency to turn to him. Which is the other remark I would make—Have we not by our uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal declenſions, manifold offences, abuſe of divine bleſſings, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked GOD into this ſevere controverſy?</p>
            <p>This was the cauſe of the people's diſtreſs, mentioned in the text: this they frankly acknowledge, in their public confeſſions, prayers and humiliation; and for us not to own it in ours, would argue a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and criminal ſtupidity: By the beſt accounts, we are aſſured, that in <hi>England,</hi> at this day, prevails a moſt awful proſtration of all public, ſocial virtue, and the peculiar graces of chriſtianity, and a fearful prevalence of all kinds of immorality, neglect of GOD, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of ſacred things, and the vileſt abuſe of divine mercy and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience;—a growing debauchery, diſſipation and venality. Very af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting are the accounts we have, concerning the declining ſtate of religion, in <hi>England,</hi> and the awful prevalence of all kinds of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs; and it were to be wiſhed, a heavy charge did not lie againſt this country: But, with bluſhing, we muſt confeſs the contrary. As it concerns the continent in general, to conſider, and be greatly affected in this matter; ſo it becomes us, in this highly favoured colony, to enquire for ourſelves. We have been diſtinguiſhed in religious and civil advantages:—The Chriſtian inſtitution, the laſt, and beſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition of the covenant of grace, we enjoy in its purity and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, and may truly ſay, we have the beſt religion in the world, free from ſuperſtition in its appointments in the holy Sabbaths, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments and miniſtry, and as free from eccleſiaſtical tyranny and perſecution. We have alſo a civil conſtitution, in the hands of good men, the beſt calculated to ſecure our civil liberties: We make our own laws, chooſe our own rulers, and manage our own political mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters among ourſelves. Such indeed has been our happy ſituation, that GOD may juſtly ſay concerning us, <hi>What more could I have done for my vineyard that I have not done in it?</hi> And it were to be wiſhed, we had not given him juſt occaſion to challenge upon us, <hi>Wherefore, when
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:014383_0018_0F92627A6D703B90"/>
I looked that it ſhould bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us aſk, then, what our temper and treatment has been toward GOD, our <hi>rulers,</hi> our <hi>miniſters,</hi> and one another in private life? Have we not <hi>forſaken the</hi> GOD <hi>of our fathers, and lightly eſteemed the rock of our ſalvation?</hi> abuſed his patience, deſpiſed his threatnings, contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his authority, and trampled his laws into the mire? Have we not profaned his Sabbaths, trifled with his ordinances and holy ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, and ſaid, <hi>practically, Depart from us, for we deſire not the knowledge of thy ways.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How have we treated our rulers? Have no groundleſs jealouſies been indulged, unreaſonable clamours raiſed and propagated, at real or ſuppoſed miſtakes, diſhoneſt intrigues practiſed, to the injury, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, of as wiſe and good men as ever ſerved our <hi>republic</hi>?</p>
            <p>Have we highly eſteemed the <hi>Meſſengers of the Lord of Hoſts, for their work's ſake,</hi> and <hi>obeyed the voice of our teachers</hi>?</p>
            <p>With reſpect to one another, as individuals, have things <hi>honeſt, virtuous, juſt, benevolent, and of good report,</hi> been approved and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed? How it is, and has been, with us, in theſe reſpects, perhaps it is better each one ſhould enquire than I ſhould ſay—ſo far as we are, or have been culpable in thoſe regards, we are to conſider our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as having procured the tokens of the divine diſpleaſure we feel and fear. If we are not careful, therefore, by deep penitency, and univerſal amendment, to put away whatever is amiſs among us, we can never have a well-grounded confidence in GOD, for his decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations are, <hi>Amend your ways and your doings, and I will cauſe you to dwell in this place,</hi> otherwiſe, <hi>I will do unto the place which I gave unto you, and unto your fathers, as I have done to</hi> Shiloh—<hi>I will caſt you out of my ſight.</hi> Jer. viii.3, 14, 15.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now put an end to this diſcourſe in the addreſſes uſual on ſuch occaſions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>May it pleaſe your Honor, and the other Gentlemen of the General Court.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You ſee the diſtreſs we are in, the thickeſt cloud we ever ſaw now impends our nation, and wears the moſt threatning aſpect on theſe American colonies. You are raiſed to places of public truſt, at a moſt important criſis. The moſt vigorous exertion of your beſt abilities, in the defence of the liberties and privileges of your country, againſt lawleſs power, and tyrannical encroachments, are called for.</p>
            <p>We doubt not you have a pungent ſenſe of the common misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of the day, and in a view of them are ready to break forth in that patriotic language, <hi>O</hi> ſuffering and oppreſſed <hi>Jeruſalem! We
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:014383_0019_0F92627F585990F8"/>
prefer thee above our chief joy, all they ſhall proſper that love thee, for our brethren and companions ſake, we will ſay, peace be within thy walls, and plenteouſneſs within thy palaces:</hi> At ſuch a critical juncture, <hi>We will not forget thee; O! pray for the peace of</hi> Jeruſalem!</p>
            <p>In confidence of your unſhaken attachment to the religion and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of your country, the eyes of all this people wait on you as the guardians, under GOD, of their injured and endangered rights. While you lead in our public affairs, the people, we truſt, will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low and ſupport you, in every wiſe method you ſhall concert for the public ſafety, at the riſk of their lives and fortunes; for they have <hi>Strengthened their hands to this good work</hi>; and the ſpirit they are of is properly expreſſed in the language of the text, <hi>Come, let us build and be no more a reproach</hi>: You will then encourage your hearts, and the hearts of the people, with a ſpirit like that of this Jewiſh ruler, in the text. You will riſe ſuperior to every danger and temptation, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play a noble fortitude in ſo righteous a cauſe, and ſo <hi>good a work</hi>; no doubt every valuable accompliſhment you are poſſeſſed of, as men, chriſtians and rulers, will be ſufficiently put to trial, eſpecially your <hi>wiſdom, prudence</hi> and <hi>firmneſs.</hi> Stimulated from a regard to the glory of GOD, a proſpect of being inſtrumental of delivering your country, ſecuring to yourſelves, your people, and future poſterity, the moſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable poſſeſſions that are ſtruck at, you will exhibit ſpecimens of zeal, conſtancy, integrity, and perſevering reſolution: Hereby, at leaſt, you will ſecure the pleaſures of ſelf-approbation, the teſtimony of your conſtituents, and the final plaudit of your Supreme Judge.</p>
            <p>[The example from whence we have ſpecified the qualifications of men much needed in public ſtations at this ſeaſon will have its proper influence with you.]</p>
            <p>The people reſt entirely ſatisfied in the meaſures that have already been taken, for the common ſecurity, in the late dangerous times, and I preſume I may, in the name of the public, return thanks to the Aſſembly, in particular, for their care to put the militia into a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per condition, and to revive a martial ſpirit. If this be purſued, we ſhall, no doubt, in a little time, be able to make a very reſpectable figure that way. An approved author, years ago, ſpeaking of <hi>New-England,</hi> ſaid, "and certainly if thoſe men were ſomewhat regularly trained, it would be impoſſible to find, in any country, or at any time, antient or modern, an army better conſtituted than that which <hi>New-England</hi> can afford."<note n="*" place="bottom">Page 643 of <hi>Guthrie</hi> continued.</note> What would the ſame writer have ſaid on a view of our preſent numbers, and ſurpriſing improvement, in the military art?</p>

               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:014383_0020_0F926283DDA11D10"/>What future meaſures are to be taken in point of political pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, are entirely ſubmitted to your <hi>wiſdom</hi>; your tim<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, no doubt, will be principally taken up in the common cauſe; yet the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar intereſts of this Colony will have as much of your attention as can be ſpared—what gievances there are among us that need redreſs, your Honors much better underſtand than I.—</p>
            <p>Religion and public virtue, in every view, are objects of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt importance; they will therefore command your firſt and greateſt attention: Your power, and the influence of your example, will be employed to encourage religion, and every ſocial virtue; to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs vice and immorality, in whatever form they may appear.—We aſk your influence for the ſupport and encouragement of a pious and learned Miniſtry.—The College in this colony we alſo recommend to your patronage.—That ſeminary has flouriſhed of late, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, I am told, its funds are low, and on that account ſuffers.— Could ſupplies be handed in, for the repairs of its buildings, and the better ſupport of its inſtructors, it would be rendered a greater bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Church and State.—The public are under obligations grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to acknowlege the goodneſs of the General Aſſembly, in paſt favours for the encouragement of inferior ſchools, the good effects, of which are pretty generally felt; could any thing farther be done at preſent, it would be a public benefit.—</p>
            <p>You live in a changeable world. Whatever diſtinctions there are among men in this world, they will ſoon be laid aſide.—They that are the greateſt here, muſt be brought down to the grave, and mingle with plebian duſt. <hi>I ſaid, ye are Gods, but ye ſhall die like men.</hi>" Rulers are notified of this in the courſe of providence, as well as in God's word. Every year brings recent inſtances.—Here I muſt not forget to bear a due teſtimony to the memory of the <hi>Honorable Thomas Fitch,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> who, for ſeveral years, ſerved this colony in the chair, for his uncommon abilities, and many faithful ſervices to this community, and the very reſpectable character he ſuſtained: in every view, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves to be had in everlaſting remembrance.—The removal, by death, of ſo great and good a man, tho' he came to his grave in a good old age, ſhould be noticed by all, and, eſpecially, by thoſe in public ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; the improvement you will make of it will be, to excite your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to greater diligence and fidelity, as <hi>Rulers</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>GENTLEMEN,</p>
            <p>We wiſh you all that light and divine communication from the father of lights, and fountain of divine conſolation, you need in this
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:014383_0021_0F926285B59B8E78"/>
diſtreſſing day; and that when theſe robes of honour that you now wear, ſhall be laid aſide, you may receive a diſtinguiſhed crown, which ſhall never fade away.—</p>
            <p>In the next place, this addreſs is directed to, My <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Brethren</hi> in the Miniſtry.</p>
            <p>Such are the alarming aſpects of Divine Providence, at this day, as in all reaſon ſhould rouſe us to a moſt painful application in the great and arduous truſt committed to us.—As members of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, our intereſts are at ſtake as well as others—whatever, therefore, is proper for us to do in our places, ſhould be diligently attended to; we ſhould encourage our people, and animate them to ſtand firm in the liberties wherewith GOD, NATURE, and CHRISTIANITY have made them FREE, and never thro' fear of ſuffering loſs, or any temptation, baſely give up the rights of Men and Chriſtians; for, as on the one hand, he that in this way, <hi>ſhall ſeek to ſave his life, ſhall loſe it</hi>; ſo on the other, <hi>he that ſhall loſe his life,</hi> in religiouſly ſupporting ſo good a cauſe, <hi>ſhall find it,</hi> and in the end <hi>ſhall receive an hundred fold.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A zeal, tempered with prudence, under the direction of ſuitable men at the head of affairs, in oppoſition to raſh attempts, and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited tumults, ſhould be inculcated—and above all, we ſhould urge a ſpeedy and a univerſal repentance, as abſolutely neceſſary in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to a well grounded hope of ſucceſs, in the all wiſe and gracious providence of God.—It is very affecting, that under ſuch awful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes of Heaven, there ſhould be prevalent a ſpirit of carnal ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.—We ſhould then <hi>blow the trumpet in Zion, and ſound an alarm in God's holy mountain</hi>—tell his people it is now high time <hi>to awake out of ſleep, and lay hold on God their Maker.</hi>—Let us then, by our prayers, our teachings, examples, and political exhortations, do what God and our people have a right to expect of us—and if God ſhould ſmile upon our faithful endeavours, we may be inſtrumental of ſaving our country from impending ruin, and the ſouls of our charges from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal deſtruction; or ſhould our labours be in vain in regard of theſe ends, we ſhould at leaſt <hi>ſave our own ſouls, and be found glorious in the eyes of the Lord.</hi>—A word to this great Aſſembly of people, and I have done.</p>
            <p>BRETHREN, and FELLOW-CITIZENS,</p>
            <p>We rejoice to ſee the return of this anniverſary, tho' it is with trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling. Whether this colony will ever be favoured with another, or if it ſhould, what diſtreſſes this year may bring to view, Heaven only knows! and indeed, it is not our buſineſs to pry into futurity, or
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:014383_0022_0F92628677DB06C8"/>
diſquiet ourſelves about what may be. <hi>That eagerneſs of looking farther than we can ſee, (ſo natural to us) hath a powerful tendency to miſlead us unhappily.—Dangers which we think we diſcern at a diſtance, may have no reality, or if they have, may never draw near; dangers that are near, may never reach us: And evils that have reached us, may vaniſh on a ſudden.— Theſe,</hi> ſays one, <hi>are no reaſons againſt prudent forecaſt, but they are ſtrong reaſons againſt extracting wretchedneſs out of ſpeculations on futurity, inſtead of following quietly and chearfully the proper buſineſs of the preſent day, ſince</hi> we know not what another may bring forth.—Putting away ſuch anxiety, it is of the higheſt importance that the people be ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, firm and reſolute; and eſpecially, that they be united in every wiſe method, at this critical turn of affairs.—We are not to be afraid to eſpouſe and maintain our juſt rights.—Government is founded in mutual compact;—what induced mankind originally to form ſuch compacts was, the better ſecurity of the means of their happineſs:— When this end is kept in view, and only purſued, obedience is due to the civil magiſtrate; but when this end is counteracted, Rulers pervert their authority, to plunder and rob the public; the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity on all the principles of ſelf-preſervation, and divine revelation, have right not only to complain, but ariſe in oppoſition to the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſor, and recover their ſtate.—If theſe principles cannot be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, neither can the glorious revolution be juſtified, nor tyranny ever oppoſed. We are then not to give up our eſſential rights to any arbitrary claims whatever.—And while we are determined nobly to contend for our precious privileges, we muſt be careful we don't run into riots, and crumble into parties among ourſelves, or under a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of zeal for our country, revenge private injuries, and ſeek perſonal preferments.—</p>
            <p>Finally, Let us ſpeedily <hi>break off our ſins by righteouſneſs, and our iniquities by turning unto the Lord</hi>;—place our entire confidence in his almighty arm, and ſeek his divine patronage, for <hi>his is the glory and the kingdom, and the victory, and the majeſty,</hi> to whom be glory forever, AMEN.</p>
