            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>PSALM XLVII. 8, 9.</bibl>
               <q>—GOD ſitteth upon the throne of his holineſs: The Princes of the people are gathered together, even the people of the GOD of <hi>Abraham;</hi> for the Shields of the earth belong unto GOD: He is greatly exalted,</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>AT what time, or upon what occaſion, the Pſalm before us was compoſed, is neither certain, nor eaſy, at this diſtance of time, to determine.—"Many have ſuppoſed it to have been pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, on occaſion of bringing up the <hi>Ark</hi> to <hi>Mount Zion.</hi>"—Others, "that it looks further, and is prophetick of the aſcenſion of the <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Mediator,</hi> after he had finiſhed his work on earth, and the ſetting up his kingdom in the world."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:017114_0005_0FA02F5C6AC36B10"/>
FROM the ſentiments it contains, it might alſo be conſidered as a Pſalm compoſed, and well adapted, for the congregation of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when all the tribes came to <hi>Hebron</hi> to receive <hi>David,</hi> and by their <hi>elders</hi> to <hi>make a league with him,</hi> as their <hi>chief magiſtrate;</hi> and to eſtabliſh him in the government.<note n="a" place="bottom">Vid. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5. 1, 2, 3.</note>
            </p>
            <p>BUT, which, or whether either of theſe ſuppoſitions hath any ſolid foundation, muſt be left to the learned and judicious to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.—Be the primary occaſion, of this <hi>devout compoſition,</hi> what it may; it is beyond diſpute, that the ſubjects of it are intereſting and important:—Subjects well ſuited to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire the church and people of GOD, at all times, with a ſenſe of his government and their dependence, and of their indiſpenſible obligations to celebrate the glories of his perfections, herein diſplayed, as the ground of their confidence and theme of their praiſe.</p>
            <p>IN a word, it is an exhortation to <hi>the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of GOD,</hi> to praiſe the LORD, as "<hi>The Great King over all the earth,</hi>" who ſhould <hi>ſubdue the people,</hi> their enemies and oppreſſors <hi>under them, and the nations under their feet:</hi> And as that GOD, who ſhould <hi>chooſe their inheritance for them,</hi> and eſtabliſh them in the quiet poſſeſſion and enjoyment of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:017114_0006_0FA02F5D9AF7C730"/>
AGREEABLY, in confirmation of this their confidence, it is ſaid, in the text—That <hi>GOD ſitteth upon the throne of his holineſs: The Princes of the people are gathered together, even the people of the GOD of</hi> Abraham; <hi>for the Shields of the earth belong unto GOD: He is greatly exalted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN theſe words, we have a ſtriking repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation,—a lively portrait of the happy ſtate of a people, or nation, in covenant with GOD, and favoured with his protection and ſmiles; of a people eſtabliſhed in the enjoyment of the bleſſings of a <hi>civil government,</hi> whoſe conſtitution is founded in principles of liberty and equity, whoſe laws are adminiſtred with juſtice and righteouſneſs, and whoſe end is the glory of GOD, in the good of mankind. <hi>The Great GOD,</hi> as the ſovereign, the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme ruler, <hi>ſitting on the throne of his holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> with all the powers of government, originally and ultimately, veſted in himſelf, and exerciſed by him, agreeable to the eternal laws of righteouſneſs and equity.—<hi>The Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the people,</hi> their leaders, or deligates, <hi>are gathered together,</hi> from all parts of the land, in the name of their conſtituents, and under the direction and influence of their ſupreme ruler and ſovereign, to conſult the public weal, to enact laws and to tranſact the great affairs of the nation and of government. The people, the body of the nation, are there introduced, as <hi>The people of the GOD of
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:017114_0007_0FA02F5DEDA103D8"/>
Abraham,</hi> in covenant with him, and devout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acknowledging their fealty to him, as their ſovereign, and their dependence upon him and his bleſſing, both for counſel and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. And in fine, that nothing might be wanting to compleat the view, we have <hi>The Shields of the earth,</hi> repreſenting both the powers of government and the perſons veſted with them, exhibited, as <hi>belonging to GOD,</hi> religiouſly devoted to his ſervice and glory, or under his direction and controul, to carry to effect the purpoſes of his benevolence and wiſdom for the good of his people, or the deſigns of his juſtice and righteouſneſs in the government of the world.—The whole is intended to ſhow—'That magiſtracy, or civil government, is of divine inſtitution—'That the end of it is the good of the governed—and 'That, as all power and all authority are derived from him, the glory of all ſhould redound to his name; to the end, that <hi>GOD,</hi> who <hi>ſitteth on the throne might be greatly exalted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THAT GOD, who created and preſerves, of right, doth govern the world, is a truth, which the light of nature teaches, which revelation confirms, and a truth, which the common ſenſe of mankind in all ages, concurs to eſtabliſh.</p>
            <p>THAT the power, authority and ſovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of GOD are abſolute and uncontroulable is a truth juſtly deducible from the preceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and equally indiſputable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:017114_0008_0FA02F5F230DDC98"/>
THE ſacred ſcriptures are far from being ſilent, or doubtful, upon a ſubject ſo funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental, ſo important. We frequently find all the powers of moral government, in the higheſt ſenſe, ſolemnly aſſumed by GOD, or devoutly aſcribed unto him, in the divine oracles. Hence GOD is introduced by the holy prophet, as ſaying, "I am the LORD, and there is none elſe; there is no GOD beſides me. I form the light and create darkneſs: I make peace and create evil: I the LORD do all theſe things."<note n="a" place="bottom">Iſai. 45 5. 7.</note> "I will work, and who ſhall let it?"<note n="b" place="bottom">Ibid. 43, 13</note>—And to ſhow the vanity of oppugnation to his government or authority, it is added,—"Let the potſherd ſtrive with the potſherds of the earth: But wo to him that ſtriveth with his maker."<note n="c" place="bottom">Ibid. 45 9.</note>
            </p>
            <p>AND what GOD hath thus juſtly aſſumed, is devoutly aſcribed to him by his ſaints and people; and frequently mentioned as the ground of their confidence, as well as the reaſon of their ſubmiſſion.—At all times, yea, even in times of perplexity and darkneſs, it was the language of GOD's people—"The LORD reigneth, let the earth rejoice"<note n="d" place="bottom">Pſal. 97. 1.</note>—"The LORD is our judge, the LORD is our law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver, the LORD is our king; He will ſave us."<note n="e" place="bottom">Iſai.</note> Holy <hi>David</hi> obſerves, that "the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is the LORD's, and he is governor among the nations."<note n="f" place="bottom">Pſal. 22. 28.</note> and to add no more, it is
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:017114_0009_0FA02F5F685B7B60"/>
ſaid—That "The LORD ſitteth King for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever:"<note n="a" place="bottom">Pſal. 29, 10.</note> And, that "His Kingdom ruleth over all."<note n="b" place="bottom">103, 19.</note>
            </p>
            <p>IN this light conſidered, the Deity is to be acknowledged, as that GOD, whoſe power and authority are ſupreme, univerſal and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controulable.</p>
            <p>IT is not, however, authority or power alone, that forms the character, or gives an idea of the great moral governor of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe; but this power, and this authority, as tempered with wiſdom, goodneſs, juſtice, truth, faithfulneſs, and other moral perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons neceſſary to a government founded in equity, exerciſed in righteouſneſs, glorious to himſelf and a bleſſing to his creatures.</p>
            <p>IT would have been eaſy to an infinite being, to have carried to effect the purpoſes of his government, by the influences of his ſpirit, or the word of his power; but, for wiſe reaſons, the ſupreme Ruler <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ath been pleaſed to employ angels and men, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

It is both natural and rational to ſuppoſe, that government ſubſiſts among intelligent beings, of whatever rank, or degree in creation.</p>
            <p>THIS conjecture is the more probable, with regard to the heavenly hoſts, and thoſe bright intelligencies, who inhabit the celeſtial abodes, and are favoured with the neareſt approaches unto GOD, from the account the ſacred ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles have given; of the various names, orders and degrees ſubſiſting among them; as <hi>Angels, Arch-angels, Thrones, Dominions, Principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> and <hi>Powers.</hi>

            <p>SOMETHING of this kind, alſo, would, undoubtedly, have been advantageous, if not neceſſary, to have perfected the felicity of mankind, had they continued in a ſtate of innocence and rectitude: And for the order, harmony and happineſs of ſociety and the world, it is reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that rule and government would have taken place among men, however virtuous, benevolent, or juſt.</p>
            <p>THE ſtill greater importance of ſuch an inſtitution to the peace, liberty, ſafety and happineſs of individuals, of ſociety and the world of mankind, ſince ſin, luſt, paſſion, imperfection and every evil work have been introduced, needs neither time to conſider, nor arguments to prove.</p>

WERE there no civil government, laws, magiſtracy, nor <hi>Shields of the earth,</hi> for the preſervation of peace, the guard of liberty, the protection of property and the defence of life, it is eaſy to ſee, and, without a ſpirit of propheſy, to foretell, what the event muſt be:—that anarchy, confuſion, blood and ſlaughter, waſte and deſtruction, would ſoon take place in the earth.—The weak would be devoured by the ſtrong, the innocent, like <hi>righteous Abel,</hi> would become an eaſy prey to the vicious, abandoned and ambitious:—and the longeſt ſword muſt quickly determine the fate of mankind.</p>
            <p>HENCE it appears, I had almoſt ſaid, to a demonſtration, that, under GOD, the ſupreme ruler, this wiſe inſtitution of <hi>civil government,</hi> this richeſt of temporal bleſſings to mankind, takes its riſe from <hi>Neceſſity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT is true, reaſon teaches the propriety, convenience points out the advantages, and all the ſocial affections concur to urge the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of civil government. But however engaging or intereſting theſe arguments might appear, to the wiſe, the benevolent, or judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, they would be, at beſt, but a feeble ſupport to the peace and order of ſociety,—would never have availed to eſtabliſh govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, over the lawleſs luſts of vicious, aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, or blood-thirſty men.—It is <hi>Neceſſity, Neceſſity alone,</hi> which combines men in
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:017114_0012_0FA02F655E03E238"/>
ſociety, and gives riſe to civil government. And had not mankind been effectually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of <hi>this neceſſity,</hi> and taught to realize that there was no living without it, it is very much a doubt, whether ever ſuch an inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would have taken place in the world.</p>
            <p>THIS Neceſſity, in a great meaſure at leaſt, is founded in and takes riſe from the luſts, the corruptions and vices of mankind.</p>
            <p>'TIS not indeed pretended, that any one man, or any number of men, have any natural right of ſuperiority, or inherent claim of domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, or governmental authority over any other man, or body of men.—All men, by nature, are <hi>free, equal</hi> and <hi>independent,</hi> in this matter. It is in compact—<hi>in compact alone,</hi> that all juſt government is founded.</p>
            <p>THE firſt ſteps, in entering into ſociety and toward the eſtabliſhment of civil government among a people, is the forming, agreeing to, and ratifying an <hi>original compact,</hi> for the regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the State, deſcribing and determining the mode, departments and powers of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the rights, privileges and duties of the ſubjects.</p>
            <p>THIS ſhould be done by the whole body of the people; or by princes, leaders, or dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates, by their choice, appointment, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:017114_0013_0FA02F6573756E70"/>
THIS right in the people, whether emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging from a ſtate of nature, or the yoke of oppreſſion, is <hi>an unalienable right</hi>—a right which cannot be given up by a people, even though ever ſo much inclined to ſell or ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice it.—Yea, ſhould a people be ſo loſt to themſelves, as, upon any conſideration, to give it up, it may juſtly be <hi>re-claimed,</hi> at leaſt by the next generation, who cannot be ſuppoſed to be deprived of <hi>their birth-right,</hi> becauſe their progenitors, like <hi>Eſau,</hi> deſpiſed and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with theirs.</p>
            <p>WHILE the <hi>ſocial compact</hi> ſubſiſts, the whole ſtate, and all its members, are bound by it:—a ſacred regard ought to be paid to it. No man, order, or body of men, in the ſtate, have any right, power, or authority, to alter, change, or violate the ſocial compact. Nor can any change, alteration, or amendment, be lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly introduced, but by common conſent. Any and every attempt of this kind, endangers the whole.</p>
            <p>IT remains, however, with the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſtate, or nation, as a public, <hi>political body,</hi> at any time, at pleaſure, to change, alter, or even totally diſſolve the conſtitution, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to a ſtate of nature, or to form anew, as to them ſhall ſeem meet.</p>
            <p>THESE principles admitted, it is evident <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

<pb n="11" facs="unknown:017114_0014_0FA02F6641566840"/>
great or good;—no ſtate, nation, or power on earth, hath any right to make or impoſe a conſtitution of government upon another ſtate or nation: Such a conſtitution, however free, is a <hi>mark</hi> of dependence, a <hi>badge of ſlavery,</hi> the moſt diſtant thought of which the high ſpirit of a free people would juſtly deſpiſe.</p>
            <p>EQUALITY and INDEPENDENCE are the <hi>juſt claim,</hi> the <hi>indefeaſible birth-right</hi> of men:—In a ſtate of nature, as individuals; in ſociety, as ſtates or nations.—Nothing ſhort of theſe ever did, or ever will ſatisfy a man or a people, <hi>truly free, truly brave.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>TRUE it is, a conquered nation is obliged to ſubmit to the terms, the laws, the conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or is pleaſed to impoſe: But this being matter of compulſion and not of choice, alters not the right. The claim to liberty and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence remains the ſame. When opportunity offers, and power is attained, it is, beyond diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, the <hi>duty,</hi> as well as right, of ſuch a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, of ſuch a nation, to aſſert their <hi>native li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,</hi> to ſhake off the <hi>tyrant'</hi>s yoke, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their equality and independence among the nations; and either reſume their former, or eſtabliſh a new conſtitution of government, as they ſhall judge beſt.</p>
            <p>UPON the whole, this is a right, the viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or infringement of which, upon any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration whatever, no man can juſtify upon
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:017114_0015_0FA02F66E9967C00"/>
the principles of reaſon, the laws of nature, or rules of equity.—Even GOD himſelf, the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme ruler of the world, whoſe government is abſolute and uncontroulable, hath ever paid a ſacred attention to this <hi>important right;</hi> hath ever patroniſed this <hi>intereſting claim</hi> in the ſons of men.</p>
            <p>THE only conſtitution of civil government that can plead its origin, as immediately from heaven, is, <hi>The Theocracy of the Hebrews.</hi> But even this form of government, though dictated by <hi>infinite wiſdom,</hi> and wrote with the <hi>finger of</hi> GOD, was laid before his people for their conſideration, and ratified, introduced and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed by their common conſent.</p>
            <p>WHAT form of government will anſwer the beſt purpoſes to ſociety, and moſt effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally diſplay the glory of the ſupreme Ruler, in the good of mankind, is a queſtion truly deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and important; and a queſtion, which, in the hand of a <hi>maſterly politician,</hi> might admit of a diſcuſſion both intereſting and entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But as neither time, nor capacity, will permit me to enter largely into ſo high and critical a ſubject; it ſhall ſuffice to obſerve,—</p>
            <p>THAT a little acquaintance with the world and the hiſtory of mankind, in the ſeveral a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges paſt, will clearly decide, that no one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, or form of civil government, can be ſuppoſed to be equally adopted to anſwer the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:017114_0016_0FA02F67BAF4FCB0"/>
beſt purpoſes of ſuch an inſtitution, in every ſociety, nation or ſtate.</p>
            <p>THAT in the riſe and progreſs of ſociety, different modes of government have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted and introduced, at different ſtages and ſucceſſive periods, cannot be doubted.—And whether there hath not been, in many inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, at leaſt, a gradation in the modes of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, keeping pace with the progreſs of ſociety, in the ſeveral ages of the world, ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar to that gradation, which is eaſily obſerved in the ſeveral ſtages and periods of human life; is a queſtion, with all deference, ſubmitted to the candor and judgment of this reſpectable aſſembly.</p>
            <p>AT firſt ſight, indeed, this circumſtance may not have been obſerved; nor can it be ſaid to have been the caſe, without many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions.

            <p>IT is not, indeed, pretended, that this hath been ſtatedly or literally the caſe, with nations that have entered into ſociety, and eſtabliſhed civil government in the world.—But whether, in the riſe and progreſs of ſociety, and the modes of government which have been adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by mankind, ſomething of this kind hath not appeared, in various inſtances?

CERTAIN it is, that as different ſocieties and ſtates may require different modes of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; ſo the ſame ſocieties or nations may require different conſtitutions, at diſtinct and diſtant periods and ſtages of their exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>

            <p>UPON the whole, the propriety or impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of this or that conſtitution or mode of
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:017114_0020_0FA02F6BFAF984D8"/>

            <p>MYSTERIES in government, <hi>ſecrets of ſtate,</hi>—thoſe <hi>Arcana Imperii,</hi> by which the artful and ambitious have inſlaved the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er part of mankind, are totally abhorrent to all principles of liberty, and naturally tend to ſap the foundations of civil government, in a free commonwealth.</p>
            <p>A people have an <hi>unalienable</hi> right to know the conſtitution they enjoy, the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment they are under, the laws they are ſubject to, and what is juſtly expected and required of them as ſubjects.</p>
            <p>NEXT to a good conſtitution, therefore, the <hi>laws of the land</hi> are the inheritance of the people.—All laws ſhould bear a reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance and carry the features, of the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution; being deduced from its principles and founded in its maxims. And, if I may be allowed the expreſſion, the laws ſhould flow from the conſtitution, as the ſtreams from
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:017114_0021_0FA02F6D2F4B8B40"/>
fountain, and even <hi>grow out of it,</hi> as the tree from the root, or the branches from the ſtock.</p>
            <p>IT is alſo neceſſary to the well-being of ſociety, that laws be adapted to the ſtate and neceſſities of a people, and to the circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and exigencies of the community.</p>
            <p>IT is of no ſmall importance to the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the ſubject, as well as the ſupport of governmental authority, in a free common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, that laws be as few in number, and as plain, conciſe and expreſſive, in their form, as poſſible.</p>
            <p>IT hath been often ſaid, 'The more laws, the leſs government.'—The inſtitutions of <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> the great founder of civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in <hi>Sparta,</hi> and the laws of <hi>Solon,</hi> the wiſe lawgiver of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> under the happy influence of which thoſe ſtates, from ſmall beginnings, roſe to the heighth of ſtrength and glory, were few, plain, conciſe and expreſſive.</p>
            <p>WHEN laws become numerous, or volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous, it indicates the decline of virtue, the weakneſs of government and increaſe of vice.—For laws, taking life from neceſſity, hold up to view the vices, or crimes, they are intended to ſuppreſs, as the reaſon of their exiſtence.—Several ages paſſed, in the republick of <hi>Rome,</hi> before any law exiſted

            <p>I only add, that to render laws effectual, to the purpoſes of their exiſtence, it hath ever been the care of the wiſeſt legiſlators, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in <hi>free ſtates,</hi> to have ſuch penalties annexed as are, not only apportioned to the malignity, but, as near as poſſible, expreſſive of the nature, of the crimes they are intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to puniſh, or ſuppreſs.<note n="a" place="bottom">Whether the multiplying ſanguinary laws and capital puniſhments, in a ſtate, can be juſtified upon the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of equity, or even ſound policy, is a queſtion not unworthy the attention of wiſe legiſlators.—And whether puniſhing certain offenders, with loſs of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and hard labour, <hi>at the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>BUT laws, however good in themſelves, or wiſely adapted to the ſtate and neceſſities of a people, can be of but little advantage, unleſs duly obſerved and carried to effect. Hence the neceſſity of appointing certain perſons to be rulers, of inveſting them with power and cloathing them with authority, to adminiſter government, and carry the laws into execution.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:017114_0023_0FA02F6F395FE978"/>
CIVIL government, duly eſtabliſhed and organized, is fitly compared to a <hi>Shield,</hi> as it is inſtituted for the defence and protection of the ſubjects and the ſtate. And hence rulers and magiſtrates, being veſted and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with the powers of government, are, with great propriety termed <hi>Shields of the earth,</hi> in the words of our text.—And as the powers of government give exiſtence to the ruler, to the magiſtrate: So it is with rulers and magiſtrates to give life to the conſtitution and energy to the laws, by a faithful admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration.</p>
            <p>GOOD and faithful rulers are raiſed above their brethren, to places of honour, truſt and authority, not for themſelves, but for the people, and the good of ſociety. They are intruſted with ſeveral powers of government, that individuals may be protected and defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in their life, liberty, property and rights—that the internal peace and order of ſociety might be preſerved; and that the external defence, of the whole, againſt the encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, violence, aſſaults, or invaſions of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, or oppreſſors, might effectually be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for.</p>
            <p>IN this way, wiſe and faithful rulers are <hi>Shields</hi> to the ſtate, and <hi>Shields of the earth;</hi> as by this happy inſtitution, under their admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration, the wiſdom and ſtrength of the whole ſtate, may, at any time, be collected in
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:017114_0024_0FA02F6FFB6AEC18"/>
defence of the public, or of any part of the community, as occaſion may require. And thus every member is engaged for the peace, ſafety and defence of the ſtate; and the whole for the peace, ſafety and protection of every member: For theſe obligations are mutual, and equally ſacred and binding.</p>
            <p>IN this light conſidered, rulers, by accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſeat or an office in government, are fitly ſaid to pledge themſelves, their faith and ſacred honour, and that in the moſt ſolemn manner, to the people for their fidelity: and to them are they accountable.</p>
            <p>BUT there is another argument, of yet higher importance, ſuggeſted in our text, which demands the attention of rulers of whatever ſtation; and may not be paſſed over in ſilence.</p>

            <p>THE fear of GOD, the ſentiments of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the approbation of their own minds, the acceptance of their judge and the rewards of his kingdom, are ſufficient to ſupport them under every weight, and to excite them to fidelity and perſeverance, under every diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement.—Neither the frowns of the great, nor the flatteries of the multitude; nor yet, <hi>the more pleaſing charms of future promotion,</hi> will ever be permitted to influence the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, or direct the conduct of the <hi>faithful ruler,</hi> acting under the influence of thoſe exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

            <p>A ſacred regard to the conſtitution, a cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful obedience to the laws and a reverend ſubmiſſion to the authority of thoſe who are veſted with the powers of government, are as much the duty of ſubjects, even in free ſtates, as it is of rulers to be faithful to the truſt repoſed in them by the people.

            <p>THE beſt conſtitution, the wiſeſt laws, and the moſt faithful rulers are all in vain to a perverſe, reſtleſs, factious, remiſs or diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient people.</p>

            <p>THIS ſentiment is evidently ſuggeſted in the words of our text.—<hi>The people,</hi> whoſe <hi>princes</hi> are here introduced as gathered together to conſult for the common good, and tranſact the public affairs for the government and defence of the nation;—<hi>The people,</hi> whoſe rulers are here termed <hi>ſhields of the earth,</hi> and juſtly ſaid to <hi>belong unto GOD;</hi> In a word, <hi>the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> in whoſe ſettled government and flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtate, GOD, the ſupreme ruler, is ſaid to be greatly exalted, are fitly ſtiled <hi>the people of the GOD of Abraham,</hi>—a people in covenant with GOD.—A people of his fear—of his praiſe.—A people deeply impreſſed with a ſenſe of the Deity, his government and providence; and a people who cordially acknowledge their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon him and their indiſpenſible ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations to fear and obey him, and to preſerve and exerciſe a ſacred regard to his worſhip, and to the doctrines and duties of that holy religion, which he had taught by his word.</p>

            <p>IN all the free ſtates of <hi>Greece</hi> and the great <hi>Republic of Rome,</hi> the regard that was paid to the worſhip of the gods and the rites of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, was conſtant, punctual and expenſive; and in many inſtances, eſpecially on great oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, roſe to the height of ſuperſtition. And no affair of importance to the liberty of the people, or the ſafety of the ſtate, in peace or war, was undertaken, without a religious ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of their dependance upon hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and the influence of the gods.</p>
            <p>"THE great CAMILLUS who was twice ſaluted 'The Deliverer of his country,' to awaken in his fellow-citizens a ſenſe of the importance of religion, appealed to the <hi>Romans</hi> whether they ever had better ſucceſs than

            <p>THE truth is, religion, more eſpecially as taught by the word of GOD, and enforced by the powerful arguments and engaging motives of the goſpel of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> is the ſource of liberty, the ſoul of government and the life of a people.—Its doctrines are ſublime, its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts excellent, its motives perſuaſive and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearing, and its rewards rich, glorious and all divine,</p>
            <p>RELIGION inſpires the ſoul with the nobleſt ſentiments, inflames the heart with the pureſt affections, and forms the man for every virtue,—for every ſervice, which GOD or his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try may either expect or require.</p>
            <p>ITS benevolent precepts are all contained in <hi>love to GOD</hi> and <hi>love to man.</hi> And where
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:017114_0041_0FA02F806EB32F58"/>
this divine affection takes place, inſpires the ſoul, warms the heart, influences the temper and governs the conduct; piety to GOD, and juſtice and charity to men, will mark, diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh and dignify the character. And the ſame divine principle, penetrating the hearts of the various orders of men in ſociety, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading the ſtate, cannot fail producing the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſt effects.—Vice and immorality, wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and unrighteouſneſs, in every form, in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very character, will ſoon diſappear: And juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, temperance, truth and lov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>,—every vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, every grace which adorns human nature, or tends to the peace and happineſs of ſociety, will quickly take their place.</p>
            <p>UNDER the ſacred energy of ſo god-like a principle, rulers will become <hi>true patriots, real benefactors;</hi> the people willing and obedient ſubjects: And all orders of men will moſt cheerfully concur in every meaſure which wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom can dictate for the common good.</p>
            <p>IN a word, religion among a people, in its power, purity and governing influence, is the guardian of liberty, the ſtrength of government, the energy of laws, the band of ſociety, and both the glory and defence of the ſtate.</p>
            <p>IN times of proſperity, a people, that have made GOD their fear, and religion their care, may reſt aſſured of the eſtabliſhment and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of their flouriſhing ſtate.</p>

IN times of perplexity, when dangers ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round, oppreſſors threaten, or enemies invade, ſuch a people have GOD for their refuge: And committing their cauſe unto him, in the way of well-doing, may humbly expect that light will ariſe in darkneſs, that the power of the oppreſſor ſhall be broken, that their enemies ſhall not prevail againſt them, and that GOD will maintain their right and their cauſe.</p>
            <p>AT all times, under all circumſtances, at home, abroad, in peace and war, ſuch a people may ſafely &amp; cheerfully leave all their concerns in the hands of GOD; and in filial confidence of his preſence, protection and bleſſing, may ſay with the Pſalmiſt—"The LORD is on my ſide, I will not fear: What can man do unto me?"<note n="*" place="bottom">Pſalm 118. 6.</note>—<hi>Happy is that people that is in ſuch a caſe: Yea, happy is that people, whoſe GOD is the LORD.</hi>

            <p>IN the above repreſentation, we have ſeen the fair ſide of the queſtion: Government a bleſſing, and the <hi>ſhields of the earth,</hi> as they ought to be, employed for the good of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. But it may, notwithſtanding, be juſtly ſaid, that this is not always the caſe. And the queſtion may ſtill be aſked—How, then, can it be aſſerted, "That the ſhields of the earth belong unto GOD?"</p>
            <p>UPON this queſtion it may be obſerved,—That it is admitted, that THE SHIELDS OF
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:017114_0043_0FA02F81F2DAE008"/>
THE EARTH may be reverſed.—The powers of government may be abuſed. Rulers, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever promiſing at firſt, may become oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors. Yea, this hath been too often the fact. But ſhould this be the unhappy caſe; and, contrary to the juſt expectations of GOD and men, ſhould <hi>the ſhields of the earth</hi> be rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and turned againſt thoſe whom they were intended to defend, it alters not the truth or propriety of the aſſertion. "The ſhields of the earth ſtill belong unto GOD:" and "the LORD ſtill ſitteth on the throne of his holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs."</p>
            <p>SUCH is the nature of the divine govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſuch the wiſdom of the Supreme Ruler, that good is brought out of evil. Even the oppreſſors of mankind are the ſervants of GOD; and their oppreſſions are ſo over-ruled as to be ſubſervient to the deſigns of infinite wiſdom and goodneſs, in the moral govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the world.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>THE ſhields of the earth reverſed,</hi> the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of government abuſed, may be and are over-ruled in providence, ſo as to be produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of great good to ſociety and mankind.</p>
            <p>SUCH, indeed, is the <hi>inertia</hi> of mankind in general, that they are more prone to undue ſubmiſſion, than the contrary. Even a bad government is better than none, in the eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the greater part of the world. And
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:017114_0044_0FA02F82B57AD778"/>
ſo great is the riſque, the uncertainty and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger attending the attempt of a revolution, that it is not an eaſy matter to perſuade a people, even under an undue exerciſe of power, to riſe and reſiſt. They will bear much, and long, before they can be brought to unite in ſuch an attempt: but there are degrees of oppreſſion beyond bearing; and which man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, unleſs totally loſt to all ſentiments of liberty, and entirely broke to the yoke of ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, will not ſubmit to. And it is wiſe in GOD, and happy for a people, when the ſtrides of oppreſſion are permitted to be ſo great, and the violences of oppreſſors ſo haſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly increaſed, as to rouſe them effectually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is too late.</p>
            <p>OPPRESSORS are fitly called, "The rod of GOD's anger, and the ſtaff in their hand is his indignation,"<note n="*" place="bottom">Iſai 10. 5.</note> They are wiſely employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Supreme Ruler, to correct the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, reprove the vices, and reform the diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of ſocieties, nations and ſtates. They are more eſpecially improved to rouſe and reſtore the true ſpirit of liberty, when declining; and to bring on a total revolution, if neceſſary, to the preſervation or reſtoration of ſo ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable a bleſſing.</p>

ON this joyful day we are invited to ſee GOD, the ſupreme ruler, <hi>on the throne of his holineſs,</hi> the ſaviour and defence of an afflicted land: "The princes of the people of the GOD of <hi>Abraham</hi> gathered together": And "The Shields of the earth," The rulers of every department, devoting themſelves to the ſervice of GOD and their country, in devout acknowledgment of his government, to the end, that GOD might <hi>be greatly exalted,</hi> in the good of his people, by their adminiſtration.</p>
            <p>To add luſtre to the joy of this day, we behold, <hi>a ſecond time</hi> raiſed to the chief ſeat of government, in this Commonwealth, by the free ſuffrages of the people, <hi>a Gentleman,</hi> whoſe <hi>patriotic principles</hi> early engaged the attention of his fellow-citizens;—whoſe uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of conduct, in the ſeveral offices he ſuſtained, effectually gained their eſteem;—whoſe firm attachment to the liberties of his country, and determined reſolution, at every riſque and in the moſt trying times, to do all in his power to ſupport them, eſtabliſhed their confidence:—In a word, <hi>a Gentleman,</hi> whoſe diſpoſition, ability and integrity, in the ſervice of this and the <hi>United States,</hi> have been try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and approved; and whoſe name is illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, both as <hi>proſcribed by Britain,</hi> and as <hi>authenticating that glorious act,</hi> by which <hi>the United States of America</hi> are forever ſeparated from her, and declared to be <hi>a free and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent NATION.</hi>

As this is the higheſt mark of eſteem and confidence, in the power of an obliged peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to give; it cannot fail of being a ſupport to His EXCELLENCY, under the weight and perplexing cares of government, and a pleaſing inducement to thoſe returns of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and fidelity, in the duties of his high ſtation, which they may juſtly expect.</p>

            <p>MAY the moſt high GOD take theſe SHIELDS of the earth, this day, under his immediate care and patronage, guidance and direction. May the ſpirit of GOD and of glory deſcend and reſt upon his EXCELLEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CY, his HONOUR, the <hi>honorable, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,</hi> to be choſen, <hi>the Senate</hi> and <hi>the Houſe of Repreſentatives:</hi> And may the divine preſence and bleſſing attend them this day, and in all their councils, debates and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental acts, through the whole courſe of the year.

            <p>THAT plainneſs of ſpeech which hath been adopted in the whole of this diſcourſe, may well ſuperceed the neceſſity of any particular application, by way of addreſs.—The whole is intended as <hi>an humble addreſs</hi> to <hi>the fathers of this Commonwealth,</hi> and to this reſpectable

            <p>OUR <hi>political fathers,</hi> however, will permit me, with all deference, to obſerve,—</p>
            <p>'THAT the elections of this day; and which, agreeable to the <hi>ſocial compact,</hi> are to take place, as the firſt buſineſs of the <hi>General Court,</hi> (however limited) are juſtly conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as intereſting and important.</p>
            <p>WHEN we conſider the importance of the <hi>executive department,</hi> to a due adminiſtration of government;—The high rank of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors;—How much the power of the Chief Magiſtrate is limited by their advice, in the diſpoſal of places, the appointment of officers, and other things intereſting to the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty—or the important influence they have in the adminiſtration of government, and the management of the great affairs of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth;—it ſhould influence to the wiſeſt uſe of that power of election, with which the honorable <hi>Senotors</hi> and <hi>Repreſentatives,</hi> by Conſtitution are veſted.</p>

               <pb n="57" facs="unknown:017114_0060_0FA02F96CC0C9458"/>
IS the election limited?—Still there is a choice,—A choice, which made with wiſdom and fidelity, may be of great utility to this Commonwealth.</p>
            <p>IT is no impeachment of the abilities, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor or integrity of any man, to ſuppoſe, that, in a body of wiſe, great and good men, there may be different talents and improvements, and diſtinct characters, that may have an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening for exerciſe, and ſhine with a peculiar luſtre, in different departments of civil go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
            <p>WHAT theſe talents and characters are, how to be diſtinguiſhed, in whom to be found and where to be placed, for the purpoſes of government, and beſt good of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, is not for me to determine. But certain it is, theſe are queſtions of no ſmall importance to the public good: And queſtions, to which our <hi>honored civil fathers</hi> will give that attention, which their intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nature demands.</p>
            <p>NOT only to preſerve, as diſtinct as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the ſeveral departments of government, that ſo they might be a mutual check upon each other; but alſo to give dignity to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and energy to the laws, as well as eaſe to adminiſtration, were evidently in view, by adopting this branch in the conſtitution: And it cannot be doubted, that, not only thoſe

who aſſiſted in adjuſting the conſtitution, but alſo the people at large promiſed themſelves much from this <hi>high department.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>THE declining ſtate of religion, morality and virtue; and the great prevalence of vice and immorality, irreligion and profaneneſs, in almoſt every form, and in the various orders and ages of men; it is humbly conceived, are ſubjects, not only important in themſelves, but of the higheſt conſequence to the well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being of ſociety, and call aloud for the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of rulers, who are ordained of GOD to be <hi>a terror to evil doers</hi> and to <hi>evil works.</hi> In vain do the teachers of religion and even the <hi>ambaſſadors of Chriſt</hi> preach and teach the importance of religion, the excellence of virtue, and the neceſſity of morality, juſtice, tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, truth or righteouſneſs; while vice, in its various forms, is winked at by authority, and iniquity eſtabliſhed by law.</p>

They ſhall all periſh to a man.</hi> Theſe words, from a man who was abſolute maſter of their lives &amp; fortunes, made the moſt reſolute tremble. They filled the whole city with dread and horror; and the conſternation was doubled the next day, when they ſaw fixed up in all public places, a liſt of proſcribed perſons, containing the names of <hi>forty ſenators</hi> and <hi>ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred knights.</hi> If any man gave ſhelter to a perſon proſcribed, though his ſon, his brother, or his father, death was the certain reward of his humanity; whereas the aſſaſſin was recompenced with two talents, though a ſlave had murdered his maſter, or a ſon his father.—The <hi>tyrent</hi> choſe ſuch agents to execute his decrees, as had even leſs pity than himſelf. The chief of thoſe was the infamous <hi>Cataline.</hi>—At the head of a band of aſſaſſins, he ſcoured the ſtreets, and killed many knights and ſenators before they knew they were proſcribed. The perſons named in the liſt were ſought for in their own houſes, in the porticoes, and even in the temples; whence they were dragged to <hi>Sylla,</hi> and cruelly butchered in his preſence.</p>
                     <p>The maſſacre was not confined to thoſe named in the liſt. <hi>Sylla</hi> extended his revenge to all who had borne arms againſt him, of what rank ſoever, or condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Nay, his cruel agents took this opportunity to gratify their private revenge and avarice, confounding the moſt innocent and peaceable with the moſt guilty, out of ſome private grudge, or purely for the ſake of their wealth and rich furniture. In ſhort, the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was ſo dreadful, that <hi>Sylla</hi> was reproached with it even by his beſt friends. Among others, a young ſena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, named <hi>Caius Metellus,</hi> ventured one day to aſk him in full ſenate, when he deſigned to put a ſtop to the calamities of his fellow citizens. <hi>We do not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede</hi> ſaid he, <hi>for ſuch as you have reſolved to deſtroy: but only deſire you to free thoſe from uneaſineſs, whom you have determined to ſave. Sylla,</hi> without ſeeming to take this bold ſpeech amiſs, anſwered cooly, that he knew not yet whom he ſhould ſave. <hi>Name to us then,</hi> replied <hi>Metellus, thoſe you are determined to deſtroy, That I will do,</hi> anſwered <hi>Sylla,</hi> very ſmartly, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately cauſed a new liſt to be fixed up of <hi>eighty ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens,</hi> whom he proſcribed, moſt of them ſenators, and perſons of great diſtinction. The next day he proſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed <hi>two hundred and twenty</hi> more, and an equal num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the third. Among theſe was <hi>Marcus Marius,</hi> who was nearly related to the great <hi>Marius,</hi> and highly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by the people.—He was ſeized by <hi>Cataline,</hi> and put to death, after having ſuffered the moſt exquiſite torments tyranny could invent. He was whipped thro' all the ſtreets of <hi>Rome,</hi> and, after this ignominious pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, carried beyond the <hi>Tyber,</hi> where by <hi>Sylla's</hi> barbarous agents, his eyes were put out, his hands and ears cut off, his tongue torn out, all his joints diſlocated, and his bones broken. One <hi>Marcus Plaetorius,</hi> being moved at ſuch an affecting ſight, could not help pitying the unfortunate young man; which ſo offended <hi>Sylla,</hi> that he ordered him to be killed on the ſpot And now after <hi>nine thouſand</hi> ſenators, knights, and citizens had been inhumanly murdered by <hi>Sylla's</hi> agents, he aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the people, and told them, that he had proſcribed as many as he could think of at preſent: and as for thoſe he had forgot, they ſhould be proſcribed too, as ſoon as he could call them to his memory!</p>

                  <p>This was the ſcene in the city of <hi>Rome</hi>—What awful havock, then, muſt the ſame meaſures of cruelty have made in the other cities and ſtates of that great Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth!—But no comment is neceſſary.</p>

WHEN, <hi>mad with loyalty,</hi> the <hi>Britiſh</hi> nation reſtored their <hi>flattering tyrant, Charles</hi> IId. a ſcene of blood was opened, more affecting, perhaps, to the more judicious part of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, than all that had appeared in the civil war.

of the worthieſt characters were ſoon <hi>attaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> and <hi>proſcribed:</hi> And it was quickly found, that nothing ſhort of the <hi>beſt blood</hi> of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, would be a ſacrifice ſufficient to appeaſe his own reſentment, or his <hi>father's ghoſt.</hi>

            <p>THE ſame, or perhaps, more affecting ſcenes will probably be opened in <hi>America,</hi> ſhould we fail of ſucceſs in the preſent conteſt; or ſhould theſe <hi>United States</hi> be ever ſubdued by <hi>arms,</hi> or cajoled by <hi>arts,</hi> to a return and ſubmiſſion to <hi>Britain.</hi>—But this is an event, which (we firmly truſt) will never take place.</p>
            <p>UPON the whole: in our united counſels and exertions, we may yet hope, and even aſſure ourſelves, that GOD who <hi>who ſitteth upon the throne of his holineſs,</hi> will behold our ſtate, hear our prayers, and ſtill <hi>maintain our right</hi> and <hi>plead our cauſe.</hi>—That he will haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the period of our preſent diſtreſſes, and give us to ſee, in his own way and time, the liberty, independence, ſovereignty and glory of the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, eſtabliſhed on a foundation that ſhall never be moved.</p>
            <p>AND what a bright, what a glorious ſcene of liberty and felicity doth ſuch an happy iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue of this <hi>great</hi> and <hi>intereſting conteſt,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to our view?—<hi>America,</hi> redeemed out of the hands of her enemies—<hi>the United
