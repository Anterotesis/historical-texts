            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE late afflicting diſpenſation of Divine Providence, in removing from this life the Firſt Man in the nation, is univerſally felt, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely lamented. Such is the force of this ſhock, which millions feel with the keeneſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility, that eloquence fails to expreſs it, and imagination to paint it.</p>
            <p>LET others engage actors on ſuch occaſions, as ſome of the ancients have done, to exhibit external marks of grief—a vain mockery, which paſſeth off like an empty tale: but when the heart is pierced with anguiſh, even nature her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf directs to ſuitable expreſſions of it. Such are the tears, and ſuch the badges of mourning in our nation, on this ſolemn occaſion. To
<pb facs="unknown:037487_0005_100D1AD710EA0460"/>
mourn with thoſe who mourn, is a principle of nature, particularly enforced by the chriſtian religion. It is at the ſame time a mournful ſat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isfaction to friends; the means of exciting a laudable emulation among ſurvivors, and of tranſmitting to poſterity characters rendered il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious by their public ſervices, by their tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, and by their virtues.</p>
            <p>I SHALL take the liberty to apply our text to the mournful ſubject of our diſcourſe, although originally expreſſive of Zion's ſorrows: and
<list>
                  <item>I. I SHALL conſider ſomething of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic loſs we have ſuſtained—<hi>The crown is fallen from our head.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>II. THE effect this loſs has produced—<hi>The joy of our heart is ceaſed.</hi> And,</item>
                  <item>LASTLY, conclude with ſome reflections and inferences from the ſubject.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>I. IN conſidering the public loſs we have ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, it is not to be expected we ſhould fully diſplay the character of the departed, nor the greatneſs of this national calamity. Indeed it is a ſubject ſo far beyond my feeble powers of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, that I was ready to mourn in ſilence, with my beloved country, in this common ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity.
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:037487_0006_100D1AD8967786A0"/>
But leſt we ſhould appear deficient in reſpectful attachment to the memory of this beſt of men, I have been emboldened to aſk your attention to this ſolemn and affecting ſubject—while I hold up to your view this bright exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of public ſervices and private virtues.</p>
            <p>HIS fame and great military talents ſhone con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous early in life; and as if deſtined by heaven to be the inſtrument of ſaving his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, he then, by his foreſight, prudence and bravery, brought off the remnant of a defeated Britiſh army, and baffled an enemy of ſuperior number. This exploit excited ſeveral predic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions reſpecting his future glory.<note n="*" place="bottom">Among the many obſervations made upon this ſubject, we find Preſident DAVIS, in a Sermon delivered in Virginia, in the year 1755, ſpeaks of him in ſtrains of praiſe, and predicts his being a future bleſſing to his country.</note> Theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions have been verified in the late revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary war. Our countrymen, at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of the war, were unprovided with mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary ſtores; untutored in the art of war, and deſtitute of a leader to direct their military ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. How could they meet the veteran bands of foes, led on by generals grown old in war? Lo! the renowned friend and father of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, WASHINGTON, appears! The ornament of human nature, to compoſe whoſe character, ſuch an aſſemblage of ſhining virtues conſpire,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:037487_0007_100D1ADB053F75C8"/>
that it were difficult to mention one moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent. His dignity of mien, propriety of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, wiſdom in council, valour in the field, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſted patriotiſm, inflexible probity, humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to his enemies, ſympathy to the ſuffering, and veneration for virtue, rendered him the joy of the people, and gave him an unrivalled aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancy in our armies through an eight years war. From this height of dictatorial power, equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poſſeſſing the unbounded confidence of ſoldiers and citizens; having accompliſhed the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of his appointment, and the wiſhes of his heart, he returns to the common rank of citizen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; retiring to the peaceful ſhades of Vernon, without penſion or emolument to himſelf or fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and without other reward for his long, pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and important ſervices, than the affectionate glowing hearts of his countrymen, and the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the world. How unlike a Caeſar or a Cromwell, or the heroes of antiquity! When <hi>they</hi> had acquired or uſurped the ſovereign power, the reins of government were guided to aggran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize themſelves at the expence of their country's liberties. It was reſerved to this firſt of men, with diſintereſted zeal for his country's welfare, to ſecure her freedom, and then to retire to enjoy, in common with his fellow-citizens, the bleſſings he had procured with ſo much toil and danger.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:037487_0008_100D1ADD58A53058"/>
HAD his life terminated with our revolution<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary war, what American heart would not have lamented his departure? He ſtood unrivalled in human glory and greatneſs;—but Heaven, as if determined to ſhew to poſterity the ſublimeſt vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of human nature, preſerves his important life until the exigencies of public affairs require the aid of his other talents and virtues. The ſtateſman and civil ruler remain to be diſplayed. Although our foreign enemies are driven from our favoured land, and the dove with the olive-branch of peace ſettles upon the boſom of our country; yet, without order and government, peace cannot long be maintained; like a veſſel deſtitute of rudder and compaſs, ſhe lies expoſed to the fury of every wave. Alike great in war and peace, this man of the people again ſteps forth, and preſides in the formation of our excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent conſtitution. Called by the unanimous voice of his country, he relinquiſhes his beloved retreat, and guides the helm of government. At this critical moment, his conſummate pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, inflexible firmneſs and endearing modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſecured his country from the machinations of deſigning internal enemies, and the horrors of civil war. Under the auſpices of his moſt excellent adminiſtration, we repoſed in peace un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our "vines and fig-trees." The paternal ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice he gave us on his voluntary retirement from
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:037487_0009_100D1AE1309C5600"/>
this exalted ſtation, his country being in a proſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous condition, I hope is indelibly engraven on the tablets of all our hearts, and will be faithfully tranſmitted to poſterity, as the beſt of earthly le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacies.</p>
            <p>HIS acceptance of the command of the armies of the United States, on a recent apprehenſion of his country's danger, from the hoſtile aggreſſions of a great and ambitious nation, enhances our ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations of gratitude, and more eſpecially as he was in the decline of life. Yet ſuch was the energy of his mind, and ardour for public uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that he was yet ready once more to forſake the moſt endearing domeſtic enjoyments, when his country demanded the ſacrifice.</p>
            <p>WHILE we contemplate ſuch heroic virtue in this ever faithful leader and friend to his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, we are conſtrained to admire and to applaud;—to rejoice in ſuch a noble ſample of the ſublime virtues to which our fallen nature may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored in this life. But the inſtance is ſingular, nor can the annals of hiſtory furniſh a parallel.</p>
            <p>IF we believe that GOD raiſed up, girded and went before Cyrus, to deliver Iſrael from their oppreſſors, why are we not to believe that this far more meritorious character has been, by an
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:037487_0010_100D1AE2B6251D50"/>
eſpecial and particular Providence, raiſed up to deliver and to ſecure the people of this land?</p>
            <p>BUT what avails our weak eſſay? Has not the trumpet of fame long ſince circulated through the nations of Europe the atchievements and virtues of this <hi>hero</hi> and <hi>patriot?</hi> But, my fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low mourners, we have this day to lament that the <hi>"Crown is fallen from our head."</hi> "How are the mighty fallen!" And we may ſay, with greater emphaſis than David ſaid of Abner, <hi>"Know ye not that a Prince and a great man is fallen?"</hi> Yes, Americans, your crown, your friend, the friend of man, the father of his country, the guardian of your rights, ſleeps in duſt. How incalculable the loſs! No more will he lead our arms to victory and peace—no more ſhall he hear our call on the greateſt pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic exigencies—no more ſhall he add dignity to order and government by his illuſtrious exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples—no more ſalutary counſels ſhall flow to us from his lips, now ſealed up in death. <hi>"The joy of our heart has ceaſed."</hi> I proceed to conſider,</p>
            <p>II. The effects this loſs has produced in our country.—It always has been cuſtomary, in days of great public calamities, to indulge public ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of grief. Who can forbear, upon an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion like the preſent, to mingle their ſorrowful notes with the millions whoſe "joy has ceaſed,"
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:037487_0011_100D1AE442BE6868"/>
and whoſe ſong of melody is turned into mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? Why this ſolemn appearance in the houſe of prayer? Why theſe uncommon enſigns of mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which meet our eyes and damp our joys in the houſe of GOD?<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>On this melancholy occaſion, the meeting-houſe exhibited ſuch affecting teſtimonies of affliction, as were highy calculated to impreſs the mind with ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and ſolemn veneration. The pulpit was entirely covered with black, with the addition of a mourning-piece in front, repreſenting a pedeſtal and urn, with three angels over it, as guarding the <hi>richeſt duſt</hi> of America; the pedeſtal inſcribed with this motto: <hi>"Sacred to the Memory of</hi> WASHINGTON;" under it the following lines:

               </note> We may well lament a friend to virtue fallen. Let not the reproachful com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint be repeated in our ears, which the Lord made by the Prophet, "The righteous periſheth, and no man layeth it to heart." The melancholy tidings produced a general ſhock pervading the nation, and the ſorrow ſtands depicted on every countenance, which ſhews that the joy of the heart has ceaſed: from every part of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try the ſad echo finds the nation in tears.</p>
            <p>THE badges of mourning exhibited among all ranks and ages of citizens, ſtrikingly pourtray the feelings of their hearts. While our ſorrow is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in national groans, what heart intereſted in human affairs can be indifferent? Weep, then,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:037487_0012_100D1AE8EC259AF0"/>
my friends; ye do well to weep with your coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, with the world. And while we drop our tears over his precious duſt, and bewail this pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic bereavement, we join in the general lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations of all that is human. Mourn, then, ye vet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erans, whoſe heads have been ſhielded in the day of battle, for your beloved leader! Mourn, ye young and riſing generation, for you have loſt a faithful friend and counſellor! Mourn, ye friends of liberty and juſtice, for our crown is fallen! Mourn, ye friends of the arts and ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, your patron is removed! Let the world mourn, FOR WASHINGTON IS DEAD!</p>
            <p>LET us cloſe with ſome reflections and infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences:</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. IN all the diſpenſations of Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, it becomes rational beings to contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the Sovereign Diſpoſer of all creatures, and make ſuitable reflections for their own profit. And in all GOD's diſpenſations of judgments, we may trace the emanations of his goodneſs, infuſing ſome ſalutary cordial into the moſt bitter draught. This ſentiment is ſtrikingly exemplified in the preſent melancholy inſtance. It has been a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular bleſſing, that GOD ſhould raiſe up ſuch a wonderful character, at ſuch a very critical time
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:037487_0013_100D1AEB45CEC930"/>
of our nation, as a luminary to ſhed his rays up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us in dark and diſmal times.</p>
            <p n="2">2d. THE preſervation of his life, which ſeemed eſſential to our national exiſtence, was no leſs expreſſive of GOD'S goodneſs. In the name of WASHINGTON were all the hoſts of America united. The ſecurity which all felt under his guidance, has no parallel. His name united the different parties in the nation, and reconciled them to a change in the ſyſtem of government. Our moſt excellent conſtitution, under his adminiſtration, diſpelled the fears of thoſe who were jealous of innovations.</p>
            <p n="3">3d. THE example of his dignified retirement to the condition of a private citizen, cultivating thoſe peaceful employments which give ſtrength to the government, and happineſs to the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is worthy imitation. He has taught this leſſon, that happineſs does not conſiſt more in leading armies, or filling a preſidential chair, than in fill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the duties of our ſeveral ſtations with induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, probity, honour and virtue. Indeed we cannot turn our eyes upon this firſt of men, but our hearts are filled with veneration, and warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the flame of ſincere and filial love. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever fondly we may wiſh that talents and virtues like theſe might be continued upon earth, heaven
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:037487_0014_100D1AECC98CBF78"/>
has otherwiſe ordained, to ſhew us that "all fleſh is graſs, and all the goodlineſs thereof as the graſs which periſheth."</p>
            <p>WE ſhall now infer,</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. IF death has entered Vernon's ſhade, and taken the great, the good, and wiſe, who can expect to eſcape? If temperance, that beſt preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative of health and life; if the collected virtues of the Man, the General and the Preſident, could have ſecured an earthly immortality, never, O lamented WASHINGTON, never ſhould thy fall have added freſh honours to the trophies of death! But ſince he is no more, let the great and the mighty of the earth prepare to die like men. Let us be wiſe, and conſider our latter end, when the alarm of mortality is ſounded from ſuch an elevated height;—and he who lived for our benefit, may then die for our benefit too—to remind us that we alſo muſt die.</p>
            <p>DEATH, ſweeps off our fellow-citizens every year, every day. Our neighbours, like leaves in the autumn, drop into the grave in a thick ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion. The air, the earth, the ocean, and all the elements, are armed with death. A thouſand dangers lie in ambuſh for us. The principles of mortality lurk in our own conſtitutions; and ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:037487_0015_100D1AEE4EFB6360"/>
the herald of the laſt enemy, often warns us to prepare. Yet how few realize the thought, that they muſt die! How many forget this ſolemn ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, till they feel it! They ſtand fearleſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apprehenſive upon the ſlippery brink of eternity, till they unexpectedly fall, and are ingulphed in the boundleſs ocean. But ſhall not this loud alarm awaken us out of our vain dreams of an earthly immortality? When the mighty is "fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len," ſhall not the feeble tremble? If the father of a people muſt ceaſe to live, ſhall not the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple expect to die? If common deaths are ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent that they have loſt their monitory force, ſhall not the death of this mighty man conſtrain us to realize our own mortality? Shall it not awaken that univerſal ſeriouſneſs which that proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect inſpires? How great a bleſſing might this awful diſpenſation prove, if thus religiouſly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved?</p>
            <p n="2">2d. AMERICANS have been indulged with a living example of ſuch diſtinguiſhed and rare virtues; are they not bound to improve it, by copying thoſe parts of it within their particular ſpheres of action? Let not the exalted height de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter us from the attempt. The more fair, beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and perfect the original, the more refined the pleaſure we ſhall have in the imitation. It is not expected that we ſhould all be generals,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:037487_0016_100D1AF22590F568"/>
preſidents or rulers; but we ſhould all be good citizens—peaceable, induſtrious, virtuous and faithful, in our ſeveral ſtations; "rendering to Caeſar the things that are Caeſar's, and unto God the things that are God's." Do we venerate the character of the deceaſed? Let us give evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of our veneration, by imbibing his ſpirit, treaſuring up his advice in our boſoms, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the ſame to poſterity, that our children may learn to liſp that beloved name, and look up to him as a model for their imitation. Let us cheriſh his philanthropic ſentiments—let us copy his example of humanity, and convince the world, that Americans have caught the "mantle" of our departed FATHER and BENE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FACTOR.</p>
            <p n="3">3d. IF all that is great in human nature is but mortal—if <hi>"the joy of our heart is ceaſed,"</hi> it becomes a rational immortal being to ſeek per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent, unchanging good. Where ſhall it be found? only in the Supreme Good. Let us then lay up for ourſelves "treaſures in heaven," and be rich towards God. There is one gift of heaven to mankind, which ſhall ſurvive the diſſolution of the world, which ſhall flouriſh and reign fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; I mean religion. Yes, the divine religion of our adorable Saviour, who conquered death when he died, who has opened the portals of eternal glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:037487_0017_100D1AF4705D7C28"/>
"and holds the keys of death and the grave;" who openeth, and no man ſhutteth; who ſhutteth, and no man openeth. This religion will ſhine bright in the night of affliction—will irradiate the thick glooms of death, and blaze out into immortality. This will be a ſource of happineſs through the revolutions of eternal ages; what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable comfort does our religion diſcloſe to the believing eye! It guides the pilgrim in the houſe and priſon of his clay; it points cut the road to duty and happineſs; it ſoothes the mourner in the deep anguiſh of ſorrow, when his earthly <hi>"crown is fallen,"</hi> and <hi>"the joy of his heart ceaſed."</hi> When the "king of terrors" knocks at the door of the pious, he may bid him welcome; for, with a well grounded hope of eternal life by JESUS CHRIST, he can ſing, "Oh death, where is thy ſting? Oh grave, where is thy victory? Thanks be unto God, who giveth us the victory, through our Lord JESUS CHRIST." Yes, this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion unfolds the myſtery of a reſurrection; that the precious duſt of the righteous has the guard of Omnipotence, and the deep ſounding trump of God ſhall finally bring forth the ſacred de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite. Then ſhall corruption put on incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the vile bodies of his ſervants "be faſhioned like unto the glorious body of our Lord JESUS CHRIST."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:037487_0018_100D1AF5F652E028"/>
Now we may aſk, in the language of an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant writer, "Is this ſenſeleſs duſt all that is left of this greateſt of men? Has he ſuffered a total extinction of being? Is he dead to himſelf, to the univerſe, and to his God? No, he lives! he greatly lives the life of immortals—he lives in the immenſe regions of ſpirits; where all the ſuperficial diſtinctions of birth, riches, power and majeſty, are loſt forever; and all the diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that remains, ariſes from virtue and vice; from our having acted our part well or ill in the ſtation where we are fixed. There triumphant tyranny, that bade defiance to human power, is blaſted and degraded by the frown of Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence: and there thoſe rulers of men, who were the ſervants of God, are advanced to a higher ſphere of dominion and beneficence, and the badges of earthly greatneſs are ſuperfluous to their dignity, and would but conceal their worth;" "for they are made kings and prieſts unto God forever." There they are clothed with the robes of ſalvation, and the garments of praiſe: and wear crowns of unfading glory, infinitely brighter than thoſe which the gold, and gems, and glitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing trifles of the earth, can compoſe.</p>
            <p>THIS view of the great, good and mighty, does not diminiſh, but heighten and brighten their glory: for what renders the nature of man,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:037487_0019_100D1AF8325A9448"/>
and even of angels, ſo important, ſo noble, ſo divine, as immortality? This advances the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of the duſt to a kind of equality with the natives of heaven. Are not ſentiments like theſe congenial with our moſt ardent wiſhes and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional feelings, when we ſee the great, good and uſeful of our fellow creatures, fall before the all-conquering hand of death? If ſo, let us forever baniſh from our hearts every ſeed of infidelity, which filled the ſoul with black deſpair; and has no virtue to calm and ſoothe the mind, torn by the heart-rending anguiſh of parting with the objects of our deareſt affections; and let us cheriſh the religion of our Saviour; let us receive it as a heavenly balm, fitted to fortify us againſt the trials of the preſent life, and to give us the ſoul-comforting confidence, that our godly ſeparated friends are diſpoſed of to their everlaſting advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, in their enjoyment of the heavenly world.</p>
            <p>TO THAT SOVEREIGN, ALL-WISE AND MOST GRACIOUS GOD, WHO "KILLETH AND MAK<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ETH ALIVE, AND FROM WHOSE HAND NONE CAN DELIVER," LET US GIVE ADORATION, PRAISE AND THANKSGIVING, NOW AND FORE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VER.</p>
            <closer>AMEN.</closer>
