            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

<pb n="2" facs="unknown:038963_0002_101238CB09C6CAD8"/>
and Jonathan Pleasants, and the Journal of the House of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legates, exhibited and read, and were argued by counsel, the court on this twelfth day of September, in the year of our Lord one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand seven hundred and ninety eight, overruled the demurrers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the right to freedom proposed to be asserted by the plaintiff on behalf of certain men, women and children detained in slavery, which freedom the former owner of some of them and of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitors of others could not bestow, although solicitous to bestow it, during his life time, was, preserved, if it could he preserved, until enjoyment of the blessing would be permitted by temporary and conditional bequests of the slaves, with a confidence that in an event which might remove the legal obstacle to deliverance from thraldom, the legataries would fulfil the testator's desire, so that the intermediate possession of the legataries, if that desire were not inane was fiduciary, &amp; in such a case, the elements, from which juridical arrangements commence, prove the question which hath occurred to be peculiarly proper for praetorian animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion for decision before a tribunal erected especially to foster and effectuate conscientious fideicommissa: and upon that question which is the capital subject of disceptation and some others, in consequence thereof the court declared its opinion in these terms, the condition which the testator, John Pleasants, enjoined the lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries, and which, if it were lawful, excepting the bequests they were obliged implicitly to perform, was not contrary to law. Such a provision for emancipation was not prohibited literally by the statute in 1748, the only instituted law then extant, which can be quoted for that purpose, enacting <q>that no slave shall be set free, upon any pretence, except for services to be adjudged by the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor and council to be meritorious,</q> the statute operated only upon emancipations efficatious immediately, not those of which the efficacy was fortuitous; and ampliation of the statute giving it energy in cases of which similar predicaments might seem to require similar policy, is reprobated in this instance, where the defendants, in a court of equity, are invoking its aid to hinder the restitution of a right, of which they, on whose behalf it is claimed, and their progenitors, could not have been deprived without viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of equitable constitutional principles. An objection urged by one of the counsel for the defendants, if it were not misunderstood, namely, that John Pleasants, who dying before the statute permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manumission of slaves, enacted in the year 1782, was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver authorised to manumit his slaves, could not enjoin manumis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of them in any circumstances, is founded upon a position con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived not to be true, unless the act required by the condition to be performed were a malum in se; that a condition requiring perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of an act, not whilst the performance would be unlawful,
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:038963_0003_101238CDCC64AF08"/>
but when it would, if ever it should be lawful, that such a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be performed, not after an intolerable length of time, is unlawful seems an absurd position: upon the doctrine of perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuities, if applicable to any cases, in which human liberty is chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged, can not be found an objection against the slaves existing at the death of the testator, John Pleasants, or against the slaves born after, of mothers existing before his death; for their cases are examples of the legitimate periods, during which emergence or lapse of contingent dispositions may be suspended, namely, where events before the termination of a life or lives existent, or of a life or lives immediately succeeding the existent, must fix the destiny. Here the slaves for whose benefit the testator intended the bequests are first, those of whom he was POSSESSED at the time of his death, and secondly, those of whose MOTHERS he was so possessed. The period of time during ability of the slaves to enjoy when the legislature should permit them to enjoy, this benefit was suspended, did not <hi>excede</hi> the tolerated period. I was during the lives of them, who survived the testator, and of them who were born after his death, of mothers surviving him, so that, in equity, of the slaves, on whose behalf this prosecution was instituted, they who were thirty years old or older, in the year one thousand seven hundred and eighty two, when the statute authorising manumis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion was enacted, were, at that time entitled, they, who born be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his death are not yet thirty years old, will be when they shall attain that age, intitled to freedom, they who were born between the times of the said testator's death and of enacting the said sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute will be when they shall attain the same age intitled to free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and they who have been born since the said statute was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted, were at their birth intitled to freedom; and the plaintiff not only the heir but the surviving executor of the said John Pleasants, is the proper party to vindicate that freedom, and require fulfilment of his desire repeatedly declared in his testament, and the court doth direct one of the commissioners thereof to report a catalogue of the slaves aforesaid, distinguishing the times when, according to the foregoing opinion, any of them ought heretofore to have been and hereafter to be liberated from servitude, and stating accounts of profits, to which they who have been wrongfully detained are intitled.</p>

                              <p>This day came the parties by their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, and the court having maturely considered the transcript of the record, and the argument of the counsel, is of opinion that there is no error in so much of the decree of the said High Court of Chancery, as overruleth the demurrers of the appellants Mary Pleasants, Isaac Pleasants and Samuel Pleasants, jun. for want of jurisdiction in the said court; but that there is error in some of the principles, on which the decree upon the merits is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and part of the reasoning thereupon is not approved by this court, therefore it is decreed and ordered, that so much of the said decree as overruleth the said demurrers be affirmed, and that the residue of the said decree be reversed, and this court proceeding to make such decree as the said High Court of Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery should have pronounced, is of opinion, that although the tes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators at the time of making their respective wills had not power to manumit, and if they had devised them upon conditions that the devisees should emancipate them immediately, the condition being unlawful would have been void, and the property vested, yet the condition that they should become free when the law would permit it, was not of that sort. That to apply the rule re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specting the limitation of the remainder of a chattel upon too re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote a contingency, with all its consequences, to the present case, would be too rigid, but that a reasonable principle ought to be adopted to suit its peculiar circumstances, which is this, that if the event happens whilst the slaves remain in the posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the family without change by the intervention of credit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:038963_0005_101238D33244C640"/>
or purchasers since the contending parties would be those whose interest had been contemplated by the testators, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest ought to take place, but that the case of such intervening claims not being in the view of the testators it ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered how far they should in equity prevent the devise of the manumission from taking effect. So far therefore as concerns the family, the court would have had no difficulty in decreeing in favor of the paupers, if the wills had directed a general emanci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, when permitted by law, and the legislature had permitted it without any condition annexed; but a difficulty arises from the testators' not having directed a general manumission, when al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by law, but a limitted one, directing that all future gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of these people born whilst their mothers were under thirty should serve to that age, founded no doubt, upon consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations of the interest of his family, and that of the slaves on which middle state the legislature have not declared their will, and on the other hand the legislature have permitted an unlimit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted emancipation, but annexed a condition imposing upon the person liberating certain terms for the sake of the community, of which the persons making voluntary manumissions might judge, whether they would do the act upon these terms and use their pleasure: and on these terms the testators have not declared their minds whether they would or would not have compelled the devisees against their inclination to emancipate subject to them. Under this difficulty, the court endeavored to model a decree to effect the purpose of the paupers without essentially violating the wills, and is of opinion that the limitted manumission, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the modifications, in the wills of the testators, can alone take place and be decreed, and that the terms for securing the public against the maintenance of the aged or infirmed, cannot be equitably imposed upon the devisees. It is therefore further decreed and ordered, that all the slaves of which the testators were possessed as their property, at the time of their respective deaths, not subject to the claims of the creditors or purchasers, before stated, and who are now above the age of forty five years, and their increase, born after their respective mothers had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the age of thirty years (so soon as Robert Pleasants the executor, the several trustees, or any other person, shall in the courts of the several counties in which the said slaves respective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reside, enter into bonds, with approved security, payable to the justices then sitting in each court, and their successors, with condition that the said slaves shall not become chargeable to the public, or enter into one such bond for the whole in the General Court,) and all such as are now above thirty and under the age of forty-five years immediately shall be emancipated and set
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:038963_0006_101238D53A76FEC8"/>
free to all intents and purposes, in like manner as if they had been born free; and that all who are now under the age of thirty, and whose mothers had not attained that age at the time of their birth, and all their future descendants, born whilst their mothers are in such service, do serve their several owners, until they shall respectively attain the age of thirty years, and then be in like manner free, and when their freedom shall severally take effect according to this decree, there shall be delivered to each of them, by their respective masters or mistresses, a certificate, written or printed, attesting their freedom, in such form as shall be directed by the said High Court of Chancery. That no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count ought to be taken of profits, it being unusual in such cases and less reasonable in this very difficult one. And the cause is remanded to the said High Court of Chancery for a state to be taken of the present condition of the several persons, and their rights ascertained, according to the principles of this decree, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so for further proceedings to be had respecting the claims of Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth Pleasants and Daniel Teasdale to part of the slaves, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der titles paramount to the will of John Pleasants, and the claims of the creditors of Charles Logan, upon proper statements of the facts and exhibits relative thereto, which they are to be at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to introduce in the said court, which is ordered to be certified to the said High Court of Chancery.</p>
