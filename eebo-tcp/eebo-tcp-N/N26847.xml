            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>MARTIN LUTHER, THE GREAT REFORMER.</head>
            <p>IN the order of time, we come now to treat of a moſt wonderful man, whom GOD raiſed up in theſe laſt ages of the world, to break the chain of ſuperſtition and ſpiritual ſlavery, with which the biſhops of Rome and their depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents had, for many centuries, caſt over the conſciences of all men. He was an inſtrument truly prepared for this great work; and yet but a mean and obſcure monk, to ſhew us, that HE, who ruleth all things, effected himſelf the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant deſign, in which the greateſt prince upon earth would have undoubtedly failed.</p>
            <p>The conduct of the dignified clergy through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all Europe, had long given ſcandal to the world. The biſhops were groſsly ignorant: They ſeldom reſided in their dioceſes, except to riot at high feſtivals: And all the effect their reſidence could have, was to corrupt others, by their ill example. Nay ſome of them could not ſo much as write, but employed ſome perſon, or chaplain who had attained that accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to ſubſcribe their names for them. They followed the courts of princes, and aſpired to the greateſt offices. The abbets and monks
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:035737_0003_10064E5425FD9218"/>were wholly given up to luxury and idleneſs; and it appeared, by the unmarried ſtate both of the ſeculars and regulars, that the reſtraining them from having wives of their own, made them conclude they had a right to all other men's. The inferior clergy were no better; and not having places of retreat to conceal their vices in, as the monks had, they became more public. In ſum; all ranks of churchmen were ſo univerſally deſpiſed and hated, that the world was very apt to be poſſeſſed with preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice againſt their doctrines, for the ſake of the men whoſe intereſt it was to ſupport them: And the worſhip of God was ſo defiled with groſs ſuperſtition, that, without great enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, all men are eaſily convinced, that the church ſtood in great need of reformation. This was much increaſed when ſcripture and the books of the fathers were rendered common by the art of printing, and began to be read, in which the difference between the former and later ages of the church very evidently appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. They found, that a blind ſuperſtition came firſt in the room of true piety; and when by its means, the wealth and intereſt of the clergy were highly advanced, the popes had upon that eſtabliſhed their tyranny; under which, not only the meaner people, but even the crowned heads, had long groaned. All theſe things concurred to make way for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of the reformation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:035737_0004_10064E55B046EEB8"/>
Wickliffe, Huſs, Jerom of Prague, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, had laid the ſeeds of the reformation, which Luther nouriſhed with great warmth. The ſcandalous extolling of indulgences gave the firſt occaſion to all the contradiction that followed between Luther and the church of Rome; in which if the corruptions and cruelty of the clergy had not been ſo viſible and ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, ſo ſmall a matter could not have produced ſuch a revolution: But any criſis will put ill humours into a ferment.</p>
            <p>As proteſtants, we are certainly much obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to Eraſmus; yet we are far more obliged, under God, to thoſe great inſtruments of the reformation, viz. Luther, Zuinglius, Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lampadius, Bucer; Melancthon, Cranmer, and others. The greateſt enemies of Luther cannot deny, but that he had eminent qualities; and hiſtory affords nothing more ſurpriſing than what he had done: For a ſimple monk to be able to give popery ſo rude a ſhock, that there needed but ſuch another entirely to overthrow the Romiſh church, is what we cannot ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently admire, and marks the hand of providence conducting the whole. It was ſaid, with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that Eraſmus, by his railleries, prepared the way for Luther; and Simon Fontaine the popiſh hiſtorian, complained, that Eraſmus oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally had done more miſchief than Luther; becauſe Luther only opened the door wider, after Eraſmus had picked the lock, and half
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:035737_0005_10064E57432B6E90"/>opened it. Notwithſtanding all this, ſays Bayle, there muſt have been eminent gifts in Luther to produce ſuch a revolution as he has done.</p>
            <p>Martin Luther was born at Iſleben, a town in the county of Mansfield, in the circle of Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Saxony, on the tenth of November, 1483. His father was called John Luther, or Luder, becauſe he was a refiner of metals; for Luder, in the German language, has that ſignification: It is agreed that his buſineſs was about the mines; and that he was the chief magiſtrate of the city of Mansfield. His mother's name was Margaret Lindeman, who was remarkable for her piety.</p>
            <p>When Martin Luther was fourteen years of age, he was ſent to the public ſchool of Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deburg, where he continued one year, and was then removed to that of Eyſenach, where he ſtudied four years. The circumſtances of his parents were at that time ſo very low, and ſo inſufficient to maintain him, that he was forced, as Melchior Adam relates, to live by begging his bread. When he had finiſhed his grammar ſtudies, he was ſent to the famous ſchool at Eyſenach in Thuringia, for the ſake of being among his mother's relations, where he applied himſelf very diligently to his books for four years, and began to diſcover all that force and ſtrength of parts; that accuteneſs and penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that warm and rapid eloquence, which afterwards were attended with ſuch amazing
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:035737_0006_10064E591325EAA0"/>ſucceſs. In the year 1501, he was entered at the univerſity of Erford or Erfurt, in Thurin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia where he went through a courſe of philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, and was admitted maſter of arts, in 1503, being then twenty years old. He was ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter made profeſſor of phyſic, and ethics: But he chiefly applied himſelf to the ſtudy of the civil law, and intended to advance himſelf to the bar, from which he was diverted by an uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon accident. As he was walking in the fields with a friend, he was ſtruck by a thunderbolt, which threw him to the ground, and killed his companion: Whereupon Luther reſolved to withdraw from the world, and enter into the order of the hermits of St. Auguſtine. He made his profeſſion in the monaſtry of Erfurt, where he took prieſt's orders, and celebrated his firſt maſs in the year 1507.</p>
            <p>It is reported, that there was an old man in this monaſtry, with whom Luther had ſeveral conferences upon many theological ſubjects, particularly concerning the article of remiſſion of ſins. This article was explained by the old monk to Luther, <q>That it was the expreſs commandment of God, that every man ſhould believe his ſins to be forgiven him in Chriſt.</q> Luther found this interpretation was confirmed by the teſtimony of St. Bernard, who ſays. 'That man is freely juſtified by faith.' He then perceived the meaning of St. Paul, when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>, We are juſtified by faith.' He
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:035737_0007_10064E5DC0F817B8"/>conſulted the expoſitions of many writers upon that apoſtle, and ſaw through the vanity of thoſe interpretations, which he had read before the ſchoolmen. He compared the ſayings and examples of the prophets, and apoſtles.</p>
            <p>In 1508, the univerſity of Wittenburg, in the duchy of Saxony, was eſtabliſhed under the direction of Staupitius, whoſe good opinion of Luther occaſioned him to ſend for him from Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furt to Wittenberg, where he taught philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy; and his lectures were attended by many wiſe and learned men. He expounded the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gic and philoſophy of Ariſtotle, in the ſchools; and began to examine the old theology, in the churches.</p>
            <p>In the year 1512, he was ſent to Rome, to take up ſome controverſies which happened a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his order; and he conducted himſelf ſo well as to obtain the character of a prudent man. In ſhort, he ſucceeded in his buſineſs; for which he was made doctor and profeſſor of divinity, upon his return to Wittenberg. At Rome he ſaw the pope and court, and had an opportunity alſo of obſerving the manners of the clergy; whoſe haſty, ſuperficial, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious way of celebrating maſs, he has ſeverely noted. "I performed maſs, ſays he, at Rome; I ſaw it alſo performed by others, but in ſuch a manner, that I never think of it without the utmoſt horror." He often ſpoke afterwards of his journey to Rome, and uſed to ſay that
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:035737_0008_10064E5F49F96FB0"/>
               <q>He would not but have made it for a thouſand florins.</q> A monkiſh poet himſelf, upon the view of the barefaced iniquity of the popes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended holy city, could not help ſinging: <q>If you would live righteouſly, keep clear of Rome: For though her prieſts can licenſe every thing elſe, they allow of nothing good.</q>
            </p>
            <p>After this, he began to expound the epiſtle to the Romans, and the Pſalms; where he ſhewed the difference between the law and the goſpel. He refuted the error that was then predominant in ſchools and ſermons; that men may merit remiſſion of ſins by their own proper works. As John Baptiſt demonſtrated the Lamb of God which took away the ſins of the world: So Luther, ſhining in the church as a bright ſtar after an obſcure ſky, expreſsly ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that ſins are freely remitted for the love of the Son of God, and that we ought faithfully to embrace this bountiful gift.</p>
            <p>His life was correſpondent to his profeſſion and theſe happy beginnings of ſuch important matter, procured him great authority. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, he attempted no alteration in the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of religion, and interfered in no doubtful opinions: But contented himſelf with opening and declaring the doctrine of repentance, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> remiſſion of ſins, of faith, and of true comfort in times of adverſity. His doctrine was gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally approved by the learned, who conceived
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:035737_0009_10064E60D5AD5CB8"/>high pleaſure to behold Jeſus Chriſt, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and apoſtles, to emerge into the light out of darkneſs: whereby they began to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the difference between the law and the goſpel, between ſpiritual righteouſneſs and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil things. Eraſmus revived learning while Luther was teaching divinity at Wittenberg. The former brought the monks barbarous and ſophiſtical doctrine into contempt by his elegant work; which induced Luther to ſtudy the Greek and Hebrew languages, that, by draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the doctrine from the very fountains, he might paſs his judgment with more authority.</p>
            <p>The firſt opportunity that this great man had of unfolding to the view of a blinded and delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded age, the truth, which had ſtruck his aſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed ſight, was offered by a Dominican, whoſe name was John Tetzel. This bold and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing monk had been choſen, on account of his uncommon impudence, by Albert archbiſhop of Mentz and Magdeburg, to preach and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim, in Germany, thoſe famous indulgences of Leo X. which adminiſtered the remiſſion of all ſins, paſt, preſent and to come, however enormous their nature, to thoſe who were rich enough to purchaſe them. The frontleſs monk executed this iniquitous commiſſion not only with matchleſs inſolence, indecency, and fraud, but even carried his impiety ſo far as to dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate from the all-ſufficient power and influence of the merits of Chriſt. In deſcribing the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:035737_0010_10064E62814A17E8"/>efficacy of theſe indulgences, Tetzel ſaid among other enormities, that <hi>even had any one raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the mother of God, he</hi> (Tetzel) <hi>had where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal to efface his guilt.</hi> He alſo boaſted, that <q>
                  <hi>he had ſaved more ſouls from hell by thoſe</hi> IN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DULGENCES, <hi>than</hi> ST. PETER <hi>had converted to Chriſtianity by his preaching.</hi>
               </q> At this, Luther unable to ſmother his juſt indignation, raiſed his warning voice, and in ninety-five propoſitions, maintained publickly at Witten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg, on the 30th of September, in the year 1517, cenſured the extravagant extortion of theſe queſtors, and plainly pointed out the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man pontiff as a partaker of their guilt, ſince he ſuffered the people to be ſeduced, by ſuch delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, from placing their principal confidence in Chriſt, the only proper object of their truſt. This was the commencement and foundation of that memorable rupture and revolution in the church, which humbled the grandeur of the lordly pontiffs, and eclipſed ſo great a part of their glory.</p>
            <p>This debate between Luther and Tetzel was, at firſt, a matter of no great moment, and might have been terminated with the utmoſt facility, had Leo X. been diſpoſed to follow the healing method which common prudence muſt have naturally pointed out on ſuch an occaſion. For after all, this was no more than a private diſpute between two monks, concerning the extent of the pope's power with reſpect to the
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:035737_0011_10064E66C4545E30"/>remiſſion of ſin. Luther confeſſed that the Roman pontiff was clothed with the power of remitting the human puniſhments inflicted upon tranſgreſſors, i. e. the puniſhments denounced by the church, and its viſible head the biſhop of Rome; but he ſtrenuouſly denied that his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er extended to the remiſſion of the divine pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments allotted to offenders, either in this preſent, or in a future ſtate; affirming, on the contrary, that theſe puniſhments could only be removed by the merits of Chriſt. The doctrine of Tetzel was, indeed, directly oppoſite to the ſentiments of Luther; for this ſenſeleſs or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning monk aſſerted, that all puniſhments, preſent and future, human and divine, were ſubmitted to the authority of the Roman pontiff, and came within the reach of his abſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving power.</p>
            <p>The ſentiments of Luther were received with applauſe by the greateſt part of Germany, which had long groaned under the avarice of the pontiffs, and the extortions of their tax-gatherers, and had murmered grievouſly againſt the various ſtratagems that were daily put in practice, with the moſt front<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs impudence, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o flecce the rich, and to grind the faces of the poor. But the votaries of Rome were filled with horror, when they were infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of the opinions propagated by the Saxon reformer; more eſpecially the Dominicans, who looked upon their order as inſulted and
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:035737_0012_10064E68502A1F60"/>attacked in the perſon of Tetzel. The alarm of controverſy was therefore founded, and Tetzel himſelf appeared immediately in the field againſt Luther, whoſe ſentiments he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to refute in two academical diſcourſes, which he pronounced on occaſion of his promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the degree of doctor of divinity. In the year following two famous Dominicans, Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſter de Prierio and Hogſtrat, the former a native of Italy, and the latter a German, roſe up alſo againſt the adventurous reformer, and attacked him at Cologn with the utmoſt vehem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and ardour. Their example was ſoon followed by another formidable champion, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Eckius, a celebrated profeſſor of divinity at Ingolſtadt, and one of the moſt zeajous ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters of the Dominican order. Luther ſtood firm againſt theſe united adverſaries, and was neither vanquiſhed by their argnments, nor daunted by their talents and reputation: but anſwered their objections and refuted their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings with the greateſt ſtrength of evidence, and a becoming ſpirit of reſolution and perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. At the ſame time, however, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed himſelf by letters, written in the moſt ſubmiſſive and reſpectful terms, to the Roman pontiff and to ſeveral of the biſhops, ſhewing them the uprightneſs of his intentions, as well as the juſtice of his cauſe, and declaring his readineſs to change his ſentiments, as ſoon as he ſhould ſee them fairly proved to be erroneous.</p>

At firſt, Leo X. beheld this controverſy with indifference and contempt; but, being informed by the emperor Maximilian I not only of its importance, but alſo of the fatal diviſions it was likely to produce in Germany, he ſummoned Luther to appear before him at Rome, and there to plead the cauſe which he had underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to maintain. This papal ſummons was ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſeded by Frederick the wiſe, elector of Saxony, who pretended, that the cauſe of Luther belonged to the juriſdiction of a German tribunal, and that it was to be decided by the eccleſiaſtical laws of the empire. The pontiff yielded to the remonſtrances of this prudent and magnanimous prince, and ordered Luther to juſtify his intentions and doctrines before cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Cajetan, who was, at this time, legate at the diet of Augſburg. In this firſt ſtep the court of Rome gave a ſpecimen of that temerity and imprudence with which all its negociations, in this weighty affair, were afterwards conducted. For, inſtead of reconciling, nothing could tend more to inflame matters than the choice of Caje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, a Dominican, and, conſequently, the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red enemy of Luther, and friend of Tetzel, as judge and arbitrator in this nice and perilous controverſy.</p>
            <p>Luther, however, repaired to Augſburg, in the month of October 1518, and conferred, at three different meetings, with Cajetan himſelf, concerning the points in debate. But had he
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:035737_0014_10064E6D0A3937D0"/>even been diſpoſed to yield to the court of Rome, this imperious legate was, of all others, the moſt improper to encourage him in the execution of ſuch a purpoſe. The high ſpirit of Luther was not to be tamed by the arrogant dictates of mere authority: ſuch, however, were the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly methods of perſuaſion employed by the haughty cardinal. He, in an overbearing tone, deſired Luther to renounce his opinions, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Saxon reformer could not think of yielding to terms ſo unreaſonable in themſelves and ſo deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potically propoſed; ſo that the conferrence was abſolutely without effect. For Luther, finding his adverſary and judge inacceſſible to reaſon and argument, left Auſb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rg all of a ſudden, after having appealed from the preſent deciſions of the pontiff to thoſe which he ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce, when better informed; and, in this ſtep, he ſeemed yet to reſpect the dignity and authority of the biſhop of Rome. But Leo X. on the other hand, let looſe the reins to ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and deſpotiſm, and carried things to the utmoſt extremity; for, in the month of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember, this ſame year, he publiſhed a ſpecial edict, commanding his ſpiritual ſubjects to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge his <hi>power of delivering from all the puniſhments due to ſin and tranſgreſſion of every
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:035737_0015_100646D2DD7031A0"/>kind.</hi> As ſoon as Luther received information of this inconſiderate and violent meaſure, he perceived, plainly, that it would be impoſſible for him to bring the court of Rome to any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable terms; he therefore repaired to Written<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg, and, on the 28th of November, appealed from the pontiff to a general council.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the Roman pontiff became ſenſible of the imprudence he had been guilty of in entruſting Cajetan with ſuch a commiſſion, and endeavoured to mend the matter by em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying a man of more candour and impartialli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and better acquainted with buſineſs, in order to ſuppreſs the rebellion of Luther, and to engage that reformer to ſubmiſſion and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. This new legate was Charles Miltitz, a Saxon knight, who belonged to the court of Leo X. and whoſe lay-character expoſed him leſs to the prejudices that ariſe from a ſpirit of party, than if he had been clothed with the ſplendid purple, or the monaſtic frock. He was alſo a perſon of great prudence, penetrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and dexterity, and every way qualified for the execution of ſuch a nice and critical commiſſion as this was. Leo, therefore, ſent him into Saxony to preſent to Frederick the golden conſecrated <hi>roſe</hi> (which the pontiffs are uſed to beſtow, as a peculiar mark of diſtinction, on thoſe princes, for whom they have, or think proper to profeſs, an uncommon friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and eſteem), and to treat with Luther,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:035737_0016_10064E6FDF3E6DA8"/>not only about finiſhing his controverſy with Tetzel, but alſo concerning the methods of bringing about a reconciliation between him and the court of Rome. Nor, indeed, were the negociations of this prudent miniſter entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unſucceſsful; for in his firſt conference with Luther, at Altenburg, in the year 1519, he carried matters ſo far as to perſuade him to write a ſubmiſſive letter to Leo X. promiſing to obſerve a profound ſilence upon the matters in debate, provided that the ſame obligation ſhould be impoſed upon his adverſaries. This ſame year in the month of October, Miltitz had a ſecond conference with Luther in the caſtle of Leiben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werd, and a third the year following, at Lich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenberg. Theſe meetings, which were reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procally conducted with moderation and decency, gave great hopes of an approaching reconciliation; nor were theſe hopes ill found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But the violent proceedings of the enemies of Luther, and the arrogant ſpirit, as well as unaccountable imprudence, of the court of Rome, blaſted theſe fair expectations, and kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled anew the flames of diſcord.</p>
            <p>Tetzel, on the other hand, burthened with the iniquities of Rome, tormented with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs of his own injuſtice and extortions, ſtung with the approbrious cenſures of the new legate, and ſeeing himſelf equally deſpiſed and abhorred by both parties, died of grief and deſpair</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:035737_0017_10064E7168773CD8"/>
Had the court of Rome been prudent enough to have accepted of the ſubmiſſion made by Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they would have almoſt nipped in the bud the cauſe of the reformation, or would at leaſt, have conſiderably retarded its growth and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs.</p>
            <p>One of the circumſtances that contributed principally, at leaſt by its conſequences, to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the embaſſy of Miltitz ineffectual for the reſtoration of peace, was a famous controverſy of an incidental nature that was carried on at Leipſic, ſome weeks ſucceſſively, in the year 1519. A doctor named Eckius, who was one of the moſt eminent and zealous champions in the papal cauſe, happened to differ widely from Carloſtadt, the colleague and companion of Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in his ſentiments concerning Free-will. The firſt conflict was between Carloſtadt and Eckius concerning the powers and freedom of the human will; it was carried on in the caſtle of Pleiſſenburg, in preſence of a numerous and ſplendid audience, and was followed by a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute between Luther and Eckius concerning the authority and ſupermacy of the Roman pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff. This latter controverſy, which the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſituation of affairs rendered ſingularly nice and critical, was left undecided. Hoffman, at that time rector of the univerſity of Leipſic, and who had been alſo appointed judge of the arguments alledged on both ſides, refuſed to declare to whom the victory belonged; ſo that
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:035737_0018_10064E72F62EFCA8"/>the deciſion of this matter was referred to the univerſities of Paris and Erfurt.</p>
            <p>Among the ſpectators of this eccleſiaſtical combat was Philip Melancthon, at that time, profeſſor of Greek at Wittenburg, who had not, as yet, been involved in theſe diviſions (as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the mildneſs of his temper and his elegant taſte for polite literature rendered him averſe from diſputes of this nature), though he was the intimate friend of Luther, and approved his deſign of delivering the pure and primitive ſcience of theology from the darkneſs and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility of ſcholaſtic jargon.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the religious diſſenſions in Germany increaſed, inſtead of diminiſhing. For while Miltitz was treating with Luther in Saxony, in ſuch a mild and prudent manner as offered the faireſt proſpect of an approaching ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ccommodation, Eckius, inflamed with reſentment and fury on account of his defeat at Leipſic, repaired with the utmoſt precipitation to Rome, to accompliſh, as he imagined, the ruin of Luther. There, entering into a league with the Dominicans, who were in high credit at the papal court, and more eſpecially with their two zealous patrons, De Prierio and Cajetan, he earneſtly entreated Leo X. to level the thunder of his anathemas at the head of Luther, and to exclude him from the communion of the church. The Dominicans, deſirous of reveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the affront that, in their opinion, their
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:035737_0019_10064E751382A100"/>whole order had received by Luther's treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their brother Tetzel, and their patron Cajetan, ſeconded the furious efforts of Eckius againſt the Saxon reformer, and uſed their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt endeavours to have his requeſt granted. The pontiff, overcome by the importunity of theſe pernicious councellors, imprudently iſſued out a bull againſt Luther, dated the 15th of June, 1520, in which forty-one pretended he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies, extracted from his writings, were ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly condemned, his writings ordered to be publicly burnt, and in which he was again ſummoned, on pain of excommunication, to confeſs and retract his pretended errors within the ſpace of ſixty days, and to caſt himſelf upon the clemency and mercy of the pontiff.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as the account of this raſh ſentence, pronounced from the papal chair, was brought to Luther, he thought it was high time to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult both his preſent defence and future ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and the firſt ſtep he took for this purpoſe, was the renewal of his appeal from the ſentence of the Roman pontiff, to the more reſpectable deciſion of a general council. But as he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw that this appeal would be treated with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt at the court of Rome, and that when the time preſcribed for his recantation was elapſed, the thunder of excommunication would be le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled at his devoted head, he judged it prudent to withdraw himſelf voluntarily from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the church of Rome, before he was
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:035737_0020_10064E7984AA65A0"/>obliged to leave it by force; and thus to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this new bull of ejection a blow in the air, an exerciſe of authority without any object to act upon. At the ſame time, he was reſolved to execute this wiſe reſolution in a public manner, that his voluntary retreat from the communion of a corrupt and ſuperſtitious church might be univerſally known, before the lordly pontiff had prepared his ghoſtly thunder. With this view, on the 10th of December, in the year 1520, he had a pile of wood erected without the walls of the Wittenburg city, and there, in preſence of a prodigious multitude of people of all ranks and orders, he committed to the flames both the bull that had been publiſhed againſt him, and the decretals and cannons relating to the pope's ſupreme juriſdiction. By this he declared to the world, that he was no longer a ſubject to the Roman pontiff; and that, of conſequence, the ſentence of excommunication againſt him, which was daily expected from Rome, was entirely ſuperfluous and inſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant. It is not improbable, that Luther was directed, in this critical meaſure, by perſons well ſkilled in the law, who are generally dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous in furniſhing a perplexed client with nice diſtinctions and plauſible evaſions. Be that as it may, he ſeperated himſelf only from the church of Rome, which conſiders the pope as infallible, and not from the church, conſidered in a more extenſive ſenſe; for he ſubmitted to
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:035737_0021_10064E7B0E39DC68"/>the deciſion of the univerſal church, when that deciſion ſhould be given in a general council lawfully aſſembled. When this judicious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction is conſidered, it will not appear at all ſurpriſing, that many, even of the Roman ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholics, who weighed matters with a certain degree of impartiality and wiſdom, and were zealous for the maintainance of the liberties of Germany, juſtified this bold reſolution of Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. In leſs than a month after this noble and important ſtep had been taken by the Saxon reformer, a ſecond bull was iſſued out againſt him, on the 6th of January, 1521, by which he was expelled from the communion of the church, for having inſulted the majeſty, and diſowned the ſupremacy, of the Roman pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff.</p>
            <p>Such iniquitous laws, enacted againſt the perſon and doctrine of Luther, produced an effect different from what was expected by the imperious pontiff. Inſtead of intimidating this bold reformer, they led him to form the project of founding a church upon principles entirely oppoſite to thoſe of Rome, and to eſtabliſh, in it, a ſyſtem of doctrine and eccleſiaſtical diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, agreeable to the ſpirit and precepts of the goſpel of truth. This, indeed, was the only reſource Luther had left him; for to ſubmit to the orders of a cruel and inſolent enemy, would have been the greateſt degree of imprudence imaginable; and to embrace, anew, errors that
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:035737_0022_10064E7CB377D3B8"/>he had rejected with a juſt iudignation, and expoſed with the cleareſt evidence, would have diſcovered a want of integrity and principle, worthy only of the moſt abandoned profligate. From this time, therefore, he applied himſelf to the purſuit of the truth with ſtill more aſſidui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and fervour than he had formerly done; nor did he only review with attention, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm by new arguments, what he had hitherto taught, but went much beyond it, and made vigorous attacks upon the main ſtrong-hold of popery, the power and juriſdiction of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man pontiff, which he overturned from its very foundation. In this noble undertaking he was ſeconded by many learned and pious men, in various parts of Europe; by thoſe of the profeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors of the acadamy of Wittenburg, who had adopted his principles; and in a more eſpecial manner by the celebrated Melancthon. And as the fame of Luther's wiſdom and Melanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thon's learning had filled that acadamy with an incredible number of ſtudents, who flocked to it from all parts, this happy circumſtance pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated the principles of the reformation with an amazing rapidity through all the countries of Europe.</p>
            <p>Not long after the commencement of theſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, Maximilian I. had departed this life, and his grandſon Charles V. king of Spain, had ſucceeded him in the empire in the year 1519. Leo X. ſeized this new occaſion of venting and
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:035737_0023_10064E7E46B7D558"/>executing his vengeance, by putting the new emperor in mind of his character as <hi>advocate and defender of the church,</hi> and demanding the exemplary puniſhment of Luther, who had rebelled againſt its ſacred laws and inſtitutions. On the other hand, Frederick the Wiſe employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his credit with Charles to prevent the publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of any unjuſt edict againſt this reformer, and to have his cauſe tried by the canons of the Germanic church, and the laws of the empire. This requeſt was ſo much the more likely to be granted, that Charles was under much greater obligations to Frederick, than to any other of the German princes, as it was chiefly by his zealous and important ſervices that he had been raiſed to the empire, in oppoſition to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions of ſuch a formidable rival as Francis I. king of France. The emperor was ſenſible of his obligations to the worthy elector, and was entirely diſpoſed to ſatisfy his demands. That, however, he might do this without diſpleaſing the Roman pontiff, he reſolved that Luther ſhould be called before the council, that was to be aſſembled at Worms in the year 1521, and that his cauſe ſhould be there publicly heard, before any final ſentence ſhould be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt him. When ſome of his friends, informed of the violent deſigns of the Roman court, and alarmed by the bull that had been publiſhed againſt him by the raſh pontiff, advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him not to expoſe his perſon at the diet of
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:035737_0024_10064E82F9F67C58"/>Worms, notwithſtanding the imperial ſafe-conduct (which, in a ſimilar caſe, had not been ſufficient to protect John Huſs and Jerome of Prague from the perfidy and curelty of their enemies), he anſwered with his uſual intrepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, that <hi>were he obliged to encounter at Worms as many devils as there were tiles upon the hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of that city, this would not deter him from his fixed purpoſe of appearing there; that fear, in his caſe, could be only a ſuggeſtion of Satan, who apprehended the approaching ruin of his kingdom, and who was willing to avoid a public defeat before ſuch a grand aſſembly as the diet of Worms.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Luther, therefore, appeared at Worms, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured againſt the violence of his enemies by a ſafe-conduct from the emperor, and, on the 17th of April, and the day following, pleaded his cauſe before that grand aſſembly with the utmoſt reſolution and preſence of mind. The united power of threatnings and entreaties were employed to conquer the firmneſs of his purpoſe, to engage him to renounce the propoſitions he had hitherto maintained, and to bend him to a ſubmiſſion to the Roman pontiff. But he refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed all this with a noble obſtinacy, and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſolemnly, that he would neither abandon his opinions, nor change his conduct, until he was previouſly convinced, by the word of God, or the dictates of right reaſon, that his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were erroneous, and his conduct unlawful
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:035737_0025_10064E8488E13180"/>When therefore neither promiſes nor threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings could ſhake the conſtancy of this magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous reformer, he obtained, indeed, from the emperor the liberty of returning, unmoleſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to his home; but after his departure from the diet, he was condemned by the unanimous ſuffrages both by the emperor and the princes, and was declared an enemy of the holy Roman empire. Frederick, who law the ſtorm riſing againſt Luther, uſed the beſt precautions to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure him from its violence. For this purpoſe he ſent three or four perſons, in whom he could confide, to meet him on his return from the diet, in order to conduct him to a place of ſafety. Theſe emiſſaries, diſguiſed by maſks, executed their commiſſion with the utmoſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy and ſucceſs. Meeting with Luther, near Eyſenac, they ſeized him, and carried him into the caſtle of Wertenburg, not, as ſome have imagined upon probable grounds, was this done without the knowledge of his Imperial majeſty. In this retreat, which he called his Patmos, the Saxon reformer lay con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed during the ſpace of ten months, and emploved this involuntary leiſure in compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that were afterwards uſeful to the world.</p>
            <p>The active ſpirit of Luther could not howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, long bear this confinement; he therefore left his Patinos in the month of March, of the year 1522, without the conſent, or even the knowledge, of his patron and protector Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:035737_0026_10064E86147551E8"/>and repaired to Wittenburg. One of the principal motives that engaged him to take this bold ſtep, was the information he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of the inconſiderate conduct of Carloſtadt, and ſome other friends of the reformation, who had already excited tumults in Saxony, and were acting in a manner equally prejudicial to the tranquility of the ſtate, and the true inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts of the church. Luther oppoſed the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuoſity of this imprudent reformer with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt fortitude and dignity; and to theſe pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent admonitions this excellent reformer added the influence of example, by applying himſelf with redoubled induſtry and zeal, to his German tranſlation of the Holy Scriptures, which he carried on with expedition and ſucceſs, with the aſſiſtance of ſome learned and pious men, whom he conſulted in this great and important undertaking. The event abundantly ſhewed the wiſdom of Luther's advice. For the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent parts of this tranſlation, being ſucceſſively and gradually ſpread abroad among the people, produced ſudden and almoſt incredible effects, and exterpated, root and branch, the erroneous principles and ſuperſtitions doctrines of the church of Rome from the minds of a prodigious number of perſons.</p>
            <p>While theſe things were tranſacting, Leo X. departed this life, and was ſucceeded in the pontificate by Adrian VI. a native of Utrecht. This pope, who had formerly been preceptor
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:035737_0027_10064E89EB727790"/>to Charles V. and who owed his new dignity to the good offices of that prince, was a man of probity and candour, who acknowledged inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niouſly that the church laboured under the moſt fatal diſorders, and declared his willingneſs to apply the remedies that ſhould be judged the moſt adapted to heal them. He began his pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate by ſending a legate to the diet, which was aſſembled at Nuremberg in 1522. Francis Cheregato, the perſon who was intruſted with this commiſſion, had poſitive orders to demand the ſpeedy and vigorous execution of the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that had been pronounced againſt Luther and his followers at the diet of Worms; but, at the ſame time, he was authoriſed to declare that the pontiff was ready to remove the abuſes and grievances that had armed ſuch a formidable enemy againſt the ſee of Rome. The princes of the empire, encouraged by this declaration on the one hand, and by the abſence of the emperor, who, at this time, reſided in Spain, on the other, ſeized this opportunity of propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the ſummoning a general council in Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, in order to deliberate upon the proper methods of bringing about an univerſal refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the church. They exhibited, at the ſame time, an hundred articles, containing the heavieſt complaints of the injurious treatment the Germans had hitherto received from the court of Rome, and, by a public law, prohib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ited all innovation in religions matters, until a
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:035737_0028_10064E8D004F5498"/>general council ſhould decide what was to be done in an affair of ſuch high moment and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance.</p>
            <p>The pope Adrian did not long enjoy the pleaſure of ſitting at the head of the church. He died in the year 1523, and was ſucceeded by Clement VII. a man of a reſerved character, and prone to artifice. This pontiff ſent to the imperial diet at Nuremberg, in the year 1524, a cardinal-legate, named Campegius, whoſe orders, with reſpect to the affairs of Luther, breathed nothing but ſeverity and violence, and who inveighed againſt the lenity of the German princes in delaying the execution of the decree of Worms, while he carefully avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſmalleſt mention of the promiſe Adrian had made to reform the corruptions of a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious church. The emperor ſeconded the demands of Campegius by the orders he ſent to his miniſter to inſiſt upon the execution of the ſentence which had been pronounced againſt Luther and his adherents at the diet of Worms. The princes of the empire, tired out by theſe importunities and remonſtrances, changed in appearance the law they had paſſed, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed it in reality. For while they promiſed to obſerve, as far as was poſſible, the edict of Worms, they, at the ſame time, renewed their demands of a general council, and left all other matters in diſpute to be examined and decided at the diet that was ſoon to be aſſembled at
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:035737_0029_10064E8E8BA39188"/>Spire. The pope's legate, on the other hand, perceiving by theſe proceedings, that the German princes in general were no enemies to the reformation, retired to Ratiſbon, with the biſhops and thoſe of the princes that adhered to the cauſe of Rome, and there drew from them a new declaration, by which they engaged themſelves to execute rigorouſly the edict of Worms in their reſpective dominions.</p>
            <p>While the efforts of Luther towards the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of the church were daily crowned with growing ſucceſs, and almoſt all the nations ſeemed diſpoſed to open their eyes upon the light, two unhappy occurrences, one of a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, and the other of a domeſtic nature, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed greatly to retard the progreſs of this ſalutary and glorious work. The domeſtic, or internal incident, was a controverſy concerning the manner in which the body and blood of Chriſt were preſent in the euchariſt, that aroſe among thoſe whom the Roman pontiff had publicly excluded from the communion of the church, and unhappily produced among the friends of the good cauſe the moſt deplorable animoſities and diviſions. Luther and his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, though they had rejected the monſtrous doctrine of the church of Rome with reſpect to the <hi>tranſubſtatiation,</hi> or change of the bread and wine into the body and blood of Chriſt, were nevertheleſs of opinion, that the partakers of the Lord's ſupper received, along with the
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:035737_0030_10064E90186BB198"/>bread and wine, the real body and blood of Chriſt. Carloſtadt, who was Luther's colleague, underſtood the matter quite other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, and his doctrine, which was afterwards illuſtrated and confirmed by Zoinglius with much more ingenuity than he had propoſed it, amounted to this: <q>That the body and blood of Chriſt were not <hi>really</hi> preſent in the euchariſt; and that the bread and wine were no more than external <hi>ſigns,</hi> and <hi>ſymbols,</hi> deſigned to excite in the minds of Chriſtians, the remembrance of the ſufferings and death of the divine Saviour, and of the benefits which ariſe from it.</q> This opinion was embraced by all the friends of the reformation in Switzerland, and by a conſiderable number of its votaries in Germany. On the other hand, Luther maintained his doctrine, in relation to this point, with the utmoſt obſtinacy; and hence aroſe, in the year 1524, a tedious and vehement controverſy, which not withſtanding the zealous endeavours that were uſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile the contending parties, terminated, at length in a fatal diviſion between thoſe who had embarked together in the ſacred cauſe of religion and liberty.</p>
            <p>To theſe inteſtine diviſions were added the horrors of a civil war, which was the fatal ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of oppreſſion on the one hand, and of enthuſiaſim on the other; and, by its unhappy conſequences, was prejudicial to the cauſe and
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:035737_0031_10064E93F736AC90"/>progreſs of the reformation. In the year 1525, a prodigious multitude of ſeditions fanaticks a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe like a whirlwind, all of a ſudden, in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent parts of Germany, took arms, united their forces, waged war againſt the laws, the magiſtrates, and the empire in general, laid waſte the country with fire and ſword, and exhibited daily the moſt horrid ſpectacles of unrelenting barbarity. The greateſt part of this furious and formidable mob was compoſed of peaſants and vaſſals, who groaned under hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy burthens, and declared they were no longer able to bear the deſpotic ſeverity of their chiefs; and hence this ſedition was called the <hi>Ruſtic war,</hi> or the war of the peaſants. But no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er had the enthuſiaſt Munzer put himſelf at the head of this outrageous rabble, than the face of things changed entirely, and by the inſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this man, who had deceived numbers before this time by his pretended viſions and inſpirations, the civil commotions in Saxony and Thuringia were ſoon directed towards a new object, and were turned into a religious war. The ſentiments, however, of this ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and diſſolute multitude were greatly divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and their demands were very different. Luther, ſufficiently defended both his principles and his cauſe againſt this turbulent ſect, by the advice he addreſſed to the princes of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire to take arms againſt them. And, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, in the year 1525, this odious faction
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:035737_0032_10064E97299124D0"/>faction was defeated and deſtroyed, in a pitched battle fought at Mulhauſen; and Munzer, their ringleader, taken, and put to death.</p>
            <p>Luther laid aſide the friar's habit in October, 1524; and married Catharine de Bore, a lady of noble deſcent, who, with eight other nuns, was taken out of the nunnery at Nimptſchen in 1523, and carried to Wittenburg, by Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard Coppen, of Torgan. Luther vindicated that action, and intended to marry Catharine to Glacious miniſter of Ortamunden, whoſe perſon ſhe diſliked; and ſo Luther married her himſelf, on the 13th of June, 1525, without conſulting his friends: But Luther ſays, he took a wife in obedience to his father's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. Luther was then forty-two, and his wife was twenty-ſix. He was ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſhamed of entering into the holy ſtate of matrimony, that he exorted the elector of Mentz, and the grand maſter of the Teutonic order, to follow his example; which was done by the latter, notwithſtanding, the cenſure of the Romaniſts. This grand maſter was Albert margrave of Brandenburg, for whom that part of Pruſſia which belonged to the Teutonic or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was formed into a ſecular duty.—He em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced the Lutheran religion, renounced his vow of celibacy, and married Anna Maria of Brunſwick. He afterwards conformed to the Augſburg confeſſion, and founded an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity at Koningſberg, in 1544, that the proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:035737_0033_10064E98B2F87258"/>religion might be introduced and eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Pruſſia, and all the profeſſors were to be Lutherians. In thoſe times, marriage ſoon became a recommendation among the reformers, and was a certain proof that they had abjured popery; for if a converted clergyman did not marry he cauſed a ſuſpicion that he had not renounced the doctrine of celibacy.</p>
            <p>Luther was very fond of his wife, and uſed to call her his Catharine. She was handſome and modeſt: But he profeſſed himſelf, that one great reaſon which induced him to marry was, to give an example of the doctrine he preached againſt celibacy, and to ſhew, that he was not afraid or aſhamed to do himſelf, what he exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and enjoined in others.</p>
            <p>While the fanatical inſurrection raiſed in Germany, Frederick the wiſe elector of ſaxony, departed this life. This excellent prince, whoſe character was diſtinguiſhed by an uncommon degree of prudence and moderation, had, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his life, been a ſort of mediator between the Roman pontiff and the reformer of Witten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg. The elector John, his brother and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor, acted in a quite different manner. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the truth of Luther's doctrine, and perſuaded that it muſt loſe ground and be ſoon ſuppreſſed if the deſpotic authority of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man pontiff remained undiſputed and entire, he, without heſitation or delay, aſſumed to
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:035737_0034_10064E9A42615C18"/>himſelf the ſupremacy in eccleſiaſtical matters, and founded and eſtabliſhed a church in his dominions, totally different from the church of Rome, in doctrine, diſcipline, and government. To bring this new and happy eſtabliſhment to as great a degree of perfection as was poſſible, this reſolute and active prince ordered a body of new laws, relating to the form of eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal government, the method of public worſhip, and other matters of that nature, to be drawn up by Luther and Melancthon, and promulgated by heralds throughout his dominions in the year 1527. The illuſtrious example of this elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or was followed by all the princes and ſtates of Germany, who renounced the papal ſupremacy and juriſdiction; and a like form of worſhip, diſcipline, and government was thus introduced into all the churches, which diſſented from that of Rome. Hence was an open rupture formed between the German princes, of whom oue party embraced the reformation, and the other adhered to the ſuperſtitions of their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers.</p>
            <p>Things being reduced to this violent and troubled ſtate, the patrons of popery gave inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, that were far from being ambiguous, of their intention to make war upon the Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theran party, and to ſuppreſs by force a doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine which they were incapable of overturning by argument; and this deſign would certainly
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:035737_0035_10064E9C2C8C3490"/>have been put in execution, had not the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of Europe diſconcerted their meaſures. The Lutherans, on the other hand, informed of theſe hoſtile intentions, began alſo to delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate upon the moſt effectual methods of defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves againſt ſuperſtition armed with violence, and formed the plan of a confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy that might anſwer this prudent purpoſe. In the mean time the diet aſſembled at Spire, in the year 1526, at which Ferdinand, the emperors brother, preſided, ended in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner more favourable to the friends of the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, than they could naturally expect. The emperors embaſſadors at this diet were ordered to uſe their moſt earneſt endeavours for the ſuppreſſion of all farther diſputes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning religion, and to inſiſt upon the rigour-ous execution of the ſentence that had been pronounced at Worms againſt Luther and his followers. The greateſt part of the German princes oppoſed this motion with the utmoſt reſolution, declaring, that they could not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute that ſentence, nor come to any determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation with reſpect to the doctrines by which it had been occaſioned, before the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was ſubmitted to the cognizance of a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral council lawfully aſſembled; alledging far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that the deciſion of controverſies of this kind belonged properly to ſuch a council, and to it alone. This opinion after long and warm
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:035737_0036_10064EA0539221C0"/>debates, was adopted by a great majority, and, at length, conſented to by the whole aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.</p>
            <p>Nothing could be more favourable to thoſe who had the cauſe of pure and genuine Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity at heart, than a reſolution of this nature. For the emperor was, at this time, ſo entirely taken up in regulating the troubled ſtate of his dominions in France, Spain, and Italy, which exhibited, from day to day, new ſcenes of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity, that, for ſome years, it was not in his power to turn his attention to the affairs of Germany in general, and ſtill leſs to the ſtate of religion in particular, which was beſet with difficulties, that, to a political prince like Charles, muſt have appeared peculiarly critical and dangerous. Beſides, had the emperor real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been poſſeſſed of leiſure to form, or of power to execute, a plan that might terminate, in ſavour of the Roman pontiff, the religious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes which reigned in Germany, it is evident, that the inclination was wanting, and that Clement VII. who now ſat in the papal chair, had nothing to expect from the good offices of Charles V. For this pontiff, after the defeat of Francis I. at the battle of Pavia, filled with uneaſy apprehenſions of the growing power of the emperor in Italy, entered into a confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy with the French and the Venetians againſt that prince. And this meaſure inflamed the reſentment and indignation of Charles to ſuch
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:035737_0037_10064EA1DB3C80F0"/>a degree, that he ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>liſhed the papal authority in his Spaniſh dominions, made war upon the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pe in Italy, laid ſiege to Rome in the year 1527, blocked up Clement in the caſtle of St. Angelo, and expoſed him to the moſt ſevere and contumelius treatment. Theſe critical events, together with the liberty granted by the diet of Spire, were prudently and induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly improved, by the friends of the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to the advantage of their cauſe, and to the augmentation of their number. In the mean time, Luther and his fellow-labourers, particularly thoſe who were with him at Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenberg, by their writings, their inſtructions, their admonitions and counſels, inſpired the timorous with fortitude, diſpelled the doubts of the ignorant, fixed the principles and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the floating and inconſtant, and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated all the friends of genuine Chriſtianity with a ſpirit ſuitable to the grandeur of their undertaking.</p>
            <p>But the tranquility and liberty they enjoyed, in conſequence of the reſolutions taken in the firſt diet of Spare, were not of a long duration. They were interrupted by a new diet aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, in the year 1529, in the ſame place, by the emperor, after he had appeaſed the commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and troubles which had employed his attention in ſeveral parts of Europe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded a treaty of peace with Clement VII. This prince, having now got rid of the burthen
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:035737_0038_10064EA3749F6B98"/>that had, for ſome time, overwhelmed him, had leiſure to direct the affairs of the church; and this the reformers ſoon felt, by a diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able experience. For the power, which had been granted by the former diet to every prince, of managing eccleſiaſtical matters as they thought proper; until the meeting of a general council, was now revoked by a majority of votes. This decree was juſtly conſidered as iniquirous and intolerable by the elector of Saxony, the landgrave of Heſſe, and the other members of the diet, who were perſuaded of the neceſſity of a reformation in the church. Therefore, when the princes and members now mentioned found that all their arguments and remonſtrances againſt this unjuſt decree made no impreſſion upon Ferdinand, nor upon the abettors of the ancient ſuperſtitions, they enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſolemn proteſt againſt this decree on the 19th of April, and appealed to the emperor and to a future council. Hence aroſe the denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> which from this period has been given to thoſe who renounce the ſuperſtitious communion of the church of Rome.</p>
            <p>The miniſters of the churches, which had embraced the ſentiments of Luther, were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring a new embaſſy to the emperor, when an account was received of a deſign formed by that prince to come into Germany, with a view to terminate, in the approaching diet at Augſburg,
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:035737_0039_10064EA518DDFB68"/>the religious diſputes that had produced ſuch animoſities and diviſions in the empire. Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto, indeed; it was not eaſy for the emperor to form a clear idea of the matters in debate, ſince their was no regular ſyſtem as yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, of the doctrines embraced by Luther and his followers, by which their real opinions, and the true cauſes of their oppoſition to the Roman pontiff, night be known with certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. As, therefore, it was impoſſible, without ſome declaration of this nature, to examine with accuracy, or decide with equity, a matter of ſuch high importance as that which gave riſe to the diviſions between the votaries of Rome. Luther, in compliance with this order, deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the elector, at Torgaw, the ſeventeen articles, which had been drawn up and agreed on in the conference at Sulzbach in the year 1529; and hence they were called the <hi>Articles of Torgaw.</hi> Though theſe articles were deemed by Luther a ſufficient declaration of the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the reformers, yet it was judged pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to enlarge them; and, by a judicious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail, to give perſpicuity to their arguments, and thereby ſtrength to their cauſe. It was this conſideration that engaged the proteſtant princes, aſſembled at Coburg and Augſburg, to employ Melancthon in extending theſe arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, in which important work he ſhewed a due regard to the counſels of Luther, and expreſſed
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:035737_0040_10064EA8404FB258"/>his ſentiments and doctrine with the greateſt elegance and perſpicuity.</p>
            <p>Charles V. arrived at Augſburg the 15th of June 1530, and on the 20th, the diet was opened. As it was unanimouſly agreed, that the affairs of religion ſhould be brought upon the carpet before the deliberations relating to the intended war with the Turks, the <hi>proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant</hi> members of this great aſſembly received from the emperor a formal permiſſion to preſent to the diet, on the 25th of June, an account of their religious principles and tenets. In conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of this, the chancellor of Saxony, read, in the German language, in preſence of the emperor and aſſembled princes, the famous confeſſion, which has been ſince diſtinguiſhed by the denomination of the <hi>Confeſſion of Augſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg.</hi> The princes heard it with the deepeſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and recollection of mind; it confirmed ſome in the principles they had embraced, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed others, and many, who, before this time, had little or no idea of the religious ſentiments of Luther, were now not only convinced of their innocence, but were moreover, delighted with their purity and ſimplicity.</p>
            <p>The tenor and contents of the confeſſion of Augſburg are well known. The ſtyle that reigns in it is plain, elegant, grave, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous, ſuch as becomes the nature of the ſubject. The matter was, undoubtedly, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by Luther, who, during the diet, reſided
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:035737_0041_10064EAB77888998"/>Coburg, a town in the neighbourhood of Augſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg; and, even the form it received from the elegant pen of his colleague, was authoriſed in conſequence of his approbation and advice. This <hi>confeſſion</hi> contains twenty-eight chapters, of which the greateſt part are employed in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting, with perſpicuity a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d truth, the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious opinions of the proteſtants, and the reſt in pointing out the errors and abuſes that occaſioned their ſeparation from the church of Rome.</p>
            <p>The creatures of the Roman pontiff, who were preſent at this diet, employed John Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, afterwards biſhop of Vienna, together with Eckius, and another doctor, named Cochlaeus, to draw up a refutation of this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous confeſſion. This pretended refutation having been read publickly in the aſſembly, the emperor demanded of the proteſtant members that they would acquieſce in it, and put an end to their religious debates by an unlimited ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the doctri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es and opinions contained in this anſwer. But this demand was far from being complied with. The proteſtants declared, on the contrary, that they were by no means ſatisfied with the reply of their adverſaries, and earneſtly deſired a copy of it, that they might demonſtrate more fully its extreme inſufficiency and weakneſs. This reaſonable requeſt was refuſed by the emperor, who, on this occaſion, as well as on ſeveral others, ſhewed more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:035737_0042_10064EAD0984A540"/>to the importunity of the pope's legate and his party, than to the demands of equity, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, and juſtice.</p>

In the year 1530, and the year following, they met, firſt at ſmalcald, afterwards at Frankfort, and formed a ſolemn alliance and confederacy, with the intention of defending vigorouſly their religion and liberties againſt the dangers and encroachments with which they were menaced. Amidſt theſe emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and preparations, which portended an approaching rupture, the elector Palatine, and the elector of Mentz, offered their mediation, and endeavoured to reconcile the contending princes.</p>
            <p>Many projects of reconciliation were propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; and after various negociations, a treaty of peace was concluded at Nuremberg, in the year 1532, between the emperor and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant princes, on the following conditions; that the latter ſhould furniſh a ſubſidy for car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on the war againſt the Turks, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge Ferdinand lawful king of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans; and that the emperor, on his part, ſhould abrogate and annul the edicts of Worms and Augſburg, and allow the Lutherans the free unmoleſted exerciſe of their religious doctrine and diſcipline, until a rule of faith was fixed either in the free general council that was to be aſſembled in the ſpace of ſix months, or in a diet of the empire.</p>
            <p>The religious truce, concluded at Nurem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg, inſpired with new vigour and reſolution all the friends of the reformation. It gave
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:035737_0044_10064EB35236CFB0"/>ſtrength to the feeble, and perſeverance to the bold. Encouraged by it, thoſe who had been hitherto only ſecret enem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>About the beginning of the year 1527. Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was attacked by a very ſevere illneſs, which brought him near to his grave. He ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied himſelf to prayer, made a confeſſion of his faith, and lamented grievouſly his on worthineſs of martyrdom, which he had ſo of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>en and ſo ardently deſired. In this ſituation he made a will, for he had a ſon, and his wife was again with child, in which he recommended his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily to the care of heaven: <q>Lord God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſays he, I thank thee, that thou wouldeſt have me poor on earth and a beggar. I have neither houſe, nor land, nor poſſeſſions, nor money, to leave. Thou haſt given me a wife and children: Take them, I beſeech thee, under thy care and preſerve them, as thou haſt preſerved me,</q> He bequeathed his deteſtation of popery to his friends and bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; agreeably to what he often uſed to ſay, i. e. Living, I was the plague of the pope; and dying, I ſhall be his death.</p>
            <p>Luther, from about this period, having laid
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:035737_0045_10064EB4DED6B6E0"/>the great foundation of the reformation, was chiefly employed in raiſing and completing the ſuperſtructure. The remainder of his life was ſpent, in exhorting princes, ſtates, and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, to confirm the great work, which had been brought about through him; and in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing from time to time ſuch writings, as might encourage, direct, and aſſiſt them in doing it. The emperor threatened temporal puniſhment with armies; and the pope eternal pains with bulls and corſes; but Luther, arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the intrepidity of grace, over and above his own courageous nature, regarded neither the one nor the other. His friend and aſſiſtant Melancthon could not be ſo indifferent; for Melancthon had a great deal of ſoftneſs, moderation and diffidence in his conſtitution, which made him very uneaſy and alarmed at theſe formidable appearances. Hence we find many of Luther's letters were written on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to comfort him under theſe anxieties: <q>I am (ſays he in one of theſe letters) much weaker than you in private confl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

You are all diſtruſt in the public cauſe; I, on the contrary, am very confident; becauſe I know it is a juſt and true cauſe, the cauſe of God and of Chriſt, which need not tremble or be abaſhed. But the
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:035737_0046_10064EB66800C4B8"/>caſe is different with me in my private con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts, feeling myſelf a moſt miſerable ſinner, and therefore have great reaſon to lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Luther preached his laſt ſermon at Witten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg on the ſeventeenth of January, 1546; and, on the twentythird, ſet out for Iſleben, where he was honorable entertained by the count, who eſcorted him to his apartments with one hundred horſe. Luther attended the buſineſs upon which he came from the twenty-ninth
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:035737_0047_10064EB88E38DA98"/>of January, to the ſeventeenth of Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, when he ſickened a little before ſupper of his uſual illneſs. This was an oppreſſion of humors in the opening of the ſtomach, with which Melancthon, who was with him, had ſeen him frequently afflicted. His pain increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and he went to bed, were he ſlept till mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, when he awaked in ſuch anguiſh that he found his life was near at an end. He then prayed in theſe words: <q>I pray God to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the doctrine of his goſpel among us; for the pope and the council of Trent have grievous things in hand.</q> After which, he ſaid, <q>O heavenly Father, my gracious God, and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, thou God of all conſolation, I give thee hearty thanks that thou haſt revealed to me thy Son Jeſus Chriſt, whom I believe, whom I profeſs, whom I love, whom I glorify, and whom the pope and the multitude of the wicked do perſecute and diſhonour.—I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee Lord Jeſus Chriſt, receive my ſoul. O my heavenly Father, though I be taken out of this life, and muſt lay down this frail body; yet I certainly know, that I ſhall live with thee eternally, and that I cannot be taken out of thy hands. <hi>God ſo loved the world, &amp;c.</hi> Lord, I render up my ſpirit into, thy hands, and come to thee. Lord, into thy hands I commend my ſpirit: Thou, O God of truth, haſt redeemed me!</q> Albert
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:035737_0048_10064EBDAD68F830"/>count of Mansfield, Melancthon, Juſtus Jonas, and ſeveral other friends, attended him in his laſt moments, joining him in prayer, that God would preſerve the doctrine of his goſpel among them. Melancthon ſays of Luther, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving frequently repeated his prayers, he was called to God, <q>unto whom he ſo faithfully commended his ſpirit, to enjoy, no doubt, the bleſſed ſociety of the patriarchs, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and apoſtles, in the kingdom of God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Luther died on the eighteenth of February, 1546, in the ſixty-fourth year of his age. A thouſand fables have been invented concerning his death; nor would his enemies forbear pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing lies on this ſubject long after he had left this world. Some have ſaid, that he died ſuddenly; others that he killed himſelf; and ſome have impudently proceeded ſo far as to give out that he was taken away by the devil. Nor are they people of mean figure and credit, who vent theſe calumnies, but the moſt famous writers, as Cochlaeus, Beſſaeus, Bozius, Fabia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, Juſtinian, and Bellarmine. This, ſays Bayle, reflects on the whole body of popery; for ſuch fables ought not to paſs the preſs. He was honourably interred at Wittenberg.</p>
            <p>Luther left a widow, three ſons, and two daughters. Whilſt the troops of Charles V. were at Wittenberg, in the year 1547, the
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:035737_0049_10064EBF373CBF40"/>Spaniards ſolicited the emperor to pull down Luther's monument, and wanted to dig up his bones; But the emperor had more generoſity and prudence, than to conſent to a procedure ſo baſe and infamous.</p>
            <p>His commentary on the epiſtle to the Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, was his favourite work, which he uſed to call his wife, his Catharine de Bore.</p>
            <p>His favourite doctrine was juſtification by faith alone, and not by works, moral, legal, or evangelical: But we muſt do him the juſtice to obſerve, that he perpetually inculcated the abſolute neceſſity of good works. According to him, a man is juſtified only by faith; but he cannot be juſtified without works; and where thoſe works are not to be found, there is aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly no true faith.</p>
            <p>It has alſo been ſaid of Luther, that it was a great miracle a poor friar ſhould be able to ſtand againſt the pope: It was a greater that he ſhould prevail: And the greateſt of all that he died in peace, as well as Eraſmus, when ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded by ſo many enemies.</p>
            <p>The doctrine of this eminent divine, and great reformer; was ſoon extended through all Germany, Denmark, Sweden, England, and other countries, under different modifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>Luther's works were collected after his death, and printed at Wittenberg in ſeven volumes folio.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="51" facs="unknown:035737_0050_10064EC0D3143378"/>
Our ſerious readers will, perhaps, be pleaſed with the inſertion of ſome remarkable ſayings and obſervations of this great man. Eraſmus confeſſed, <q>that there more ſolid divinity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in one leaf of Luther's commentaries, than could be found in many prolix treatiſes of ſchoolmen, and ſuch kind of authors.</q> Speaking of the pope's uſing the maſs for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted ſouls, Luther obſerved, that <q>he with his maſs was not ſatisfied to thruſt himſelf into all corners of the earth, but he muſt needs go tumbling down into the very boſom of hell.</q>
            </p>
            <p>He uſed to call the indulgence-merchants, <hi>purſe threſhers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There were many plots laid againſt his life, which the bloody papiſts ſought after by all means. Poiſen, daggers, piſtols, were inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; when fire and faggot could not be uſed, through the elector's protection. A Poliſh Jew was hired for 2000 crowns to poiſon him. <q>The plot (ſays Luther) was diſcovered to me by the letters of my friends. He is a doctor of phyſic, and dares to attempt any thing; He would go about this buſineſs with incredible craft and agility. He is juſt now apprehended.</q>—However, God preſerved him from the malice of his enemies. It ſhews, however, what papiſts can attempt (ſays Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chior Adam); and if we wanted further proof of it, the words of Alexander, the pope's legate,
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:035737_0051_10064EC260491748"/>are ſufficient. <q>Though you Germans (ſaid he), who pay the leaſt of all people to the Roman ſee, have ſhaken of the pope's yoke; yet we will take care, that ye ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured with civil wars, and periſh in your own blood.</q>—A pious reſolution indeed!</p>
            <p>When Luther's bold manner of expreſſing himſelf was cenſured, he replied; <q>Almoſt all men condemn my tartneſs of expreſſion; but I am of your opinion, (ſays he to his friend) that God will have the deceits of men thus powerfully expoſed. For I plainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that thoſe things, which are ſoftly dealt with in our corrupt age, give people but light concern, and are preſently forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.—If I have exceeded the bounds of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, the monſtrous turpitude of the times has tranſported me. Nor do I tranſcend the example of Chriſt, who, having to do with men of like manners, called them ſharply by their own proper names, ſuch as, <hi>an adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and perverſe generation, a brood of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, hypocrites, children of the devil, who could not eſcape the damnation of hell.</hi>
               </q>—Eraſmus, with all his refinement, could own, <q>That God had ſent in Luther a ſharp phyſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, in conſideration of the immenſity of the diſeaſes, which had infected this laſt age of the world.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Luther cauſed the Pſalms, uſed in worſhip, to be tranſlated into German. <q>We intend
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:035737_0052_10064EC6C13BFAA0"/>(ſays he to Spalatinus), after the example of the prophets and primitive father's of the church, to turn the Pſalms, for ſpiritual ſinging, into the vulgar tongue for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people; ſo that the word of God may remain among the people even in their ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Upon this account, we ſeek for ſome poets: And as you poſſeſs the copiouſneſs and elegenoe of the German, which you have greatly cultivated; I would requeſt your aſſiſtance in this buſineſs. Let the ſenſe be clear, and as cloſe as poſſible to the original. To preſerve the ſenſe, when you cannot render word for word, it may be right to uſe ſuch a phraſe as will moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly convey the idea. I confeſs, I am not ſufficiently qualified myſelf; and therefore would requeſt you to try how near you can approach to Heman, Aſaph, and Jeduthun.</q>
            </p>
            <p>He uſed to ſay of himſelf and the other mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters; <q>We are only planters and waterers, in adminiſtering the word and ſacrament; but the increaſe is not in our power.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Concerning our righteouſneſs, he obſerved; <q>Thou, Lord Jeſus, art my righteouſneſs: but I am altogether ſin; Thou haſt taken what was mine, and haſt given me what was thine; thou haſt taken what thou waſt not and haſt given me what I had not before.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Reſpecting ceremonies, he ſaid; <q>I co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>With regard to human learning, he thus expreſſed himſelf; <q>I am perſuaded, that true divinity could not well be ſupported without the knowledge of letters: Of this we have ſad proof, for while learning was decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and in ruins, theology fell too, and lay moſt wretchedly obſcured. I am ſure, that the revelation and manifeſtation of the word of God would never have been ſo extenſive and glorious as it is, if preparitorily, like ſo many John Baptiſts ſmoothing the way, the knowledge of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages and good learning had not riſen <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>He adviſed, in the caſe of temptations, in this manner; <q>I would comfort thoſe, that are tried in their faith and hope towards God, in this way; firſt, let them avoid ſolitarineſs, keep always in good company, ſing the pſalmns, and converſe upon the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Secondly, Though it be the moſt difficult point to work upon the mind, yet it is the moſt preſent remedy, if they can, through grace, perſuade themſelves, that theſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Three things make a divine, <hi>meditation, prayer, and temptation.</hi> And three things are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered by a miniſter; <hi>turnover and over the bible; pray devoutly; and be never above learning.</hi>—They are the beſt preachers for the common people, who ſpeak in the meaneſt, loweſt, humbleſt, and moſt ſimple ſtyle.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In private life, Luther was an example of the ſtricteſt virtue. At dinner or ſupper, he would often dictate matter of preaching to others, or correct the preſs; and ſometimes amuſe himſelf with muſic, in which he took great delight. Though a large man, he was a very moderate eater and drinker, and not at all delicate in his appetite, for he uſually fed upon he ſimpleſt diet. He much delighted in his
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:035737_0055_10064ECD4761C540"/>garden, and was very fond of cultivating it with all kinds of plants. In ſhort he was never idle.</p>
            <p>Though he had not much himſelf, he very freely beſtowed of what he had upon others. A poor ſtudent, aſking money of him, he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his wife to give ſome, who excuſing herſelf on account of their poverty; he took up a ſilver cup and gave it to the ſcholar, bidding him to ſell it to the goldſmith, and keep the money f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r his occaſions. When a friend ſent him two hundred pieces of gold, he beſtowed them all on poor ſcholars. And when the elector gave him a new gown, he wrote in anſwer, <q>That too much was done; for if we receive all in this life, we ſhall have nothing to hope for in the next.</q> He took nothing of printers, for his works, to his own uſe, ſaying, <q>'Tis true I have no money, but am indeed poor; yet I deal in this moderate manner with printers, and take nothing from them for my variety of labours, except ſometimes a copy or two.</q> This, I believe, may be due to me, when other authors, even tranſlators, "for every ſheet have their ſtipulated price." When he had ſome money ſent him, he wrote thus to a friend: <q>I have received by Tauben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heim an hundred pieces of gold; and at the ſame time Schart has ſent me fifty; ſo that I begin to fear, leſt God ſhould give me my portion here. But I ſolemnly proteſt, that
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:035737_0056_10064ECED2334570"/>I would not be ſatisfied from HIM: I will either preſently return, or get rid of them. For what is ſo much money to me? I have given half of it to Prior, and made him very happy.</q>
            </p>
            <p>He had great tenderneſs for his family. When he ſaw Magdalen his eldeſt daughter at the point of death, he read to her this paſſage from the xxvith of Iſaiah: <hi>Thy dead man ſhall live together with my dead body ſhall they ariſe: Awake and ſing, ye that dwell in the duſt; for thy dew is as the dew of herbs, and the earth ſhall caſt out the dead. Come, my peo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <q>My daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, do thou enter (ſays he) into thy cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber with peace: I ſhall ſoon be with thee; for God will not permit me to ſee the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that hang over Germany.</q> And upon this he poured forth a flood of tears. Yet afterwards, when he attended the funeral, he contained himſelf, ſo as not to appear to weep.</p>

He, who began this work, began it without our advice and contrivance; he hath hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to protected it; and hath ordered the whole
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:035737_0058_10064ED3A9D38CD0"/>above and beyond our counſels and imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. He alſo, I make no doubt, will carry on and complete the ſame, without and above all our conceptions and cares. I know and am aſſured of this, for I reſt the whole upon him, who is able to do above all that we can aſk or think. Yet our friend Philip Melanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thon will contrive and deſire, that God ſhould work according to and within the compaſs of his puny notions, that he may have ſomewhat whereof to glory. Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (he would ſay) thus and thus it ought to be done; and thus and thus would I do it.' But this is poor ſtuff: 'Thus I Philip would do it.' This (I) is mighty flat. But hear how this reads; I AM THAT I AM, <hi>this is his name</hi> JEHOVAH: HE, <hi>even</hi> HE, <hi>will do it.</hi>—But I have done. Be ſtrong in the Lord, and exhort Melancthon from me, that he aim not to ſit in God's throne, but fight againſt that innate, that develiſh implanted ambition of our's, which would uſurp the place of God; for that ambition will never further our cauſe. It thruſt Adam and Eve out of paradiſe; and this alone per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexes us, and turns our feet from the way of peace. We muſt be men, and not gods.</q> The proteſtant champion knew full well where his ſtrength lay—not in himſelf, but in his Sovereign. If deſerted by his Covenant head, he felt the deep conviction, that every reed
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:035737_0059_10064F2FF3169918"/>might make him tremble, and every blaſt of trial caſt him down. He knew (to uſe the words of a late writer) that <q>if God changed from his purpoſe of ſaving a man, whenever the man, left to his own will, would change from the deſire of being ſaved, he muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the ſtrongeſt believer upon earth, in five minutes after he had ccommitted him to himſelf.</q>—But Luther had <hi>not</hi> so <hi>learned Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Luther's memorable proteſtation, upon the article of juſtification, muſt not be omitted, and with it we ſhall cloſe this account of his life. <q>I, Martin Luther, an unworthy preacher of the goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, thus profeſs and thus believe; that this article, THAT FAITH ALONE WITHOUT WORKS, CAN JUSTIFY BEFORE GOD, ſhall never be overthrown neither by the emperor, nor by the Turk, nor by the Tartar, nor by the Perſian, nor by the pope, with all his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals, biſhops, ſacrificers, monks, nuns, kings, princes, powers of the world, nor yet by all the devils in hell. This article ſhall ſtand faſt, whether they will or no. This is the true goſpel. Jeſus Chriſt redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us from our ſins, and he only. This moſt firm and certain truth is the voice of ſcripture, though the world and all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils rage and roar. If Chriſt alone take
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:035737_0060_10064ED545126A88"/>away our ſins, we cannot do this with our works; and as it is impoſſible to embrace Chriſt but by faith, it is, therefore, equally impoſſible to apprehend him by works. If then faith alone muſt apprehend Chriſt, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> works can <hi>follow,</hi> the concluſion is irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragable; that faith alone apprehends him, before and without the conſideration of works: And this is o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <head>JOHN CALVIN, THE EVANGELIC REFORMER.</head>
            <p>THIS eminent reformer was born, on the tenth of July, 1509, at Noyon, a city of France. His parents enjoyed a decent for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and beſtowed on him a liberal education. In all the branches of literature then known, his ſtudies were attended with the moſt amazing and rapid ſucceſs. He was originally deſigned for the church, and had actually obtained a benefice; but the light that broke in upon his religious ſentiments, as well as the preference given by his father to the profeſſion of the law, induced him to give up his eccleſiaſtical vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which he afterwards reſumed in a purer church.</p>
            <p>Calvin made great progreſs in the civil law; and purſued his private ſtudies in the holy Scriptures with equal ſucceſs. He was incited to the latter by Melchior Wolmar, who was profeſſor of Greek at Bourges, and ſecretly a Lutheran.</p>
            <p>While Calvin was ſtudying the civil law at Bourges, he preached ſeveral ſermons in a neighbouring town called Live<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ta: But his father died in 1533; on which account he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:035737_0062_10064EDB74B06B28"/>to Paris, in the twenty-third year of his age, with a reſolution to make divinity his principal ſtudy. Soon after he came back to Paris, he became acquainted with all thoſe who profeſſed the reformed religion; and about this time, he embraced the doctrine of the reformers, and began publickly to teach it.</p>
            <p>Calvin was eſteemed in the French congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as one of the moſt able and beſt qualified men to teach and defend the doctrine of the reformation, which had been introduced into that kingdom. His zeal expoſed him to various perils, and the connexion he had formed with the friends of the reformation, whom Francis I. was daily committing to the flames, placed him more than once in imminent danger, from which he was delivered by the good offices of the queen of Navarre. To eſcape the impend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtorms he returned to Baſil, where he publiſhed his <hi>Chriſtian Inſtitutions;</hi> and prefix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them that famous dedication to Francis I. which has attracted the admiration of ſucceeding ages, and which was intended to ſoften the fury of that prince againſt the proteſtants. The Inſtitution are a body of divinity, containing the doctrines of the Chriſtian religion, in a diſtinct and eaſy method. It was publiſhed in 1535, and afterwards tranſlated into almoſt all the languages of Europe.</p>
            <p>When Calvin had publiſhed this book, he made a journey into Italy, to wait on the duch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:035737_0063_10064EDD043DA5C8"/>of Ferrara, the daughter of Lewis XII. She was a princeſs of exemplary piety, and a favourer of the reformation. Calvin met with a very gracious reception from her: But the duke of Ferrara would not ſuffer him to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue long with his ducheſs; and he returned into France, to ſettle his affairs in that kingdom, from whence he prepared to ſet out for Straſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, or Baſil.</p>
            <p>The war had left no other paſſage, but through the duke of Savoy's dominions, which obliged them to take that courſe. This ſeemed a particular direction of Providence, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned him for Geneva, where he was kindly entertained by William Farel, who detained him there, as it were, by an order from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove.</p>
            <p>Farel was a man of a truly heroic ſpirit, and uſed a great many arguments to prevail with Calvin to ſtay and aſſiſt him at Geneva, rather than proceed any farther. Calvin was unwilling to continue there, till Farel ſaid to him, <q>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I declare to you, in the name of Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God, that unleſs you will here become fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-labourer in the work of the Lord, his curſe will be upon you, for ſeeking yourſelf rather than Chriſt.</q> Peter Viret ſeconded Farel, and Calvin then ſubmitted to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the preſbytery and magiſtrates; by whoſe ſuffrages, together with the conſent of the people, he was choſen preacher, and
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:035737_0064_10064EDEB82379A8"/>divinity profeſſor. He complied with the latter, and would have declined the former; but he was obliged to undertake both functions Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin afterwards called Farel his <q>fellow-labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, to whom the Geneveſe owed even them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; that he was the father of their liberty; and the founder of their church.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Hooker has given a full character of Calvin, as head of the Genevan diſcipline. <q>A founder it had, whom for mine own part, I think in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably the wiſeſt man that ever the French church did enjoy, ſince it enjoyed him. His bringing up was in the ſtudy of the civil law. Divine knowledge he gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not by hearing or reading ſo much, as by teaching others: For though thouſands were debtors to him, as touching knowledge in that kind; yet he to none, but only to God, the author of that bleſſed fountain, the book of life; and of the admirable dexterity of wit, together with the helps of other learning, which were his guides; till being occaſioned to leave France; he fell at length upon Geneva, which city the biſhop and clergy thereof had a little before forſaken, as ſome do affirm; being of likelihood frighted with the people's ſudden attempt, for the aboliſhment of the popiſh religion. At the coming of Calvin thither, the form of their civil regimen was popular, as it continueth to this day; neither king, nor duke, nor
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:035737_0065_10064EE1814CDED8"/>noblemen, of any authority or power over them; but officers choſen by the people, yearly out of themſelves, to order all things with public conſent. For ſpiritual govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they had no laws at all agreed upon; but did what the paſtors of their ſouls by perſuaſion could win them unto. Calvin conſidered how dangerous it was, that the whole eſtate of that church ſhould hang ſtill on ſo ſlender a thread, as the liking of an ignorant multitude, if it have power to change whatſoever itſelf liketh. Wherefore taking unto him two of the other mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters for more countenance of the action, albeit the reſt were all againſt it, they moved and perſuaded the people to bind themſelves by ſolemn oath, <hi>firſt,</hi> never to admit the papacy amongſt them again: and, <hi>ſecondly,</hi> to live in obedience unto ſuch orders, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the exerciſe of their religion, and the form of their eccleſiaſtical government, as thoſe their true and faithful miniſters of God's word, had, agreeable to Scripture, ſet down to that end and purpoſe,</q> Hence it appears, how extremely falſe and unjuſt the exclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the papiſts againſt Calvin are, that he ſubverted the government, and turned the ſtate of Geneva into confuſion; whereas the truth is, the biſhop of Geneva who, like ſome other prince-biſhops in Germany, claimed the office of ruler, was expelled long before Calvin's
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:035737_0066_10064EE49920C8F8"/>arrival; and as the government was modelled into its democratic form, previous to his reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, he did not believe that he had any divine authority to alter the civil conſtitution, if it had been in his power.</p>
            <p>This reformation of doctrines had not remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that corruption of manners which had prevailed in Geneva; nor that factious ſpirit which had ſo much divided the principal families. Therefore Calvin, aſſiſted by his colleagues Farel and Caroldus, declared, that as all there remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances had proved ineffectuall, they could not celebrate the holy ſacrament while thoſe diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders continued. They alſo agreed, that they would no longer ſubmit to the conſtitutions that the ſynod of Bern had made; and they deſired to be heard in the ſynod which was to be held at Zurick.</p>
            <p>The church of Geneva made uſe of leavened bread in the communion; they had removed the baptiſmal fonts out of the churches; and aboliſhed all feſtivals except Sundays. But the churches of the canton of Bern diſapproved of theſe three things; and, by an act made in the ſynod of Lauſanne, required that the uſe of unleavened bread, the baptiſmal fonts, and the feſtivals ſhould be re-eſtabliſhed in Geneva. Theſe were the regulations with which Calvin refuſed to comply.</p>
            <p>The ſyndics of Geneva ſummoned the people in 1538; and Calvin, Farel, and Courant,
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:035737_0067_10064EE624A99EC0"/>preſented themſelves before the council, offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make good their confeſſion of faith. The Syndics favoured the diſcontented party, and were catholics in their hearts. The coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, under pretence of preſerving the liberties and privileges of the city; and becauſe Calvin and his friends would not conform to the cuſtom of Bern in celebrating the communion, made an order to enjoin thoſe three members to leave the city in three days. When this decree was brought to Calvin he ſaid, <q>Truly, if I had ſerved men, I ſhould have had an ill reward: But it is well that I have ſerved him, who doth always perform to his ſervants what he hath once promiſed.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Calvin had no maintainance from the city, and lived at his own expence. He went to Baſil, and from thence to Straſburgh, where Bucer and Capito gave him every mark of their eſteem. He was alſo careſſed by Hedio, and other learned men, who procured him permiſſion from the magiſtrates to ſet up a French church, of which he became the paſtor, and had a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petant maintainance allowed him there. He was alſo made profeſſor of divinity.</p>
            <p>While Calvin was abſent from Geneva, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal Sadolet wrote an eloquent letter to the inhabitants of that city, to exhort them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into the boſom of the Romiſh church. Calvin anſwered that letter in 1539; in which he manifeſted his affection for the church of
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:035737_0068_10064EE847AD0EB0"/>Geneva, and diſappointed the views which the biſhop of Carpentras had entertained in his fine artful letter to that ſtate.</p>
            <p>The time was now come for eſtabliſhing the church at Geneva, by recalling Calvin<hi rend="sup">.</hi> The Syndics who had promoted the decree of baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were dead or baniſhed; and the people were not before ſo willing to be rid of their learned paſtor, as now importunate to obtain him again from them who had given him entertainment, and were unwilling to part with him, if irreſiſtible ſolicitations had not been uſed.</p>
            <p>One of the town miniſters, who ſaw in what manner the people were inclined for the recall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Calvin, gave him notice of their affection in this ſort. <q>The ſenate of two hundred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſſembled, they all deſire Calvin. The next day a general convocation; they all cry, we will have Calvin, that good and learned man, the miniſter of Chriſt.</q> When Calvin underſtood this he praiſed GOD; and judged it was the call of heaven. He ſaid, <hi>It is marvellous in our eyes; for the ſtone which the builders refuſed, was made the head of the corner.</hi> In his abſence, he had perſuaded them, with whom he was able to prevail, that though he more approved of common bread to be uſed in the euchariſt; yet they ſhould rather accept the other, than cauſe any trouble in the church about it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="70" facs="unknown:035737_0069_10064EECCBC95D50"/>
The people ſaw that the name of Calvin in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed every day greater abroad; and that with his ſame, their infamy was ſpread, who had ejected him with ſuch raſhneſs and folly.</p>
            <p>He re-entered Geneva, (leaving Brulius to ſucceed him in the French church at Straſburgh) on the thirteenth of September, 1541, to the infinite ſatisfaction of the people and magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; and the firſt thing he did was to eſtabliſh a form of diſcipline, and a conſiſtorial juriſdiction, with power to exerciſe canonical cenſures and puniſhments, even to excommunication. This diſpleaſed many, who urged, that it was reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Roman tyranny: However, the thing was executed; and this new cannon paſſed into a law, in a general aſſembly of the people, on the twentieth of November, 1541.</p>
            <p>He rightly conſidered how groſs a thing it was for men of his quality, wiſe and grave men, to live with ſuch a multitude, and to be tenants at will under them, as their miniſters, both himſelf and others, had been. For the remedy of this inconvenience, he gave them plainly to underſtand, that if he became their teacher again, they muſt be content to admit a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete form of diſcipline, which both they, and alſo their paſtors, ſhould be ſolemnly ſwore to obſerve for ever after. Of which diſcipline the principal parts were theſe: A ſtanding eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical court to be eſtabliſhed: perpetual judges in that court to be their miniſters, others of the
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:035737_0070_10064EEE53F9D0B8"/>people annually choſen, twice ſo many in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber as they, to be judges together with them in the ſame court: Theſe two ſorts to have the care of all men's manners, power of deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining all kind of eccleſiaſtical cauſes, and authority to convent, control, and puniſh, as far as with excommunication, whoever they ſhould think worthy, none, either ſmall or great, excepted.</p>
            <p>Both the clergy and laity of Geneva engaged themſelves to a perpetual obſervance of the new inſtitution made by Calvin, whoſe inflexible ſeverity, in maintaining the rights of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtory, raiſed him a great many enemies, and occaſioned ſome diſorders in the city. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, he ſurmounted all oppoſition, and alſo governed the proteſtants in France, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all held the doctrine of Calvin, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved miniſters from Geneva, who preſided in their congregations.</p>
            <p>Of all the undertakings of Calvin, there was none that involved him in ſo much trouble, or expoſed him to ſuch imminent danger, as the plan he had formed, with ſuch reſolution and fortitude, of purging the church by the excluſion of obſtinate and ſcandalous offenders, and inflicting ſevere puniſhments on all ſuch as violated the laws, enacted by the church, or by the Conſiſtory, which was its repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. The party at Geneva, which Calvin cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the ſect of Libertines (becauſe they defended
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:035737_0071_10064EEFDE8A9A80"/>the licentious cuſtoms of ancient times, the erection of ſlews, and ſuch like matters, not only by their diſcourſe and their actions, but even by force of arms), was both numerous and powerful. But the courage and reſolution of this great reformer gained the aſcendant, and triumphed over the oppoſition of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
            <p>Dupin ſays, <q>The doctrine of Calvin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſacrament, is not fundamentally different from that of the Zuing lians; though he uſes very poſitive words to expreſs the preſence of the body and blood of Jeſus Chriſt.</q> The expreſſions which are in Calvin's inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and his other writings, might make us believe, that he did not deny the real and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial preſence of the body and blood of Chriſt in the euchariſt: Yet, in other places, he clearly rejects not only tranſubſtantiation, but alſo his real preſence; by aſſerting, that the body of Jeſus Chriſt is really and ſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally preſent only in heaven; and that it is united to us only by faith, after a ſpiritual manner, by the incomprehenſible working of the Holy Spirit, which joins things together that are ſeparated by diſtance of place. Theſe words, <hi>this is my body,</hi> ought to be underſtood after a figurative manner, according to his notion; and the ſign is there put for the thing ſignified, as when it is ſaid, <q>The rock is Chriſt; the lamb is the paſſover; and
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:035737_0072_10064EF16E2BA038"/>circumciſion is the covenant.</q> The body and blood of Jeſus Chriſt are united to us only by virtue and efficacy; and his flesh, remaining in heaven, infuſes life into us from his ſubſtance: Laſtly, though the ſubſtance of the body and blood of Jeſus Chriſt are communicated to us by the ſacrament of the euchariſt, they are not really and ſubſtantially preſent there: And though the body and blood of Chriſt are there preſented, and offered to all chriſtians, they are not really received, except by the truly faithful, and not by the unworthy.</p>
            <p>Calvin differed not ſo much from Luther in other points of doctrine. He held the ſame principles as to imputed righteouſneſs, and the certainty of our juſtification, which he exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to an aſſurance of eternal ſalvation. He alſo added an impoſſibility of falling finally from grace; and he aſſerted the ſalvation of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of believers who die before they have been baptized. He likewiſe condemned with more ſeverity than the Lutherians, the invocation of ſaints; the worſhip and uſe of images; vows; celibacy of prieſts; faſting; holy-days; ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the maſs; adoration of the euchariſt; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgencies; the ſacraments, except the eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt and baptiſm; and, in general, all the rites and ceremonies of the church, which the Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therians had not entirely aboliſhed.</p>
            <p>The views and projects of this great man were grand and extenſive. For he not only under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:035737_0073_10064EF44963B3A8"/>to give ſtrength and vigour to the riſing church, by framing the wiſeſt laws and the moſt ſalutary inſtitutions for the maintenance of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and the advancement of true piety' but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven propoſed to render Geneva the mother, the ſeminary of all the reformed churches, as Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenberg was of all the Lutheran communities. He laid a ſcheme for ſending forth from this little republic, the ſuccours and miniſters that were to promote and propagate the proteſtant cauſe through the moſt diſtant nations, and aimed at nothing leſs than rendering the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, diſcipline, and doctrine of Geneva the model and rule of imitation to the reformed churches throughout the world. The under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking was certainly great, and worthy of the extenſive genious and capacity of this emmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent man; and, great and arduous as it was, it was executed in part, nay, carried on to a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry conſiderable length, by his indefatigable aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiduity and inextinguiſhable zeal. It was with this view, that, by the fame of his learning, as well as by his epiſtolary ſolicitations and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements of various kinds, he engaged ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny perſons of rank and fortune, in France, Italy, and other countries, to leave the places of their nativity, and to ſettle at Geneva; while others repaired thither merely out of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity to ſee a man, whoſe talents and exploits had rendered him ſo famous, and to hear the diſcourſes which he delivered in public. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:035737_0074_10064EF769ED3B08"/>circumſtance, that contributed much to the ſucceſs of his deſigns, was the eſtabliſhment of an academy at Geneva, which the ſenate of that city founded at his requeſt; and in which be himſelf, with his colleague. Theodore Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za, and other divines of emminent learning and abilities, taught the ſciences with the greateſt reputation. In effect, the luſtre which theſe great men reflected upon this infant ſeminary of learning, ſpread its fame through the diſtant nations with ſuch amazing rapidity, that all who were ambitious of a diſtinguiſhed progreſs in either ſacred or profane erudition, repaired to Geneva, and that England, Scotland, France, Italy, and Germany, ſeemed to vie with each other in the numbers of their ſtudious youth, that were inceſſantly repairing to the new aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demy. By theſe means, and by the miniſtry of theſe his diſciples. Calvin enlarged conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably the borders of the reformed church, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated his doctrine, and gained proſelytes and patrons to his theological ſyſtem, in ſeveral countries of Europe.</p>
            <p>Calvin reduced the power of the magiſtrate, in religious matters, within narrow bounds. He declared the church a ſeparate and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent body, endowed with the power of legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for itſelf. He maintained, that it was to be governed, like the primitive church, only <hi>preſhyteries</hi> and <hi>ſynods,</hi> that is, by aſſemblies of elders, compoſed both of the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rgy and laity;
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:035737_0075_10064EF8F931CCC8"/>and he leſt to the civil magiſtrate little elſe than the priviledge of protecting and defending the church, and providing for what related to its external exigencies and concerns. Thus this emminent reformer introduced into the republic of Geneva, and endeavoured to introduce into all the reformed churches throughout Europe, that form of eccleſiaſtical government, which is called <hi>Preſbyterian,</hi> from its neither admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the inſtitution of biſhops, nor of any ſubordination among the clergy; and which is founded on this principle, that all miniſters of the goſpel are, by the law of God, declared to be equal in rank and authority. In conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of this principle, he eſtabliſhed at Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva a <hi>conſiſtory,</hi> compoſed of <hi>ruling elders,</hi> partly <hi>paſtors,</hi> and partly <hi>laymen,</hi> and inveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this eccleſiaſtical body with a high degree of power and authority. He alſo convened ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods, compoſed of the ruling elders of different churches, and in theſe conſiſtories and ſynods had laws enacted for the regulation of all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of a religious nature; and among other things, reſtored to its former vigour the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent practiſe of <hi>excommunication.</hi> All theſe things were done with the conſent of the greateſt part of the ſenate of Geneva.</p>
            <p>The abſolute decree of God, with reſpect to the future and everlaſting condition of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man race, was an eſſential tenet in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>reed of Calvin, who inculcated with zeal the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:035737_0076_10064EFAE2C3B050"/>doctrine: <hi>That God in predeſtinating, from all eternity, one part of mankind to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting happineſs, and another to endleſs miſery, was led to make this diſtinction by no other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives than his own</hi> GOOD PLEASURE <hi>and</hi> FREE WILL.</p>
            <p>Calvin was intimidated at nothing, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled the peace of Geneva. It would be difficult to believe, that in the midſt of violent agitations at home, he could ſhew ſo much care, as he did, of the churches abroad, in France, England, Germany, and Poland; and write ſo many books and letters. But there are inconteſtable proofs of it; for he lived in continual action, and almoſt conſtantly with his pen in his hand, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven when ſickneſs confined him to his bed; ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from his zeal for the general good of the churches. He was a man on whom God had confered extraordinary talents, a great deal of wit, an exquiſite judgment, a faithful memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, an able, indefatigable, and elegant pen; an extenſive knowledge, and a great zeal for the truth. But he could not eſcape ſlander abroad, nor oppoſition at home.</p>
            <p>He was full thirty years old when he mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Idolette de Bure, the widow of John Stor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur, a native of Liege, and an Anabaptiſt, whom he had converted.</p>
            <p>As the reformers married to prove their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion from the papiſts, the latter reproached them, as if they warred againſt Rome for the
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:035737_0077_10064EFF7AE77BA8"/>ſame reaſons the Grecians warred againſt Troy. "Our adverſaries, (ſays Calvin)" pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend we wage a ſort of trojan war for a woman. <q>To ſay nothing of others at preſent; they muſt allow myſelf at leaſt to be free from this charge: Since I am more particularly able, in my own caſe, to refute this ſour lous reflection. For notwithſtanding I was at liberty to have married under the tyranny of the pope, I voluntarily led a ſingle life for many years.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The ordinary labours of Calvin were theſe. Every other ſabbath he preached twice. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, Tueſday, and Wedneſday, he read his divinity lectures. Thurſday he aſſiſted in the conſiſtory for the exerciſe of eccleſiaſtical diſcipline. On Friday he read a lecture in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of ſome difficult places in ſcripture: Beſides his public writings, and private nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciations. God ſo bleſſed his miniſtry that he was applied and reſorted to from all parts of the chriſtian world; ſome to conſult his advice in matters of religion, and others to hear him preach. This filled the city of Geneva with a great concourſe of people: and beſides the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed church, there were alſo churches for the Engliſh, Spaniards, and Italians.</p>
            <p>We have in the writings of Calvin, an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and alſo a refutation, of a moſt per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

This odious ſect which aſſumed the denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of libertines and Spiritual Brethren and ſiſters, aroſe in Flanders, was headed by Poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſius, Ruffus, and Quintin, got a certain foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in France through the favour and protection of Margarett, queen of Navarre, and ſiſter to Francis I. and found patrons in ſeveral of the reformed churches. Their doctrine, as far as it can be known by the writings of Calvin and its other antagoniſts (for theſe fanatics publiſhed no account of their tenets that is come to my knowledge), amounted to the following pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions: "That the deity was the ſole <hi>opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting cauſe</hi> in the mind of man, and the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate <q>
                  <hi>author</hi> of all human actions; that, conſequently, the diſtinction of <hi>good</hi> and <hi>evil,</hi> that had been eſtabliſhed with reſpect to theſe actions, were falſe and groundleſs, and that men could nor, properly ſpeaking, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſin; that religion conſiſted in the union of the ſpirit, or rational ſoul, with the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Being; that all thoſe who had attained this happy union, by ſublime contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation and elevation of mind, were then allowed to indulge, without exception or reſtraint, their appetites and paſſions: that all their actions and purſuits were then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent? and that, after the death of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, they were to be united to the Deity.</q>
            </p>
            <p>We muſt not confound, as is frequently done,
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:035737_0079_10064F0296454370"/>with theſe fanatics, another kind of Libertines, whom Calvin had to combat, and who gave him much trouble and perplexity during the whole courſe of his life and miniſtry, I mean the libertines of Geneva. Theſe were rather a cabal of rakes than a ſect of fanatics. For they made no pretences to any religious ſyſtem, but pleaded only for the liberty of leading voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and immoral lives.</p>
            <p>The oppoſition that was made to Calvin did not end here. He had conteſts of another kind to ſuſtain againſt thoſe who could not reliſh his theological ſyſtem, and, more eſpecially, his doctrine in relation to <hi>eternal</hi> and <hi>abſolute De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees.</hi> He however executed his plan of diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline with the utmoſt rigour. He excluded obſtinate offenders from the communion of the church, and even procured their baniſhment from the city.</p>
            <p>The year 1545 was rendered infamous by that cruel and abominable edict which the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liment of Aquitain iſſued againſt the poor Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſes, whereby the moſt unparalleled barbarities were exerciſed upon thoſe unhappy people, without any diſtinction of age or ſex, even to the very burning of their towns. The Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſes, or Vaudois, were a ſect eſtabliſhed by Peter Vaud, or Valdo, a rich merchant of Lyons in France, in 1160, who found out ſeveral errors in the church of Rome, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan a reformation. The clergy excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:035737_0080_10064F059DDE6490"/>him, and perſecuted ſome of his diſciples which occaſioned them to quit Lyons, and fly into the valies of Piedmont, which have been ever ſince inhabited by their deſcendents, who have adhered to their doctrine.</p>
            <p>Calvin was greatly afflicted for the ſufferings of the Waldenſes, to whom he had wrote con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolatory letters a ſhort time before, and ſent them faithful paſtors for inſtructing them in the goſpel precepts. He wrote to the reformed in France, to convince them they acted in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious manner, who pretended it was no ſin to be preſent at the popiſh ſervices, if they kept the true religion in their hearts. He told them, it was an error condemned by the ancient fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: And, becauſe ſome of them might think him too rigid, he adjoined to his own the opinions of Melancthon, Bucer, and Martyr: whereby the name of theſe Nicodemites became obnoxious; for ſo they were called, who cloaked their errors with his example.</p>
            <p>When the emperor hold the diet at Ratiſbon, in 1541, the neceſſity of his affairs compelled him to grant the proteſtants the INTERIM; that is, a ſet form of faith, which might be agreeable to both parties, till a general council ſhould regulate the points wherein the proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants had abandoned the ſentiments of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man church. The emperor wanted to invade the Turkiſh dominions in Africa: But he loſt half of his army in that fatal expedition, and
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:035737_0081_10064F0895C9BE58"/>returned to Germany, where he renewed his ſeverities againſt the proteſtants. Calvin aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Melancthon in writing againſt the Interim; while the emperor and the king of England were engaged in a war againſt France, which ended in 1546, and was ſoon followed by the deaths of Henry VIII. and Francis I.</p>
            <p>The city of Geneva had been infeſted with the plague, and very unhappy diviſions began there in 1546. Calvin, from the pulpit, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed againſt the wickedneſs of the people, who revived the controverſy about their privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, and would not ſuffer their paſtors to diſpoſe of the eccleſiaſtical goods taken from the Pontificians, as they ought to be. The young people would not ſuffer themſelves to be depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of their ſports, taverns, and other places of debauchery. The miniſters inſiſted earneſtly upon it, both in the council and church, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening the contumacious with excommunication. One of the council accuſed Calvin, that he had taught falſe doctrine for the ſpace of ſeven years: But the council committed him to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, without the ſolicitation of Calvin, and enjoined him to perform pennance by carrying a torch in his hand through the city.</p>
            <p>Viret's ſervant received a letter from Calvin: But, inſtead of carrying it to his maſter, as he was directed, he delivered it to the Syndics, who broke it open, and were not a little diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed at ſome paſſages in it, eſpecially where
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:035737_0082_10064F0A1E4373A8"/>he told Viret, <q>that the people of Geneva would govern without GOD; and that he had to do with hypocrites.</q> Calvin was ſent for to anſwer this before them; when he juſtified his complaint by the inſtance of ſeveral debauched perſons, who were ſuffered to ſcoff at the word of GOD, and ſcoff at their inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. He then left the city.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Calvin, (ſays a late excellent writer) has been taxed with fierceneſs and bigotry: But his meekneſs and benevolence were as emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, as the malice of his traducers is ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs. I ſhall give one ſingle inſtance of his modeſty and gentleneſs. While he was a very young man, diſputes run high between Luther and ſome other reformers, concerning the manner of Chriſt's preſence in the holy ſacrament. Luther, whoſe temper was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally warm and rough, heaped many hard names on the divines who differed from him on the article of conſubſtantiation: and among the reſt, Calvin came in for his divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dend of abuſe. Being informed of the harſh appellations he received, he meekly replied, in a letter to Bullinger;" 'Tis a frequent ſaving with me, that, if Luther ſhould even call me a devil, I hold him not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding in ſuch veneration, that I ſhall always own him to be an illuſtrious ſervant of GOD; who, though he abounds in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary virtues, is not without conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:035737_0083_10064F0BA81809C0"/>imperfections."—Turretin's opinion of him alſo deſerves attention. 'John Calvin, (ſays he) was a man, whoſe memory will be bleſſeed in every ſucceeding age. He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed and enlightened, not only the church of Geneva, but alſo the whole re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed world, by his immenſe labours. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch, that all the reformed churches are, in the groſs, frequently called by his name.</q> Thus wrote this candid Arminian, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an unſuſpected evidence of all undue par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality, ſo late as the year 1734.</p>
            <p>When Calvin returned to Geneva, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate publiſhed a decree, empowering the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to require of every family an account of their faith: And they ordered, that no holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day ſhould be obſerved but the ſabbath.</p>
            <p>Calvin, in his writings, every where de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, when he treats of the cauſe of ſin, that the name of GOD ought not to be mentioned: Becauſe the nature of GOD is perfectly righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and juſt. <q>How rank a calumny is it then, to charge a man who hath ſo well deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of the church of GOD, with making GOD the author of ſin: He teaches, on all occaſions, that nothing can be without the will of GOD. He ſays, the wicked actions of men are ſo ruled by the ſecret judgment of GOD, as that he is no ways acceſſary to them. The ſum of what he teaches is, that GOD, in a wonderful manner, and by ways un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:035737_0084_10064F0D71856228"/>to us, directs all things to whatev e end he pleaſed. But why GOD wills wha ſeems to us not ſuitable to his nature, he acknowledges to be incomprehenſible: And therefore denies that it ſhould be over curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſearched into; becauſe the judgments of GOD are a vaſt abyſs, and myſterious beyond our reach, which ought to be adored with awful reverence. But ſtill he keeps to this principle; that, though the reaſon of his council be unknown to us, the praiſe of righteouſneſs is ever to be given to GOD; becauſe his will is the ſupreme rule of equity.</q> Let Calvin himſelf be heard againſt the abuſe, which men will attempt in defaming the great doctrine of prediſtination. <q>In all our inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, (ſays he in his Inſtitute,) into prediſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natination, let us never fail to begin with effectual calling. Again; There are ſome who go on, ſecurely in ſin, alledging, that if they are of the number of elect, their vices will not hinder them from going to heaven. Such abomoniable language as this is not the holy bleating of Chriſt's ſheep, but, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure grunting of ſwine. For we learn from St. Paul, that we are elected to this very end, even to holineſs and blameleſſneſs of life. Now, if ſanctity of life is the very end, ſcope, and drift of election itſelf; it will follow, that the doctrine of election ſhould
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:035737_0085_10064F101C355428"/>awaken and ſpur us on to ſanctification, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of furniſhing us with a falſe plea for idleneſs.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Philibert Bertelier, regiſter of the inferior court of juſtice at Geneva, had been ſuſpended from the ſacrament by the preſbytery, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his vicious life: But he applied to the ſenate to be abſolved; and that body actually abſolved him from the ſentence. This was oppoſed in the name of the preſbytery, by Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin, who ſhewed, that the Chriſtian magiſtrate ought to preſerve, not to deſtroy, the eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical conſtitution. The ſacrament was to be adminiſtered within two days. When Calvin came to hear what had paſſed, he ſoon reſolved what to do, and preached againſt the contempt of the ſacrament. He raiſed his voice, lifted up his hands, and ſaid that he would imitate St. Chryſoſtom: that he would not oppoſe force to force, but that he would rather ſuffer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be maſſacred, than that his hands ſhould preſent the holy myſteries to thoſe who had been judged unworthy of them. This was a thunderbolt, which confounded the faction of Bertelier; ſo that it was not thought fit that he ſhould preſent himſelf to the communion. The next day after the ſacrament, Calvin, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by his conſiſtory, deſired leave of the ſenate, and of the council of two hundred, to ſpeak to the people about this matter, as it concerned the abrogation of a law made by the
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:035737_0086_10064F12C1C097D8"/>people. This made ſo great an impreſſion on their minds, that it was reſolved the Swiſs Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons ſhould be conſulted about it; and that the decree of the two hundred ſhould be ſuſpended; but that none ſhould ſay the ancient regulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons had been infringed.</p>
            <p>Calvin diſpatched letters to ſome of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal paſtors in the Helvetic cities; craving earneſtly at their hands to reſpect this affair, as a thing whereon the whole ſtate of religion and piety in that church ſo much depended, that the cauſe of GOD, and all good men, were inevitably certain to be trampled under foot, unleſs thoſe cities, by their good means, might be brought to give ſentence with the miniſters of Geneva, when the cauſe ſhould be brought before them. The Swiſs paſtors an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that they had heard of thoſe conſiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial laws, and acknowledged them to be godly ordinances, drawing towards the preſcript of the word of God; for which cauſe, they did not think it good for the church of Geneva, by innovation, to change the ſame, but rather to keep them as they were.</p>
            <p>The attempts of Michael Servede or Serve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, a Spaniſh phyſician, were much alarming to thoſe who had the cauſe of true religion at heart. This man, who has made ſuch a noiſe in the world, was born at Villa Nueva, in the kingdom of Arragon, diſtinguiſhed himſelf by the ſuperiority of his genius and had made a
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:035737_0087_10064F144F4C2340"/>conſiderable progreſs in various branches of ſcience. In the years 1531 and 1532, he pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, in Latin, his <hi>Seven books concerning the errors that are contained in the doctrine of the Trinity,</hi> and his two Dialogues on the ſame ſubject, in which he attacked, in the moſt au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacious manner, the ſentiments adopted by far the greateſt part of the Chriſtian church, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> and a <hi>Trinity</hi> of perſons in the <hi>Godhead.</hi> Some years after this he travelled into France, and, after a variety of adventures, ſettled at Vienne in Dauphine, where he applied himſelf, with ſucceſs, to the practice of phyſic. It was here, that, letting looſe the reins of his warm and irregular ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, he invented that ſtrange ſyſtem of theology, which was printed, in a clandeſtine manner, in the year 1553, under the title of <hi>Chriſtianity reſtored.</hi> The man ſeemed to be ſeized with a paſſion for reforming (in his w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y), and many things concurred to favour his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, ſuch as the ſire of his genius, the extent of his learning, the power of his eloquence, the ſtrength of his reſolution, the obſtinacy of his temper, and an external appearance, at leaſt, of piety, that rendered all the reſt doubly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging. Add to all this, the protection and friendſhip of many perſons of weight, in France, Germany, and Italy, which Servetus had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by his talents and abilities both natural and acquired; and it will appear that ſew in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novators
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:035737_0088_10064F1625731CC8"/>have ſet out with a better proſpect of ſucceſs. But, notwithſtanding theſe ſignal ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, all his views were totally diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the vigilance and ſeverity of Calvin, who, when Servetus had eſcaped from his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon at Vienne, and was paſſing through Switz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erland, in order to ſeek refuge in It<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ly, cauſed him to be apprehended at Geneva, in the year 1553, and had an accuſation of blaſphemy brought againſt him before the council. The iſſue of this accuſation was fatal to Servetus, who, adhering reſolutely to the opinions he had embraced, was, by a public ſentence of the court, declared an obſtinate heretic, and, in conſequence thereof, condemned to the flames. For it is obſervable, that, at this time, the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient laws that had been enacted againſt here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics by the emperor Frederic II. and had been ſo frequently renewed after his reign, were ſtill in vigour at Geneva. It muſt, however, be acknowledged, that this learned and ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſufferer was worthy of a better fate; though it is certain, on the other hand, that his f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ults were neither few nor trivial; ſince it is well known, that his exceſſive arrogance was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with a malignant and contentious ſpirit, an invincible obſtinacy of temper, and a conſiderable portion of fanaticiſm.</p>
            <p>The author of the memoirs of literature ſays, <q>If the religion of proteſtants depended on the doctrine and conduct of the reformers, he
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:035737_0089_10064F1B4D5EFD28"/>ſhould take care how he publiſhed his account of Servetus: But as the proteſtant religion is entirely <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>f unded on holy ſcripture; ſo the defaults of the reformers ought not to have any ill influence on the reformation. The doctrine of nontoleration, which obtained in the ſixteenth century, among ſome proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, was that pernicious error which they had imbibed in the church of Rome: And, I believe, I can ſay, without doing any inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to that church, that ſhe is, in a great meaſure, anſwerable for the execution of Servetus. If the Roman catholics had never put any perſon to death for the ſake of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; I care ſay, that Servetus had never been condemned to die in any proteſtant <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Let us remember, that Calvin, and all the magiſtrates of Geneva, in the year 1553, were born and bred up in the church of Rome: This is the beſt apology that can be made for them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The number of ſtrangers viſibly increaſed in Geneva; and the Engliſh were all<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In 1555, a conſpiracy was form<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ected in France. But, in 1556, a tertian ague ſeized upon him as he was preaching, which obliged him to quit the pulpit, and it was rumoured abroad that he was dead. He recovered, and went to Franckfort to pacify ſome controverſies which had lately ſprung up in the French church.</p>
            <p>The number of youth, who came from all parts to ſtudy at Geneva, increaſed ſo much, that the old ſchool was not large enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them. The council therefore reſolved to erect a new college for ſeven claſſes, and three profeſſors of Hebrew, Greek, and philoſophy; beſides divinity lectures, which Calvin read himſelf, to whom was joined Theodore Beza, who preached the following week after Calvin. The ſtatutes of this college were firſt publiſhed in St. Peter's church, before the magiſtrates, miniſters, and ſcholars, by Calvin, who ſeemed to conſecrate ſo body and profitable a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>On the ſixth of February, 1564, Calvin preached his laſt ſermon. He was faint, thin, and conſumptive. He had for ten years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:035737_0091_10064F1E5FFB4180"/>abſtained from dinners, for he was fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently troubled with the head-ach, which his abſtinence only could cure. By ſtraining his voice, and uſing of aloes, he brought on the hemorhoids, which at laſt proved ulcerous; and he had alſo a ſpitting of blood. When his ague left him, the gout took him in his right leg; then the cholic, and laſtly the ſtone, which he never perceived till a few months be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his death.</p>
            <p>Though he was tormented with ſo many violent diſeaſes, he never uttered a word un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming a Chriſtian, and ſo great a divine; only lifting up his eyes to heaven, he uſed to ſay, "How long, Lord!" which was an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion he conſtantly uſed, when he heard of the calamities which afflicted his proteſtant brethren, for which he felt more than for any thing that could befal himſelf. On the twenty-ſeventh of March he was carried in his chair to the ſenate, when he preſented to them a new rector for the ſchool; then uncovered his head, and thanked them for all their favours, and particularly for their great care of him in his ſickneſs: <q>For I perceive, (ſaid he), this is the laſt time I ſhall come into this place.</q> His voice failed him as he ſpoke, and the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly took leave of him in tears.</p>
            <p>On the ſecond of April, which was Eaſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, he was carried to the church, where Beza edminiſtered to him the ſacrament. He made
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:035737_0092_10064F2034BA2370"/>his will on the 25th and on the 27th died, <q>having, by over-much ſtudy, brought upon him ſeveral diſtempers.</q> He died in the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty fourth year of his age, and was buried the next morning, in the common church-yard of the large palace, according as he had deſired in his will, without any pomp or epitaph.</p>

And he hath not only gently and graciouſly borne with my faults and ſins, for which I deſerved to be rejected of him and caſt out, but hath treated me with ſuch meekneſs and mildneſs, that he
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:035737_0093_10064F22DC53A5E0"/>hath vouchſafed to uſe my labours in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and publiſhing the truth of his goſpel. And I witneſs and declare, that I intend to paſs the remainder of my life in the ſame faith and religion which he hath delivered to me by his goſpel; and not to ſeek any other aid, or refuge for ſalvation, than his free adoption; in which alone ſalvation reſteth. And, with my whole heart, I em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the mercy which he hath uſed towards me for Jeſus Chriſt's ſake; recompenſing my faults with the merit of his death and paſſion, that ſatisfaction might be made, by his death for all my ſins and crimes, and the remembrance of them be blotted out. I witneſs alſo and declare, that I humbly beg of him, that being waſhed and cleanſed in the bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But, alas! that ſtudy and zeal of mine (if worthy ſo to be called) have been ſo remiſs
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:035737_0094_10064F266C97E4C0"/>and languiſhing, that, I confeſs, innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things have been wanting in me to the well performing of my duty. And, unleſs the unmeaſurable bounty of GOD had been preſent, my ſtudies had been vain and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing. For which cauſes, I witneſs and declare, that I hope for no other help for ſalvation than this only; that ſeeing GOD is the father of mercy. I truſt he hath ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf a father to me, who acknowledge myſelf a miſerable ſinner.</p>
               <p>As for other things, after my departure out of this life. I would have my body com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the earth, in that order and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner which is uſual in this church and city, till the bleſſed day of reſurrection cometh &amp;c.</p>
            </q>
            <p>To the four ſyndics, and all the magiſtrates, who in a body honoured him with a viſit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his death, he ſpoke to the following effect:</p>
            <q>
               <p>Honoured ſirs, I give you great thanks that you have done me this honour, having not deſerved it from you, and that you have ſo often borne with my infirmities: Which, to me, hath always been an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of your ſingular goodneſs for me.</p>
               <p>Touching the doctrine you have heard from me, I take GOD to witneſs, that I have not raſhly and ungroundedly, but carefully and purely taught the word of GOD intruſted to me: whoſe wrath I ſhould
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:035737_0095_10064F27F60DA580"/>otherwiſe now perceive hanging over me. But I am certainly aſſured, that my labours in teaching it have not been diſpleaſing to him.</p>
               <p>And I teſtify this the more willingly, both before God and yourſelves; becauſe, I doubt not but the devil, according to his cuſtom will raiſe up wicked, light, and gid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy headed people, to corrupt the ſincere doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine which you have heard from me.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Then, conſidering the immeaſureable bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits which GOD had confered on that city, he ſaid;—, <q>I am a very good witneſs, out of how many great dangers the hand of GOD hath delivered you; Moreover, you ſee in what eſtate you now are Therefore, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther your affairs be proſperous or adverſe, let this thing be always before your eyes, that GOD is he alone who eſtabliſheth king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and cities; and therefore will be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped by mortal men.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And, continuing his diſcourſe, he ſhewed them at large, the danger of pride and ſecurity; the great dangers they were alſo in from errors in judgment, and corruptions in practice.</p>
            <p>Then he prayed to GOD for the increaſe of his gifts and bleſſings upon them, and for the ſafety and welfare of the commonwealth. After which, giving his hand to each of them, they took their leave; departing full of ſorrow, and with many tears, as from their common father.</p>

April 28. The miniſters of Geneva being with him, he ſpake thus to them— <q>Brethren, after my deceaſe ſtand faſt in this work of the Lord, and be not diſcouraged; for the Lord will preſerve this church and commonwealth againſt the threatnings of the enemies. When I came firſt to this city, the goſpel indeed was preached, but the management of things, with reſpect to it, was very trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome: Many conceiving, that Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was nothing more than the demoliſhing of images. And there were not a few wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed perſons, from whom I ſuffered many things. But the Lord our God ſo ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened and confirmed me, who am not natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally bold, that I gave not place to any of their attempts. I profeſs, brethren, that I have lived with you in true love and ſincere charity; and thus I now depart from you. If you have found me any way pettiſh under my diſeaſe, I crave your pardon; and give you very great thanks, that you have ſo borne, on your part, the burden impoſed on me, in the times of my ſickneſs.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Having thus ſpoken, he gave his hand to each of them, who then took their leave, ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing and weeping.</p>
            <p>A while after, Calvin hearing that Viret, who was eighty years of age, and ſickly, was on his journey to viſit him, wrote thus to ſtay him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="98" facs="unknown:035737_0097_10064F2E67308C08"/>
               <q>Farewell, my beſt and ſincereſt brother: GOD will have you to out-live me in this world, live mindful of our friendſhip; for it has been profitable to the church of GOD here, ſo the fruit of it tarrieth for us in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. I would not have you weary yourſelf for my ſake. I hardly draw my breath: And I expect daily when it will wholly fail me. It is enough that I live and die to Chriſt, who is gain to his both in life and death. Again farewell." May 11, 1564,</q>
            </p>
            <p>Yet notwithſtanding this letter, the good old man came to Geneva; and having folly confered with Calvin, he returned to New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. After which, Calvin paſſed his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining time almoſt wholly in prayer, with his eyes towards heaven; while his voice of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten failed him, by reaſon of the ſhortneſs of his breath.</p>
            <p>He died as we obſerved before, May the 27th, A. D. 1564, aged fifty-four years, ten mouths, and ſeventeen days. Beza had but juſt left him when Calvin ſuddenly altered for death. On which a meſſenger was diſpatched after Beza to bring him back; but though Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za returned preſently, Calvin, without a ſigh or groan was fallen aſleep in Jeſus before Beza could reach him.</p>
            <p>He was a man, whoſe thoughts were lifted up much above the deſire of worldly go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="99" facs="unknown:035737_0098_100646D5CD527A08"/>ſeeking how he might moſt and beſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote his maſter's ſervice in the eſtabliſhment of his goſpel. When he took leave of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple at Straſburg (as we have mentioned above) to return to Geneva, they would have conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued his freedom of the city, and the revenues of a prebend; which had been aſſigned him; The former he accepted but abſolutely refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the latter.</p>
            <p>When his friends would have diſſuaded him in his ſickneſs, from dictating, and eſpecially from writing, he anſwered; <q>What; would you have me idle when my Lord comes?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>It is a ſtrong proof of his not having ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died to heap up riches, that all his effects, notwithſtanding his library were ſold very dear, as ſcarce amounted to three hundred crowns; ſo that he might very juſtly, as well as elegant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in order to wipe off this monſtrous calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, uſe theſe words, in the preface to his Commentary on the Pſalms; <hi>If I cannot in my life time perſuade ſome people that I am no hoarder of money, I ſhall convince them at my death.</hi> The ſenate certainly can witneſs for him, that, though his ſtipend was very ſmall, he was ſo far from being unſatisfyed with it, that he poſitively refuſed the offer of increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it.</q> This is one of the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The works of Calvin, publiſhed at Geneva, comprehended twelve volumes in folio; which the edition of Amſterdam, 1667, has reduced to nine. His commentaries upon the Bible are the moſt conſiderable part of his works: But he guined moſt honour by his "Chriſtian Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution," which was wrote in defence of the proteſtant religion, and has been always eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an incomparable work. This "inſtitution" has not only appeared in French, but alſo in High Dutch, Low Dutch, Italian, Spaniſh, and Engliſh. Calvin intended it as a complete ſyſtem, and a fall Idea of theology.</p>

            <head>CONCLUSION.</head>
            <p>AS the hiſtory of particular perſons al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways throws light upon the age in which they lived; it is preſumed, that the preceding Memoirs alſo, which relate to emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent men in the church of Chriſt, from the aera of the reformation (and a great number more might have been produced, if our limits had allowed) not only diſcover their own cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, but the characters of the ſeveral times in which they appeared. Peſſibly, therefore, theſe accounts, will be not only edifying to the faith, but inſtructive to the mind, of our ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous readers, and of thoſe younger perſons eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, who wiſh to be acquainted with our eccleſiaſtical hiſtory.</p>
            <p>The intelligent Chriſtian may perceive, that we have ſtudiouſly avoided any undue predilec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to any particular party or profeſſion; knowing that the grace of God is confined to no party, and entailed upon no one profeſſion of Chriſtianity in the world. Theſe Memoirs, if they prove any thing, abundantly prove this truth. And though the compiler muſt natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have his predilections and paſſions, or he
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:035737_0101_10064F3773386D40"/>would not be a fallen ſon of fallen Adam; yet he can truly ſay, that he has watched over theſe infirmities of human nature, and has been above all things deſirous, that the glory of God may be ſeen to triumph over the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowneſs of men, and that the grace of God in his moſt excellent ſervants, may alſo appear to be one and the ſame bleſſing; notwithſtanding the prejudices of birth and education; which do indeed ſtrike the mind with much ſtronger impreſſions, than perhaps any of us are readily apt to imagine.</p>
            <p>In reviewing the work, our readers may probable perceive, that ſome of the following conſiderations preſent themſelves to the mind, and that they are juſtified by many particular circumſtances in theſe Lives.</p>
            <p>The reformation of the Proteſtant church from popery proceeded chiefly upon, what are juſtly enough called, <hi>The Doctrines of Grace,</hi> in oppoſition to a variety of corrupt opinions, and to a greater variety of antiſcriptural ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions which had been grounded upon them. Thoſe doctrines were not <hi>novelties</hi> (as ſome of the Papiſts affected to treat them) becauſe they were not only as ancient as divine revelation itſelf, but were alſo maintained more or leſs in all ages of the chriſtian church; though, for ſome centuries before the reformation, but by comparatively a few ſcattered perſons, who
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:035737_0102_10064F38FB367E38"/>ſhone as ſtars amidſt the gloom of darkneſs which generally pervaded Europe.</p>
            <p>The moſt conſiderable <hi>body</hi> of people profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſcriptural and unſophiſticated divinity, were the Albigenſes in the ſouth of France, and the Waldenſes in Piedmont. The latter name, however, became the general one, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the great ſpread of their doctrine, which was one and the ſame, after the junction of the pious Peter Waldo or Valdo, about the year 1170, from whom this appellation was taken. From theſe real chriſtians, living for the moſt part in mountainous and almoſt inacceſſible places becauſe of their enemies, was derived the primary root of all the ſubſequent refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations. Their origin is carried up very high into the pureſt ages of the church. It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that a Romiſh council at Tours in 1163 condemned them as maintainers of an hereſy, LONG SINCE ſprung up in the territory of Thoulouſe, i. e. among thoſe called Albigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. "This ſect," ſays Cave, from Reineri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, (a monkiſh adverſary, who wrote againſt them about the year 1254) <q>ſoon increaſed to an immenſe number of followers, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed every where; and ſome have affirmed, that it exiſted in the days of Pope Sylveſter, (i. e. in the year 314) or rather from the Apoſtolic age itſelf, and that there is no country in Europe into which it hath not extended itſelf.</q> It is not improbable, that
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:035737_0103_10064F3A8BB4B828"/>they were deſcendents of thoſe excellent chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, who wrote from Lyons in France the very remarkable Epiſtle to the Aſian churches, in the ſecond century after Chriſt.</p>
            <p>They continued likewiſe, as well as ſpread; for when Luther and the other reformers ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the ſixteenth century, the deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants of theſe perſecuted people (who were called by abundance of nick-names) held a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial correſpondence with them, aſtoniſhed on both ſides to find the cloſeneſs of their ſimilari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Hence Gretzer the Jeſuit called them, 'the great anceſtors of the Calviniſts.' Of the moſt remarkable <hi>individuals,</hi> who ſupported the great truths of the goſpel, with more or leſs clearneſs, from the days of the fathers, ſeveral reſpectable names may be adduced in ſucceſſive ages; but in this place we cannot give even their names, though their hiſtory deſerves the ampleſt conſideration.</p>
            <p>Bleſſed be God! his truth ſhall ſtand to the end of the world, and his goſpel till the laſt of the redeemed is ready for glory. There is a SPIRITUAL CHURCH, conſiſting of Chriſt's faithful people, and of them only, gathered, perhaps, out of all denominations; and this church, founded on the everlaſting Rock, is impregnable to every aſſault of its enemies. No weapon, formed againſt it, can proſper. This conſideration ſhould afford every true believer great conſolation, under all dark appearances
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:035737_0104_100646D7552D95C8"/>either in viſible churches or in the world. 'Tis God's cauſe, and not man's: the arm, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, which ſupports it, is omnipotent and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine. <hi>The</hi> LORD <hi>of</hi> HOSTS <hi>is with us</hi> (may this <hi>church of the firſt-born</hi> triumph;) <hi>the God of Jacob is our refuge!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And may God, whoſe goodneſs extends from age to age, and whoſe favour is the life of ſouls, bleſs and unite this HOLY CHURCH at all times in ſpirit and in truth, that it may be eſtabliſhed and proſper upon earth, and that many of all nations may flow unto it. May diſcord and every work of the fleſh be far removed from among brethren, and may they love, and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to love more and more, all of all denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, who love our lord Jeſus Chriſt in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity. May the ſalvation of the redeemed ſpread farther and wider by all manner of holy means; till the kingdoms of the world become the kingdoms of the Lord, and of his Chriſt, and till every tongue ſhall confeſs with joy, THE LORD GOD OMNIPOTENT REIGNETH! AMEN.</p>
