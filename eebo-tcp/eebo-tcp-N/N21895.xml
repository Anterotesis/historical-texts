            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>JERUSALEM was not only the ſeat of government for the Commonwealth of Iſrael, but alſo of the church of GOD. On this favoured ſpot ſtood the National Temple, whither the tribes of the LORD went up to pray and praiſe. The happineſs of the nation was ſo connected with the proſperity of the church, that whatever touched the one, would af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the other. It was preſumed, therefore, that He who had an intelligent regard for the proſperity and happineſs of civil ſociety, would diſcover it by a ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able affection for the houſe and worſhip of GOD.</p>
            <p>THIS pſalm ſeems to have been compoſed to be ſung at the general national feſtival, when the aſſembled tribes had opportunity to meet each other with mutual congratulations, and unite together in devoutly wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping their common Creator: And by an eaſy transfer of the ſentiments it contains to the occaſion of our preſent meeting, it may afford inſtruction both

May it never be profaned by impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, nor diſhonored by improper uſes! May it be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſacred to GOD and his ſervice! Here, may thy worſhip ariſe as incenſe, and the offerings of thy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple be an acceptable memorial before thee!</p>
            <p>THE duties of piety and devotion are the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant part of the ſervice which is due from man to his Maker. In vain do we offer GOD the outward form without the homage of the heart! And in vain do we profeſs to have devotion, unleſs we have clean hands and a pure heart, moral virtue and chriſtian charity! Theſe are ſentiments which ſhould always accompany us to the houſe of GOD.</p>
            <p>MAY they impreſs our minds while we proceed to conſider this congratulatory hymn, and apply it to the preſent occaſion.</p>
            <p>"<hi>I WAS glad when they ſaid unto me, let us go into the houſe of the</hi> LORD. <hi>Our feet ſhall ſtand within thy gates, O Jeruſalem,</hi> Jeruſalem is builded as a city that is compact together: Whither the tribes of the LORD go up, the tribes of the LORD unto the teſtimony of Iſrael, to give thanks unto the name of the LORD. For there are ſet thrones of judgment; the thrones of the houſe of David."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:028839_0004_0FDDD8812F257158"/>WITH inimitable melody he repreſents them as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing, in ſemichoir, the pleaſure they received by the invitations to go up to the temple, echoed by the full choir "<hi>Our feet ſhall ſtand</hi>—;" becauſe the worſhip and order of it was fair as the moon, clear as the ſun; and the workmanſhip of it was as beautiful as Tirzah, and comely as Jeruſalem.</p>
            <p>MANY of them came from a diſtance. They did not decline the fatigues that muſt attend going there. But urged on by the love they felt for the houſe and worſhip of GOD, they rejoiced in the opportunity of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending there. They celebrate the uniformity and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance of the city, which added beauty to the temple, while that in turn contributed much to ornament the city.</p>
            <p>IT was on this account that they were encouraged to go from ſtrength to ſtrength. Here they beheld every thing decent and in order. Here they conſult togeth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the oracles of GOD. They worſhip Him together. And as the order and arrangement of the building, formed a faint emblem of the glory and magnificence of the great Builder of the temple above, ſo it had a good effect on the mind.</p>
            <p>IT was matter of joy too that this ſeat of worſhip was alſo the ſeat of juſtice and of judgment, where their civil rights and eccleſiaſtical concerns were patronized and ſecured. Though religion needs not the aid of civil government to defend, much leſs to prove its truth, yet government needs the aid of religion to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:028839_0005_0FDDD882B3911C60"/>FEEBLE indeed were the efforts of law in the hand of civil officers to control the unruly paſſions of men, were they not reſtrained by the more awful ſanctions of religion. Happy the ſtate where the current of juſtice runs pure by the temple of GOD! Where religion ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders all in authority a terrror to evil doers!</p>
            <p>THE favourable aſpect of morality and religion on the proſperity and happineſs of ſociety cannot be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Indeed, it is a well known fact, that thoſe places are more opulent and happy where publick worſhip is made reſpectable, by ſuitable houſes dedicated to GOD, and His worſhip ſteadily ſupported, than where they are neglected. The expenſe notwithſtanding.</p>
            <p>RELIGIOUS eſtabliſhments are the juſt abhorrence of freemen, both as a violation of the rights of conſcience, and as the bane of pure religion, by introducing an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrent ſyſtem of corruption, prieſtcraft and ſtate poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: But the experience of mankind envinces the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of upholding religious inſtitutions.</p>
            <p>THE air of reſpectability which elegant churches give a town, tends to its proſperity and happineſs, by inviting ſettlers, by giving a ſpring to induſtry, and by promoting order. The reſpect which religion ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires by an open, fair and liberal ſupport, has a great influence on the welfare of ſociety, by refining the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents and poliſhing the manners of men. The ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect on the education of youth, and in forming the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter of the riſing generation, is unſpeakably great. And while theſe pleaſing effects are produced on the face of the world, the way is prepared for the growth
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:028839_0006_0FDDD886C637B490"/>
of real virtue and piety in the heart, which are the final objects of all religious inſtitutions.</p>
            <p>THESE things are, in their operation, promotive of the beſt intereſts of mankind on earth. They are at the ſame time, by their inſtructive and moral tendency, training up men for higher ſcenes of nobler joys.—Thus the inſtitutions of religion, by qualifying men to be citizens on earth and ornaments in the church, are preparing them to receive, as the gift of GOD'S grace, the rank of citizenſhip in heaven, and to ſhine as ſtars in the firmament above.</p>
            <p>"<hi>PRAY for the peace of Jeruſalem; they ſhall proſper that love thee.</hi>" Since ſo many bleſſings attend the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of religion, how natural to call on the church to pray for the city which contained them, eſpecially when both their outward proſperity, and inward and ſpiritual comfort depend on the bleſſing of GOD.</p>
            <p>THE welfare of men on earth depends ſo much on the preſervation of order, that to pray and exert our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for the proſperity of Zion, is an evidence of our regard for the good of the world, and is a mean of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing our attachment to it. With this publick and generous ſpirit, chriſtianity inſpires its true ſubjects, and is itſelf the higheſt poſſible example of it, in the aſtoniſhing act of its Author and Founder, who died a martyr to the truth and importance of our ſubject.</p>
            <p>SO true is the ſaying, that "godlineſs is profitable to the life that now is," that he who exerts himſelf for
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:028839_0007_0FDDD887EF12FAC8"/>
the honour and intereſt of religious inſtitutions, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting his own good and proſperity. By a wiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of things, it is ſo ordered, that he who caſts his bread on the waters ſhall receive again after many days.</p>
            <p>HE will find his account in all his deeds of charity or of publick utility, in one way or another. Whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſervice he renders the church of GOD, he thereby lays up in ſtore a good foundation for himſelf or his children. Though he ſhould experience no particular marks of proſperity himſelf, he has the conſolation of reflecting that he has laid the foundation for it in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity, by the order he has contributed to eſtabliſh.</p>
            <p>THE Pſalmiſt thought it a ſufficient reaſon to wiſh peace and proſperity to Jeruſalem, becauſe that city contained the temple of GOD. "<hi>Peace be within thy walls.</hi>"—It is not uncommon for man to envy the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity of the opulent and the condition of publick char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acters. But a better ſpirit is inculcated in the houſe of GOD; even to pray for them. Of how much conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, then, to their comfort and tranquillity, that they ſhould give publick countenance and ſanction to the inſtitution of worſhip?</p>
            <p>"<hi>FOR my brethren and companions' ſake, I will now ſay, peace be within thee.</hi>" The intereſts our friends have in the proſperity of the church ſhould engage our at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to it. Their happineſs, as ours, depends on the preſervation and growth of religion. But how is this to be effected but by keeping up religious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions.</p>
            <p>WERE religion left to a ſolitary retreat without houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es or forms of worſhip, how would the ſpirit of it die
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:028839_0008_0FDDD88C1F3793C0"/>
away for want of public countenance; and with the failure of this, how would iniquity and every evil work abound? But there are many who wiſh well, but can do but little towards the ſupport of religion. Thoſe may be among the ſalt of the earth, by whoſe moral influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the ſyſtem is preſerved. "<hi>For their ſakes</hi>" ſhould we cultivate a public ſpirit, and ſeek the good of the church.</p>
            <p>"<hi>BECAUSE of the houſe of the</hi> LORD <hi>our</hi> GOD, <hi>I will ſeek thy good.</hi>" To prayers in the church, every good man will add his endeavors to promote the welfare of the State, and ſo much the more as they enjoy protection from it, and freedom in the exerciſe of religion.</p>
            <p>IT is the wiſdom of the ſtate to hold out public countenance and encouragement to religion, not by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious eſtabliſhments in favor of one and to oppreſs another ſect; but by extending equal patronage to all literary and religious inſtitutions, and by the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of friends to religion to public offices. Then the influence would be reciprocal. The ſtate would derive a ſalutary influence from the temple, and that in turn, the countenance of the ſtate.</p>
            <p>THE ſanctions or civil law can reach no further than the outward act, and that only as diſcovered and ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by legal evidence; but thoſe of religion extend to the heart, take hold of the conſcience, and ſtrike at the root of wickedneſs. While the one can only lop off the branches within its reach, the other is tearing up the tree by the roots. Judge then whether the inſtitutions of religion deſerve not the countenance of every wiſe and judicious citizen.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:028839_0009_0FDDD88D476714A0"/>IN the application of the ſubject we are led to make the following reflections:</p>
            <p>THE firſt is, that all good men will rejoice in the proſperity of the chriſtian church: Yea, that all who conſult the good of ſociety will pay reſpect to the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of public worſhip.</p>
            <p>INDEED, the pſalmiſt intimates that the want of this ſpirit of philanthropy is inconſiſtent with an honeſt and good heart; and therefore takes it for granted that all ſuch would cultivate it. The more of this benevolent diſpoſition we poſſeſs, the more ſhall we reſemble Him who is the ſtandard of all perfection. In whatever breaſt this ſpirit prevails, towards the church in general, there will be an attachment to the particular chriſtian ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety with which we are connected; not to the exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of any others from our charity; much leſs to their injury.</p>
            <p>THE rational ends which men have in view in form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into diſtinct religious ſocieties are, the opportunity of worſhipping GOD according to the dictates of their own conſciences, and the convenience of attending an uniform mode of ſocial worſhip with their families.—How important this is to the education of children and youth, let the experience of the world declare!</p>
            <p>BUT in vain do men profeſs an attachment to ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty unleſs they are willing to exert the abilities which GOD hath given them to promote its welfare. Expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes neceſſarily ariſe in erecting houſes of worſhip and upholding the ſtated miniſtry, which requires their u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:028839_0010_0FDDD88ECC126888"/>
exertion to defray, becauſe it is for common good. A moment's conſideration will ſhow every wiſe man the neceſſity of the former, and convince him of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of the latter. It is a ſentiment that meets the common ideas of juſtice, that "the laborer is worthy of his hire;" and it is a ſtatute of immutable obligation in the chriſtian kingdom, that—"they who preach the goſpel ſhall live of the goſpel."—But I will not offend the underſtanding of an enlightened audience by dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on ſo plain a caſe.</p>
            <p>ANOTHER ſentiment ariſing from the ſubject, is, that ſome reſpect is due to the conſtruction of houſes erected for the worſhip of GOD.</p>
            <p>GREAT and magnificent was the temple of the Jews at Jeruſalem, built under the direction of the great head of the church. Although this may not afford a ſuitable model for the more ſpiritual inſtitution of chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ian worſhip, yet it is preſumable that a rational venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the Deity will lead to the beſtowment of much labor and expenſe upon buildings dedicated to GOD. Will it be objected that GOD is not confined to the walls of houſes, nor pleaſed with the elegance of build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings or coſtly offerings—that all nature is his temple, and that he is worſhipped through the vaſt amplitude of ſpace? Be it granted! yet though we cannot be profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to GOD, His worſhip made reſpectable, may be ſo to us. He is not confined to houſes, but houſes built for convenience of ſocial worſhip are appropriat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Him. And if we follow the alluſion in the objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, may we not aſk in turn—Why ought they not, in humble imitation of the ſuperb ſtructure of his univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal temple, to be the maſter ſtrokes of human ingenuity,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:028839_0011_0FDDD89206507480"/>
the higheſt efforts of human ſkill? At leaſt, fitneſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires that the beauty and elegance of houſes for worſhip ſhould ever correſpond to the progreſs of wealth and refinement in ſociety, with which other buildings keep pace. Otherwiſe there would be a marked inattention to religious order; and the want of decent accommodations might be pleaded by peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of taſte for the neglect of public worſhip.</p>
            <p>HAPPILY, the people of this town can have no ſuch apology for ſuch neglect! Few towns, of its ſize, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, none in the United States exceeds it in this reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect.<note n="*" place="bottom">The new meeting houſe in Providence, at the dedication of which this ſermon was alſo delivered, is 87 by 71 feet on the ground plat. That in Brookfield weſt-pa<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ſh, is 64 by 51, and conſidering its remoteneſs from any great commercial town, muſt be viewed as poſſeſſing a high degree of elegance.</note> This ſociety finding their houſe of worſhip out of repair and not ſufficiently large to accommodate their growing numbers, conceived the bold deſign of erecting another which will ſtand as a laſting monument of praiſe to the preſent generation. What ſeemed to be wanting in ability has been ſupplied by generous and harmonious exertions; and Divine Providence ſmiling on efforts ſo laudable hath rendered them ſucceſsful. And we are this day called to felicitate you on the cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but ſerious occaſion of dedicating to GOD the houſe ye have builded for His name! May the ſame ſpirit of concord and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> brotherly love, that have marked your proceedings in projecting and accompliſhing this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble edifice, continue among you and render you happy in the enjoyment of it!</p>
            <p>A THIRD obſervation that reſults from the foregoing diſcourſe, is the union of duty with pleaſure in attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing public worſhip.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:028839_0012_0FDDD89348764E38"/>IN vain are houſes erected for this purpoſe, unleſs we have ſome pleaſure in hearing it ſaid—"<hi>Let us go into the houſe of the</hi> LORD," and our hearts reſpond—"<hi>My feet ſhall ſtand within thy gates, O Jeruſalem.</hi>" That we ſhould worſhip GOD together is a dictate of reaſon. What can be more fit and reaſonable than that beings conſtantly dependent on GOD ſhould acknowledge this to Him; ſhould thank Him for His favours; commit themſelves to His protection, and ſeek His bleſſing? This joint offering is neceſſary in our ſocial ſtate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our wants are common, and ſo are our bleſſings; and this is a public and viſible mark of reſpect and reverence for the giver of every good gift.</p>
            <p>BUT, beſides thoſe outward expreſſions of worſhip and homage, the public inſtitutions of religion afford a convenient opportunity of communicating uſeful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions to all, old and young. There are always to be found, in ſociety, many individuals who need the benefit of ſuch communications from thoſe whoſe buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is ſtudy and improvement. How many are there who have neither time nor means for gaining this knowledge? And how much need have thoſe who poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs both to be quickened in the knowledge they have? What method ſo ſuitable to effect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this as public ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes to people congregated for that purpoſe, in ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional and well digeſted diſcourſes on moral and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious ſubjects? The benevolent deſign of ſuch inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the rational ends of ſuch public religious aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, muſt be a reaſon ſufficient to induce every well wiſher to the beſt intereſt of ſociety to give their exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary attendance, though it were only of human ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment. But where to this motive, is added the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:028839_0013_0FDDD894C582DBB0"/>
weight of Divine authority, how does the obligation encreaſe?</p>
            <p>THE inſtitution of ſocial worſhip is coeval with ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety itſelf, and has met the approving voice of men in all ages. Particular directions were given about it to the Jews. Solemn aſſemblies were continued under the goſpel; and the neglect of them was conſidered as apoſtacy from the faith. And to the preſervation of theſe may be aſcribed all the appearances of religion which we this day behold in the world. It requires no great penetration to diſcern, nor force of argument to prove, that without this method of preſerving a remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the Deity in the world, and of cultivating on the mind a due reverence for Him, a general forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Him would enſue. The feeble light of natural reaſon would ſoon be clouded; and human nature un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the weight of its own infirmities and degraded paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions would ſoon degenerate into wildneſs and barbariſm.</p>
            <p>HENCE among all civilized nations ſtated ſeaſons for calling of the mind from the employments of this life have been obſerved, and means uſed for directing it to the concerns of another. Without the reſtraints of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, what happineſs, yea, what ſafety could be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed in the world? Take away thoſe ties, and you let looſe the whole army of the wretched and the deſperate upon the induſtrious, the affluent, and the happy; and open the door for violence to ſtalk at noon day, unawed by fear, and unreſtrained by principle. To awaken theſe principles is the office of religion, and to keep a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live this reſtraint is the tendency of public worſhip. How can parents expect dutiful children, or maſters
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:028839_0014_0FDDD89897CD79B0"/>
faithful ſervants, unleſs they are ſeen openly and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licly to acknowledge, in a dutiful manner, the athor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of the great Parent and Ruler of men?</p>
            <p>IT cannot be thought an improper uſe of the ſubject if I make uſe of the occaſion to remind you of one cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance that ſhould ever attend your aſſembling here.</p>
            <p>THE houſe is ſuch as reflects honor upon you. Its walls are ſacred by conſecration and appointment only, your principal pleaſure therefore in coming hither ſhould not be the gratification of the eye but the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of devotion in worſhipping GOD in ſpirit and in truth. May your delight in coming to this houſe of the LORD be in communion with Him, and in hearing from Him out of His word! Muſt not that heart be awfully engroſſed with the vanities of this world that can take no pleaſure in thoſe things—that cannot ſep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erate the Sabbath from the common buſineſs of the week and devote it unto GOD?</p>
            <p>IT is the character of the true worſhippers that "<hi>they love the habitation of His houſe and the place where His honor dwells.</hi>" Their hearts are there and where their hearts are they will endeavor to be alſo. They will conſcientiouſly attend the appointed means of moral inſtruction and religious improvement, with a view to benefit themſelves by "<hi>adding to their virtue, knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge</hi>;" and for the benefit of others, by their counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and example.</p>
            <p>THIS whole aſſembly will permit me to recommend to them to preſerve a due reſpect to religion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:028839_0015_0FDDD89ABB78FDA8"/>THERE are never wanting thoſe who endeavour, by the force of ridicule, to undermine the pillars of the chriſtian church, and to ſap the foundation of all reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious worſhip and order. Let not your reſpect for ſo uſeful an inſtitution be leſſened either by the raillery of thoſe who make a mock at ſin, or by their example—whoſe conduct caſts contempt on the inſtitution of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious worſhip. But rather rejoice that there are ſtill ſo many who favor the cauſe of Zion, and that, in this, you have the countenance of the wiſeſt and moſt virtuous, who rejoice in hearing it ſaid—"<hi>Let us go into the houſe of the</hi> LORD.</p>
            <p>THE things there diſcourſed on carry in them an air of high importance. They claim to be from GOD. They have reſpect to the beſt intereſts of men. They therefore, demand the attention even of the infidel him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who can never diſprove their truth; and on account of their great public utility claim attendance on theſe forms of inſtruction. Shall the poliſhed period of the Orator be liſtened to with attention—ſhall the artful mimicry of the actor excite alternate joy or grief or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, and ſhall not the awful majeſty of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel warm and affect the heart? What ſubjects ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving our attention as thoſe contained in the goſpel? They are of all others the moſt intereſting. They have an influence on our preſent condition; yea, their effects run parallel to our exiſtence. They open to us the great things of eternity. They treat of a day of final judgment—of worlds diſſolving with fervent heat—the univerſal wreck of nature—the joys of heaven, and the perdition of ungodly men.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:028839_0016_0FDDD89C351EE080"/>SUCH, and ſo great are the ſubjects that chalange your attention in this houſe! And it ſhould be remembered that the day is approaching in which we muſt all ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an account of our doings, how we have heard, and how we have improved the privileges we have enjoyed. To that momentous period may all our conduct bear reference; that from worſhipping GOD in earthly tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, we may, in His own time, be tranſlated to the temple above to join the general choir in aſcribing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Him, bleſſing and honor and glory and power for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever and ever. AMEN.</p>
