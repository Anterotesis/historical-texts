            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the eyes of men, is always evil. But the Truth of the Proposition before us is further evident.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In that Original sin hath depraved the whole man. It is a woful Leprosy whereby every member of the body, and all the powers of the soul are tainted and disorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The heart is put for the most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent faculties wherewith the Souls of men are adorned. Sometimes for the mind or understanding. Now sin has defiled and depraved that power of the rational Soul. <hi>The mind and Conscience</hi> (which is the practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal understanding, or the Soul reflecting upon it self and judging of a mans own ways) these are <hi>defiled,</hi> Tit. 1. 15. Therefore men are apt to Judge <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> to be Truth, and evil to be good, the light in them is darkness, and how great is that darkness? So that if they walk after the blind dictates of their own dark and deluded understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they may miserably perish. Sometimes <hi>the heart</hi> is put for the <hi>will and affections,</hi> which are also corrupted and perverted by Adams fall and original sin. Hence men do naturally chuse and delight in those things which the Lord abhors. Zech. 8. 17. <hi>Let none of you imagine evil in your hearts against your neighbours, and love no false Oath, for all these 
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:000728_0009_0FAA454820190A80"/>
things I hate, saith the Lord.</hi> So then the things which God hates, the vile and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal hearts of men love and embrace. And as the chief powers of the Soul, so the most excellent members of the Body are vitiated by sin. The eye is the most excellent mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the body, but it is now a very sinfull member. The Scripture does therefore speak of <hi>Eyes full of Adultery, and that cannot cease from sin.</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 14.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The natural Inclinations of the hearts of men are corrupt and evil inclinations. The hearts of men are naturally averse from and indisposed unto that which is good. They have neither wit nor will for a good matter. Jer. 4 22. <hi>They are sottish Children, they have none understanding, they are wise to do e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, but to do good they have no knowledge.</hi> That which the Prophet there speaks, concerning the Jews, is no less true of all men considered as what they are by nature. Heart does answer Heart, as in the water, Face does ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer Face. The Jews spoke what was in their hearts, when they said unto the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, as for the word which thou hast spoken to us in the Name of the Lord, <hi>We will not hearken to thee.</hi> Jer. 44. 16. Let a good moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be presented, and the carnal heart can find an hundred Excuses, Evasions, and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections 
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:000728_0010_0FAA454C9394EC98"/>
against it; but let an evil motion present it self, and the heart is ready to close with it immediately. Sinners are not only <hi>uninclined</hi>to that which is good, but woful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inclined unto that which is evil. Eccles. 8. 11. Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore <hi>the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.</hi> The heart of a sinner is wickedly bent. 'Tis set for evil, nay <hi>fully</hi> set to do evil. The truth is (and a sad truth it is) there is no e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil so bad, no sin so abominable, but there is a natural propensity in the Unregenerate heart to close with it. Well does the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture say, that the heart of man (and what worse could be said of the heart of a Devil) is <hi>deceitful above all things, and desperately wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> Jer. 17. 9. 'Tis not only false, but deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full above all things; not only a subject of sin, but wicked and desperately so. There is not an Unregenerate man in the world, but if the Holy God should wholly remove from him the restraints of His Grace and Providence, and give him up to the natural inclinations of his own heart; there is no wickedness so great, no sin so bloody, but he would soon become guilty of it. Therefore the Apostle speaking concerning what men are by nature; he saith, <hi>their feet are swift 
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:000728_0011_0FAA454D3AF44130"/>
to shed blood,</hi> Rom. 3. 15. Every man has by nature the heart of a Murderer in him. Is he not subject to rash and undue anger? That's a degree of Murder, and would end there, did not special or common Grace prevent it. From this consideration it was that an holy man when he heard of any prodigious wickedness done by the vilest sons of Beli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al (suppose Blasphemy, Sorcery, Adultery, Murder) would strike upon his breast and say, In this Heart of mine is that which would have caused me to have been guilty of the same evil, if the Grace of God had no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> made a difference. Yea, such is the depravation of mens nature, as that their hearts are set upon an evil the rather and the more because God has forbidden it. The Heathen could observe that there is such a perverse Temper and Inclination in men. They could say, <hi>Nitimur in vetitum semper,</hi> men are always desiring forbidden fruit. Truly since the sin of Adam, it has ever been so. The holy Apostle was very sensible of this; we hear him bewailing it sadly. Rom. 7. 8. <hi>Sin taking Occasion by the Commandment, wrought in me all manner of Cons<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>piscence.</hi> So it was with him before his Conversion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Commandment said, ye shall not do such a thing, he was the more set upon 
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:000728_0012_0FAA454ECC826098"/>
doing it. There is many an Unregenerate man that would not do such and such things, did not God in His Word say, ye shall not do them. I remember <hi>Austin</hi> in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, mourns over the Corruption of his nature in this respect. He saith, that when he was an ungodly Youth, he did sometimes Steal Apples out of his Neighbours Orchard, when he might take as many as he desired of the very same sort of Apples in his fathers Orchard, but where he might have them without sin he cared not for them, only in a place where he could not come by them without transgressing the eighth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; his eyes and heart were set upon the forbidden fruit. The truth is, that no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations besides what have sin attending them are natural to the carnal hearts of men. If there be good Inclinations, they are Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penatural. <hi>For I know that in me (that is in my flesh) dwelleth no good thing.</hi> Rom. 7. 18. Since it is thus, men ought not to walk after the inclinations of their own hearts.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The thoughts and Imaginations of the heart of a sinner are vain and vile. Job 11. 12. <hi>Vain man would be wise, though man is born like a wild Asses Colt.</hi> Men bring hearts into the world with them that are full of Vanity. They are born foolish Creatures. 
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:000728_0013_0FAA454EE6317F10"/>
Therefore has the wise man said, that <hi>Fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishness is bound in the heart of a Child,</hi> Prov. 22. 15. A Child carries a bundle up and down with him wherever he goes, and this bundle in his heart. But a bundle of what? Truly, a bundle of folly. Children can no sooner exercise their thoughts about any matter, but there are a world of foolish Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons naturally springing up in the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

Unclean thoughts, Revengful thoughts. Bloody and Blasphemous thoughts; if there were no Devil to Tempt them or to cast such thoughts into their minds, their hearts would naturally of themselves produce them. <hi>For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, Murders, Adulteries, Fornications, Thefts, False Witness, Blasphemies.</hi> Math. 15. 19.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The Byes of men are oftentimes an Occasion, and an inlet to very much sin. David was very Sensible of this, and it had been well for him if he had alwayes remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred it. The knowledge and sense of this truth in his heart, made him pray as in Psal. 119. 37. <hi>Turn away mine eyes from behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Vanity.</hi> The eyes are the windows through which many sins creep into the heart. 
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:000728_0015_0FAA4550895C7FE8"/>
No sooner do's a sinful eye behold any thing which is vain, but the corrupt heart is stirred up to lust after it. Holy Job made a covenant with his eyes, and he would not suffer <hi>his heart to walk after his eyes.</hi> Job 31. 1, 7. But the heart of an Unregenerate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy man does walk after his eyes. He is led by sense and not by right reason, or by Religion. Where sin bears rule (as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Though sin is Originally in the heart, 'tis there before it is in the eye; nevertheless, the eye allures the heart, and occasions the stirrings of that Corruption which is there as the fountain of sin. There are very pernicious evils which get into the heart by the eye: when once the eye le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

There are young men that have been kept from Scandalous sins all their days, who are nevertheless in their natural estate, strangers to a work of Regeneration. Such a young man do we read of in the Gospel, who came to Christ desiring to know what good thing he should do that he might have Eternal Life: when the Lord said to him, keep the Commandments, thou shalt do no Murthen thou shalt not Commit Adultery, thou shalt not Steal, thou shalt not bear false

Witness, Honour thy Father and thy Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>the young man said unto him, all these things have I kept from my youth up,</hi> Math. 19. 20. And yet that Young man had not saving Grace in his soul: he wanted that one thing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary unto Salvation: he loved the world more then he loved Christ: he had not Faith, and therefore could not overcome the World: he would rather part with Christ; and loose eternal life, than part with his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state when the Lord called for it. And such a Young man was Paul whilest he was yet in his natural estate: No man could accuse him with any Scandalous sin; nor could he accuse himself: he had lived honestly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Religion in the which he had been Educated: he could say to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, <hi>I have lived in all good Conscience before God until this day,</hi> Acts 23. 1. And he tells the Philippians that touching the Righteousness which is in the Law he was blameless: This notwithstanding, had he dyed in that estate he must have perished Eternally. But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though an Unconverted Person may be free from Scandalous Immoralities in the sight of men, yet he does indulge himself in some lust or other, some way of his own heart; some sin or other does not only at Times prevaile over him (as it may be with a true

believer) but has a <hi>standing power</hi> and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over him. And there are evils which Youth is in a peculiar manner subject unto. Hence is that caution, 2 Tim. 2. 22. <hi>Flee youthful Lusts.</hi> h. e. those Lusts which Young men more than others are generally addicted unto. We see this also in that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of the Psalmist, <hi>Wherewith shall a Young man cleanse his way.</hi> Psal. 119. 9. Intimating that the ways of Young men are commonly Unclean, Unholy ways, <hi>wayes of their own heart,</hi> very impure in the sight of God who will bring them into Judgment. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions and Supplications made by holy men long after their Conversion do likewise ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest this.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. The way of Pride is the way of a mans own heart. Man is naturally e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver since Adam sinned a proud Creature. The Devil who is made up of Pride, infused that poyson into Adams heart. When once 
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:000728_0019_0FAA4554D1DB8C68"/>
the Serpent of hell had bitten him, his heart was swollen with Pride: and Adam did propagate that poyson to his children: he was in the day that God Created him in the likeness of God; but when once he had sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned he did not beget a son in the likeness of God, but <hi>in his own likeness and after his I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,</hi> that is to say, he begat a Son with a proud heart like his Father. Gen. 5. 3. Nor is there any Unregenerate man, but he is under the dominion of that sin of Pride. It may be other sins may have dominion over him. Men are <hi>serving divers lusts:</hi> but whatever lust besides there may be, Pride reigns in the Unregenerate Soul. Hence such persons are in the Scripture called <hi>the Proud,</hi> Mal. 4. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

There is no sin more na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural then that of Pride: We see it in chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren who discover that Corruption to be in them before they can speak. And this is the sin which useth to reign in Young men: if they are descended of better parents then others, they are proud of their birth and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantage: if they have good natural parts, wit and memory; or acquired parts above others, they are on these accounts lifted up with pride.

<pb n="20" facs="unknown:000728_0020_0FAA468EB039CB70"/>
so. And vain Young men do often times conceit their knowledge to be much greater then it is, not being sensible of that <hi>Abyss</hi> of Ignorance which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s in their dark minds. It is from Pride that Young men do not shew that respect to their Superiours, or unto Aged ones, which God Commandeth them to do. <hi>The child will behave himself Proudly against the Ancient,</hi> Isa 3. 5.

I spake unto thee in thy prosperity, but thou saidst, I will not hear, <hi>this has been thy manner from thy youth,</hi> that thou obeyest not my voice. Young men are usually impatient of Advice and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof; let the Reprover have never so much Authority with him, they regard it not. <hi>

It is from Pride that young men are not willing to be under Government: Children will not be ruled by their Parents, nor Servants by their Masters; 
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:000728_0021_0FAA468F372A40E0"/>
and the reason is because they are ruled by the Pride of their own hearts. An inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate affectation of liberty, is the sin which reigns in Youth commonly. Whats said concerning the Young Prodigal is a discrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the spirit which useth to prevail in Unconverted Young men. He was not will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to continue in his Fathers Family, nor to be under his Fathers inspection and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, but would be gone into far Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. Luke 15. 12, 13. Do we not see it just so in many Young men amongst our selves? Nothing will serve them, but to be going far from their fathers house, that so they may without control walk in the way of their heart, and after the sight of their eyes. An humble and dutiful respect to their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents would make them think themselves happy in being near them Again, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture speaks of <hi>the Pride of Life,</hi> 1 Joh. 2. 18 Vanity in Apparel is one particular intended by that expression: for the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> of life dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers it self very much in the outward garb which persons appear in. We see daily that young people are very much addicted unto such Vanities. They are ready to follow every Proud Fashion as soon as it cometh into the Land, and it may be regard neither God nor man that shall testify against them. 
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:000728_0022_0FAA469252763A10"/>
Because of the bravery of their tinkling Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments, the Chains, and Bracelets, and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geable suits of Apparel, the daughters of Zion are haughty. Isa. 3. 16. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They that walk in Pride, walk in the way of their own hearts, and in the sight of their eyes. This Young People too generally do.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Unruly Unmortified Passions, are the ways of a mans own heart. As for those Graces of Meekness, and Patience, and a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing forgiving spirit, they do not grow in natures garden: They are Supernatural fruits produced and planted in the heart by the holy Spirit of God: but for men to be Passionate and Revengful is natural: We see it in little Children who if any one cross them, will presently strike again and revenge themselves. The carnal Unregenerate hearts of men esteem those holy Commandments which require the Mortification of Passions to be severe and unreasonable. <hi>Julian</hi> the Apostate would scoff and deride the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion because of those holy precepts which our Saviour Christ ha's taughts His Disciples, in Math. 5. 39, 40. <hi>Resist ye not evil, but whosoever shall smite you on the right cheek, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 words">

                           </gap> to him the other also. &amp;c.</hi> The Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers amongst the Gentiles have taught that in great injuries men ought to revenge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, 
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:000728_0023_0FAA4693374575B8"/>
which is directly contrary to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press word of God. Prov. 24. 29. <hi>Say not I will do to him as he has done to me, I will ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to him according to his work.</hi> Nothing is more natural for men then to say so, and to do so. I'le be even with him (saith the Unregenerate heart) I'le give him as good as he brings. They think it a disgrace for them to put up an afront, or to pass by an injury without revenge or satisfaction, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the Lord chargeth them to forgive those that have done them wrong as ever they desire pardoning mercy at the hands of God. And thus it is with Young men until the Grace of God ha's made a mighty change in them: they are ruled not by the word of God, but by their own pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions; when once they are provoked because they have not Grace in their hearts, they cannot command their own spirits. Hence it is usual with Young men in their anger to speak rashly and wickedly. There are Young men so devoid of all fear of God and the Judgment to come, as that in their mad wrath and rage, they will Curse and Swear, and wish Damnation to themselves and others. Ungodly Young men are apt to proceed from wrathful words to revengful blows: in their passion they'l make bloody work of it. 
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:000728_0024_0FAA4693D192FA48"/>
There were a number of Young men (above Twenty of them) that every one thrust his Sword in his fellows side until they fell down together. 2 Sam. 2. 16. Sometimes their sinful anger doth degenerate into hatred and revenge: So it was with <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Absolom,</hi> wicked Young men both of them. And <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi</hi> were Young men that in their passion and revenge did a bloody fact, concerning whom their Father on his death bed said, <hi>in their anger they slew a man, Cursed be their anger for it was fierce, and their wrath for it was cruel.</hi> Gen 49. 6, 7.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. When men indulge themselves in sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual pleasures, they walk in the way of their own hearts. The Scripture fortels (and we see it verified) that in the latter days of the world, some will be <hi>Lovers of pleasures more then lovers of God,</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 4. This is that which men do naturally: they study more how to gratify their senses than how to please a holy God. Hence the Apostle describing the natural estate of the Ephesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and so of all other men, saith, they did walk after the course of this world, <hi>fulfilling the desires of the flesh.</hi> And this is that which Young men are in a peculiar manner addict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto, and their souls endangered by. <hi>Walk in the wayes of thy heart,</hi> h. e. Take thy

fill of those sensual pleasures which thy heart is set upon: this is that which Young men would have not considering that when Death and Judgement comes, those will prove bitter pleasures to them. We see that Young men for the most part are Servants, yea Slaves to some sensual lust or other: Drink and vain Company is dearer to them than the Salvation of their own Souls: And many times there is some unclean lust or other which they live in; <hi>Elibu</hi> observed concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Youth</hi> in former ages, <hi>that their life was amongst the Unclean.</hi> There are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny sad instances which stand upon Record in the Book of God concerning this. <hi>Onan</hi> a Young man but abominably unclean in the sight of God, for which his wickedness the Lord flew him and sent him to hell in his youth. The sons of <hi>Eli</hi> were guilty of vile uncleanness to the great dishonour of God and of their Father also; of them it is said, that <hi>the sin of the young men was very great before the Lord,</hi> 1 Sam 2. 17. <hi>Amnon</hi> a Young man was (though the son of a very holy father) a monster of uncleanness; he set his eyes on his own Sister, and then did wickedly after the sight of his eyes, by which means he made himself one of the fools in Israel, and come to an unhappy and untimely

Solomon saith that one even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he looked out of his window, <hi>and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned amongst the youths, a young man void of understanding</hi>—Prov. 7. 7. And whither was that Young man a going? To a wicked house there to debauch himself, not consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that it would cost him the life of his Soul. And there are few Young men in a state of Unregeneracy, but there is some un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean lust or other which they do indulge themselves in: If not in the grosser acts of wickedness, yet <hi>in Chambering and Wontonness,</hi> which will as certainly keep their Souls out of the Kingdom of God as any other sins whatsoever. Gal. 5. 19.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Persons that live in Idleness, walk in the ways of their own hearts. The flesh had rather live an easy than a labourious life. <hi>Much study is a weariness of the flesh.</hi> Eccl. 12. 12. And so is other hard labour irksome to the flesh.

God and for His People. Do we not see many spend their Youthful days in little else but sports and pastimes. It was said by <hi>Ah<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, Let the Young men arise and play.</hi> 2 Sam. 2. 14. Thats it which Young men would be at; they are for their play and sports. As for lawful Recreations which moderately and seasonably used are good and in some cases a duty; they too often spend more time therein, then God alloweth of. And too many of them indulge themselves in sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full sports and pastimes; and when once they have tasted o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>Ecclesiastes, be not overmuch wicked, neither be you foolish, for why shouldest thou dy before thy time,</hi> Eccles. 7 17. Many years since there was a sad Occasion for me to insist on that Scripture, and to shew that excess in wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness brings untimely death: We have with our eyes seen woful examples of it. Especially if the Children of Godly Parents exceed in wickedness, they make hast into Hell. This we see in several of Davids Children, and in the Sons of Eli: Inasmuch as they had been brought up in such Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, but sinned heinously against the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Education God had favoured them with, while they were Young men they became ripe for Everlasting destruction. And most of all it is so as to such as live under the Gospel: God useth to make quick work with such sinners. That Scripture relates to Gospel times, Mal. 3. 5. Where the Lord saith, He will <hi>Come near to Judgment, and that He will be a swift witness against the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterers, and against the false Swearers &amp;c.</hi> If Young men that have the Gospel shall be Profane Swearers, and Unclean debauch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wretches, the Lord will be a swift witness against them, He will not suffer them to be long out of Hell. How rare is it to see a profane Young man that has enjoyed the 
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:000728_0031_0FAA4698EB64BBF0"/>
means of Grace powerfully dispensed to live unto old age? No; but God brings them to death, and when they are brought to death they are brought unto Judgment also. For Judgement follows at the heels of death. Heb. 9. 27. <hi>It is appointed unto men once to dy, and after this the Judgment.</hi> At the hour of death there is a particular Judgement passed on the Soul: The Soul of a sinner is no sooner out of his body, but the next mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he knoweth most certainly where he must be, and what will become of him throughout eternal ages. Young men (as well as others) that shall dy in their sins will then be judged and condemned to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Imprisonment: To lie in a <hi>Dungeon</hi> amongst hellish Serpents, where is <hi>blackness of darkness for ever.</hi> Then will the days of darkness which are many come upon them. It is said concerning the sinners of the old World (amongst whom there were many Young men) that <hi>their Spirits,</hi> their Souls are <hi>in Prison,</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 19. Miserable Souls! they have been in Prison now near upon Four Thousand Years: and Prisoners they must be another thousand years untill they shall be brought unto their Trial before all the World at the last day; and after that to a worse Prison, there to abide for ever and 
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:000728_0032_0FAA469B663130F0"/>
ever. Before the dead body of a man or woman, that dieth in a state of sin is put into the Prison of the Grave, their Souls are in a worse Grave, in an Eternal Prison, in an everlasting Hell of Misery.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Young men (as well as others) shall be brought into Judgment at the Great day. This is that which is cheefly intended in the Text before us. It is a truth which has been known and believed in all ages, that there will a day come, when He that made the World, will bring all the men that ever have been, are, or ever shall be, before His Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal. The <hi>Jews</hi> have a tradition amongst them, that this was the Controversy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Cain and Abel: It is said <hi>that Can talked with Abel.</hi> Gen. 4. 8. The Scripture mentions not what the discourse was that passed between them, onely in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> there is an Extraordinary pause, intimating that they had more talk than is there ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed. The <hi>Jews</hi> have it traditionally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them, that the thing which <hi>Cain</hi> said, was, that there is no other World but this, that there it no Immortal Soul, and that men shall not after this World is come to its end, be brought before God to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but that <hi>Abel</hi> contradicted him, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, there is an Immortal Soul in every man, 
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:000728_0033_0FAA469C5D2AB0A8"/>
and there will be a great day of Judgment, when every man must give an account to God, of all that he ha's done in this life. Whether the Jews say true or no concerning such discourse between <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel,</hi> the thing it self is most certainly true: A day of Judgment will come, and the beginning of it is now very near; not one man in all the World shall escape the Trial of that dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full day. 2 Cor. 5. 10. <hi>We must all appear before the Judgment seat of Christ, that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he ha's done whether it be good or bad.</hi> And in particular Young men who have walked in the ways of their own hearts, must hold up their guilty hands before the Barr of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Justice in that day.

To the Righteous it will be the most happy day that ever was, but unto them that have walked in the way of their hearts, and in the sight of their eyes, a bitter and a miserable day. A day of wrath: A day of Perdition.

He who is the Lord of us all, ha's given <hi>to Every man his Work,</hi> Mar. 13. 34. One man ha's this Work, and another man ha's that Work, in the doing of which he must im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove his Talent. Young men are favoured with several peculiar Talents: Time is a precious Talent: Health, and Strength, and those Vigorous Affections which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly in Young men, are great Talents which they must be accountable for. A day of Reckoning will come. It is said in the Parable concerning the Talents, <hi>After a Long Time the Lord of those Servants cometh, and reckoneth with them.</hi> Math. 25. 19. It is now a long time since our Lord ascended into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but He will come quickly to Judge the Earth, and then will reckon with His Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants: He will know of them how they have lived, and what they done in the World. A Servant that ha's been set to work, but spends his time in Idleness all the day, will have a miserable account to give unto his Master when night cometh. A Servant that ha's been trusted with Money or Goods to improve for his Masters use, if he shall Embezel or mispend them can expect no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but severity. Thus when God shall say to a Young man at the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I gave thee space to repent in, I suffered

thee to live on the Earth, Twenty years Thirty years; I put many advantages into thy hands, to be working out thy Salvation but instead of attending to my Counsils, thou didst walk in the wayes of thy own heart and what account canst thou give for this now? What will thy Judgment! What thy Sentence be then? God in His Word ha's told all unprofitable Servants, what their Doom shall be. Math 25. 30. <hi>Cast ye the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable Servant into utter Darkness, there shall be weeping and gnashing of Teeth.</hi> Though a Young man, if he ha's been an unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Servant, he must be cast into utter dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and the sad remembrance of lost op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities never to be recovered again will cause Weeping and Gnashing of Teeth.</p>

World will hear of what they have done. Eccles. 12. 14. <hi>God will bring every Work into Judgment, with every Secret thing, whether it be good or whether it be evil.</hi> As the Secret good deeds of pious Young men that follow the Lord in secret will then be openly revealed and rewarded, the same is to be said of the secret transgressions and abominations which ungodly Youths will be found guilty of at that day. Therefore the day of Judgment must needs be a day of horror and confusion to them. Where is there an ungodly Young man, but if all his secret sins (yea, the sins of his heart and all) should be revealed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the World, he would be ready to say as <hi>Thamar</hi> when sollicited by a wicked Young man to commit folly with him, <hi>Whither shall I cause my shame to go,</hi> 2 Sam. 13. 13. The day of Judgment will be to them that dy in their sins a day of the greatest shame that ever was or that can be: then will God fulfill that threatning against sinners, Jer. 23. 40. <hi>I will bring an Everlasting reproach upon you, &amp; a perpetual shame which shall not be forgotten.</hi> Now they seek to cover their sins by denials, fictions, and false-hoods, but it will be in vain for them to think to do so then. Witnesses to their conviction will appear against them in that day. The Judge Himself will be a witness 
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:000728_0038_0FAA469FAE3F5EE8"/>
against them: He will then say, My eyes saw what you did, and My ears heard every Word that was spoken by you. Jer. 29. 23. <hi>They have committed villany in Israel, they have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted Adultery—even I know and am a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness saith the Lord.</hi> And Angels will come in as witnesses against them. The devils who now Tempt them to do wickedly will then be their accusers: Yea, and holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels whose eyes have been upon them, and whose Testimony will be received, shall be witnesses against them. And so will Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science which is more than a thousand wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses. For the remembrance of their sins remains in their Consciences for ever. Jer. 17. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

A sin which a Young man commits now, he will remember it after he is dead, and at the day of Judgment, and throughout the days of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity. We see that men of an hundred years old will remember what they did four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score years ago more perfectly than what they did but four weeks since; a clear de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration that the Immortal Souls of men will never forget what was done by them

Therefore in the Parable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Rich man and Lazarus, it was said to him, <hi>Remember that in thy life time thou receivedst thy good things,</hi> Luk. 16. 25.

                     <p n="3">3. A sentence which will be exceeding terrible, and the execution thereof certain and unavoidable, will in the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be pronounced on such as shall dy in their sins.

This wo will come upon every sinner at the day of Judgment. Sinners must then <hi>Go away</hi> from the Glorious and Gracious presence of God for ever: He will say to them <hi>depart.</hi> And the place which they shall be banished into will be the most dismal that can be i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magined: Into a place where they must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

see the light of the Sun; even into <hi>Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er darkness,</hi> where there is nothing but a perpetual night. Psal. 49. 19. <hi>They shall never see light.</hi> And in that place they must dy. It was said unto <hi>Shebna,</hi> that with a mighty Captivity he should be carried into <hi>Babylon,</hi> and <hi>there thou shalt dy,</hi> Isa. 22. 18. So at the day of Judgment, the Chaldeans of Hell will carry sinners with them into an Everlasting Captivity, and there they must dy. They shall then suffer not only a sentence of ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment but of death too, and that the most dreadfull that can be thought of: They shall be sentenced to be burnt to death; to be cast into a Lake of fire and brimstone. The Scripture expresseth the Punishment of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in the World to come by such Metaphors because it will be more intolerable than those things really and literally done would be; as one in horror of Conscience looking on the fire, said, <hi>To burn in that fire is nothing to what I feel.</hi> And as certainly as the sentence shall be pronounced, execution will follow. For it is a Judgment never to be reversed, a sentence never to be repealed. In this life sinners may by Repentance towards God, and Faith in Jesus Christ obtain a Pardon, so as that the sentence of Condemnation which they are under shall not be executed upon 
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:000728_0041_0FAA46A514897240"/>
them, but at the day of Judgment it is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise: For the day of Grace is then at an end; there will not be one offer of Grace more then: Christ the Judge that now offers to obtain a Pardon from God His Father for those that will humble themselves and repent of their iniquity, will than be inexorable. No Cries, no Tears, no Prayers, no Entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties will prevail with Him for mercy.

It is called <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Judgment,</hi> Heb. 6. 2. because men are then adjudged to an eternal estate either of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness or of misery. Whoever shall be found in their sins <hi>at that day</hi> must die not only by a Tormenting but an Everlasting Death. To be long in dying is a dismal thing. The pangs and Agonies of <hi>the Second Death</hi> will never be over. Rev. 14 11. <hi>The smoke of their torment ascends up for ever and ever; and they have no rest day nor night.</hi> The pleasures of sin will then prove dear bought pleasures in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. It was a sad word which a man that had lived an ungodly life uttered on a death bed, <hi>I</hi> (said he) <hi>have enjoyed the pleasures of sin for a few years, and now I must be in tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for it, more than a thousand Million of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</hi> Sin ha's a short pleasure attending it, but a long, an everlasting pain. It were well if Young men who walk in the wayes of 
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:000728_0043_0FAA46A6738A9868"/>
their own heart would think of this. A man that is in great pain and misery, suppose by some Tormenting disease, as by the Stone, Gout, Cancer or the like, is comforted with thinking this will not last alwayes; but when misery is endless as well as easeless, when there is Eternity added to extremity of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, most wofull is the condition of such forlorn Creatures. Yet all this will Young men that continue to walk in the wayes of their own heart, bring themselves unto at the day of Judgment. Hell fire is a fire that never can be quenched: The breath of the Lord which is like a stream of Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone kindleth that fire, and makes it to burn for ever.</p>

Hear what the Wisest of men faith Prov. 7. 7. <hi>I beheld amongst the simple ones, I discerned amongst the Youths, a Young man void of understanding.</hi> Consider a little if it be not so. Fools are easily deceived, and so are Young men that have not Grace in their hearts; sin deceiveth them; the Devil de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth them; vain Companions deceive them. They are easily drawn into the snares of Temptation: like silly birds they hasten to the snare not knowing that it is for their life. Persons are known to be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Wise or Foolish by the choice which they make. One that does preferr pebbles to Pearles, Trifles to the richest Treasure, is judged to be a fool. Thus it is vvith Young men that vvalk in the vvayes of their own heart, especially if they do so under the light of the Gospel, like fools as they are they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse a good offer; with the Young man in the Gospel, they refuse the Treasures vvhich are in Heaven: And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Thus do profane Young men do: They have Immortal Souls which are more worth than all the World, these do they exchange for sensual and brutish Lusts. To part with pleasures for-ever-more, to enjoy those that are but for a season, is infinite folly. He that runs into the fire is either a fool or a mad man: What Fools then are they, that will cast their own bodies and Souls into the fire that never shall be quenched? If it should be said unto a man, you shall enjoy all the pleasures which your heart can desire for a year together, on condition that after that you shall be in most inexpressible Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for an hundred years; no one but a Fool or a mad man would accept of the proposal.

ask any thing of me that is reasonable and He do it for your sake: To whom she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, <hi>Is it unreasonable for you to hold your finger in the fire one quarter of an hour for my sake, and do you think that it is reasonable for me for your sake to consent unto that, for which my Body and Soul must burn for ever in the fire that cannot be quenched.</hi> Therefore Young men that continue to walk in the ways of their own hearts, and so bring themselves to this at last, are Foolish Creatures.</p>

                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> of this Psalm: <hi>The Transgression of the Wicked saith within my heart, there is no fear of God before his Eyes:</hi> He seems to intimate that once he had too great a Charity for <hi>Saul,</hi> supposing that he might sin out of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity, Melancholy, or Passion, rather than out of Malice; but now he was convinced in his Heart and Conscience, that <hi>Saul</hi> was a very wicked man: That he was wholly destitute of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> fear of God; his Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the Priests of the Lord was an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of it. Such actions were done by 
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:000728_0066_0FAA46BB83A09AA8"/>
him as were inconsistent with the fear of God.</p>
                  <p>As for the Words at present to be insist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on, there have been various Translations, and so various Interpretations of them, which (as not being much to Edification) I shall not trouble you with. But as they are before us, two things are affirmed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Wicked man. (1.) That <hi>he Flattereth himself in his iniquity:</hi> He is secure notwithstanding the sin he has been guilty of: He pleaseth himself with vain Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations concerning his present and future happiness. (2.) The Psalmist affirms that sin will at last appear in other colours before the wicked man than at present it does. <hi>It will be found to be hatefull.</hi> Now iniquity is sweet, but the time shall come when it will be bitter: Though at present it appears in false colours, as if sin were a desirable thing, it will in the end of all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be a most detestable thing. The <hi>DOCTRINE</hi> therefore from the words, is, 
<q>
                        <hi>That although Sinners may Flatter and please themselves with vain Imaginations to the Contrary, it is certain that Sin will at last appear to be a most Odious thing.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="68" facs="unknown:000728_0067_0FAA46BC20F82F80"/>
The particulars contained in this Doctrine may be expressed in three <hi>PROPOSITIONS,</hi> all which are implyed in it.</p>

They please themselves with vain Imaginations. Otherwise they would be afraid to sin, and much more to go on in their trespasses. There are several vain Imaginations which sinners flatter themselves with.</p>

Like <hi>Saul</hi> who excused his transgressing a positive Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God, with saying, he did it for Sacrifice. Sin and Satan do wonderfully blind the eyes of sinners. Hence they sometimes take damning Errors to be rare <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> so did <hi>they speak</hi> concerning those Errors which at last they found to be no better than Satanical delusions. When men have

And because men err in their Judgments, they are guilty of such practices as will prove the ruin of their Souls, and yet flatter themselves that their is no sin nor evil in what they do. Idolatry is a Soul-ruining iniquity, yet the <hi>Jews</hi> of old who lived in that sin, would not believe they were guilty of any such crime. The Prophets by all their Sermons could not convince them of it. Jer. 2. 35. <hi>Thou sayest, because I am innocent, surely his anger shall turn from me, behold, I will plead with thee because thou sayest I have not sinned.</hi> Men may be under the power of Sin and Satan so far as not only to believe that a damning sin is no sin at all, but that it is a duty. To per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute the faithfull Ambassadors of Christ to death is a crime of an high nature: Yet did the Lord say to his Apostles, <hi>The time cometh that whosoever killeth you will think he does God Good Service.</hi> Joh. 16. 2. Thus it was with <hi>Paul</hi> before his Convertion. <hi>He verily thought with himself that he ought to do many things contrary to the Name of Jesus of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zareth,</hi> Acts 28. 9. This indeed was not <hi>Sauls</hi>

case when he killed the Priest at <hi>Nob.</hi> He sinned Maliciously against his Conscience, at the very time when he commanded bloody <hi>Doeg</hi> to Murder them; he called them <hi>the Priests of the Lord:</hi> Some have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thought that he did at that time Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the sin against the Holy Ghost, because his knowledge and his malice was very great. But many of those that kill and burn them whom they call Hereticks, do it more out of Ignorance than Malice, thinking they do well in it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Another Imagination which sinners please themselves with, is, <hi>That is what they do is a sin, yet that it is no great or dangerous sin.</hi> They say of the iniquity which they indulge themselves in, as <hi>Lot</hi> said of <hi>Zoar, Is it not a little one.</hi> Gen. 19. 20. Thus <hi>Ephraim Loved to oppress,</hi> and yet he said, <hi>they shall find in me no iniquity that were sin,</hi> Hos. 12. 7, 8. The Hebrew word there translated Sin, is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times used to denote a great Sin: <hi>Epha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim</hi> pleased himself that they should find in him no iniquity that was of an hanious or criminal nature, notwithstanding his being guilty of great oppression, he esteemed that to be no sin, that is to say <hi>no great sin.</hi> There are great Oppressiors in the World, who justify themselves in their Oppression They 
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:000728_0070_0FAA46BE67EFD8B0"/>
that are guilty of biting and oppressing usury commonly do so. Sinners remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber not what Christ has said, Math. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>. 19. <hi>Whosoever shall break one of these least Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments and shall teach men so, he shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven;</hi> he shall be of no account there, he shall never come there, if he do's allow himself in the willfull breach of the least Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Men are apt to please themselves that none on the earth are without sin; the best have their failings: and that their iniquities are only sins of Infirmity, such as Gods Children whilest in the World are Subject unto; and that therefore they shall have a pardon in course for them: they cannot think that the merciful God will be so severe as to punish them Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally for such small matters; not believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the least sin is in its own nature deadly and damning. And it is possible for men to be so blinded as to think that great sins are little ones. The Gentiles thought that Fornication and Drunkenness were no great sins: and therefore they had no Laws to punish such iniquities But the Lord in his Word declares that they which do such things shall not Inherit the Kingdom of God, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 21.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="72" facs="unknown:000728_0071_0FAA46BF391E19D0"/>
Hence 3. Sinners are apt to flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, <hi>That though they do iniquity they shall escape Punishment.</hi> Notwithstanding the awfull threatnings of God in His word, the Sinner thinks he shall do as well as others. When he heareth the words of the Curse, <hi>He blesseth himself in his heart, saying, I shall have peace though I walk in the Imagination of mine heart, to add drunkenness to thirst.</hi> Deut. 29. 20. There are many such sinners, who after they have made themselves a thirst with strong drink, will make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves drunk again, and yet say they shall have Peace. They promise themselves Impunity in sinning against the Holy God. Hence the Psalmist speaketh, as in Psal. 10. 13. <hi>Wherefore doth the wicked Contemn God? he hath said in his heart thou shalt not require it.</hi> Every <hi>Sinner</hi> so far forth as he is a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, is an <hi>Atheist:</hi> he faith in his heart that there is no such God as the Lord is. Either he is such an Athest as to Imagine that God does not take notice of the sins of men, Psal. 94. 7. <hi>They say the Lord shall not see, neither shall the God of Jacob regard it.</hi> A vile wretch when he is about to commit a sin, suppose The<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

That He is not so much offended with sin as His Ministers say He is. They imagine a God made up all of mercy, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any justice or Holiness. They Judge of God by themselves; because they do not hate sin, they think the Lord hates it not. They flatter themselves that because God bears with them for a time, that He will never call them to an account, Psal. 50. 21.<hi> These things hast thou done, and I kept silence; thou thoughest that I was altogether such an one as thy self; but I will reprove thee, and set them in Order before thee.</hi> Or, they flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter themselves that because of some exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal show of Religion, or some good works done by them, all their sins will be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given. They vainly suppose that by some Righteousness of their own they shall make amends for all their transgressions. They think the Lord will be pacified with Rivers of oyl, and that the fruit of their bodies will Compensate for the sin of their Souls. The Jews would <hi>Steal, Commit Adultery, and Swear falsly,</hi> and yet trust in Lying

words, saying, <hi>The Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord,</hi> Jer. 74. They would go to the Temple and there offer Sacrifice and then say, <hi>we are delivered;</hi> we are purged from our past transgressions; and now having cleared the old Score, we may safely venture to sin again, and by going to the Temple we shall be delivered, and never punished for these abominations <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

sin ha's made them to be the most hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Creatures in the World; and next un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to sin we ought to hate the Devil, and to have no communion with him.

throughout a wholeLand which suffers under the weight of them; such as Wars, Famines, Pestilential and wasting diseases which leave great desolations behind them. These are procured by sin, Mic. 1. 8. <hi>For the transgression of Jacob is all this, and for the sins of the house of Israel.</hi> There are Judgments which fall upon particular Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies; sometimes a great Family is brought to ruin: Thus it was with the house of <hi>Jeroboam, Ahab</hi> and others whom we read of in Scripture; and it was sin that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked the Lord to destroy them all. As for the man that shall do very wickedly, the Lord saith, <hi>I will set my face against that man, and against his Family and will cut him off,</hi> Lev. 20. 5. Nay, which is awfull to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, if a Godly man shall through the power of Temptation become guilty of a Scandalous sin, it may be God to testify his holy displeasure at the sin of that good man will destroy all his Family: What came on <hi>Gideons</hi> numerous Family after he was dead and his Soul in Heaven? because of their Fathers sin, threescore and ten per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of them were Murthered in one day. <hi>Gideon</hi> made an Ephod, and that became a ruining snare to his house.

Again, there are personal Judgments, which sin is wont to bring with it.

not for sin only, as we see in that instance of the man that was born blind, <hi>Job.</hi> 9 3. Nevertheless, it is certain, that Sin is the Parent of all Sorrow: If men had never sinned, they would never have known Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: Nor did ever any man in the World suffer any thing, but either his own on o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens sins were the procuring cause of it.

Rom. 5. 12. <hi>By one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin, and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned.</hi> Sin ha's opened the door to let in death upon all the World Men hate Death, but they have more reason to hate Sin. There are more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over <hi>Spiritual Judgments,</hi> which Sin is the wofull cause of; Judgments that light immediately on the Souls of men, and which are indeed the most fearfull; though sinners themselves are for the present the least sensible of them: A blind mind is a dreadfull Judgment. Joh. 9. 39. <hi>Jesus said, for Judgment am I come into this world, that they which see might be made blind.</hi> Natural blindness is a sore Calamity, but Spiritual blindness is incomparably a greater evil. As sight is a great mercy, but spiritual eye sight a far greater blessing. One of the Martyrs said to a pious blind Youth, that

But He ha's given thee a far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sight, He ha's given thee an eye of Faith to behold the Lord Jesus Christ.</hi> So Spiritual blindness is a thousand times worse than that which is of the body onely.

Hardness of heart is a Spiritual Judgment: No greater Judgment can befall a poor Creature out of Hell, than to be given up to sin without remorse for it. The more men sin, the more are they hardned and emboldned in sin, untill they have filled up the measure of their iniquity. This is a dismal effect of sin, and of the forest wrath of God for it. Well therefore might the Apostle give that Solemn Caution, <hi>Take heed, lest any of you be hardned through the deceitfullness of sin.</hi>

When He drowned all the men in the World at once excepting one small Family: When He rained fire and brimstome upon Sodom and Gomorra, casting them alive into E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Fire and Vengeance, He let the World see that Sin is abominable to the eyes of His Glory: But His not sparing His own Son was the most astonishing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of His Holy Indignation and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence of sin that can be.

Christ the Son of God had no sin of His own, nor was it possible that He should sin, only the Reflection, the Imputation of sin was upon Him, He became a surety for sinners, and then God spared him not, but his Body and his Soul too, was made an Offering for sin: The sorrows of Hell took hold on Him. Shall sin be thus hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the Blessed God, and shall we love it? And how does the Lord Jesus Christ hate sin? It was said of him, <hi>Thou lovest Righteousness and hatest wickedness,</hi> Psal. 45. 7. Never man did hate sin as He did and doth: He declareth it from Heaven. He said to the Church in <hi>Pergamus,</hi> Thou hast them that hold the Doctrine of the Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colaitans, <hi>which thing I hate,</hi> Rev. 2. 15. And in the days of his flesh, although he did converse with great sinners in order to their Conversion and Salvation, and did shew such Patience and Meekness as the like never was: Nevertheless, his Zeal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst sin did amaze the beholders of it. <hi>Joh</hi> 5. 17.

And every truly Godly man is an hater of sin. The description and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter of a wicked man is this, <hi>He setteth himself in a way that is not good, be abhoreth not evil,</hi> Psal 36. 4.
