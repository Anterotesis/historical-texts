            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>A<hi>S this way of writing, in caſes not much unlike this, has been approved of, and has met with great ſucceſs in other hands; it has been an encouragement to this under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hiſtorical dialogues, it muſt be confeſſed, have a very taking elegancy in them, and the ſtory being handed forward in ſhort periods, and quick returns, makes the retaining it in the mind the eaſier, and the impreſſion the more laſting as well as delightful.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The ſtory repreſented here is capable of ſuch, and ſo many applications to the caſes of young people, whoſe ſettlement is always in view, that there will never be a time when the inſtruction will be uſeleſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>If any body ſhould object, that too much is put here upon the woman's part, and that a lady cannot be ſuppoſed, in the midſt of her

lover's addreſſes, to take upon her, to demand ſuch an account of himſelf as is here ſuggeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; that few men will ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>oop to ſuch an exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; and few women venture the loſs of their lovers upon ſuch a ſubject: Let ſuch conſider how ſmall the ſatisfaction here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on the lady's part is, and that no gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man can think it hard a woman ſhould be ſatisfied whether he is a Chriſtian or a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then; a man of religion or an Athieſt: and indeed, no man of any tolerable ſhare of ſenſe, will addreſs himſelf to a lady for marriage, but he will take care to anticipate her inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of that kind, by ſhewing ſome concern, for knowing what ſhe is herſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The univerſal neglect of this trifle, both in men and women, is what this book is deſigned to correct, and there needs no greater ſatire upon that part, than the ſucceſs of the ſeveral caſes here related, viz. The happy life of the youngeſt ſiſter, who came into the meaſures propoſed; and the miſerable condition of the ſecond ſiſter, who raſhly threw herſelf into the arms of a man of different principles from her own, though bleſt with all the good hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour in the world.</hi>

mere leap in the dark, and as the firſt lady expreſſes it, ruſh like a horſe into the battle, theſe things will be of ſome moment. As to thoſe that are void of care of theſe matters, they muſt go on, and pay for their experience; let them take heed, and buy it as cheap as they can.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>If the women ſeem to be favoured in this ſtory, and have the better part of the ſtaff put into their hands, it is becauſe really the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard is chiefly on their ſide, and they are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally the greateſt ſufferers in the ſucceſs: but if it were otherwiſe, yet, if they are treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with more than ordinary regard, the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor hopes they will not lay that ſin to his charge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The appendix to this work ſpeaks for itſelf: Irreligious ſervants, in ſome reſpects, are the plague of families, and keep our houſes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in diſorder. It is a wonderful thing to reflect on, that ſo ſcandalous an evil, ſo eaſy to be rectified, ſhould have gone to ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree as it has in the world; and that maſters and miſtreſſes of families, have not long ago, for their own eaſe, and for the ſatisfaction of one another, come to a general law, for the managing, the puniſhing, and above all, for the recommending of ſervants; which if they would do, they would eaſily, I ſay, bring <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> to know themſelves, and do their duty; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of which is the caſe among ſervants at this time.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>But it is all our own faults; we recommend

ſluts, and thieves, and drones, and ſaucy, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent fellows, and wenches: I ſay, we recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them to one another, without any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern for our neighbour's ſafety or peace; in a word, to pay the debt of charity for thoſe creatures who have abuſed us, we forget the debt of juſtice to one another, and betray the confidence which one houſe-keeper and neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour owes to another, in one of the moſt eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial articles of their families' quiet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This is all expoſed here; and though this part is very ſhort, being but an accident to the other diſcourſes; yet, I preſume to ſay, it will be as acceptable, and, in its kind, as uſeful as any of the reſt.</hi>

               <hi>This eighth edition of this work, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends itſelf upon this expreſs condition, viz.

               <p>THERE lived in a village near London, an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, grave gentleman, of a good eſtate, which he had gained by trade, having been bred a merchant, though of a very good family too. He had been a man in great buſineſs, but his circumſtances being eaſy, and his love of a retired life increaſing with his years, he had left off his buſineſs, and taken a houſe a mile or two out of town. He was a widower at the time of this affair, his wife having been dead ſome years before.</p>
               <p>He had five or ſix children; and all grown up, but none ſettled in the world, though he had an eſtate ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to give them very plentiful fortunes. His three daughters were very agreeable women: and, which was ſtill better, were very ſober, modeſt, ſenſible, and religious young ladies; two of them eſpecially. And, as the character of their father, and the fortune he was able to give them, recommended them very well to the world; ſo they had ſeveral gentlemen that made ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and handſome propoſals to their father for their marriage.</p>
               <p>I ſhall moſt carefully avoid giving any room here, ſo much as to gueſs what opinion in religion they were bred up in, or whether the old gentleman <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

till now, hurried in the world; being crowded with a vaſt buſineſs, taken up with getting money, and with growing rich; ſo that he neither had much concern for, nor indeed took any care of the education or inſtruction of his children, but left them wholly to the conduct of their mother. Nor was it any great loſs to the children, eſpecially to the daughters; their mother being a moſt pious, religious, and virtuous lady; who was not only extraordinarily qualified to inſtruct her children, but gave up her whole time to it from their childhood.</p>
               <p>One morning, a little before her death, calling her daughters to her, ſhe told them, among other things, That as to marriage, ſhe had but two injunctions to lay upon them, which, as ſhe was not likely to live to ſee them ſettled, ſhe would deſire them to lay down as maxims in the choice of their huſbands, and which ſhe would, as upon her death-bed, if her words had any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary influence upon them, oblige them to obſerve ſtrictly, viz.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Never to marry any man, whatever his perſon or fortune might be, that did not, at leaſt, profeſs to be a religious man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Second,</hi> Never to marry any man, how religious ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he may ſeem to he, if he was not of the ſame prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple and opinion in religion as themſelves.</p>
               <p>And as this was but a little before her death, ſo the daughters were more than ordinarily touched with the ſenſe of it, and reſolved to purſue it exactly. How they did purſue it, and the conſequences of it, will be ſeen in the following dialogues.</p>
               <p>It followed ſome time after, that a gentleman of a very good eſtate courted the youngeſt of theſe daughters; and making very handſome propoſals to her father [for he offered to ſettle 600l, per annum upon her] the father was exceedingly pleaſed with the match; he being a gentleman thoroughly well bred, an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able perſon, and, in a word, nothing appearing to give <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

nor had ſhe at his firſt appearance the leaſt exception to make againſt the gentleman as to his perſon. Indeed, as to his eſtate, though her fortune was very handſome, yet his was ſo far beyond it, that there was no compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon in the caſe; and beſides all this, ſhe had this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging circumſtance in the propoſal, viz. That ſhe being the youngeſt of the three daughters, the gentleman had paſſed over, her two eldeſt ſiſters, and had ſingled her out by his more particular fancy, giving her that unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable mark of his affection, viz. That ſhe would be the wiſe of his choice, and conſequently ſhould have an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common ſecurity of the ſincerity of his love to her.</p>
               <p>The father oppoſed his propoſal a little at firſt, as a ſlight offered to his eldeſt daughters; but the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man told him, That he hoped, if he accepted his deſign of coming into his family, he would give him leave to take the perſon his judgment had made choice of, and that he thought he might be happy with: That it would be a very hard circumſtance to him, and what he could not think of with patience, to marry one of his daughters, and be in love with another: That he was very far from offering any ſlight to the eldeſt, letting him know, that happening to ſee the youngeſt firſt, he found ſuch ſuitableneſs, and ſomething ſo agreeable in her to him, that he reſolved to look no further: That, perhaps, if he had ſeen the eldeſt or the ſecond daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter firſt, it might have been the ſame thing; but that as he could not anſwer for the bias of his fancy, ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could he anſwer it to his own conduct, not to chuſe her, that was from the firſt moment he ſaw her, the only woman in the world that he ever thought could make him happy.</p>
               <p>Her father could make no return to an anſwer that had ſo much weight in it, and which appeared to be ſo ſincere; and therefore, not acquainting his eldeſt daughter with the deſign he had to propoſe her to him, he took occaſion to talk to them all together, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

The young lady's ſiſter was diſappointed in his anſwer; for ſhe expected he would have inquired into the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars; but he put it off, as a thing that did not concern him much. At which the younger ſiſter looked at her, and ſmiled, which was as much as to tell her, that ſhe had found now, that what ſhe had told her was true; namely, that ſhe would not ſee it eaſy to break in upon him. She took the hint, and reſolved ſhe would try the beſt of her ſkill, and ſhe found it ſoon anſwered her end: ſo ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to him very ſmartly. No, no, Sir, ſays ſhe, it was not at all from a diſagreement of tempers is this caſe; it is worſe a great deal; it was a diſagreement of princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; for the gentleman was of a very good temper I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you. Then, if he had a good wife, returns he, he ſhould have made it his firſt principle to have been oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and good tempered to his wife. Alas! ſays the lady, he had no religion, and ſhe is the moſt pious religious la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in the world. It may be then, ſays he, ſhe had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, for her and her huſband too. Her being religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, ſaid ſhe, made his want of it an inſufferable burden to her. Then ſhe was to blame, ſays he, for what need ſhe have been uneaſy at that? Not uneaſy! ſays ſhe, How is it poſſible a religious woman can live comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly with an irreligious, profane huſband! O very well, ſays he again, What ſignifies it to a woman, whether her huſband have any religion or no? I have better thoughts of you, ſays ſhe, than to believe you ſpeak as you think, or that you would be underſtood ſo.</p>
                     <p>Her ſiſter had liſtened very attentively to all this, and was ſenſibly affected with it; but ſaid nothing till now, when ſhe turned upon her ſiſter: Why ſiſter, ſaid ſhe, ſhould you think ſo? I hope Mr.—ſays nothing but what he is very ſincere in. Do you think he has not his religion to chuſe as well as other young gentlemen?

and her mind was ſo oppreſſed with it, that ſhe was not able to hold; but making an excuſe to take her ſiſter's letter, and go in and tell her father the news of the death of his brother-in-law, ſhe left her ſiſter to walk with her lover, and went up into her chamber, and locking herſelf in, ſhe gave vent to her paſſions, by crying vehemently a great while. When ſhe had recovered herſelf, conſidered that ſhe was obliged, in civility, to go down again, ſhe compoſed her thoughts, and kneeling down, prayed to God to fortify her ſoul in the reſolutions ſhe had always taken, never to join herſelf to any man that did not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge God, and profeſs to fear and ſerve him; and, in this temper, ſhe went down to him again.</p>
                     <p>She was with him after that ſome hours in the evening, as uſual; but he obſerved ſhe was not eaſy nor free; at length ſhe told him, that upon this occaſion of a relation being dead, it was proper for the family, and decent to their father, that they ſhould make ſome little alteration in their conduct, and deſired he would not take it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

This he could not object againſt, and accordingly he took his leave, believing that her uneaſineſs was nothing but the buſineſs of her aunt's being a widow; which, though, as ſhe ſaid, ſhe was not much concerned for, yet ſeveral things about it might take up her thoughts, ſo as to make her not ſo perfectly eaſy, or ſo good company as ſhe was before.</p>
                     <p>But he was quite out in his gueſs; for her uneaſineſs was of another kind, and ſhe had nothing now lay upon her mind, but how ſhe ſhould diſcharge herſelf entirely of his importunities, and yet without being rude and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civil to him, and without diſobliging her father; for ſhe was firmly reſolved in her mind never to ſee him more.</p>
                     <p>When ſhe had thus taken her leave of him, ſhe went up into her chamber, ſending her maid, to deſire her ſiſter to come up; and ordering the ſervant to excuſe her to her father for not coming to ſupper, for ſhe was indiſpoſed.</p>

<pb n="30" facs="unknown:025384_0029_0FCCE106753CC0F0"/>
ſtronger reaſons for deſiring a religious huſband, than ſhe may have now; that ſhe might have a kind inſtructor to aſſiſt her. We have all need of helps that way at leaſt. We need no profane huſbands to keep us back; a looſe, irreligious huſband is a dreadful ſnare.</p>
                     <p>[This was a night of paſſion, and little was done all the evening by the father but to make work for repentance. He was ſo provoked at his daughter, that he made terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reſolutions againſt her, that he would never give her a farthing; that he would turn her out of doors; that ſhe ſhould go to ſervice, that he would make his will, and whatever he left to the reſt of his children, it ſhould be upon condition, that they ſhould never relieve her, nor own her, nor call her ſiſter, and that if they did, what they had ſhould go to his eldeſt ſon; and the like.</p>
                     <p>He was ſo diſturbed, that he got but little ſleep all night; and, in the morning, he was obliged to go out of town early to his ſiſter's, about forty miles off, whoſe huſband was juſt dead; ſo that he did not ſee his young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt daughter any more before he went; but juſt as he was ſtepping into his chariot, he called his eldeſt daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to him, What, ſays he, child, is to be done in this affair while I am gone? She won't be ſo rude to turn him off while I am away, will ſhe? Indeed, Sir, ſays the daughter, I am perplexed about it; I know not how it will be managed; but I believe ſhe will ſee him no more. Not ſee him! ſays the father; that is the unmannerlieſt thing in the world: ſure ſhe won't be ſo rude to me; ſhe might give me the opportunity to put an end to it hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomely. Pray tell her, I expect it, and I aſſure you, if ſhe refuſes to ſee him till my return, I'll never ſee her more as long as I live.</p>
                     <p>In this temper the father went away: the eldeſt daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, poor lady, had her heart full with ſuch a meſſage, and ſcarce knew how to deliver it; however, upon talking farther with her ſiſter the ſame morning, and finding her inflexible, and perhaps more ſtiff than ſhe thought ſhe needed to be, ſhe did at laſt deliver it: their dialogue was ſhort but effectual, as follows.]</p>

                     <p>But not to hear me, not to aſk my reaſons, this is very hard! Do any fathers marry their daughters by force?</p>

                     <p>'Tis hard for a daughter to make herſelf judge between her father and the reſt of his children: I am ſorry you are ſo hard puſh'd at.</p>

                     <p>That's true, my dear; but conſider, child, how far God's command lies on you here: I know your text, <hi>Be not unequally yoked;</hi> and I remember my dear mother's words, that this cannot be underſtood of any thing but a religious perſon marrying with a profane.</p>

                     <p>Well, if I ſhould own it, perhaps it might bear being called ſo: is it not better than, that I ſhould avoid the ſtruggle between conſcience and affection!</p>

                     <p>But I have a ſtrong fancy, that you ought to enter into cloſer diſcourſe with him upon this matter. I think you do not do either him or yourſelf juſtice elſe; for firſt, perhaps, you may find, that though he talked looſely then, when he did not know, perhaps, whether we were in jeſt or in earneſt, yet if you talked ſeriouſly with him of the main point yourſelf (for you know our diſcourſe was at a diſtance, and was rather a kind of civil
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:025384_0032_0FCCE10B1701CD10"/>
raillery than argument) you may find one of theſe two things will happen, viz. either he will talk ſeriouſly, and let you ſee, that he has a bottom of religious good ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which is all you ought to inſiſt upon, and would be a happy diſcovery on your ſide, or talk profanely, and be ſelf convicted.</p>

                  <p>THE young lady, having reſolved to ſee her gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man once more, at the perſuaſion of her ſiſter, there needed nothing to be done but to ſit ſtill till evening, when he was ſure to come. It ſeems ſhe had reſolved to ſend a footman to him, to tell him ſhe was gone out of town for two or three days, and ſo to prevent his coming, till her father would tell him in general, that it could not be a match: and to make it good, ſhe had ordered her father's coach to be ready to carry her to Hampſtead, to an uncle's houſe ſhe had there; but, on this occaſion, ſhe deferred it, and in the evening he came, as uſual to wait on her. It would not perhaps be poſſible to ſet down the particulars of the courtſhip of this night, there being a great deal of variety in it, and nobody preſent but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: but the beſt account we have of it being from her own mouth, I have ſet it down as ſhe related it to her ſiſter in the following dialogue.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as the gentleman was gone, which, his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment being not much to his mind, was ſome hours ſooner than uſual, ſhe came directly to her ſiſter, who was expecting her with the utmoſt impatience, though ſhe did not look for her ſo ſoon neither as ſhe came; the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing dialogue will give an idea of the whole.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as ſhe came to her ſiſter, ſhe prevented her thus:</p>

He replied, he thought I appeared very much concerned at it laſt night, which made him withdraw ſooner than he intended. I told him, I was thoughtful indeed, but not ſo much about that; for, though I believed my aunt very ſorry for his death, yet I thought ſhe had no great reaſon: for, I was ſure ſhe lived a very uncomfortable life with him.

I declined telling him, but did it in a way that I intended ſhould prompt his curioſity; for I deſired nothing more than to have a fair opportunity to tell him very plainly what troubled me; and he ſoon gave it me. He told me, he took himſelf to be ſo much intereſted in me now, as to be concerned in all my griefs; and he claimed to know if any thing afflicted me, that he might bear his ſhare in it; and added ſomething ſo handſome and ſo obliging on that head, that I muſt acknowledge it ſhook my reſolution very much; and I had almoſt given over my deſign; but I recovered myſelf again in a moment or two.</p>

pray what ſort of a perſon did you take me for? I replied, as warm as he, that I wondered he ſhould miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take me ſo much; that I thought he did not do me juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice; that I had ſaid indeed he was not the perſon he had been repreſented, but never ſaid, that he had repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented himſelf one way or other. Then he begged par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don again, and told me, he had taken me wrong; that, whatever came of it, he would never deceive me; I ſhould know the worſt of him, whether I would have him or no. Indeed, Sir, ſaid I, I am perſuaded you are no hypocrite. I underſtand you, ſaid he, you think I have uſed more honeſty than diſcretion. No, Sir, ſaid I, I ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much approve of your honeſty, and do not blame your diſcretion at all. But I do, ſaid he, for I find, if I could have counterfeited more ſerious things than I am maſter of, and feigned myſelf a little religious, all had been well. I told him, I would not ſay that it was in his power to have deceived me; but I hoped he had acted a part much more like a gentleman. He replied, that it was hard then I ſhould make ſo unkind a return to him, as to make him loſe his miſtreſs for his honeſty.</p>

Hold, ſays he, you have broke one poſitive promiſe you made me already. I told him, I did not remember that I had ever made him any promiſe at all.

that was more than I knew. But, pray, Madam, ſaid he, why do you lay ſuch a mighty ſtreſs upon this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular? Religion is an entire article by itſelf; my being relious, or not religious, need not obſtruct our affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to one another; I am no enemy to religion. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that it was indeed an acceptable thing, as times went now, not to find a gentleman a deſpiſer, and hater of religion, and of all that favoured it; but that I was aſſured, where there was not a profeſſion of religion, and where God was not acknowledged, there could be no bleſſing expected: and that I ſhould think I had renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced God, and declared war againſt heaven, if I ſhould marry a man that openly acknowledged he had no reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. He told me he was ſorry to ſee me run things to ſuch an extremity; that he did not think I had been in earneſt, when he, in jeſt, ſaid, he had not thought of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; that he would not urge me in a thing, which I laid ſo much ſtreſs upon, but would wait on me again, and hoped to find me in another mind, and to let me know he was not quite ſo bad as I thought him to be.

the young gentleman a little; for his ſtory does not end ſo. He went away very much concerned, as above, and particularly it touched him very ſenſibly, that he ſhould be taken for ſuch a creature, that a ſober, virtuous lady (for ſuch he was ſure his miſtreſs was) ſhould refuſe him merely on account of his wicked character; and that tho' ſhe acknowledged ſhe had a reſpect for him, ſhe was obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to ſhun him, purely becauſe ſhe was afraid of him, as a hater of religion, and therefore dangerous to live with. It has often run in his mind, that ſhe had ſaid, ſhe could expect no bleſſing with him; and that if ſhe married him, ſhe ſhould think ſhe had renounced God, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared war againſt Heaven; ſo that, to be ſure, I am a dreadful fellow, ſays he, that ſhe dares not take me, leſt ſhe ſhould appear to be a confederate with one of God's enemies.</p>
                  <p>It then occurred to him, that it really was no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in fact: that ſhe was in the right in it all; that he had in truth no religion, or ſenſe of God, upon his mind, nor had ever entertained any notions of religion in his thoughts, and had told her ſo himſelf, and that therefore the young lady was in the right of it, and if ſhe had any fund of religion herſelf, had a great deal of reaſon to refuſe him; that every ſober woman ought to refuſe him upon the ſame account: and that ſhe, that did not, was not fit to make him a wife, or at leaſt ſuch a wife as he could expect any happineſs from; that this young lady had made a true judgment, and it was his buſineſs not to think of perſuading her to alter her mind, which, in ſhort, muſt leſſen his opinion of her, but to conſider what ſtate and condition he was in, and what was his firſt buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to do, to deliver himſelf out of it, before he went to her any more.</p>

<pb n="45" facs="unknown:025384_0044_0FCCE11F13258CE0"/>
of her refuſing him: but the reproaches of his heart, as being ſuch a monſter, that a woman, that even owned ſhe loved him, durſt not join herſelf to him, doubled upon him as his affections for her increaſed.</p>
                  <p>He could not think of coming to her again; for he confeſſed the reaſons, which ſhe gave for her not daring to take him, were ſo juſt, and ſhe had argued them ſo well, that if ſhe ſhould abate any thing of them, he ſhould not have ſo much eſteem for her as he had before; and yet he ſaw, that if ſhe did not, he could never expect to have her; and yet alſo he could not bear the thoughts of not having her, for all that.</p>
                  <p>He lived in this uneaſy condition ſome months: his friends perceiving him to be very melancholy, tried many ways to divert him; but none reached his caſe, or, if they did, they underſtood not how to adviſe him; for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations were moſt like himſelf, people of levity and gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry, being rich and gay; a family that dealt very little in matters of religion. He had an aunt, his mother's ſiſter, who ſeemed very much concerned about it; but as ſhe thought all that ailed him was his being croſſed in his affection, ſhe worked her thoughts about, night and day, to find out a wife for him. And ſo to take his thoughts off, and turn them another way. At length, ſhe found out a young lady in the city, of a very great fortune; for ſhe had near 20,000l. to her portion, and ſhe plyed it ſo warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with him, that he conſented to treat of it with her friends, and his circumſtances being ſuch as few fortunes would refuſe, he found his way clear enough, and ſo went to viſit the young lady.</p>
                  <p>It was an odd kind of courtſhip, you may be ſure, and he went about it accordingly; for, as he confeſſed after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, he reſolved, before he ſaw her, not to like her or any thing ſhe ſaid or did; no, nor ever to be in earneſt with her upon any thing; but only to jeſt with, and ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter her; and he told his aunt ſo before-hand. However, his aunt would not take him at his word, but would have him wait upon her, and ſo he did; but he needed not to have taken up any reſolutions in the caſe, for he was ſpoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for courtſhip already, at leaſt, for moſt of the ladies of the times; he had no reliſh for any of their converſation;
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:025384_0045_0FCCE122FAA7A7D0"/>
it was like muſic to one that had no ear: all the gaiety and flutter about them was loſt upon him; his firſt miſtreſs had treated him with ſuch ſolid reaſoning, ſuch ſerious talk, and had handled him after ſuch a manner, that in ſhort nothing but what was ſerious had now any reliſh with him; however, as I have ſaid, he reſolved to put a force upon himſelf ſo far, as to go and ſee what kind of thing his new miſtreſs was; and accordingly he did go, as above.</p>
                  <p>But when he had been one evening there, and had talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a little with her, he ſoon ſaw he had no need of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſolutions; that he was in no danger of being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnared by her; the levity of her behaviour, the emptineſs of her diſcourſe, the weakneſs of her conduct, made him ſick of her the very firſt time; and when he came away, he ſaid to himſelf, It is poſſible for any man in his ſenſes to bear this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

him with horror at his own picture, which, he thought, now was ſet before his eyes in all its juſt deformities. When he came away from her, he ſaid to himſelf, Well, now I ſee the true force of what that dear creature argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for herſelf againſt me; that to venture upon me while I declared againſt religion, was to run herſelf into the pit with her eyes open, and ruin herſelf by mere preme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditated choice. It would be juſt ſo with me in this caſe, if I ſhould marry this butterfly; we ſhould even go hand in hand very lovingly to the devil. This will not do my buſineſs! So he put an end to that affair as ſoon as he could, and reſolved to ſee her no more</p>
                  <p>All this while he had no aſſiſtance from either books, friends, miniſters, or any body, only the juſt and natural reflections of his own reaſon: but, as he was a gentleman of polite manners, and bred to converſation with gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the beſt quality, as well as of the beſt parts, ſo the government of himſelf was the more eaſy, and he reſtrained the dejection of his ſpirits from making any extraordinary diſcovery of itſelf, only, that he appeared a little more ſedate and more thoughtful than before, and was a little more retired in his way of living; but not ſo much but that he came often into public company, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                  <p>It happened one time, that, in promiſcuous converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, at a chocolate-houſe near the court, this gentleman and ſeven or eight more being preſent, the company fell from talking of news to talking of religion: the diſcourſe began about the differences which had happened in France lately, and were then depending, between the Pope and the French clergy; and of the Sorbonne, or faculty of theology, as they are called there, being at that time em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in drawing up a new ſyſtem of divinity, or body of doctrine as they called it; and as a conſequence it was hinted, how likely it was, that ſuch a ſtrict inquiry, made by men of learning and virtue, into the fundamentals of religion, ſhould lead them at laſt into Proteſtant princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and break that whole kingdom off from the errors and ignorance of Popery, opening the eyes of the people to Chriſtian knowledge.

gravely and judiciouſly, and the whole company ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to receive it with pleaſure; when a couple of young beaux, who happened to be in the room, beginning to be tired with a thing ſo much out of their way, one of them riſes up on a ſudden, and ſays to the other, Come, Jack, I am tired of this dull religious ſtuff; prithee let us go, there's nothing in it. Ay, ſays the other, with all my heart, I know nothing of the matter: come, will you go to the opera? There ſat another young gentleman of their acquaintance there, and they pulled him to come with them: No, ſays he, I like this diſcourſe very well, it is worth two operas to me. Why, ſays the other, how long have you been in orders, pray? Is ſuch ſtuff as that fit converſation for a gentleman? Yes, ſays the ſober young gentleman, I think it is: pray, what can there be in religious converſation that is unfit for a gentleman? There ſat an antient nobleman by, talking with a clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who hearing the young gentleman's reply, fell a laughing; for this diſcourſe put the former ſubject to a ſtop. On my word, Gentlemen, ſays his Lordſhip, Mr.—has met with you: I don't think you can anſwer his queſtion. Yes, my Lord, ſays the fooliſh beau, I think it is below a man of quality to trouble his head a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it. Pray, Sir, ſays the Lord, is it below a man of quality to be a Chriſtian? O, my Lord, ſays the other beau, bantering and jeſting, we are mighty good Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ians at the opera; and turning away to his comrades, ſays he, Come, come, Jack, prithee let us go: ſo they went both out together, for they did not care to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Our gentleman came home charmed with this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, as indeed the whole company were beſides; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially conſidering the authority and dignity of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who ſpoke it. His mind was inſpired with new thoughts by it, both of religion and of himſelf; he not only ſaw more of the excellency of religion in itſelf, but began clearly to ſee it was the ornament of a gentleman to be a Chriſtian. It was with the greateſt contempt, that he now looked back upon the notion he had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſpouſed of a gentleman's being above troubling him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with ſerious things. How ſordid and brutiſh did the two beaux appear, ſaid he, compared to that noble and excellent perſon, my Lord—!

On the other hand, it occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to him, how handſomely did that young gentleman anſwer them! with what modeſty did he ſpeak, and yet boldly, in defence of a religious life? and what an honour was paid him for it by all the company, and by the noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in particular? and then to think o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>From all this he drew this general and happy conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for himſelf, viz. That he ſhould never be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete gentleman, till he became a religious man; and that the more of a Chriſtian he was, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  <p>To avoid the uſual diverſions of the town, while theſe ſerious thoughts were upon him, he reſolved to retire into the country, to a little ſeat he had in Hampſhire, remote from all converſation, and where he had no body to talk to, but his own ſervants, or ſome of the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, who were all his tenants.

                  <p>I talk of being religious! and being a Chriſtian! why, I underſtand nothing of it, or how to go about it. What is it? what is religion? and what is it to be a Chriſtian?

                  <p>He was ſeriouſly muſing on this part one evening walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all alone in a field near his houſe, when he began to look with great concern, upon the want, which he felt, of an early foundation laid in his mind by a religious education.

                  <p>There lives a poor ploughman, and yonder lives a poor farmer; they both fare hard and work hard; how ſober, how religious, how ſerious are they! how are they daily teaching and inſtructing their children! and how they were taught and inſtructed by their parents! and there's ſcarce a boy of ten years old in their families, but knows more of God and religion than I do; I have been taught nothing, and know nothing but this, that I am under the curſe of darkneſs, in the midſt of light; igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in the midſt of knowledge; and have more to give an account of, than a negro of Africa, or a ſavage of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica.</p>

                     <p>Yes, I do indeed; he was a good man to the poor: I was the better for him many a day; he was a worthy gentleman.</p>

                     <p>It is a great pity, indeed, an't pleaſe you; but I know it is ſo too often: there is young Sir Thomas—your worſhip's couſin, he is a pretty youth, and may make a fine gentleman; but though he is but a child,

he has ſuch words in his mouth, and will ſwear ſo already, it grieves me to hear him ſometimes. It is true, his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is dead; but ſure if my Lady knew it, ſhe would teach him better: it is a pity ſo hopeful a young gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſhould be ruined.</p>

                     <p>No, no, William, only his own father and mother; I have heard his father take him, when he was a child, and make him ſpeak lewd words, and ſing immodeſt ſongs, when the poor child did not ſo much as know the meaning of what he ſaid, or that the words were not fit for him to ſpeak. And you talk of my Lady! why, ſhe will ſwear and curſe as faſt as her coachman: How ſhould the child learn any better?</p>

                     <p>O dear, that is a dreadful caſe indeed, an't pleaſe you; then the poor youth muſt be ruined of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity; there's no remedy for him, unleſs it pleaſe God to ſingle him out by his diſtinguiſhing inviſible grace.</p>

                     <speaker>La.</speaker>
                     <p>Why his caſe, William, is my caſe, and the caſe of half the gentlemen in England. What God may do, as you ſay, by his inviſible grace, I know not, nor ſcarce know what you mean by that word; we are, from our infancy, given up to the devil, almoſt as directly as if we were put out to nurſe to him.</p>

                     <p>Indeed, Sir, an't pleaſe you, the gentlemen do not think much of religion; I fear it was always ſo; the ſcripture ſays, <hi>Not many rich, not many noble are called,</hi> and it is <hi>the poor of this world that are rich in faith,</hi> James ii. 5.</p>

pray to him; prayer is the firſt duty, and prayer is the greateſt privilege we can enjoy in the world.</p>

                     <p>Ay, William: but there is a great deal required in prayer, that I am an utter ſtranger to: I never pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in my life; no, nor I believe my father or grandfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before me, William!

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Will.</speaker>
                     <p>That's true, indeed, Sir, they muſt not tread in thoſe ſteps.</p>

                     <p>Well, Sir, but who do you think put thoſe thoughts in your mind, which now you have? and who opened your eyes, Sir, to ſee a beauty in religion, as now you ſee; and touched your heart with ſuch an earneſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire after the ways and things of God, as you now expreſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay you have? do you think this is not of God, an't pleaſe you?</p>

                     <speaker>Will.</speaker>
                     <p>Without queſtion, Sir, it is: man can have no ſuch power; nature prompts us to evil thoughts and evil deſires, and to them only; the imagination of the thoughts of our hearts are evil, and only evil; if there are any good motions, or heavenly deſires in the heart, they are from God. Every good gift, and every perfect gift comes down from above; it is his power works them, his invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible grace forms all holy deſires in the ſoul.</p>

                     <p>As ſoon as he came into his own houſe, he locked him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into a parlour, and began to conſider, with great ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſneſs, all theſe things, and eſpecially what the poor man had ſaid to him about praying to God; and, as his thoughts were intent upon the meaning of prayer, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it, and the advantages of it, at every turn of theſe thoughts he found a ſecret kind of hint like a voice in him, O that I could pray! O, if I could pray but as the poor man does! How happy ſhould I be, if I could but pray to God! and the like. He was not aware of theſe move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; they ſeemed to be wrought in his affections per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly involuntarily and ſudden; and they paſſed over with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being noticed or obſerved, even by himſelf, till after a good while they returned ſtronger and more frequent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him; ſo that he not only perceived it, but remember<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed how often his heart had thrown out theſe expreſſions; when, on a ſudden, the poor man's words came into his mind with ſuch a force, as if the man himſelf had been there; why this was praying; certainly I have been pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all this while, and knew it not.</p>
                     <p>Upon this reflection, it was impoſſible for him to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, as he ſaid afterwards, what a ſtrange rapture of joy poſſeſſed his mind, and how his heart was turned within him; then he fell into the ſame ſacred ejaculations of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother kind, viz. of admiration, praiſes, thankſgiving, and mere aſtoniſhment; but ſtill without ſpeaking other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:025384_0066_0FCCE72555F33F58"/>
than a kind of mental voice, ſounding or injecting words into his mind: ſuch as theſe, Lord! ſhall I be brought to pray to God! I that have never been told ſo much as how to mention his name! I that have never known any thing of God, or myſelf! or have been taught any thing of my duty to him! ſhall I be taught to pray! and taught by whom! by this poor deſpicable creature, that at another time I would not have ſpoken to, if he had made me twenty bows and ſcrapes! His tongue then was let looſe; and he cried out, Bleſſed be God that ever I came near that poor man.</p>
                     <p>He continued all that evening filled with comforting reflections, and wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>h a kind of inward peace and ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; which as he had never known before, ſo be knew not how to deſcribe or relate it, or indeed how to manage it. In the morning he ſound the ſame meditation and the ſame lightneſs upon his ſpirits returned, and he remembered what the poor man had prayed for, for him, viz. That he might be comforted with the hopes of the preſence and bleſſing of God, to which his heart had ſo readily ſaid Amen. And now he longed for the poor man's coming with the Bible.</p>
                     <p>The poor man was likewiſe mightily affected with his caſe, conſidering him a young gentleman of ſuch a fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and fortune; and who was ſo far above him as that, though he was his landlord, he durſt never offer to ſpeak to him in his life, but with the greateſt ſubmiſſion and diſtance; how he ſhould come to call him out, and to talk to him, of ſuch things eſpecially, and in ſo ſerious a manner.</p>
                     <p>He then reflected, with a ſerious joy, that this young gentleman ſhould be thus touched with a ſolid ſenſe of religion and good things; for it was eaſy to ſee, that it was not a ſlight or an inſincere work upon his mind.—It rejoiced his heart, that the heir of the eſtate ſhould be thus likely to prove a good man; and it preſently oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred to his thoughts, how great a bleſſing ſuch a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman might be to the country, to the poor, and to the uninſtructed people round him; as well by reforming their manners, and reſtraining their vices, as, perhaps, by
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:025384_0067_0FCCE726EC3BAB60"/>
bringing religion to be accepted and received among them by his example.</p>
                     <p>Theſe were ſome of the thoughts he came along with, and as he walked, he prayed to God, very earneſtly, that he might be made an inſtrument to bring the ſoul of this gentleman to the knowledge of God, and to bow at the footſtool of his Redeemer as a true penitent.</p>
                     <p>His prayers were not in vain. Prayer, put up from ſuch a principle, and with ſuch a ſpirit, ſeldom is made in vain.</p>
                     <p>He came to the gentleman, while he was in his bed; for he had given orders to his ſervants to bring him up to his chamber; there he delivered him the Bible, and told him he hoped he would find in it both encouragement and direction in the great work which he was going about, and that God would bleſs it to him, and would ſupply by his grace all the wants of early inſtruction, which he had ſo much complained of,</p>
                     <p>He received the poor man with a glad heart, made him ſit down by him, and told him, God had made him the inſtrument of ſo much good to him, that he could not part with him any more while he ſtayed in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>

                     <p>Dear brother, is this a time for me to tell you what I wanted in Sir James, when he is in his grave? I have wanted nothing in him that a woman could deſire in a huſband; he was rich in his eſtate, a lovely, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete, handſome gentleman in his perſon, and held it to the laſt; he was the beſt humoured man that ever woman had, and kind, as a huſband, to the laſt degree: I never ſaw him in a paſſion in my life; he was a man of good ſenſe and good learning; a man of honour, good breeding, and good manners; none went beyond him; all the country knows it, and lov'd him for it.</p>

                     <p>Nay, he not only did not himſelf, but he did not really love to have any body about him religious. I have known many gentlemen that have had no religion them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, yet value it in others, and value and reverence good men: but he thought all people hypocrites that talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of any thing religious, and could not abide to ſee any appearance of it in the houſe.

                     <p>Why, firſt, brother, there was all family religion loſt at one blow. There could not be ſo much as the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of worſhipping or acknowledging the God that made us; nay, we ſcarce aſked him leave to eat our meat, but in ſecret, as if we were aſhamed of it. Sir James never ſo much as ſaid grace, or gave thanks at table in his life, that I remember.</p>

                     <p>And they that do, make it nothing but a cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and do it for faſhion-ſake, not that they think it ſignifies any thing.</p>

                     <p>Well, let them do it for faſhion-ſake then, if they will, but let them do it. It is the moſt rational thing in the world, while we own that God gives us our meat, that we ſhould aſk him leave to eat it, and thank him for it when we have done. But, alas! this is but a ſmall part of the ill conſequences of an irreligious family.</p>

                     <p>Why, 1ſt I mean by it that religion that ought to be between a man and his wife; ſuch as comforting, encouraging, and directing one another, helping one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other on in the way to heaven; aſſiſting one another in Chriſtian duties, praying with and for one another, and much more which I could name, and which, without doubt, paſſes to their mutual comfort and delight, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a man and his wife, where they are mutually a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed in worſhipping and ſerving God, and walking <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

all need of helps: and it is not every one that conſiders, or indeed that knows, what help, what comfort, what ſupport, a religious huſband or wife are or may be to one another. This, I ſay, has been a ſad loſs to me, I aſſure you.</p>

                     <p>Every body, brother, that has any ſenſe of the bleſſing of a religious family muſt do ſo.

                     <p>It is better, to be ſure, where they may be had, but to lay all the happineſs of life upon it, as if a man or a woman could not be religious by themſelves, without they were ſo both together, I do not ſee that; I think you carry it too far.</p>

                     <p>I'll convince you that I do not carry it too far at all; I do not ſay a man or a woman may not be religious by themſelves, tho' the huſband or wife be not ſo; but I ſay, all the help and comfort of relative religion is loſt; the benefit and value of which none knows, but they that enjoy it, or feel the want of it; but there is another loſs which I have not named, and which my heart bleeds in the ſenſe of every day.</p>

                     <p>Did he not! it is true he did not when they were little; but has he not by example, and want of reſtraint, encouraged all manner of levity, vanity, folly, nay, and even vice itſelf in them? Do you think children, thus let looſe to humour their own inclinations, and to the full ſwing of their pleaſures, would not ſoon ſnatch themſelves out of the arms of their mother, and deliver themſelves from the importunities of one that had no other authority with them than that of affection?</p>

                     <p>Why, truly, there is ſomething in that; but I do not ſee that your children are much the worſe; there is your eldeſt ſon, Sir James that is now; he is a pretty young gentleman: I hear a very good character of him.</p>

                     <p>Why truly, brother, as times go now with gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, we may be thankful neither he nor his brother are debauched or vicious; and I am thankful for it. They have good characters for modeſt pretty gentlemen, as you ſay: but ſtill, brother, the main thing is wanting. I cannot be partial to them, though they are my own; there is not the leaſt ſenſe or notion of religion in them; they cannot ſay they have no knowledge of it. I took care to deprive them of that excuſe, as early as they knew any thing: but it goes no farther; my eldeſt ſon will tell me ſometimes, he has as much religion as a gentleman of a thouſand a-year ſhould have; and his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tells me, if I would have had him have any religion, I ſhould have kept our pariſh living for him, and bred him a parſon.</p>

                     <p>It is a dreadful jeſt to me brother; I am far from taking it merrily; you know I was otherwiſe brought up; our father and mother were of another ſort of people; they united their very ſouls in the work of God; they joined in every good thing with the utmoſt affection; they loved the ſouls as well as the bodies of us their children. The family was a houſe of chearful devotion; God was ſerved night and day; and, in a word, as they lived, ſo they died; they dropped comfortably off, and went, as it were, hand in hand to heaven.</p>

                     <p>I'll tell you what can be ſaid, and what will ſtick cloſe to them one time or other, viz. if they are loſt, it is not for want of good inſtruction, or good example; they cannot blame father or mother; it has been all their own. Parents may beg grace for their children; but they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not give it them; they may teach their children good things, but they cannot make them learn; that is the work of God, and parents muſt ſubmit it to him. But, when parents do nothing, nay, rather by example and encouragement, lead their children into wickedneſs, what a dreadful thing is that?</p>

                     <p>Well, but our two ſiſters were not led into wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs; and yet, as I ſaid, they value religion as little as any body.</p>

                     <p>Truly, brother, juſt the other extreme: he has a wild, giddy, play houſe-bred wife; full of wit, and void of grace, that never had any religion, nor knew what the meaning of it was; this has ruined him. My brother was a ſober, well-taught, well-inclined young man, as could be deſired; but getting ſuch a tempter at his elbow, inſtead of a wife to help him on to heaven, ſhe has led him hood-winked to the gates of hell, and goes chearfully along with him; a ſad inſtance, brother, of the want of family-religion!</p>

                     <p>This is all by the miſtake of the thing: it is want of religion that makes men thus. It is in good breeding as it is in philoſophy; a little philoſophy, a little learning, makes a man an Atheiſt; a great deal brings him back, and makes him a Chriſtian: ſo, a little religion makes a man a churl; but, a great deal, teaches him to know himſelf, and be a gentleman. When good principles join with good manners. how ſhould they but illuſtrate the education, and ſet off the breeding of a man of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity? As it is a miſtake to ſay, that jewels ſhould be worn by none but homely women, it is juſt the contrary; ſo, religion adorns education, as jewels give real beauty a double luſtre.</p>

The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the ſcripture is plain in it, <hi>Be not unequally yok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> 2 Cor. vi. 14.

                     <p>Beſides, brother, conſider another thing: how many young women and young men too, who have been religiouſly bred, has this way of marrying been a ſnare to? that, when they come to huſbands with no religion, or to giddy, looſe, profane wives, they drop all their own principles, and become empty of all religion too at laſt.

                     <p>I can take all your banters patiently, brother, and I will explain myſelf, contradict me if you can; I diſtinguiſh them thus: if your daughter deſires to marry any perſon you don't like, I grant that you have power by the law of God to forbid her poſitively: the ſcripture is plain, you have power to diſſolve even a vow or promiſe of hers to marry, or not to marry at all. But if your daughter is not willing to marry one you may like, I do not think you have the ſame right to command; for you might then command her to marry a perſon ſhe may have an abhorrence of, and an averſion to, which could not be; the very laws of matrimony forbid it; ſhe could not repeat the office of matrimony at her marriage, viz. to love and honour him: and to promiſe what ſhe knew at the ſame time would be impoſſible for her to perform, would be to perjure herſelf (for the marriage promiſe is a ſolemn oath) and to deceive her huſband in the groſſeſt manner; neither of which would be lawful for her to do.</p>

                     <p>Say you ſo! I'll be as poſitive as ſhe; if ſhe will ſee him no more, ſhe ſhall ſee me no more; I'll let her know ſo much.</p>

                     <p>I'll try that; I'll go over to Hampſtead in the morning, I'll ſee what I can do with her.</p>
                     <p>[Her ſiſter was now in as great a fright as before; ſhe knew the principle her ſiſter went upon was good, and ſhe was very loth to have her thruſt by violence into a ſtate of life ſhe ſo abhorred; and this made her take more freedom with her father than ſhe would have done, and take more care of her ſiſter too, leſt her father ſhould bring her away and marry her by force; ſo ſhe ſent a man and horſe away the ſame night to Hampſtead to her ſiſter, to give her notice of her father's reſolutions to come over in the morning, and giving her an account of what had paſſed, adviſing her to be gone out of his way ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where elſe.</p>
                     <p>As the young lady had acquainted her aunt with the whole ſtory, her aunt was ſo affected with it, and ſo abundantly juſtified her conduct in it, that, upon this news, ſhe told her, ſhe would place her at a friend's houſe a little way off, and ſhe would undertake to talk to her father, when he came; and if ſhe could not bring him to any reaſon, ſhe would ſend her the next day in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the country to her other aunt, the Widow of Sir James—; ſo ſhe ſent her away in the mean time in her own coach to Hindon, a village beyond Hampſtead,
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:025384_0085_0FCD106415D683E0"/>
with a maid and a footman to attend her, till her father was gone.</p>
                     <p>In the morning (as he ſaid he would) her father came to Hampſtead, and, as ſoon as he had ſaluted his ſiſter, he aſked for his daughter; his ſiſter told him, ſhe was gone a little way to viſit a friend of hers, but deſired him to ſit down.</p>
                     <p>She ſaw he was diſturbed and uneaſy; come, brother, ſays ſhe, be calm and moderate, and do not treat your child with ſo much warmth, let you and me talk of this matter; my niece has given me a full account of the whole ſtory.]</p>

                     <speaker>Bro.</speaker>
                     <p>Has ſhe ſo? but ſhe ſhall give me another ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it, before ſhe and I have done yet.</p>

                     <speaker>Siſt.</speaker>
                     <p>I find, brother, you conſult your paſſions only in all this matter, and I muſt tell you, they are baſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors; I wiſh you would act in cool blood, and conſult your reaſon a little too.</p>

                     <speaker>Siſt.</speaker>
                     <p>No, no, brother, it is evident you act too vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently; if you conſulted your reaſon, I am ſure it would tell you, that you are all wrong: did ever a father hurry and terrify his children ſo with his fury and his paſſions, that they are afraid to ſee him, and ready to ſwoon when they hear he is coming to them; and then do you conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what a child this is, that you uſe thus?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Bro.</speaker>
                     <p>I uſe her! ſhe uſes me, I think! and abuſes me too.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Siſt.</speaker>
                     <p>Be patient, brother, be patient; paſſion, I tell you, is an ill counſellor; conſider the circumſtances of your child, and hear what ſhe has to ſay.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Bro.</speaker>
                     <p>What do you mean by hearing? I think ſhe ha'n't heard what I have to ſay, when ſhe flies thus from place to place, as if ſhe was a thief.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Siſt.</speaker>
                     <p>That is becauſe you do not act like a Chriſtian, brother; you make yourſelf a terror to your children; this dares not ſee you; thoſe at home dare not ſpeak to you: why, what do you mean, brother? you did not treat them thus, when they were little: do you conſider what they are now? that they are women grown, and
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:025384_0086_0FCD1064E407C528"/>
ought to be treated as ſuch? and deſerving women too they are, that the world ſees; and thus expoſe yourſelf moſt wretchedly to treat them thus: I am very free with you.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Bro.</speaker>
                     <p>How do I treat them? What, to provide a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of 2000l. a-year for the youngeſt, a handſome complete young gentleman as any the town can produce, and every way unexceptionable; nay, ſhe owned herſelf he was one ſhe could like very well; and to have her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front him and her father; and to diſmiſs him of her own head without conſulting me, or ſtaying till I came to town! and this after five weeks keeping him company, and when ſhe knew the writings were drawing for her marriage-ſettlement; is this a decent way of treating a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? I think you are free with me indeed, to take their parts in it.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Siſt.</speaker>
                     <p>Well, brother, ſuppoſe all this to be juſt as you relate it, yet, if the young people could not bit it, do we not always, when we make propoſals one to another for our children, make this condition, viz. if the young people can agree? and do we not put them together to talk with one another, on purpoſe that they may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted, and ſee whether they can like one another, or no?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Bro.</speaker>
                     <p>Well, and ſo did I: has he not waited upon her ladyſhip. I tell you, five weeks? was that not time e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to know whether ſhe liked him or no?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Siſt.</speaker>
                     <p>Time enough to like or diſlike, I grant it; and ſhe tells you plainly, ſhe does not like, and cannot mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry him: what would you have? And, as to putting him off in your abſence, ſhe ſays, ſhe told you her mind poſitively, before you went out of town, and would have given you her reaſons for it; but you treated her-with ſo little temper, that ſhe had no room to ſpeak; and at laſt told her; you would have none of her reaſons, but expected ſhe would have him: how do you anſwer that, pray?</p>

                     <speaker>Bro.</speaker>
                     <p>I knew what ſhe had to ſay well enough; howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, I gave her till my return to conſider of it; what had ſhe to do to turn him off without my knowledge, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:025384_0087_0FCD106694AFDA48"/>
a gentleman of his quality? it is an inſult upon her father, and a ſcandal to the whole family.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Siſt.</speaker>
                     <p>That's all anſwered by what I ſaid before, that ſhe told you poſitively, before you went out of town, ſhe would never have him, and indeed had reſolved then to ſee him no more; for what ſhould a young woman keep a man company for, when ſhe reſolves not to have him? whatever you may think, brother, it would not have been very handſome on her ſide; beſides, I can aſſure you, your daughters are none of thoſe women, that do any thing unbecoming.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Bro.</speaker>
                     <p>Why, ſhe did keep him company after it, for all that.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Siſt.</speaker>
                     <p>Never but once, that ſhe might diſmiſs him ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villy, and that was merely a force of your own upon her, becauſe your paſſion with her obliged her to do that work herſelf, which you ought to have done for her.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Bro.</speaker>
                     <p>Well, ſhe is an undutiful, diſreſpectful creature to me; I can't been an unkind father to her; but I'll let her know herſelf my own way.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Siſt.</speaker>
                     <p>You'll conſider of that, Brother, when your paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is over.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Bro.</speaker>
                     <p>Not I; I am no more in a paſſion now, than I was before.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Siſt.</speaker>
                     <p>That may well be indeed; becauſe you were then in ſuch a paſſion, it ſeems, as diſordered all your family. Is paſſion a proper weapon to manage children with, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Bro.</speaker>
                     <p>It is impoſſible for any man to be thus treated by his children, and not be in a paſſion; ingratitude is a thing no man can bear with patience.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Siſt.</speaker>
                     <p>But who ſhall be judge between you, brother? for it is poſſible you may be in the wrong as well as your children; and take this with you as a rule in all ſuch breaches, that generally thoſe that are in the greateſt paſſion, are moſt in the wrong.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Bro.</speaker>
                     <p>No, no; I am ſure I am not in the wrong.</p>

                     <speaker>Siſt.</speaker>
                     <p>That's making yourſelf judge, brother; I think you ſhould let ſome judicious, ſober, impartial perſon hear your child, ſince you won't bear her yourſelf.</p>

                  </sp>
                  <sp>

                     <p>Be that, as the ſenſe of your own conduct di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects you to think, brother; that's none of my buſineſs; ſhe was my ſiſter, and therefore, I ſay no more of that.—But theſe are all digreſſions; the young women, your daughters, thus inſtructed, and thus religiouſly inclined, are grown up; you bring a gentleman to court one of them, who, with all the advantages his perſon and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances preſent, yet wants the main thing which ſhe looks for in a huſband, and without which ſhe declares ſhe will not marry, no, not if a peer of the realm courted her: pray, what have you to ſay to ſuch a reſolution, that you ſhould oppoſe it?</p>

genuine interpretation, it would help to convince you of all I have ſaid: be angry, but be not in a paſſion; to be angry may be juſt, as the occaſion for it may make it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary; but be not immoderately angry, for that is to ſin, and no cauſe of anger can make that neceſſary; and therefore, another text ſays, "Let all bitterneſs and wrath be put away from among you," Eph. iv. 13 Theſe are ſcriptures, brother, for our conduct even with ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers: but, when we come to talk of children, is it not ten thouſand times more binding? we cannot be in a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion at any body without ſin; but, to be in a paſſion at our children, that is all diſtraction, and an abomination that tends to nothing but miſchief.</p>

In the <hi>next</hi> place, a ſplendid fortune, giving her a proſpect of enjoying all that this world can offer. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> A very agreeable perſon, and one that has, by his engaging conduct, made ſome way into her affection; ſo that it is eaſy to ſee, ſhe not only has a reſpect for him, but really loves him: and, <hi>laſtly,</hi> The diſpleaſure of her father, who ſhe never diſobeyed before, and to diſoblige whom, is effectually to ruin herſelf for this world.

                     <p>Why, ſeveral things will convince you of its being the fooliſheſt thing in the world: Grief is a ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, uſeleſs paſſion; it is uſeleſs, becauſe it is perfectly incapable of doing any good, and only capable of doing evil: Grief is indeed no paſſion, but a quality, a diſeaſe of the mind, which muſt be cured; it is an evil ſpirit that muſt be caſt out; beſides, it is a ſenſeleſs thing; for it is a means to no end; it aims at nothing, ſeeks nothing, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours nothing, only corrodes the ſpirits, ſtagnates the very ſenſes, and ſtupifies the ſoul; and therefore, grief was anciently repreſented as a viper, generated in the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and preying upon the vitals of the man; and, when it came within a certain ſpace of the heart, it had two ways to go; if it aſcended, it quitted the hypochondriac veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and ſo poſſeſſing the brain, ended in madneſs; if it deſcended, it poſſeſſed the blood, and ended in death.</p>

                     <p>That his overtaking them upon the road was purely accidental, and without the leaſt deſign, as ſhe might eaſily be ſatisfied by his ſervants and baggage; for, he was juſt ſetting out on a journey of above an hundred miles,
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:025384_0101_0FCCDD59F03B0008"/>
and ſhould not return under three weeks at leaſt. And, ſecondly, That he had no deſign in calling there, to move any thing to her ſiſter concerning the old affair, but only to have two or three words with her relating to himſelf. You know, ſiſter, ſays he, for I muſt ſtill give you that name of reſpect, upon what terms your ſiſter and I part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and, as I promiſed her I would wait on her again, and did not, I have been very uneaſy leſt ſhe might think I ſhewed her ſome diſreſpect, and that I took ill what ſhe ſaid to me; and truly for ſome time ſo I did.

No, Madam, ſays he, I believe that, by the manner of the diſmiſs ſhe had given me: but however, I would not be rude to her, whatever ſhe thought fit to ſay to me. She returned, and with a little more concern than before, that ſhe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, however her ſiſter had thought fit not to go on with what was propoſed, yet that ſhe had not been rude to him. No, Madam, ſays he, not rude. Sir, ſays ſhe, as you had offered nothing to my ſiſter, but what was, like yourſelf, very honourable, I am ſure ſhe does not ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, with a very obliging way of ſpeaking, that her ſiſter underſtood herſelf perfectly well; and I aſſure you, ſays he, ſhe underſtood my character better than I did myſelf. I do not rightly take your meaning, Sir, ſaid ſhe, my ſiſter could make no objections to your charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: Madam, ſaid he, you know very well upon what foundation your ſiſter altered her mind, and abſolutely refuſed any farther treaty with me, viz That I was a profane, wicked, irreligious creature. The fact was true, I owned it to her, that I neither had any knowledge of religion, or deſired any, for which I was a very great brute.</p>
                     <p>I think you were very ſincere, Sir, ſaid ſhe.</p>

he, and ſhall love her ten thouſand times better for it, if that be poſſible, than ever I did before.</p>
                     <p>Says ſhe to him again, Sir, you are pleaſed to banter a little.</p>
                     <p>No, ſiſter, ſays he, I don't banter; and my ſtopping to ſpeak with you was for this reaſon; I do not aſk to ſpeak with your ſiſter, but I beg you will tell her from me very ſeriouſly, that ſhe has been a better inſtructor to me than my father or mother, or all the tutors and friends I had in my life; ſhe has convinced me, that I was a monſter, a ſcandalous fellow, that ought to have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to pretend to a woman that had the leaſt ſenſe of her education, or of him that made her. I have reaſon to give thanks to God every day I live, that ever I ſaw her face, and that I had that repulſe from her. Tell her I recommend it to her, to preſerve that noble, heavenly reſolution, which ſhe ſaid, ſhe had taken up, viz. never to marry any but a religious man: She is undone if ſhe break it; and though I am never able to deſerve her, yet I will always think of her as the mother of all that is or ever will be good in me, and value the memory of her accordingly! He waited no anſwer, but, with all poſſible civility, took his leave, and his horſes being at the door, took horſe and went away. She waited on him to the door, and, as he was paying his reſpects to her, ſitting on his horſe, he ſaid to her, Dear madam, I hope you will give your ſiſter a particular account of what I have ſaid to you. She anſwered, ſhe would not fail to do it with all the exactneſs poſſible.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as he was gone, ſhe ran up to her ſiſter, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe could ſpeak to her, her youngeſt ſiſter cried out to her, Siſter, before you ſpeak, do not aſk me to go down; for I will not ſee him.]</p>

                     <p>Child, do not preſs your ſiſter to hear any thing; I muſt confeſs her caſe is wonderful nice; ſhe loves the gentleman, ſhe does not ſtick to acknowledge it; ſhe has great ſcruples on her thoughts about her duty to her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and they all ſway on the ſame ſide: her father frights her with violent words, and hard uſage, and threatenings of turning her out of doors; againſt all this ſhe ſtands ſingle in obedience to her conſcience; I think we ſhould aſſiſt her.</p>

                     <p>Dear madam, if my ſiſter was not here, I would ſay a great deal more; I think ſhe has acted the nobleſt part in its kind that any young body ever did; I wiſh I may be able to preſerve ſuch a reſolution, if ever it ſhould be my caſe; and I am ſure I ſhould be far from diſcouraging her; but what I was going to tell her was nothing to diſcourage her; I wiſh ſhe would let me tell it you firſt.</p>

                     <p>Well, niece, I do think of the two it may be ſtill better not to tell it your ſiſter, let us lay it up in our hearts; if it be true, and he is a reformed man, we ſhall perhaps hear more of him; if not, to perſuade her he is really changed, is but to make her love him more, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowing whether he thinks any more of her or no, and that can be of no ſervice to her.</p>

                  <head>DIALOGUE IV.</head>
                  <p>THE former dialogue having put an end to the court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip between the gentleman and his miſtreſs for the preſent, and there being ſome interval of time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thoſe things and the remaining part of the ſtory, that interval is filled up with another little affair in the ſame family, of ſtill a nicer nature than the other, though not carried ſo far.</p>
                  <p>The father had frequently diſcourſed theſe things with his eldeſt daughter, in the caſe of her ſiſter, as is to be ſeen in the laſt dialogue, and found, by her diſcourſe, that ſhe was pretty much of her ſiſter's mind, in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of chuſing a huſband: but, having a gentleman in his thoughts for her, who had the character of a very ſober, religious perſon, he made no queſtion but he ſhould diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe this daughter both to her ſatisfaction and his own.</p>
                  <p>It was with a view to this deſign, that he had jeſted with her, in one of their laſt diſcourſes, that he had a religious huſband in ſtore for her, and that he hoped he ſhould give her no occaſion to play the fool, as her ſiſter had done.</p>
                  <p>In conſequence of this, he took occaſion to tell her, one evening after ſupper, that what he had ſpoken in a way of a jeſt to her, at ſuch a time, was really no jeſt in his own thoughts; that he had been ſpoken to by a certain gentleman, a conſiderable merchant in the city, whoſe eldeſt ſon had an inclination to pay his reſpects to her; and I aſſure you, my dear, ſays the father, he has the character of a very ſober, religious gentleman; and, I am ſure, his father and mother are very good people: indeed the whole family are noted for a religious family, and I know no family in the whole city that have a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter character.</p>

She made him no anſwer at all, till he began with her again, Why are you ſo ſilent, child, ſaid her father. Have you nothing to ſay? Methinks when I look back on the diſorder which the obſtinacy of your ſiſter has put us all in, I would be glad to have every difficulty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved before hand with you, and therefore I ſpeak ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that if you have any objections I may hear them, and not be driven afterwards to aſk people pardon, for ill uſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age which I have had no hand in; and I would have you uſe your freedom now, that I may take nothing ill from you afterwards. And thus he preſſed her to ſpeak.</p>

                     <p>I am in no haſte, Sir, to marry; the times terrify me; the education, the manners, the conduct of gentlemen is now ſo univerſally looſe, that I think for a young woman to marry, is like a horſe ruſhing into the battle; I have no courage ſo much as to think of it.</p>

                     <p>Sir, it is thoſe civilized people which I ſpeak of; for even thoſe who now paſs for ſober, are not like what it was formerly. When you look narrowly among them as they are in the groſs, ten rakes to one ſober man; ſo, among the ſober men, that are called civilized men, and whoſe morals will bear any character, there are ten A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſts to one religious man; and which is worſe than all the reſt, if a woman finds a religious man, it is three to one again, whether he agrees with her in principles; and ſo ſhe is in danger of being undone, even in the beſt.</p>

                     <p>[Though her father ſeemed to give it over thus in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with his daughter, yet he had gone farther with the gentleman that had made the propoſal, than he had ſold her; and had invited the father and mother to din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

the next day, with an intent that they ſhould ſee and be acquainted with his daughters; ſuppoſing at the ſame time, that they would bring the young gentleman with them.</p>
                     <p>They came to dinner accordingly; but, as the father knew well enough that the education of their ſon was in a different way from that of his daughter, and that ſhe had declared herſelf ſo poſitively in that part, he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired them privately not to bring their ſon to dinner: when they were come, and before his daughter was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in, the father told them how the caſe ſtood between him and his eldeſt daughter, and that he ſaw no remedy but this, that, as he had not told her any thing of the deſign of his invitation, or that they were the family he had deſigned her a huſband out of; ſo, if they thought fit to turn their eyes to his ſecond daughter, he was in hopes ſhe would have more with than to run into the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous ſcruples of the eldeſt. They preſently agreed, that it was not at all reaſonable to force the inclination of the young lady; that they ſay no room to bring the opinions in religion together, in their children, their opinions at that time differing extremely, and their ſon being as poſitive, they believed, as his daughter: ſo they ſaid with all their hearts, if their ſon could fancy the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond daughter as well, it ſhould be the ſame thing to them: however, the mother of the young gentleman aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, if he would give her leave to enter into diſcourſe with his daughter upon the ſubject of her ſcruples? He told her, with all his heart, for he would be glad to have her change her mind; becauſe, as on the one hand, he ſhould be very well ſatisfied to bring them together, ſo he really thought her notions were empty and ſimple, and ſhould be glad ſhe was made wiſer; but then, Madam, ſays he, you muſt not diſcover the real deſign, for, if you do, ſhe will be backward to ſpeak freely. She agreed to that, and ſo this private diſcourſe ended; and his daughters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing introduced, and the uſual ceremonies paſſed, they went to dinner, the young ladies knowing nothing of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of their being invited.</p>
                     <p>The father and mother were charmed at the conduct: of the young woman, her perſon and manner, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty

of their behaviour, and above all the politeneſs and pertinence of their diſcourſe; and ſomething happening to be ſaid about marrying, the father falls to rallying his daughters upon their nicety in that point, that nothing would ſerve them but religious men. There is my daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter—, ſays he, (pointing to his youngeſt) I think nothing will do for her but a parſon; ſhe refuſed a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of 2000l. a-year t'other day, becauſe he was not reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious enough for her.</p>
                     <p>No, Madam, ſays his daughter, my father means, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had no religion at all; hardly ſo much as a coach horſe; for a coach-horſe often knows the way to the church-door.</p>
                     <p>That alters the caſe quite, ſaid Madam: why, Sir, ſays ſhe, you would not have married your daughter to a brute! a man without religion is a worſe brute than a horſe! for the horſe obeys the dictates of nature, but an Atheiſt acts againſt reaſon, nature and common ſenſe. I would not marry a child of mine to a man of no religion, if he had ten thouſand pounds a year.</p>
                     <p>Well, ſays he, there's my daughter—(pointing to his eldeſt) ſhe goes farther; ſhe is not ſatisfied with a religious huſband, but ſhe muſt have one of her own o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion in religion, that goes to the church where ſhe goes to church, and worſhips juſt as the worſhips: I don't think ſhe will ever be pleaſed, while ſhe lives.</p>
                     <p>Madam, ſays the eldeſt, I expected my father would be upon my bones next; my father talks of my opinion, as if I was ſomething that nobody elſe is; as if I was one of the new prophets, or of ſome ſtrange, ſingular opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, ſomething monſtrous in religion: all I ſay is, that as I profeſs nothing but what I think is right, and wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>Madam, ſays the old lady, your father does but jeſt with you; he can never oppoſe ſo reaſonable a thing as that; I muſt confeſs, I think it is much to be deſired; I will not ſay but there is a poſſibility of doing well with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

it; it may not be a ſin; but I own, it is better, if it can be ſo.</p>
                     <p>I am ſure it would be a ſin in me, ſays the daughter, becauſe it would be againſt my conſcience.</p>
                     <p>Nay, Madam, ſays the other, that's true; and you are very much in the right to inſiſt upon it, if it be ſo; and no doubt, your father will be far from offering any thing that may ſeem to be a violence upon your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
                     <p>I offer violence, Madam! ſays the father, nay, they are above that; they take upon them to ſay, I will, and I won't, to their father; I aſſure you they are paſt my offering violence to them.</p>
                     <p>In nothing, Madam, but this crabbed buſineſs of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying, ſays the daughter, and there indeed we do take ſome liberty with my father.</p>
                     <p>Well, Sir, ſays the old lady, you muſt allow liberty there; marriage is a caſe for life, and muſt be well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered; and the young ladies are to bear it, fall it how it will, you know, for better or worſe: they had need be allowed ſome liberty there.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, Madam, ſays the youngeſt, all the liberty we take is in negatives only; we don't offer to take any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy that my father don't like, only we don't care to take ſuch as we don't like ourſelves.</p>
                     <p>The old gentleman then put in: Upon my word, Sir, ſays he, I think your daughters are in the right; for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, though we may refuſe to let them marry where they may chuſe, yet I can't think we ſhould deny them the liberty to refuſe what we may offer; or elſe we may as well give them in marriage, as was done in old days, and never let them ſee one another.</p>
                     <p>The eldeſt ſiſter turned her head towards her father as this, but ſaid nothing.</p>
                     <p>I underſtand you, Betty, ſays her father; but ſhe ſaid nothing ſtill; and the old lady, finding the diſcourſe pinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a little hard, began ſome other talk, and ſoon after, the men withdrawing, left the ladies together.</p>

                     <p>Religion, Madam, without doors is one thing, religion within doors is another. In the town, among my acquaintance, and in the neighbourhood, a due charity to every one is what I think the Chriſtian principle calls for, and I converſe freely with good people of every opinion, extending charity to all in lowlineſs of mind, eſteeming every one better than myſelf: but, within doors, the caſe alters; family religion is a ſociable thing, and God ſhould be worſhipped there with one heart, and with one voice; there can be no ſeparation there, without a dreadful breach both of charity and duty.</p>

<pb n="117" facs="unknown:025384_0116_0FCD10A20AFD9170"/>
but we are talking of a difference in opinion only, where the fundamentals may be the ſame.</p>

                     <p>Madam, I recal the word principles then, and join with you to confine it to opinion only; but it is the ſame thing in its proportion; the union can never be perfect, while the differing ſentiments of things leave room for diſputes between them: for example, Madam, the differing forms of worſhip; one will pray by a book only, the other without a book wholly; this is as light a difference as can be ſpoken of. But how ſhall God be worſhipped with the united voice and affections of the whole family even in this caſe? what helps will two ſuch relations be to one another, in praying to God either by themſelves, or with their families?</p>

                     <p>It is not enough, Madam, that they being ſincerely religious apart, ſhall worſhip God in their own ſeparate way, though better ſo than not at all; but the zeal, the affection, the uniting their hearts in their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, their praying with and for one another; this alas! is all loſt. Then, ſay it be in the public worſhip, there they make a woeful ſeparation, God, that has made them one, is ſerved by them as two; God has joined them together, and they part aſunder in their ſerving him; God has made them one: how does this conſiſt, Madam?</p>

                     <p>This is not all, Madam, there are ſeveral fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily circumſtances beſides theſe, which make union of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion abſolutely neceſſary: as firſt, family-worſhip is a thing, without which families, however privately and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parately devout, are coupled with heathens, Jer. x. 25.

                     <p>Well, Madam, we come to another caſe; ſuppoſe the huſband and wife we are ſpeaking of have children, what foundation of eternal ſchiſm is there in the family! ſome of the children adhere to the father, ſome to the mother; ſome worſhip in this mount, and ſome no where but at Jeruſalem; ſome go with the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſome with the mother; ſome kneel down with the father, ſome with the mother; till, as they grow up, they really learn not to kneel down at all: family education, united inſtruction, caution, example, they are all dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully mangled and divided, till in the end they come to nothing; and the children grow out of government, paſt inſtruction, and all loſt. Theſe, Madam, are ſome of the reaſons I would have given my father (if he would have had patience with me) why, in his late propoſal he had to make, I deſired that I night be at liberty to chuſe by my own principles, and not at random, as too many do</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Old Lad.</speaker>
                     <p>But, Madam, do you not allow, that if both parties are ſincerely pious and religious, that they may make allowances to one another, and make conſcience of hindering and palling back one another in the duties of religion?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Eld. ſiſt.</speaker>
                     <p>Truly, Madam, as to that, two things of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to my view, for I have often conſidered them both: Firſt, the more ſincere in religion either of them is, the more fixed in principle and opinion its likely they will be, and the farther from making abatements to one another; and eſpecially, ſecondly, in the great article of education, and inſtructing their children; for what tender mother,
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:025384_0118_0FCD10A60221E9E8"/>
that having fixed her opinion, as ſhe thinks, in the beſt manner and way, could bear not to have their children brought up in the ſame ſentiments of religion, which ſhe thinks moſt agreeable to the revealed will of God? And the more conſcientious and religious ſhe was, the more ſteadily ſhe would cleave to it as her duty; and the like of the man: ſo that here would be a conſtant heart-burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and uneaſineſs.</p>

                     <p>Truly I have; but I ſay now I have been wrong to them both; and indeed more to my youngeſt daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than to my eldeſt: for, ſhe refuſed the gentleman becauſe he really had no religion at all, and yet I was in a violent paſſion with her.</p>

                     <p>Nay, that was hard indeed: for, if there be all this to be ſaid, why a woman ſhould not marry a man of a different opinion in religion, there muſt be much more to be ſaid why ſhe ſhould not marry one that deſpiſes religion and this indeed I ſaid to your youngeſt daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, applauding her conduct, though I did not know that you had uſed her hardly on that account.</p>

                     <p>[Upon this footing the diſcourſe ended for a time; and all thoughts of the match for the eldeſt daughter with the ſon of that gentlewoman being laid aſide for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, the old lady, at parting, in a friendly manner, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited the young ladies to her houſe, and they promiſed to come, and the father ſaid aloud he would come and bring them.</p>
                     <p>It was not long before the young ladies put their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in mind of his appointment; for, being mightily pleaſed with the old gentlewoman, they had a great mind to pay the viſit, that the acquaintance might be ſettled. Their father appointed the next day, but being interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed juſt at the time he intended to go, he cauſed them to go without him, and ſend the coach back for him to come after them when his buſineſs was done.</p>

with every thing ſhe could think of; and, after abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of other uſual chat, they fell to talking the old ſtories over again about religious huſbands, and the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity there was to have both huſband and wife join their endeavours for propagating family-religon. The young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt daughter repeated her mother's maxim; Madam, ſays ſhe, it was a rule my mother gave us at her death, and which I ſee ſo much weight in, that I deſire to make it the foundation upon which I would build all my proſpects of happineſs, viz. <hi>That a religious life is the only heaven upon earth.</hi> I have added ſome other things to it ſince, which my own obſervation directs me to, but which I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve you will allow to be in their degree juſt, ſuch as theſe, viz. That a religious family is one of the greateſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of a religious life: that where huſband and wife are not mutually, at leaſt, if not equally religious, there can never be truly a religious family: that therefore, for a religiouſly inclined woman to marry an irreligious huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, is to entail perſecution upon herſelf as long as ſhe lives. The old lady replied, I find, Madam, as young as you are, you have ſtudied this point very well. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, Madam, ſaid the eldeſt ſiſter, my ſiſter has had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for it; for the has been hard put to it, what with the offers of an extraordinary match, my father's violent paſſion, and (among ourſelves, Madam,) not a little the importunity of her own affections, that, for my part, I muſt confeſs I wonder ſhe has been able to hand her ground. They are three powerful arguments, I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, ſaid the old lady: pray, Madam, as far as it may be proper, let me know ſomething of the matter; you need not mention perſons; I am not inquiſitive on that ſcore, I aſſure you. If my ſiſter gives me leave, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, ſays the eldeſt; the youngeſt ſaid ſhe left her at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. Why then, Madam, ſays ſhe, my father—. [Here ſhe gives her an abridgement of the whole ſtory, but without the moſt extravagant part of her father's paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that it might not reflect upon him.]</p>
                     <p>Well, Madam, ſays ſhe, I will not ſay all my thoughts on this ſurpriſing ſtory, becauſe your ſiſter is here; for it is a rule with me, never to praiſe any one to their face, or reproach any behind their backs; but it is an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:025384_0123_0FCD10AE6FA065E8"/>
ſtory indeed; and, turning to the youngeſt ſiſter, ſhe ſaid to her very ſeriouſly, I pray God fortify you, child, in ſuch reſolutions, and grant that you may have the true end of them fully anſwered; that, if ever you do marry, it may be to a man as uncommonly ſerious, pious, and ſincere, as you have been inimitably reſolute in refuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch great offers, for the want of it. Then, turning to her eldeſt ſiſter, ſays ſhe, this ſurpriſing ſtory puts me in mind of another ſtory, which a very good man, an old acquaintance of ours, told me the other day, and which, they ſay, has juſt now happened to a young gentleman that he knows in the country; it is a pretty way off too, but he told us his name; I believe my huſband knows the name, and I tell you the ſtory for your ſiſter's encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement: who knows, but ſhe may be a means, by ſuch unexampled conduct, as this of hers is, to bring the gentleman ſhe has had upon her hands to ſome ſenſe of his condition?</p>
                     <p>There is a gentleman in that country, of a very good family, and of a very great eſtate, but young, and, I think he ſaid a batchelor; he is not above ſix and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and has between two and three thouſand a-year; it ſeems he is a moſt accompliſhed, well-bred man, a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome charming perſon: and every thing that could be ſaid of a man, to ſet him out, he ſaid of him: he had, indeed, been of a family, he ſaid, that had been imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently wicked, ſo that the very name of religion had ſcarce been heard of among them for ſome ages; and young Maſter, ſaid my friend, could not be ſaid well to be worſe than his father or grandfather who went before him.</p>
                     <p>However, it happened it ſeems, that he went to Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, I think, ſays ſhe, my friend ſaid it was laſt winter, and when he came back, he was ſtrangely melancholy and dejected, and quite altered in his converſation; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of riding abroad and viſiting the gentlemen, and receiving viſits from them, he ſhunned all company, walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed abo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> his gardens and woods all alone till very late in the night, and all his ſervants wondered what ailed hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>; that one night they were in a great fright for him, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he was out on foot, and alone; when, about ten o'<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clock
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:025384_0124_0FCD10B1A1D4D3E0"/>
at night, he came in with a poor, honeſt country fellow with him, that lived almoſt three miles off; that the next day he took that poor man home to his houſe, and ſent for his wife and children, who all lived before in a poor cottage on the waſte, and provided for them; gave the poor man a farm rent free for twelve years, which always went for 22 l. a-year, with a good houſe; lent him a ſtock for manuring it too, and made him bailiff of the manor, and, in ſhort, made a man of him. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon every body ſaid, that the eſquire had been in ſome great danger or other, and the poor man had ſaved his life; and, when ſomebody happened to ſay as much to him one day, he anſwered, yes, that poor man had done more than ſaved his life, for he had ſaved his ſoul.</p>
                     <p>It ſeems this poor labouring wretch, though miſerable to the laſt degree as to the world, was yet known to be a moſt religious, ſerious Chriſtian, and a very modeſt, humble, but knowing and ſenſible man, and he had been diſcourſing good things with him, and, from that time forward, the poor man was ſcarce ever from him; that it was obſerved by ſome of the ſervants, that the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after the poor man came home with him he came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and brought a Bible with him, which was left in the young gentleman's chamber, and that this poor man and he were often locked up an hour or two together, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every day; that next market-day the poor man went to the next market-town, upon ſome buſineſs for the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, and brought home a new Bible, and ſeveral other religious books, and that his maſter was continually read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them; in ſhort, our friend tells us, ſaid ſhe, that he is become the moſt ſober, religious Chriſtian, that, for a man of his fortune, and quality, has ever been heard of, and that he is admired by all the country for it.</p>
                     <p>I tell you this ſtory, Madam, turning to the youngeſt ſiſter, to confirm you in your reſolution, and to let you ſee, that there are ſome religious gentlemen in the world ſtill, and that the gentlemen may be aſhamed, when they pretend to ſay, religion is below their quality; for my friend ſays, that this gentleman is, with his religion, alſo the humbleſt, ſweeteſt tempered creature in the world, ready to do good offices to the pooreſt in the country,
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:025384_0125_0FCD10B2F719CA08"/>
and yet mannerly, and agreeably pleaſant with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt; and his family is a little pattern of virtue to all round them.</p>
                     <p>Ay, Madam, ſays the eldeſt, it is ſuch a gentleman my ſiſter would have. But, ſays her ſiſter, where are they to be found? I never expect it. Pray, Madam, ſays the eldeſt ſiſter, in what part of the world does this black ſwan, this unheard of, non-ſuch thing of a gentleman live? I really forget the place, Madam, ſays the old lady, but it is ſomewhere in Hampſhire.</p>
                     <p>She perceived, at that word, both the young ladies change a little, and looked at one another; ſo ſhe turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her diſcourſe off to ſome other ſubject, and left them in the dark, as to the name of the gentleman; for ſhe perceived they both gueſſed at it, or ſuſpected it.</p>
                     <p>When they had taken their leave, and the two ſiſters were in the coach coming home, ſays the elder ſiſter to the other, did you obſerve Mrs. B—'s ſtory of the gentleman in Hampſhire? Yes, ſaid the other, I did; and I believe you fancy its the ſame perſon we know of. It is very true, ſays the eldeſt, I did think ſo, all the while ſhe was telling the ſtory; and I expected ſhe would name him, but I was loth to aſk her his name. I am glad you didn't, ſays the other, for I know no good it can be to me to hear it, one way or other, now he is gone. Why, would not you be glad to know that he was really ſuch a one as ſhe has deſcribed? ſays the eldeſt. Yes, truly, for his own ſake I ſhould, ſaid the ſiſter; but it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to me now; I had rather never have him mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at all to me, upon any occaſion whatever.</p>
                     <p>After they were come home, their father, who had been engaged all the while, had ſent the coach back for them, with an excuſe for his not coming, was very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitive to know of them, what diſcourſe they had had; and, his eldeſt daughter telling him one ſtory and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtory, he would cry, Well, was that all? For he expected ſhe had broke the thing to them. No, ſays the eldeſt, ſhe told us a ſtrange ſtory in Hampſhire; and with that repeated the paſſage word for word. Her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther took no notice of it at that time, but two or three days after, as they were at ſupper, he ſays to his eldeſt
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:025384_0126_0FCD10B46654CE20"/>
daughter, Betty, who do you think the gentleman in Hampſhire is, that Mrs. B—told you the ſtory of? I cannot tell, ſays ſhe: pray who was it? even as I thought when you told me of it, ſaid the father, for I had heard ſomething of it before; it is nobody elſe but Mr.—, the ſame your wiſe ſiſter there thought fit to treat with ſo much ill manners.</p>
                     <p>Nay, Sir, ſays the eldeſt, do not ſay my ſiſter treated him with ill manners; for he owns the contrary to that himſelf: but how are you ſure of it, Sir, that it is he? Why, I have had the ſtory, ſays her father, from her huſband, who is greatly affected at it, and he named his name to me, not knowing in the leaſt that I know any thing of him.</p>
                     <p>Truly, ſaid the eldeſt, I am very glad of it for his ſake; but it does not ſignify a farthing to her now; for, if he was to come to her again to-morrow, with all his ſobriety and reformation about him, ſhe would have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſay to him.</p>
                     <p>Why ſo, child, ſays the father, did you not own ſhe loved him? Yes, ſays the daughter, before the came to know what a creature he was. Well then, ſays the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if that be removed, and he is become another man, ſhe will love him again; and ſhe had no other objection againſt him, had ſhe? No, Sir, ſays the daughter, ſhe had no other objection; but ſhe will never believe him, let his pretences to religion be what they will. Why ſo? ſays the father. Becauſe, Sir, he told her, that if he had known her mind, he would have pretended to a world of reformation and religion, and that he did not doubt but he could be hypocrite enough to cheat her.</p>
                     <p>Nay, if he has been ſo fooliſh, I know not what to ſay to it, ſays the father: let it reſt as it is; if ſhe will not have him, whether he be religious or not religious, then the objection of his not being religious, was a ſham and a cloak, and ſhe ſtands out in mere obſtinacy againſt her own intereſt, purely to affront her father; let her go on, till ſhe comes to be convinced by her own misfortune; I'll meddle no more about it.</p>
                     <p>The eldeſt ſiſter failed not to relate this ſtory very par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to her ſiſter; who, very gravely muſing on the
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:025384_0127_0FCD10B66A18F658"/>
particular, anſwered her ſiſter thus, after ſeveral other ſober and religious expreſſions:</p>
                     <p>Dear ſiſter, ſays ſhe, this thing has been affliction e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to me; but my father's conduct has always made it double; becauſe he cannot talk of it without reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and unkindneſs; if it be really ſo, that this is the gentleman Mrs.—told us the ſtory of yeſterday, I ſhould rejoice; nay, though I am loth to be cheated, and what he ſaid of playing the hypocrite with me, has made me the more backward to give credit to outſides; yet, were I ſure it was a real work of God in him, and that he was become a religious gentleman, you know I have affection enough to rejoice on my own account, and to entertain him after another manner than before: but yet two things make it ſtill remote from me, Firſt, That I have no demonſtration of the truth of the fact: and, Secondly, That, if it is ſo, he has made no ſtep towards me, and perhaps never may; and you know, ſiſter, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſhe, it is no buſineſs of mine, till he does.</p>
                     <p>Why, that's true, ſays the eldeſt ſiſter; but, what muſt be done then?</p>
                     <p>Done! ſays ſhe, let it alone; let it reſt, till we heat ſomething or other of it in the ordinary way of ſuch things.</p>
                     <p>But what muſt we do with my father? ſays the eldeſt, for he is always talking to me about it.</p>
                     <p>Do! ſays the other, give the ſame anſwer to him from me as I do to you.</p>
                     <p>Then, ſays the eldeſt, I am ſure he never will reſt, till he brings it about again; for he is ſtrangely intereſt upon it.</p>
                     <p>Let that be as pleaſes God, I will be wholly neuter, ſays the youngeſt ſiſter.</p>
                     <p>Some time after this diſcourſe, the father having ſome occaſion for his health, went down to the bath, and tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all his daughters with him, he continued there ſome months; in which time they contracted an acquaintance with a lady and her two daughters, who came thither from Hampſhire. The old lady had been a widow of a gentleman of quality, by whom ſhe had two daughters, but was married to an eminent clergyman in the country
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:025384_0128_0FCD10B79935BC40"/>
where ſhe lived; and they were all together at the bath, and lodged in the ſame apartments with theſe ladies.</p>
                     <p>It happened one day after dinner, talking freely toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther about marrying religious huſbands and wives; the eldeſt daughter, as what is always much upon the mind, will be in proportion much upon the tongue, inſiſted in diſcourſe upon the miſery of unequal matches, and how unhappy it was, either to huſband or wife, when a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, pious, ſincere Chriſtian, whether man or woman, was married to another, who had no ſenſe of religion; and ſhe gives a long account of a relation of her father's, but without naming their aunt, how good a huſband ſhe had in all other reſpects, how comfortably and pleaſantly they lived, but only for that one thing: and then ſhe told them (ſtill without naming any body) how many odd trick Sir James ſerved his lady, and the like.</p>
                     <p>Well, Madam, ſays the old clergyman, I can tell you ſuch a ſtory of a lady in your country, as I believe you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard the like. I do not know the woman, ſays the doctor, but I know the gentleman intimately well, and have had a great deal of religious converſation with him, upon the occaſion I ſhall tell you of.</p>
                     <p>He courted a young lady, ſays the doctor, but, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe lived in our country or the city, or where, he is perfectly mute, only that he often tells her Chriſtian name; and ſeeing he ſeems reſolved to conceal her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, no body will be ſo rude to preſs him on that head.</p>
                     <p>The gentleman, ſays the doctor, is of a very good fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, has a noble eſtate, a comely perſon, and a complete courtly education, and till this happened, was almoſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways at London.</p>
                     <p>His miſtreſs muſt be little leſs than an angel in human ſhape, by his diſcription; but that we give no heed to; for, Madam, ſays the old doctor, you know, men in love give themſelves a liberty that way: but, however, after all things were agreed, and the writings drawing, it ſeems ſhe threw him off entirely, and refuſed him merely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the found he was a man of no religion.</p>
                     <p>Says the eldeſt ſiſter, how could ſhe know that, Sir? he was not ſo fooliſh to tell her ſo himſelf, I ſuppoſe.</p>
                     <p>Yes, ſays the doctor, he did: why then, ſays the ſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:025384_0129_0FCD10BC2FB685F8"/>
I ſuppoſe he was indifferent whether he had her or no. Indeed, ſays the doctor, one would think ſo, and I ſaid ſo to him: but he told me, that it was ſo far from that, that he had taken up his reſolution never to have any other woman, if ſhe were the richeſt, beſt, and moſt beautiful creature alive.</p>
                     <p>Then, perhaps, the lady has a ſuperior fortune to him, beſides her other qualifications, ſays the ſiſter. No, juſt the contrary, ſays the doctor. But, Madam, ſays he, I'll tell you the hiſtory of this gentleman, if it is not too long for you; it is a ſtory that cannot be unprofitable to any one to hear, eſpecially to you, ladies, who have taken up ſuch happy reſolutions about marrying none but religious huſbands. The ladies bowed, in token they deſired him to go on with the ſtory. So the doctor went on.</p>
                     <p>Nothing touched this gentleman ſo near, ſays he, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he was gone from his miſtreſs, as to reflect what kind of a wretch or monſter he was, that a virtuous young lady, and one who he had reaſon to believe had no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like of him, ſhould be afraid to marry him for fear of being ruined, and that ſhe ſhould think, if ſhe took him, ſhe declared war againſt heaven, and renounced all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions of duty to her Maker.—[Here he related the whole ſtory, his talk with himſelf, the diſcourſe at the chocolate-houſe, his retreat into the country, his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening to hear the poor countryman at prayer, his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation with him upon the way, and his conduct after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, all in the manner as related before.]</p>
                     <p>We muſt ſuppoſe the ſiſters to have much leſs ſenſe of religion than they were known to have, and particularly leſs ſenſe of the caſe itſelf, in which it was eaſy to know they were nearly concerned, if they were not very much moved with the particulars of this ſtory; and no ſooner had the doctor finiſhed his relation, with ſome very hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome reflections upon it, but the ſiſters longed to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw, to compare their own thoughts together, where they could do it with freedom.</p>
                     <p>But the eldeſt daughter went farther; for though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps her curioſity was not greater than her ſiſter's, yet, as her courage was greater, and her concerns in it leſs,
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:025384_0130_0FCD10BDC8681598"/>
ſhe was reſolved to get the name of this gentleman, if poſſible; accordingly, at length, ſhe aſked the doctor, if the name of this gentleman was a ſecret; No, Madam, ſays the doctor, his name is no ſecret; it is Mr.—the eldeſt ſon of Sir Thomas—, by whom he enjoys an eſtate of 2000l. a-year, and after his uncle, who is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry old, he has near a thouſand pounds a-year more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed upon him.</p>
                     <p>The two ſiſters had heard too much to continue any longer; the youngeſt eſpecially, who pretending ſome indiſpoſition, withdrew, and her ſiſter ſoon after: when her ſiſter came to her, ſhe ſaid, well, child, what do you ſay to this ſtory? there's no room to think there can be any deſign in this old gentleman, or any hypocriſy in the particulars if they are true.</p>
                     <p>Her ſiſter ſaid never a word; but ſhe found ſhe had been crying, and that ſhe was ſtill too full of it to ſpeak; ſo ſhe let her alone a while, till, after ſome time fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a great ſigh, which gave her paſſions ſome vent, ſays the youngeſt, Why, what do you ſay to it? I ſay to it! ſays the eldeſt ſiſter, I can ſay neither leſs or more to it than what the two diſciples ſaid to one another, going to Emmaus, about our Saviour's diſcourſe to them, after he was gone, did not our hearts burn within us when he talked to us? I am ſure mine did, ſays ſhe; ay, and mine too, ſays the youngeſt. But it is all nothing to me now. Nay, ſays the eldeſt ſiſter, if all the ſtory be true, it may be ſomething to you ſtill; for you ſee, the doctor ſays, he is reſolved to have nobody elſe. I give no heed to that, ſays the youngeſt ſiſter, for the tables are quite turned now between us, and he ought to refuſe me now, for the very reaſon that I refuſed him before; for I have no religion for ſuch a convert as this, I am ſure, any more than a man without any notion of a deity, had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion enough for me. Well, well, ſays her ſiſter, let Providence, which brings all things to paſs its own way, work as he ſees fit; I dare ſay, as my aunt ſaid, we ſhall hear more of it.</p>
                     <p>They had very little diſcourſe at that time but what ended thus; but the eldeſt ſiſter had a great mind her father ſhould hear the ſtory too, if poſſible, before they

left the place; and ſhe reſolved to take an opportunity to bring it about, if ſhe could; but ſhe was happily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by the forwardneſs of her father to complain of his daughter's nice<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>y on all occaſions: for, in diſcourſe with the doctor and his lady, the young ladies on both ſides being abſent, he took a liberty to exclaim vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly how fooliſh one of his daughters had been, and how ſhe had obſtinately caſt off a gentleman of ſuch and ſuch qualifications, as before. My dear, ſays the doctor's la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to him, pray tell Mr.—the ſtory you told the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies yeſterday: With all my heart, ſaid the doctor; ſo he repeated the whole ſtory.</p>
                     <p>The father was exceedingly ſurprized at the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, but more when the doctor told him the name of the gentleman. However, he held his tongue, as it happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and did not let the doctor know how near it related to his family; but in the evening, taking his opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he calls his eldeſt daughter to him. Hark ye, Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſays he, did the doctor tell you a ſtory t'other day of a gentleman in Hampſhire? Yes, Sir, ſays ſhe. And was your ſiſter by? ſays he. Yes, Sir, ſays ſhe. And do you know that this is the ſame Mr.—that we know of? ſays her father. Yes, Sir, ſays ſhe, he told us his name: Well, and what does your ſiſter ſay to it? ſays he. She ſays little, Sir, ſays his daughter; but ſhe cannot but be moved at it; for 'tis a ſurpriſing ſtory. I dare ſay, ſays her father, I ſhall hear of him again; ſhe won't turn him off again, I hope; I am ſure ſhe does not deſerve him now. She ſays ſo herſelf, ſays the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, That he ought to refuſe her now, for the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that ſhe refuſed him. Well, ſays the father, we ſhall certainly hear of him again; I am fully perſuaded, he will have no reſt till he comes to ſee her again.</p>
                     <p>A few weeks after this they returned to London, and the eldeſt ſiſter being impatient to ſee her aunt, and to give her ſome account of theſe things, they went both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to Hampſtead: when they came thither, ſhe failed not to give her aunt a particular account of all theſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, as well that which had happened at their viſit to the merchant's lady at London, as what had happened at the bath; all which, but eſpecially the laſt, were won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully

ſurpriſing and agreeable to their aunt. Well, niece, ſays the aunt to the youngeſt ſiſter, what do you think of theſe things? I can ſay little to them, Madam, ſays ſhe; I am glad, for his ſake, that God opened his eyes. But is it no ſatisfaction to you, child, ſays her aunt, that you have been ſo far the inſtrument of it? Alas! Madam, ſays ſhe, I the inſtrument! I have been none of the inſtrument, not I. Yes, yes, replies her aunt, you have, and he acknowledges it too: and turning to the eldeſt ſiſter, ſays ſhe, I think, child, now you may perform your promiſe, and tell your ſiſter what he ſaid to you when he called here <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s he went out of town. Yes, Madam, ſays ſhe, ſo I think too. [Here ſhe gives her ſiſter a full account of what he had ſaid, as before.]</p>
                     <p>I think you might have told me this before, ſays the youngeſt ſiſter. Nay, ſiſter, replied ſhe, did you not take me ſhort, and forbid me telling you any thing, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew out of the room, and bid me tell it my aunt? Why, that's true, I did ſo, ſays ſhe again, and I have been ſo confuſed, that I know not when I do well, and when I do ill: indeed, niece, ſays her aunt, I alſo obliged her not to tell you; for I concluded, if there was any thing in it, we ſhould hear of it again: and if we did not, it could do you no ſervice.</p>
                     <p>While they were talking thus, a coach ſtopt at the door, and a ſervant brought word, their father and another gentleman with him was below ſtairs.</p>
                     <p>It will be neceſſary here to leave this part a while, and bring forward the ſtory of the young gentleman as far as it is needful to the co-herence of things; the ſtory alſo will be very ſhort.</p>
                     <p>The young gentleman having, as has been ſaid, taken his new tutor, the poor countryman, into the houſe with him, received ſo much aſſiſtance from his advice, and had daily ſuch inſtruction in religious things, from the whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome plain counſels of this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>, poor creature, that the benefit of them ſoon appeared in his converſation, and his reformation ſoon became viſible in the general courſe of his life; he kept company with the ſobereſt, graveſt, and moſt religious perſons that he could find; he kept a moſt ſober, regular, reformed family; and, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:025384_0133_0FCD10C26E8B5FF0"/>
to reſolve to reſide pretty much there, for the better government of his family, he took in a young miniſter of an extraordinary good character to be his chaplain, and cauſed every ſervant who appeared diſorderly or vicious to be put away out of his houſe.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are the natural conſequences of a ſincere work upon his own mind, were the viſible product of that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed change, and indeed an agreeable evidence of the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of it; but they were far from being the ſum of things; for, in a word, he proved to be a moſt pious, ſincere Chriſtian in all his ways; and as this was attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a natural ſweetneſs in his diſpoſition, modeſty and generoſity in his manner, and an excellent temper, free from all manner of pride or hypocriſy, it made him perfectly agreeable to all ſorts of people; thoſe who were not like him valued and honoured him, and the ſober, religious part of men were delighted in him beyond ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion.</p>
                     <p>He went on thus for near two years, lived generally in the country; eſpecially, becauſe he could not be long from his faithful aſſiſtant, the poor clergyman, who was upon all occaſions, as we may ſay, clerk of the cloſet to him, and with whom he kept up a moſt religious, but ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret converſation, and had retirements with him, which none were acquainted with but themſelves.</p>
                     <p>But in all this enjoyment of himſelf, and the retired life he had now placed his delight in, he found ſomething ſtill wanting too, as well to complete his happineſs here, as to forward his progreſs in things of an eternal and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable nature; and he began to ſay to himſelf, that he had robbed himſelf of much of his comfort, in neglecting ſo long to have the aſſiſtance of that bleſſed creature whom God had made the firſt inſtrument to touch his mind with a ſenſe of good things.</p>
                     <p>Theſe thoughts dwelt upon his heart a good while, and he found himſelf very uneaſy: it occurred to him, that certainly, as it had pleaſed God to make that young woman to give him the alarm, and ſtrike his ſoul with the firſt ſenſe of his wretched condition, he had certainly furniſhed her for his farther aſſiſtance, and made her ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of giving him further help, light, and directions in
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:025384_0134_0FCD10C3641C1848"/>
his duty; and that he ſtood in the way of his own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts all the while he was without her; nay, that he ſeemed to reject the inſtrument by which God had done him ſo much good, without inquiring whether God had deſigned her for his farther benefit or no.</p>
                     <p>He reflected, how ſuitable a diſpoſition ſhe was of in religious things, to the deſign he had of keeping up a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious family, and how admirable a wife, a mother, a miſtreſs, ſuch a lady muſt needs be to him, and his whole houſe; who now ſaw the truth of the excellent ſentence ſhe had often repeated to him, viz. That a religious life was ſhe only heaven upon earth. He diſcourſed all theſe things with his faithful counſellor, poor William, who perſuaded him by all the perſuaſious he could uſe, to go and make her his own; for it was the only fear, William ſaid he had for him, that he would marry ſome lady, who, having been brought up in the uſual levity of the times, would pull him backward, rather than forward him in his religious reſolutions.</p>
                     <p>With theſe thoughts he reſolved to go to London, and apply himſelf immediately to his former miſtreſs, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain her for his own, if poſſible; but was exceedingly diſappointed, when he found ſhe and her father, and all the family, were gone to the Bath.</p>
                     <p>However he waited, and hearing of her return, he went immediately to make his viſit, without any cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony: when he found ſhe was abroad, he fell to worn ſeriouſly with her father; he told him, that the laſt time he was there, he had indeed promiſed to wait on her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, notwithſtanding what had paſſed. Her father told him, he had received an account how his daughter had us'd him; that he was in the country when it happened, otherwiſe he ſhould have concerned himſelf to have ſecur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him better treatment; that he had reſented it ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready to his daughter, that he had ſcarce been in ſpeaking terms with her ſince; that, as to his promiſe of coming again, he believed ſhe was convinced that ſhe had no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to expect it, ſeeing no gentleman would care to be ill uſed twice upon the ſame occaſion. The young gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man anſwered, that he was very ſorry he ſhould reſent any thing from his daughter on his account; that he was
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:025384_0135_0FCD10C4E3C3CAD0"/>
ſurprized to hear him ſay, ſhe had ill us'd him; that, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his word, ſhe had not ſaid or done the leaſt unbecom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thing to him; that he was even then, when ſhe did it, fully convinced of the reaſonableneſs of what ſhe had ſaid, and ten times as much, if that were poſſible; and alſo of the juſt motives ſhe had to ſay it to him: that if ſhe had done leſs, ſhe would have acted from meaner prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples than he knew ſhe was miſtreſs of; and that her reaſons were ſo good, and ſhe ſo well maintained them, that he had neither then, nor now, the leaſt thing to offer againſt them; and that his buſineſs was not now to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer her arguments, but to ſee if he could comply better with the juſt demands that ſhe then made, than he could before.</p>
                     <p>The father anſwered with a great many compliments and excuſes, and ſuch like diſcourſes; but the gentleman found that he neither reliſhed the reaſon of his daughter's refuſal, or was affected at all with all he could ſay to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince him how he had taken it; and modeſty forbidding him to go farther in any declaration about religious mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, eſpecially where he found there was no taſte of it, he declined ſaying any more about it; but he turn'd his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to deſiring another interview with his daughter upon the terms of former propoſals; which the father con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ing to, they went together in the young gentleman's chariot to Hampſtead, where the young ladies were; and this was the gentleman, who, as I obſerved, was come to the door with their father, juſt as they were about talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him with their aunt.</p>
                     <p>I had given an account before, that they heard a coach ſtop at the gate, and that a ſervant brought up word, that their father and another gentleman was below ſtairs; but they were ſurpriſed, you may be ſure, when the eldeſt ſiſter going down firſt, comes running up ſtairs again, with the news, in ſhort, that it was Mr.—, and that their father had brought him.</p>
                     <p>The aunt, unwilling her niece ſhould appear in any diſorder, ſays to her, Come, child, you two ſhall ſtay a little, and let me go down firſt; which the younger ſiſter was very glad of. It was eaſy to perceive, and the paſſages already related will allow us to ſuppoſe, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:025384_0136_0FCD10C9617AC148"/>
it was ſome ſurpriſe to the young lady to have him come thus ſuddenly and abruptly upon her, having not prepared her thoughts, or reſolved upon what reception to give him, and not having the leaſt intimation from her father upon what account he came, yet that ſhe was not alarmed as ſhe uſed to be; the ſcruples of her conſcience were all anſwered; her jealouſies of his hypocriſy were over, and her affection had little or nothing to ſtruggle with now, unleſs ſhe might doubt his reſentment of things paſt, and whether he came upon the old account, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to perform his promiſe, and make a viſit of ceremony only; however, ſhe begg'd her ſiſter to ſpeak to her aunt, that they might ſtay at her houſe, and that ſhe might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his viſits there, becauſe then ſhe would have her aunt to adviſe and conſult with, on every occaſion, and then ſhe would put off their being left together that night, that ſhe might conſider things a little, and know the better how to receive him.</p>
                     <p>Her ſiſter went down, and ſending for her aunt into another room, propoſed the firſt to her; let me alone, niece, for that, ſays ſhe. So the other went up to her ſiſter, and ſoon after the father calling for his two daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, they went down into the room. It was eaſy for her, at firſt ſight, to perceive, that her lover was not at all altered in his affection to her; that he did not come to her with reſentment, or with ceremony; for he flew to her, took her in his arms, and told her, he came to ſee if ſhe had goodneſs enough to pardon his not keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his word with her, in coming to wait on her again, and alſo to claim her promiſe of ſtaying for him. He ſpoke this ſo ſoftly, as not to be heard by the company, and without expecting any anſwer, turned about to pay his reſpects to her aunt; in doing which, he told her, he hoped ſhe would give him leave to wait upon her niece at her houſe.</p>
                     <p>The aunt took the hint, and turning to the father, Brother, ſays ſhe to him privately, I think if you would let my niece ſtay here for ſome time, and let the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man come to wait on her here, I would take care to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent ſuch little ſcruples as you know interrupted that affair before, and you will ſhe ſooner bring it to an end
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:025384_0137_0FCD10CA6AEEFF50"/>
according to your mind. With all my heart, ſays the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; if we had done ſo before, I believe ſhe had not play'd the fool as ſhe did.</p>
                     <p>Upon this, turning themſelves to the company, ſhe ſays aloud, Niece, I don't intend to loſe your company thus; I ſuppoſe, if this gentleman deſigns to viſit you, he won't think it a great way to come to Hampſtead, which, now the roads are ſo good, is not above an hour's driving; and, I hope, we ſhall not make his entertainment ſo ill, as to make him weary of his coming hither. Her niece ſaid, that muſt be as her father pleaſed to direct; I know that, ſaid her aunt; and therefore I have got your father's conſent already. They bowed both to her in token of aſſent, and night coming on, her father talk'd of going away; ſo he told her, he would take another opportunity to wait on her, which was what ſhe had deſired. And thus ended their firſt meeting.</p>
                     <p>They had ſcarce dined the next day, but, as he had ſaid, he came to viſit her, and they had the whole after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon to themſelves; and, from that day, they began to underſtand one another ſo well, that, in a few weeks, matters began to draw to a cloſe. But, becauſe ſome part of their diſcourſe is neceſſary to finiſh the former ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and may be as uſeful as it is entertaining, I ſhall firſt give ſome of the particulars, as they occurred in diſcourſe between her and her aunt and ſiſter, upon this occaſion.</p>
                     <p>As ſhe had adviſed with her ſiſter and aunt upon every particular, and eſpecially with her ſiſter, from the firſt of it; ſo ſhe made no ſcruple to give them a full account of things as they paſſed. It was one morning, after the gentleman had been above a week in his new addreſſes, that, coming into her aunt's dreſſing-room, ſhe found her ſiſter there drinking coffee with her aunt; and her ſiſter began with her thus:</p>

After ſome compliments, he repeated what he had ſaid before, that he came to aſk my pardon for not coming again: I told him, I did not expect him to come again, and, if I was to believe the opinion of other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, I had uſed him ſo rudely, that it was not reaſonable to think, that any gentleman that was ſo treated, would ever have come again, unleſs it was to affront me. He wondered, he ſaid, who could pretend to ſay ſo; for he aſſured me, he not only never ſaid I uſed him ill, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thought ſo, and certainly I would not ſay ſo to any body; for he was perſuaded, he ſaid, that I did neither do it on purpoſe to uſe him ill, or believe it was ill uſage. I told him he did me a deal of juſtice to ſay, I did not act on purpoſe to affront him; but that I could not but ſay, I thought I had uſed him a little rudely, for all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

hour from he before he was convinced of the juſtice of all I had ſaid, and how much reaſon I had to refuſe him, upon the nicety which I had refuſed him upon. He ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that he had a thouſand times ſince reproached him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with the folly of his own conduct at that time, or that he could think it would recommend him to any wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of virtue and ſenſe, to boaſt of having no thought or ſenſe of religion: for, Madam, ſays he, had you taken no notice of it, I ſhould of neceſſity have concluded in a quarter of an hour after, that you had no ſenſe of virtue or religion yourſelf. Why, what if I had not? ſaid I; I had been but the more ſuitable to you, and you muſt have liked me the better for that. He returned, no, Madam, juſt the contrary; for, though I own I had not thought of religion myſelf, yet if any woman had told me ſo of herſelf, I ſhould preſently have ſaid, ſhe was no match for a gentleman; for no man can be ſo void of ſenſe, as well as of religion, as not to know, that a woman of no reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is no woman fit to make a wife of: and this, ſays he, convinced me, that you were in the right to refuſe me on that account.</p>

                     <p>It was a very ingenuous acknowledgement, I confeſs; the truth of it is ſo convincing, that I wiſh all the young woman, who have their ſettlements in view, would reflect ſeriouſly on this point, That, however wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men are, they are always willing to have ſober, reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, and virtuous wives; and 'tis very rarely, that the worſt rake in nature, if his ſenſes are in exerciſe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to have a wife looſe like himſelf;—but pray go on, niece.</p>

                     <p>He told me, he was not gone a quarter of an hour from me, but this reflection ſtruck with horror upon his mind: what a dreadful creature am I? Sure I am a horrid, frightful wretch! that a woman of ſobriety and religion was afraid to venture to take me, for fear of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ruined; and that ſhe ſhould think ſhe declared war againſt Heaven, and joined herſelf to one of God's ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies! He was going on, but I found his ſpeech ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped of a ſudden; at which I was a little ſurprized, and aſked him, if he was not well? He ſaid, Yes; and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to hide the little diſorder he was in, and went
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:025384_0141_0FCD10D4D87C7A78"/>
on. He then told me, that I had been really very juſt to him, and he had reaſon to thank me for it; and that he had deſired my ſiſter to expreſs his mind fully on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; which he hoped ſhe had done. I told him, I could not now enter upon an apology for what I had ſaid to him ſo long ago; that, if I had treated him rudely, or ſeverely, I was very ſorry; but that what I did was occaſioned, as he knew very well, by his making ſuch open declarations, and ſuch as I thought he really had no occaſion for, concerning his averſion to, and ignorance of all religion; and that it was really a dreadful thing to think of marrying upon ſuch terms. He replied, that if I had ſaid leſs than I did, he muſt neceſſarily, when he came to his ſenſes, have had a meaner opinion of me than he had; and that it was really the reproaches that I had given him, and the excellent reaſons I had given him for my reſolutions of rejecting him, that had now brought him back to me, and had made him reſolve to have no woman upon earth but me, if I would but revoke the reſolution I had taken againſt him; for nothing leſs, than ſo much religion and virtue, could ever make him happy.</p>

He confeſs'd that was very true; unleſs he could convince me the cauſe was removed; which he ſaw no hopes of: and that was the reaſon that he came to viſit me again, with ſo little encouragement, that he knew not what to think of it.</p>

                     <p>When he came again the next night, he made a kind of an apology for having left me in more diſorder than he us'd to do: For, to tell you true, Madam, ſays he, I was not able to go on with what I was ſaying to you, neither am I now, ſays he, ſeeing I am come to wait on you, and yet have effectually ſhut the door againſt my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. I told him, I did not perhaps rightly underſtand him, unleſs he would explain himſelf: why, ſays he, I have firſt told you ſincerely, how abſolutely I approve of the reſolution you took againſt me, and yet own'd and do ſtill, that I am no way able to convince you that the cauſe is removed. I told him, that I thought he was not juſt to himſelf; and that the ſame thing whatever it was, that had power to convince him that I was under a neceſſity to refuſe him on that occaſion, would certainly aſſiſt him to remove the cauſe. He turn'd ſhort upon me. But, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, ſays he, did not I make conditions with you, that whenever I talk'd of it, you ſhould take me for a hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite? and did I not declare poſitively to you, that I would deceive you, if I could.</p>

He told me, it proceeded from the juſt reflection he made on his fooliſh diſcourſe two years ago, viz. that he wiſh'd he had counterfeited religious diſcourſe, and he would certainly have cheated me if he could, and did not doubt but he could have done it effectually. Thoſe words, he ſaid, flew in his face, when he went to ſay any thing ſerious to me, and perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him that I would believe he was only counterfeiting ſerious things on purpoſe to deceive me. I anſwered, he might reproach himſelf with thoſe things, but I did not ſay any ſtreſs on them; for I believed he had too much honeſty, whether it proceeded from religion or no, to offer to deceive me in a thing, in which he own'd ſo ingenuouſly I was right.

or any man, in ſuch a caſe. He told me, he thought it required more aſſurance than he was maſter of, to talk any thing of himſelf that way, at leaſt till there were more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timacy between us; that he thought religious things (talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of in that manner) received an injury from the very diſcourſe; and that it was next door to boaſting of them, which was the worſt kind of hypocriſy; and if he could ſay no more of himſelf but this, he hoped I would take it for a ſufficient teſtimony of the alteration of his thoughts, viz. that he loved me for the honour I paid to religion, and for that ſteadineſs which had made me refuſe him before. I told him, I ſaw his difficulty, and that I would abate him of the trouble of entering into particulars, which I found he was too modeſt to relate, and which however I was not quite a ſtranger to; and that I deſired we might ſpeak no more of a thing which I knew it was difficult for him to be free in. He bluſhed as red as fire, when I ſaid I was not a ſtranger to the particulars, which he declined to expreſs, and ſaid not one word for a good while. I told him, I knew it was a point that could not come eaſily from a man's own mouth; that I did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it, and would make him eaſy, ſo far as to tell him, I was fully ſatisfied he was no hypocrite, and hoped he would give himſelf no more trouble about it. He took me in his arms, and told me very affectionately, that I had ſaid that of him, that he would give all the world to be able to ſay of himſelf; that however, he hoped to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden to me for more than that; and as I had given him the firſt view of the beauty of a religious life, he expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a great deal more from my aſſiſtance and example in purſuing the ſteps of it. I told him, that I begged of him, we might avoid all religious compliments, for they were the oddeſt things in nature; that he quite miſtook me; that it was not becauſe I thought myſelf capable of guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in religious matters, that I inſiſted on the neceſſity of not marrying a man void of religion, but from a due ſenſe of juſt the contrary, viz. the want I ſhould be in of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing guided and aſſiſted in religious things upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions myſelf; that it would be a fatal miſtake the other way, and greatly to my diſadvantage, to have him expect more from me than he would find; and that, on the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <head>PART II.</head>
               <p>WE have ſeen the happy conduct of the youngeſt of the three daughters of the gentleman, whoſe family this book began with, and the comfortable ſucceſs of it. The ſecond daughter, from the beginning, acted upon other principles, or rather, indeed, upon no princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples at all; yet her hiſtory may, perhaps, be no leſs fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of inſtruction than the other, though ſomething more tragical, as to her own part of it.</p>
               <p>She had declared to her ſiſter, as appears in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of her ſtory, that ſhe would not trouble herſelf, when it came to her turn, what religion the gentleman was of, or whether he had any religion or no, if ſhe had but a good ſettlement; and now we ſhall ſee her be as good as her word.</p>
               <p>Her father, whoſe character I have ſufficiently ſpoken to already, having had, for many years, a conſiderable trade into Italy, where he once lived, there came an Engliſh gentleman to viſit him, who had been formerly contemporary with him, and long been his correſpondent, or factor, there, viz. at Leghorn; and who, being grown very rich, was come to England, reſolving to ſettle here. There were ſome accompts, it ſeems depending between them, which they had appointed a day to ſettle and balance, in order to exchange releaſes; which being all finiſhed in the morning, the father of theſe ladies takes his factor into his coach, and carries him home to dinner with him, where the old gentleman entertained him very handſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and where he had an opportunity to ſee the two maiden daughters; for the youngeſt, who had been married ſome time, was gone into Hampſhire to her country-ſeat with her huſband.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="149" facs="unknown:025384_0148_0FCD10E16C53C740"/>
This Leghorn merchant no ſooner ſaw and converſed a little with the ladies, but he took a fancy to the youngeſt, and from that time reſolved to make her his wife. It was not long before he let them know his mind; and, having made very handſome propoſals to her father, he [the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther] received him with a frankneſs ſuitable to their long intimacy and acquaintance, and told him, With all his heart, if his daughter and he could agree.</p>
               <p>Before I bring them together, it is proper to the reliſh of the ſtory, to take a little notice of the characters of the two young perſons, of whoſe ſtory we ought to have a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral idea, that we may not be left to gather it up ſlowly among the particulars.</p>
               <p>The young lady was very ſober, virtuous to the niceſt degree, extremely well bred, and wonderfully good hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured. She was likewiſe a very lovely, beautiful per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the handſomeſt of the three ſiſters beyond all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon. As to religion, ſhe had a very good foundation of knowledge, and had done nothing to make it be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed ſhe was not truly religious in practice; but ſhe was not altogether ſo grave and ſerious as her eldeſt ſiſter, much leſs was ſhe ſo ſtrict and devout as her younger ſiſter that was married, as might be obſerved from what paſſed between them at firſt: her temper was ſprightly and gay; and, though ſhe governed herſelf ſo, that ſhe gave every one room to ſee, that ſhe was one that had a true ſenſe of religion at bottom, and a fund of good prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and notions in her mind; yet ſhe was young and merry, and did not tie herſelf up ſo ſeverely in ſuch things as her ſiſters had done; which, though it was no part of her happineſs in the affair before her, yet it rendered her very agreeable to her father; and particularly, it made the affair with this gentleman much leſs trouble with her, than he had with her two ſiſters.</p>
               <p>The gentleman was, as I have obſerved, an Italian gentleman, a very handſome, agreeable perſon, perfectly well bred, having lived abroad, and ſeen a great deal of the world. He was alſo a man of excellent parts and ſenſe, talked admirably well, almoſt to every thing that came in his way, ſpoke ſeveral languages, and in ſhort, was not only a complete, well-bred merchant, but much
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:025384_0149_0FCD10E2EF6F43C8"/>
of a gentleman; and all this to be added, that he was very ſober, grave, and often times, as occaſion offered, his diſcourſe upon religious affairs diſcovered him to be very ſerious and religious. As to his eſtate, it was not very well only, but extraordinary; he was indeed a little too old, having lived abroad twenty-two years, and was about ſo much above twenty, which was the age of the lady. However, as this was an advantage in many other ways, as in his judgment and experience in the world, the father made no ſcruple at all of it, nor did his daughter inquire much after it.</p>
               <p>In a word, having been introduced to the young lady, ſhe muſt have been a woman of much more nicety and ſcruple, than ſhe profeſſed herſelf to be, if ſhe had diſliked any thing in his perſon or circumſtances; and therefore having kept her company for ſome weeks, things began to draw near a cloſe, when one evening, after the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man had been with her, and gone away, her eldeſt ſiſter and ſhe happened to meet; and the following dialogue between them may farther explain the caſe.</p>

                     <p>Well, but ſuppoſe it to be but as advice, yet it has a double force with it. Firſt, as it came from a tender, dear, and moſt affectionate mother, who not only moſt paſſionately loved us, but had an excellent judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to direct her to give us the beſt counſel. And, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, as our own judgment and conſciences muſt teſtify with her, that what ſhe enjoined us to obſerve, is the moſt reaſonable thing for us to do; that can be imagined for our own advantage, and as well for our happineſs here as hereafter.</p>

Our mother warned us againſt marrying men of no religion, that is, men that made no profeſſion of a reverence to God and his worſhip, this want of a religious profeſſion, is the circumſtance which I ſpeak of; if the circumſtance does not appear, the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice ceaſes; for our mother knew we could not judge of ſincerity.</p>

                     <p>I don't know that neither; you and I know ſome families, more than one or two, where they are all at daggers draw about opinion, and the families are ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as to their peace; and yet both are very religious too, nay zealous in their way; and the more the zeal, the more the ſtrife.</p>

                     <p>Well, but becauſe charity does not always keep pace with religion, and every one is apt to think themſelves in the right, and to reproach the ſincerity of thoſe that differ from them; therefore, our mother ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly preſſed us to make that point ſure, before we fixed our choice for our lives.</p>

                     <p>No, ſiſter, I am not willing to be deceived, you ſee; I have had a general diſcovery of his being a man religiouſly inclined, that he has a reverence for the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, and the being of God; nay, you cannot but remember, how the other night at ſupper he diſcourſed very gravely; and I aſſure you, to me it was very agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, about the men of the town, pretending to be Atheiſts, and to deny the being of a God, and the next minute pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanely ſwearing by his name.</p>

                     <speaker>Siſt.</speaker>

                     <p>You argue, ſiſter, from the practice to the duty, as if becauſe children do not regard the care and concern of their parents in their marriage, therefore they ought to do ſo: and it was not the duty of parents to direct them, or concern themſelves about it.</p>

                     <p>I think, take one time with another, children do as well, when they truſt to their own directions, I mean when they chuſe with judgment; pray what would become of us if we were juſt to follow our father's direction? you know, he would direct us to take the firſt that comes, if he liked but the ſettlement.</p>

                     <p>But it is a matter of ſuch weight, and ſo irrecoverable when done that we ought to ſee with as many eyes as we can; and a careful, religious parent is a good ſcout to look out for us, a good pilot to ſteer us, and a good counſellor to adviſe us.</p>

                     <p>Do! I would enter into a ſerious diſcourſe of religious matters with him; I would know how we were to live together, whether as Heathens, or as Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ians; I would find out his principles, if he has any, or find out that he has none; this is not catchiſing him, nor is there any thing indecent in it. You are not aſhamed to enquire into his eſtate, and make proviſion for yourſelf out of it by a good jointure; and will you be aſhamed to inquire after that, which is of ten thouſand times the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence! ſure, you can never go on hood winked at all hazards thus in that part that is for the happineſs of your life, ſoul and body; beſides, had not you your ſiſter's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample before you.</p>

                     <p>Why, I tell you, it is clear to me, that he is a man that has a ſenſe of religion upon his mind; I gave you an inſtance of it in his deteſtation of Sir Robert and his practices; if my ſiſter could have had but ſo much ſatisfaction as that, ſhe never would have refuſed my brother.—</p>

                     <p>You wrong my ſiſter, I aſſure you; ſhe did not come ſo far indeed: becauſe ſhe came to a clear diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery that he had no religion at all, which was the firſt point; but I can aſſure you, if ſhe had got over that point, ſhe would have inquired farther; for, 'tis a poor ſatisfaction that is founded upon negative religion only.</p>

                     <p>If we expect to ſearch into poſitives, as the world goes now, I think we put a hardſhip upon ourſelves that we are not obliged to.</p>

                     <speaker>Eld. ſiſt.</speaker>
                     <p>But certainly it is our buſineſs to do it, if we expect to live happily; for there are a great many men now a-days that are not Atheiſts, and that abhor bantering of religion, or making a jeſt of ſacred things; and yet have nothing at all in them that is fit to be called religion.</p>

                     <p>Yes, yes; but I allude only to it and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve how leſs anxious you are, how much eaſier ſatisfied, how ſooner ſecure, about the main article that conſtitutes the happineſs of your life, and of your family, if ever you have one, than about your eſtate.</p>

                     <p>You run this matter up to a ſtrange height, ſiſter, as if all my felicity conſiſted in this one queſtion, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther my huſband be a religious man or no? nay, as if it conſiſted in his being of the ſame opinion in religion as I am of; as if I could not be religious, though my huſband was not ſo; nor in a word, as I could not go to heaven without my huſband.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Eld. ſiſt.</speaker>
                     <p>No, ſiſter; it is you that run it too high; I do not ſay you cannot go to heaven without your huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band: or you cannot be religious without your huſband; but I do ſay you cannot go comfortably through the journey thither without him, nor he without you. A woman is to be a help-meet, and a man is to be the ſame; now a huſband will be a ſorry help to a wife, if he is not a help in the religious part of her life: and a ſorry help indeed in the religious part, if he has no ſenſe of it himſelf.</p>

                     <p>Well, but it will hold in the other part of the queſtion too: ſuppoſe he has, yet, if his ſenſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is not the ſame with, or agreeable to your ſenſe of it; if he thinks you are going the wrong way, and you think he is going the wrong way, one pulls this way, and the other pulls that way in religion; what will this come to in the family, ſiſter? have you conſider'd that?</p>

                     <p>I have conſidered it ſo far as to ſee that I can do nothing in it any farther; I cannot enter into a debate about principles; tell him what my opinion is, and aſk him what his opinion is, and try before-hand whether they agree or no: I tell you, I don't think 'tis my buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, any more than the talking to him of our ſettlement: that's the father's part to do; ſure my father won't bring a Heathen to me!</p>

                     <p>It is true, and that is our miſery, that, as I ſaid before, we have not a father to concern himſelf in that part for us; but I do not think it is ſuch an impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per thing for you to do. Sure I could ſome way or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bring it in, that I would make ſome gueſs at him: why, you have never offered it in the leaſt; neither has he ſhewn you any thing of it; I do not ſo much as find that he has ever gone to church with us, ſince he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared ſo publicly.</p>

                     <p>Well, and would not I have laughed at him at night, and aſk'd him if ever he us'd to go to church, or whether he went to church that Sunday, or no?</p>

                     <speaker>Eld. ſiſt.</speaker>
                     <p>So that you think he ought rather to deny his religion, and diſown all his principles, than venture your diſpleaſure?</p>

                     <p>I ſhould think he was very indifferent, whether I was diſpleaſed or no, or that he preſumed on my being ſo engaged to him, that I could not go off; either of which I ſhould take for an inſufferable inſolence.</p>

                     <p>Why, I told you, he ſaid in particular, that he was of the church of England, as by law eſtabliſh'd.</p>

                     <speaker>Eld. ſiſt.</speaker>
                     <p>Why firſt, dear ſiſter, I told you that's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what any Papiſt may ſay, even without a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation; but however it ſeems he did not that, but in way of diſcourſe to other people; he did not ſay ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly, in anſwer to any inquiry of yours, or to give you ſatisfaction.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Siſt.</speaker>
                     <p>No, that's true; I have not deſired any ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him; for I take thoſe caſual, occaſional diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of himſelf to have more of nature in them, and to be leſs liable to ſuſpicion, than a formal, ſtudied anſwer to a jealous or doubting queſtion; and I have many rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for my opinion too.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Eld. ſiſt.</speaker>
                     <p>Why that may be true; but I cannot think that ſuch occaſional, curſory ſpeeches can have ſolid foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation enough to ſatisfy you in a thing of ſuch moment; and I think I have the teſtimony of the fathers of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation on my ſide, who, without doubt, ſaw it in the great weight that lies on this part, viz. of the advantage and neceſſity that there is, that huſband and wife ſhould be of the ſame opinion in religion one with auother: when they appointed, with the office of matrimony, that the communion be given to the married couple at every wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; that it might appear, not only that they both made a profeſſion of the Chriſtian religion, but that they both agreed in the profeſſion of the ſame principles, and joined together in the ſame communion with the reformed Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant churches, and with one another. And I think this is enough to convince you of the juſtice of our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's injunctions, that we ſhould not marry any man, how religious ſoever he was, unleſs he was of the ſame o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion in religion with ourſelves; or, as I obſerved above, that, as was the cuſtom, the man and the wife might communicate together.</p>

                     <p>I take that to be done principally to prevent Proteſtants marrying with Papiſts; and to diſcover the

fraud, if there was any; you ſee the practice is left off now.</p>

                     <p>I know it is left off, ſince other and leſſer differences among Proteſtants have made mutual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion more difficult; but I think the reaſon of the thing remains, viz. that every couple ſhould know what communion they are of, and ſhould be always, if poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſincere and without conſtraint of the ſame com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with one another.</p>

                     <p>That is then becauſe religion itſelf is leſs in faſhion than it us'd to be, which indeed is too true; alſo marriages are now wholly taken up with mirth and gay things; but in thoſe days matrimony ſeems to have been underſtood, as it really is in itſelf, a ſolemn and ſerious thing: not to be ventur'd on raſhly, conſider'd ſlightly, or perform'd with levity and looſeneſs; 'tis a tranſaction of the greateſt weight, attended with circumſtances of the greateſt importance, and conſequences of the utmoſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern to our welfare or miſery; the happineſs of life, the proſperity of families, and indeed the intereſt of the ſoul, is exceedingly dependent on the good or bad conduct of both parties in this affair: and to run headlong upon it, is rightly compared to a horſe ruſhing into the battle, and argues a miſerable thoughtleſſneſs of what is before us.</p>

                     <p>No, not a word, he knows better; he knows I would give him but a ſhort anſwer, if he would aſk me any thing about my religion: what, do you think I'll be catechis'd already? no, no; it is not come to that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

                     <p>This is one of the ſtrongeſt grounds of ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion to me, and aſſures me that he has very little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to religion in general, that he can pretend to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry you, and know nothing whether you are a Heathen or a Chriſtian, an Atheiſt or a religious perſon, a Papiſt or a Proteſtant; the man can have no great value for reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, that it is ſo little concerned whether his wife have any, or no; for I take the thing to weigh as much on the one ſide as on the other, where there is any ſerious conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration at bottom.</p>

<pb n="167" facs="unknown:025384_0166_0FCD110C264CD328"/>
and nature of religion, how it conſiſted chiefly in natural duties, the effects of the knowledge and acknowledgement of God governing the world, to whom we owed the hom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of our lives, and all we enjoyed, and muſt account for the uſe or abuſe of them: then, he obſerved how pleaſant and agreeable a religious life was, how it was religion alone that made life happy, families pleaſant, ſociety a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable, and relations comfortable; how miſerably ſome families were brought up for the want of it; how beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful it was to ſee an unity between relations in matters of that nature, and how dreadful the ſtrife was in families where it was otherwiſe.</p>

                     <p>She ſat by him, and he held her by the hand all the while: he went on then to tell us a great many pleaſant ſtories of families that he had known; how in ſome the huſband was religious, and the wife Atheiſtic and profane; and in others, the wife was religious, and the huſband rakiſh, looſe and profligate, and how miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able the one made the life of the other. Then he gave himſelf a looſe to talk for the conſtant, never fading feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of families where was a harmony in religious things between huſband and wife; and then, to try her, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, or perhaps to prevent her thinking he pointed his diſcourſe at her, he turned to her, and ſmiling, My dear, ſays he, if there be any defect, on that account, between you and me, it will be on my ſide; but I hope to be help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forward by you.</p>

                     <p>No, no, ſhe took it otherwiſe, I aſſure you, for he might eaſily ſee ſhe was not pleaſed. However, he went on, and told us a long ſtory of a couple that were married, and were both very religious, and yet, ſaid he, they never had any happineſs, any agreement, or any practical religion in the family; this put me upon inquiry into the circumſtances of it. Why, Madam, ſays he, one was of one opinion in religion, and one was of another, both of them were tenacious of their own opinion, and cenſorious of the other. One went to one place of worſhip, and another to another: one prayed to
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:025384_0167_0FCD110DABEA5EE0"/>
God in one part of the houſe, and one in another. Why, ſays I, they prayed to the ſame God I hope; ſure charity might have taught them to have prayed together! ſo far from that, Madam, ſays he, that they not only never prayed with one another, but I believe they ſcarce ever prayed for one another in their lives, but looked upon one another as Heathens and Publicans, and ſuch as God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf would not hear.</p>
                     <p>This was a ſad family, Sir, ſaid I; but I hope there are very few ſuch in this nation, where religion is ſo heartily eſpouſed. Truly, Madam, ſays he, it may teach us what occaſion there is for us to ſeek out for reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious wives, and to take care to be agreeable huſbands to them, when we have them. And here he ſaid a great many handſome things indeed of the little concern men generally took upon themſelves, either to marry religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous wives, or to ſee that the opinions of thoſe they mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried were not too much ſhocking with their own; and eſpecially that when men had religious wives, or women had religious huſbands they did not ſtudy, as much as lay in them, both ſides, to bring their opinions to agree <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

frequent occaſions, in ſerious diſcourſe with her, to hear her ſpeak her mind freely to me, in this very caſe, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, I will give you one example of it, viz.

burſt out into tears; he was extremely anxious to know what ailed her, but ſhe could not ſpeak; ſhe was unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to grieve him, and unwilling to ſay any thing that was unkind; he preſſed her a long time, and ſaid a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand tender kind things, that I hardly expected from him; but that made her cry the more. At laſt, I ſaid to him, ſmiling, I know what troubles her, but you won't relieve her. Won't I, ſays he, a little moved, Why doſt thou ſay ſo? I would let out my blood to do her any good; and ſhe knows I will ſtick at nothing to do for her. Why, ſays I, you won't ſerve God with her. Won't I, ſays he, yes, I would with all my heart, if ſhe would let me. This I found laid a foundation for ſome diſpute about their principles; but ſhe wiſely avoided that, and I perceived it, ſo I put it off, I dare ſay, ſays I, ſhe would give all ſhe has in the world, you would but go to church with her now. At that ſhe burſt out, though full of tears, Ay, ſays ſhe, I would give him back my jointure with all my heart. He took her in his arms, and with all the tendereſt and kindeſt expreſſions that he was capable of, endeavoured to pacify her, and put an end to it, a thing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Her huſband is as religious too in his way as ſhe is in hers: but, as there is no harmony or concurrence in their ſeveral prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and ways of worſhip, ſo there can be no public, ſtated family worſhip. He does not join with her, nor ſhe cannot join with him; ſo all the thing called family religion, the glory of a married ſtate, and the comfort of family ſociety is entirely loſt: the ſervants are left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>governed, the children are unguided; and there again is her grief doubled, ſhe has four little young children. It is true, he is a man of too good a humour to deny or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain her in the education of her children; has it is a ſad thing to her to be obliged to inſtruct and caution her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren againſt the practice of their father, whoſe life <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Yes, truly in ſome meaſure, ſiſter, you do, and your own words acknowledged it juſt now. Did not you ſay, that if he would not be of your opinion, you would be of his? And is it not often that we ſee young women change their opinions, nay, change the very prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of their religion, in compliance with their huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands?</p>

<pb n="175" facs="unknown:025384_0174_0FCD111D6966DC98"/>
they do well to change them, to be ſure; but is it not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tener that they rather abandon principle than exchange it; loſe their religion than increaſe it? for you cannot ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt, that all the women who have changed their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, in compliance with their huſbands, were wrong before, and have changed for the better.</p>

                     <p>But it is a ſad exchange, if it be wrong; for the woman then exchanges the peace of her conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence for peace with her huſband; loſes her religion, and gives up her principles, inſtead of exchanging them for better.</p>

                     <p>I won't enter into that; I'll allow them to be Chriſtians too; but take it of him as well as of her; ſuppoſe him to change then, and come over to her, then it would be the ſame with him; which is all one to the caſe in hand. Pray where is the felicity of ſuch a match, where one or other is ſuppoſed to act without conſcience, or againſt conſcience, all their days for conjugal peace, and to ſacrifice principle to affection? are not theſe ſtill invincible arguments for what I am perſuading to?</p>

                     <p>Yes you do, ſiſter, very well; however I'll repeat it as often as you ſay ſo: I am arguing the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute neceſſity of young people comparing their religious principles and opinions before marriage; and ſeeing that they agree, at leaſt ſo far as to lay no foundation of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious breach in the family after marriage; that they
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:025384_0175_0FCD111EE1FA8068"/>
may worſhip God together; join in family precepts, and ſupport family religion; that they may agree in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions to their children, join in family precepts and examples; that there may be no diſputings or dividings againſt one another, but a mutual harmony in the propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating their own eternal intereſts, and that they may go hand in hand in the true way to heaven.</p>

                     <speaker>Siſt.</speaker>
                     <p>And cannot this happen to them without ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of circumſtances before hand, that we muſt capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late about religion as we do about jointures, and ſettle principles as we do fortunes, always before hand.</p>

                     <p>That it may not or cannot happen ſo, I will not ſay: but if you will take the world at large, as it is now ſtated, between thoſe that have no religion at all, and thoſe who differ from others, you muſt allow, ſiſter, it is a lottery of a thouſand blanks to one prize; and who that values their own peace, would venture the odds?</p>

                  <p>It was but a few days after the diſcourſe which ſhe had held with her ſiſter, that her father and ſhe had the following dialogue one evening, after the gentleman who courted her was gone away; her father being in a parlour all alone, called her to him, and began with her thus:</p>

And thus they were married in a few weeks after, and abundance of mirth and jollity they had; which covered all the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of other things for a great while.</p>
                     <p>At length, the lady went home to her houſe in the city, which was magnificently furniſhed. Among other rich furniture, the rooms were exceedingly ſtored with a noble collection of very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

It hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened after ſhe had been ſome time at home, had ſettled her houſe, and finiſhed the decorations of her rooms, that her huſband bringing ſome pictures home, which were newly arrived from Italy, had, among others, three very choice pieces <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> to have hanged up by the bed-ſide.</p>
                     <p>His wife, not uſed to ſuch things, perfectly ignorant of the deſign, not at all acquainted with the uſe made of them in Popiſh countries, took no manner of notice of it at firſt, taking it to be only brought in there, as it was a moſt noble piece of painting; and that her huſband thought it was the beſt thing he could grace her chamber with. It happened, her two ſiſters came together ſome time after, as is uſual, to ſee her houſe, and to ſee the fine collection of paintings, which they had been told ſo much of. And after ſome time, their ſiſter and their new bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther led them through all the apartments, which were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed extremely fine. The brother-in-law, as what he took great delight in, made it his buſineſs to tell them the deſign of the ſeveral pictures, what places or fine houſes ſuch and ſuch repreſented, what ſtories and what faces others were drawn for; and the like: And, being his wife's ſiſters, he treated them with all the freedom and kindneſs imaginable.</p>
                     <p>When they came to the crucifixion which hung by the bed-ſide, he told them, there was one of the fineſt pieces of painting in England; told them the name of the painter

that had drawn it, who, he ſaid, was one of the beſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters in Italy; and I'll aſſure you, ſiſter, ſays he, this is counted a fine thing in Italy.</p>
                     <p>But why muſt it hang in your bed-chamber, brother? ſays the other married ſiſter, not ſuſpecting any thing; for her eldeſt ſiſter had not told her any thing of what ſhe had ſaid to her ſiſter. O Madam, ſays he, they always have theſe things in their bed-chambers in Italy on a religious account. Well, ſays the ſiſter, but as we do not make uſe of them that way, methinks they are better any where elſe. Why ſiſter, ſays he, our bed-chambers are places where we are, or ought to be moſt ſerious. Why, ſays ſhe again, but we that are Proteſtants do not make a religious uſe of them. Not ſo much per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, ſays he, as the Romans do; but I cannot ſay but they may be uſeful to aſſiſt devotion. Not at all, ſays the ſiſter. At leaſt, Madam, ſays he, they can be no diſadvantage to us; we want all poſſible helps in our ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. We have the promiſe of the Spirit of God to aſſiſt us, ſays the ſiſter, very warmly, and need no idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous pictures. He ſaw ſhe was tart, and ſeemed to he forward to diſpute, which he avoided; ſo he called them to look on another picture, and that paſſed off the diſcourſe.</p>
                     <p>After they had gone through ſeveral apartments, and had admired the fine paintings, as indeed they well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, they came to his cloſet. He would have avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed going in, and told them it was in confuſion, and not worth their ſeeing; but his wife having told them it was her huſband's cloſet, they would not be denied. When they went in, they were ſurprized with the moſt charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pictures that their eyes had ever beheld, with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of rarities, which their new brother, being very curious, had picked up in his travels; and, in a little room, on one ſide of his cloſet, upon a table covered with car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     <p>They paſſed from this place to the other ſide of the clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, where were abundance of very fine pieces; but here the elder could not forbear obſerving, that all the pictures on that whole ſide of the room were religious pieces, and, though ſtill without much ſuſpicion, ſhe ſaid to him, I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve brother, you gentlemen that have lived in Italy, are ſo in love with popiſh cuſtoms, that you are always full of theſe church paintings; here's nothing but repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Chriſt and the Virgin Mary, in one ſhape or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in every room in your houſe. She went on jeſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for ſome time till ſhe came to the upper end of the room, to a picture which hung juſt over an eaſy chair, and which had a curtain drawn over it: he thought ſhe would not have let her curioſity outrun her good manners, and ſo did not apprehend her opening it; but ſhe made no ſcruple of offering to fling back the curtain; but ſoon found it would not run back, being, as ſhe found after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, to draw up in feſtoons with pullies: however, ſhe diſcovered by what ſhe had done, that the picture was the ſame with that in the bed-chamber, viz. A large crucifix, or picture of the crucifixion.</p>
                     <p>She ſaid no more, but haſtened to view what was far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be ſeen, yet ſo, as that it was eaſy to diſcover ſhe was in no little diſorder. Her ſiſter that came with her diſcovered it firſt, and aſked what ailed her? Then the new married ſiſter, whoſe houſe ſhe was in, came to her with the ſame queſtion; ſhe owned to them ſhe was not very well, and that preſently gave her an excuſe to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw into the woman's apartment, where ſhe had ſome room to recollect herſelf. However, ſhe took care not to give the leaſt cauſe to ſuſpect what ailed her, till ſhe got an opportunity, when no body was in the room with her but her youngeſt ſiſter (ſhe who was firſt married) and then burſt out into tears, and taking her ſiſter about the neck, with the greateſt paſſion imaginable, O my dear ſiſter, ſays ſhe, this poor child is utterly undone. Undone! ſays her ſiſter, what do you mean? I think ſhe is nobly married. O ſiſter! I tell you ſhe's undone!

                     <p>I confeſs it is hard to reſiſt the force of thoſe perſuaſions, the reaſons for which we cannot rid our hands of by argument. And one is apt to think, one ought to comply with what we cannot confute, otherwiſe the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts will tell us, we are Proteſtant, we know not why; a Jew may tell us we are Chriſtians, we know not why; and an Atheiſt may tell us we are religious, we know not why, and ſo on.</p>

                     <p>That is, becauſe they make a religious uſe of them. But I think Proteſtants ſhould not be ſo fond of them, who make no ſuch uſe of them.

of his unkindneſs to her; for, except in diſputes about theſe things, they never had any difference worth the name of a diſpute in their lives; and, at his death, he left to her own diſpoſal above ſix times the fortune ſhe brought him; but this of his children was a mere point of conſcience to him, which he could not diſpenſe with. This was an inexpreſſible grief to her, and that ſuch, and ſo heavy, as it is impoſſible to repreſent it in this narrow tract, ſo as to ſay how far it afflicted her, or what ill conſequences attended it; the drift and deſign of this work alſo lying quite another way, viz.

                  <p>The eldeſt ſiſter was now married alſo, and married very happily and comfortably; the principles as well as practice of her huſband, not only concurred entirely with her own, but anſwered in a moſt agreeable manner to the character which was given <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  <p>Their father now grown old, had been a true peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent for his miſtakes in the paſt conduct of his children, and had fully made up his want of care in his middle daughter's match, by his difficulty in being pleaſed for his eldeſt. She needed no concern for, or to ſhew any nicety in examining into the perſon; for the father was ſo very nice for her, that ſcarce any thing could pleaſe him; he rejected ſeveral very good offers, merely on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of religious principles, and put them off without ſo much as naming them to his daughter, till at laſt, fixing upon a merchant in the city, who both for ſobriety, pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, opinion in religion, and eſtate, ſuited every way both his deſires and his daughter's judgment; the match, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch circumſtances, was ſoon made.

when all her affairs were in a ſettled poſture, that ſhe went to divert her thoughts a little, and unbend her mind from the ſorrows ſhe had been under, for ſhe was a ſincere mourner for her huſband; I ſay, it was ſome months after his death, that her younger ſiſter having invited her down to her ſeat in Hampſhire, ſhe went thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and her father and eldeſt ſiſter, at her requeſt, went all with her.</p>
                  <p>Here upon a caſual diſcourſing of things paſt, her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who was almoſt ever bemoaning his neglect in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing his children, threw out ſome words, which firſt gave her to underſtand that both he and her ſiſter knew her huſband was not a Proteſtant, at which ſhe ſeemed very much ſurpriſed: but, as ſhe found it was known, and that however it was ſtill ſo far a ſecret, as that it had gone no farther than their own breaſts, ſhe was ſoon made eaſy; ſhe then made a confidence of it, earneſtly entreating them that it might go no further, which they willingly promiſed for her ſatisfaction.</p>
                  <p>But this opened the door for variety of conferences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them; as particularly her ſiſter told her, how they diſcovered it firſt, and afterwards their father; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated all the diſcourſes they had had about it, and how, and for what reaſon they had reſolved never to mention it to her, unleſs ſhe ſpoke firſt of it; concluding, that, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, he might conceal it from her, and they would be very loth to diſcover a thing to her, which they knew could have no other conſequences at that time, but to ruin and afflict her; alas ſiſter! ſays ſhe, I diſcovered it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a fortnight after I came home.</p>

                     <p>Well, ſiſter, ſeeing you had ſo entire a maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery over yourſelf in that part, and you brought the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of your reaſon over your paſſions to ſo perfect an exerciſe, which is what I confeſs I muſt admire you for; I ſay, ſeeing you maſtered yourſelf ſo well that way, I am obliged to think you maſtered yourſelf as well within doors; and with good conduct perhaps you made it no inconvenience to you. I wiſh you would let us hear how you managed, that we may ſee, perhaps, difference of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion may be ſo managed as to make no breaches in a family, and it might be as well as if it had been other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>

                     <p>Why, it was not much above a fortnight after we came home, as I obſerved to you, before I diſcovered it; and the manner was thus. I wondered that every Sabbath-day my ſpouſe contrived ſome excuſe or other to avoid going to church with me. I had taken ſome notice of it before we went home; but the ſecond Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-day <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

He ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to deny me, and went into the coach with me, but pretended a ſudden thought, he was obliged to go up to St. James's; and having very civilly handed me out of the coach, and gone with me into the very place, made a light bow, when I could not ſtand to perſuade, and went back.</p>

                     <p>No, no; he never ſhewed me ſo little reſpect as that.

He ſmiled a little, but laying his hand upon it too, I had rather not, my dear; they are things I brought from Italy, but nothing of ornament. Well, well, ſays I, let it lie; I don't deſire to look, not I, and immediately turned to look at a picture that hung

I do not know, but I am ſure it is about me. Yes, ſays he, ſo it is: and he ſays I muſt tell you what it is, or elſe you will think he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannerly, to ſpeak any thing in a language you do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand. Well, pray, ſaid I, what is it he ſays? What pity is it, ſaid my ſpouſe, ſuch a fine genius as my lady, your wife is, ſhould not be within the pale of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic church! While my ſpouſe was telling me this, he looked very earneſtly at him to obſerve when he repeated the words, and, juſt as he repeated them, the good old father lift up his eyes, and ſaid ſome words ſoftly, but with great appearance of ſeriouſneſs, which it ſeems was to pray to Chriſt to convert me; and my ſpouſe looking very ſeriouſly too, croſſed himſelf, and ſaid Amen.</p>

my dear, I hope I am; and if I thought I was not, I would not ſleep till I was.

When he ſaw me ſo overwhelmed, he came to me, and took me in his arms, and ſaid all the kind things it is poſſible to think of, to pacify me: my dear, ſays he, though you may think this a grief to you, expect to have it made up to you abundantly, by all that is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for man to do to oblige you: and indeed if all the affectionate things a man could ſay or do, could make it up, it was made up to me; if it was poſſible for a man to do any thing to make a woman forget her diſappointment, he did it; and this from a man too, who had a perfect underſtanding of every thing that could oblige and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage the affections: in a word, no man could do more, or woman deſire more, to make up the loſs.</p>

I reſolved it from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to avoid bringing on any thing that might be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind or diſobliging between us, and he approved it, and did the ſame for the ſame reaſon; ſo that I never, after the firſt diſcourſe, ſo much as inquired what his opinion was: it was ſufficient to have the grief that we could not worſhip God together, either abroad or at home; we could not think of one another with charity, but as deceived perſons, out of the way of eternal felicity, out of God's bleſſing and protection; we could not look upon one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but with ſighs and ſad hearts. Again, we could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver converſe with one another upon religious ſubjects, for we could not enter upon the leaſt ſerious thing, but it led us into contradictions and wild diſtracted notions, which we were immediately forced to take the help of our affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to ſuppreſs, that we might not break out into inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencies to one another.</p>

                     <p>Why, truly ſiſter, I was young, and did not conſider what I ſaid! and beſides, I did not in the leaſt ſuſpect what my ſiſter ſuggeſted; and yet ſo far have I kept up to it, we have by the help of abundance of good humour on his ſide, and a great deal of love on both ſides, avoided differences and diſputes upon that ſubject: but, alas! ſiſter, that is but a negative, and it can only he ſaid we did not quarrel, which is a great deal to ſay too; but, what is this to a happy life? how was our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily guided, our children educated, and how would they have been educated, if he had lived? and how was God worſhipped? he and his prieſt at their maſs in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>No, never; we carefully avoided it: but this is but an evidence of the dreadful conſequences of ſuch marriages in general: for, where is there a couple that can ſay, as we could, that they have had no jars about it?

He told me, that was an argument juſt as ſtrong on his ſide, as it was on mine: and he added, ſmiling, How ſhall we do to agree, my dear, when it

comes to that? I hope we ſhall not love leſs than we do now. I told him I had a great many melancholy thoughts about it; and thus at laſt we were always fain to drop the diſcourſe; but to this hour I cannot conceive how we ſhould have done to have divided our children's inſtruction between us, if he had lived to ſee them grow up.</p>

                     <p>And I make no doubt but they are the moſt dangerous weapons to attack a woman's principles. I cannot but think them impoſſible to reſiſt. Paſſion, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindneſs, and all ſorts of conjugal violence, of which there is a great variety in the married life, are all nothing to them. You remember, ſiſter, ſome lines on another oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, but very much to the caſe:
<q>
                           <l>Force may indeed the heart invade,</l>

                     <p>I grant that it is difficult to reſiſt the influence of ſo much affection; and every thing that came from ſo ſincere a principle, and to a mind prepoſſeſſed with all the ſentiments of tenderneſs and kindneſs poſſible to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, make a deep impreſſion; but I thank God I ſtood my ground.</p>

                     <p>Well, well, you would not have ſtood it long, I am perſuaded; and this is one of the great haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards a woman runs in marrying a man of a different religion, or a different opinion from herſelf, viz.

                     <p>Dear ſiſter, let me confeſs to you, fine preſents, flattering words, and the affectionate looks of ſo oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſo dear, and ſo near a relation, are dreadful things, when they aſſault principles; the glittering jewel had a ſtrange influence, and my affections began to be too par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial on his ſide: O let no woman that values her ſoul, venture into the arms of a huſband of a different reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion? The kinder he is, the more likely to undo her; every thing that endears him to her, doubles her danger; the more ſhe loves him, the more ſhe inclines to yield to him; the more he loves her, the ſtronger are the bonds by which he draws her; and her only mercy will be, to have him barbarous and unkind to her.</p>

If her huſband is kind, he is a ſnare to her; if un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, he is a terror to her; his love, which is his duty, is her ruin; and his ſlighting her, which is his ſcandal, is her protection.</p>

                     <p>It is my caſe, dear ſiſter; ſuch a jewel! ſuch a huſband! how could I ſpeak an unkind word: every thing he did was ſo engaging, every thing he ſaid was ſo moving, what could I ſay or do?</p>

                     <p>I ſtood up and thanked him with a kind of ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony, but told him, I wiſhed it had been rather in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other form. Why, my dear, ſays he, ſhould not the two moſt valuable forms in the world be placed together? I told him that as he placed a religious value, upon it, he ſhould have it rather in another place. He told me, my breaſt ſhould be his altar; and ſo he might adore with a double delight. I told him, I thought he was a little profane; and ſince I did not place the ſame value upon it, or make the ſame uſe of it as he did, I might give him offence by mere neceſſity, and make that difference

which we had both avoided with ſo much care, break in upon us in a caſe not to be reſiſted. He anſwered, no, my dear, I am not going to bribe your principles, much leſs force them; put you what value you think fit upon it, and give me the liberty. I told him, I hoped I ſhould not undervalue it as his preſent, if he did not overvalue it upon any other account.

                     <p>Yes, Sir, my ſpouſe deſired me to put it on, and I could not well deny him; but I did not know how to
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:025384_0215_0FCD116A0B72CD28"/>
behave; for the ambaſſador and all his retinue paid ſo many bows and homages to me, or to the croſs, that I ſcarce knew what to do with myſelf, nor was I able to diſtinguiſh their good manners from their religion; and it was well I did not then underſtand Italian; for, as my dear told me afterwards, they ſaid a great many religious things that would have given me offence.</p>

                     <p>My dear, let me aſk you a queſtion or two about that: I know the firſt method they take in ſuch caſes, is to let you ſee that you have been miſtaken in your notions about Popery; that the difference is not ſo great as has been ſuggeſted to you; that we are all Chriſtians; that we worſhip the ſame God; believe the ſame creed; expect eternal life by the merits of the ſame Saviour, and the like; and by this method they bring us at firſt not to have ſuch frightful ideas of the Roman Catholic religion as we had before.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Wid.</speaker>
                     <p>That is true; and this I had frequently in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; and, I confeſs, ſuch diſcourſe had ſome effect on me.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Yo. ſiſt.</speaker>
                     <p>It leſſened the averſion you had to them, no doubt.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Wid.</speaker>
                     <p>It is true, they became not ſo frightful to me as before; but they had another argument which my dear often uſed to me, and it was this: My dear, ſays he, all your own divines, and all that have written on theſe ſubjects, own that a Papiſt, as you call us, may be ſaved; that it is poſſible for us to go to heaven. Our church have no reaſon to believe ſo of the Proteſtants, why, if you may go to heaven among us, ſhould you not join with us?</p>

                     <p>It is true, there lay my danger; for I muſt own, words ſpoken with ſo much tenderneſs have a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular effect, and ſink deeper on the mind than others, eſpecially where the affection is ſo mutual as it was with us.</p>

                     <p>Why, ſiſter, do you think in time his ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, and his affectionate way of treating you would not have abated?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Wid.</speaker>
                     <p>I often feared it, but indeed I never found it. Sometimes I ſuggeſted it to him, that I feared it; and one day I told him, that if I did not turn, I was afraid he would. He gueſſed what I meant, but would have me explain myſelf. Why, my dear, ſays I, when I reflect what your thoughts are about Proteſtants, That they are out of the pale of the church, and in a condition that they cannot be ſaved, I cannot but apprehend, that if I do not come over to your opinion, your love to me will abate, and at laſt turn into a ſtated averſion and hatred: how can you love an object whom you think God hates? My dear, ſays he, taking me very affectionately in his arms, I will prevent all your fears, by telling you, that, were what you mention poſſible, it could not be till I utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaired of your ever being brought over to the church and I ſhall never be brought to believe, but God will open your eyes firſt or laſt; and, beſides, my earneſt deſire to perſuade you, and win you to embrace the true religion will teach me to do it by all the tenderneſs and love that it is poſſible for me to ſhew you; for, to be unkind to you, would be the way to drive you farther off: but, be it as it will, I can never abate my affection to you; and, my dear, ſay he, (with the moſt obliging paſſionate air of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:025384_0218_0FCD11716328A410"/>
that it was poſſible to ſhew) that I hope, to love you tenderly and violently, is not the way to keep you at a diſtance from the church, but rather to draw you, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage you, and let you ſee, that peace, love, joy, charity, and all the virtues of a Chriſtian, are to be found among us, and not that we are furies and tyrants, as we have been repreſented. And when he had ſaid this, holding me ſtill in his arms, he kiſſed me ſeveral times, and went on: My dear, ſays he, let God alone change your heart his own way; I'll never take any method, but that of loving you ſincerely and moſt paſſionately while I live, and praying for you even after I am in heaven. While he ſaid this, I ſaw ſuch an inexpreſſible tenderneſs in his countenance, and every word came from him with ſuch paſſion, that I could not hold from tears: but he had not done with me yet; for, while he held me with one arm, he put his other into his pocket, and taking out his pocket-book, he bid me open it, and there dropt a looſe paper, doubled pretty thick, which I took up; ſays he, put it up, you ſhall have a pledge for the continuance of my affection to you, whether you change your opinion or no. I open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, but could read very little of it, for I had but newly begun to learn Italian. What is it, my dear, ſaid I. It is, ſaid he, an aſſignment on the Bank of Genoa for 2000 ducats a-year, and it ſhall be made over to your father in truſt for you, and to whoever you will beſtow it after you.</p>

                     <p>There was as much religion in our houſe, as it was poſſible there could be, in our circumſtances; for both of us deſired it in general, and purſued it in particular, only we could not join in the manner; and it was a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſcene of confuſion, to ſee how religion was carried on among us; the ſervants were ſome Papiſts, ſome Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, ſome Pagans; for we had three Eaſt-India blacks and one negro among our people.

They agreed exactly in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the joys of eternal life, the torments of hell, and particularly they had joined in giving the poor negro a frightful apprehenſion of hell, as the reward of his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wickedly, and of the devil as a tempter, an enemy, and tormentor; ſo that the poor fellow would pray to God very heartily to ſave him from hell, and to keep him from the devil.</p>

               <head>PART III.</head>
               <p>IN the latter part of the diſcourſe we left the aunt and the widow ſiſter, who had married the Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic gentleman, entering into a diſcourſe about the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies of entertaining irreligious ſervants; and alſo of entertaining ſervants of different perſuaſions and opinions in religion, one from another, or of different opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions from the family they ſerve in. The ladies put off the diſcourſe of that affair for another time, the aunt being willing to enter into a more particular converſation about it. This cauſed ſeveral entertaining diſcourſes among them at ſeveral times, ſome of which, I hope, may be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to be made public for the direction of other families, and for the encouragement of all maſters and miſtreſſes of families, who deſire to promote good government and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious things among their children and ſervants; and particularly in ſuch a time as this, when it is known that ſervants are leſs apt to ſubmit to family regulations, and good houſehold government, than ever.</p>
               <p>The two ladies being at their aunt's houſe, which was at Hampſtead, as I have obſerved, their aunt had a little ſquabble with one of her maids upon the following occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: The maid had, it ſeems, been out in the afternoon of a Sabbath day, and ſtaid longer than the uſual time of being at church: and her lady, who otherwiſe had known nothing of it, happened, unluckily for the wench

to be juſt in the way when ſhe came in; that is to ſay, the lady chancing to go down the back ſtairs, which was not ordinary for her to do, meets her maid dreſſed in her beſt clothes, and juſt going up to undreſs herſelf; and this rencounter between the miſtreſs and the maid produced the following dialogue.</p>

                     <p>Why, that is true, madam; I was at High-gate church-door, but I did not go in, that is true; I did not think you would have troubled yourſelf to examine ſuch trifles ſo very particularly.</p>

                     <p>Why thus: That though they may ſometimes drop aſleep, 'tis not always; and they do it but ſeldom, You, it ſeems, make the other a practice, and do it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways: Then, if they do ſleep ſometimes at church or at prayers, they don't pretend to ſay there is no harm in it, they muſt acknowledge they ought not to do ſo; but you have the impudence to ſay, when you ſpend your time in the fields, or perhaps worſe, there is no harm in it. Now there's a great deal of difference between doing a thing which they acknowledge to be wrong, and doing what is really wrong, and juſtifying it as if it was right.</p>

the real caſe, I would not reſtrain you, provided I was ſatisfied you went but ſomewhere; but your diſpute with my miſtreſs is between going ſomewhere and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, not between ſerving God in this manner or that manner, but between ſerving God ſome way or other, and ſerving him no way at all; and that alters the caſe mightily.</p>

                     <p>But as to the matter of coming to prayers at home, it would be the ſame thing: for, if I were a Church woman, and my miſtreſs a diſſenter; or I a diſſenter, and my miſtreſs of the Church; or I a Quaker, and my miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs a Roman C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Well, well, I don't doubt, however, but I ſhall get a place among them, and not be queſtioned about going to church.

the worſe, I aſſure you, for taking care that her ſervants ſhould go to church, and not caring to keep thoſe that are deſpiſers of religion. I think 'tis a pity any lady that is religious ſhould not have religious ſervants about her.</p>
                     <p>[They had another dialogue upon this ſubject after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: but it had too much paſſion in it to merit a place in this account; for the caſe was this; Betty gave her lady an account of ſome part of Mary's diſcourſe, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly that of making a jeſt of her chaplain, and of cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the family to prayers: upon which her miſtreſs turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her out of her houſe, giving her a month's wages in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a month's warning as one not fit to be allowed to ſtay in her family; and Mary fell upon her fellow ſervant for that part in a great rage. Betty told her in ſo many words, ſhe thought herſelf obliged to mention it, though it was not till her miſtreſs, having heard that they had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed together, made her promiſe to give her a full ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of all that had paſſed between them, and if ſhe had not done it faithfully, her miſtreſs would have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Theſe two ſhort dialogues or diſputes about the maid's rambling on the Sabbath-day, was the reaſon why the young lady's aunt was willing to diſcourſe again with her niece upon that ſubject; and accordingly meeting toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſome time after, they renewed their diſcourſe about ſervants in the following manner.]</p>

                     <p>I think, niece, when you and I talked laſt, we were upon the ſubject of taking religious ſervants: I want to hear what you have to ſay upon that head; for I think there is really much more in it than moſt people imagine.</p>

                     <p>As the world goes now, child, it will be very hard to find ſuch; for religion is ſo much made a jeſt of among maſters, that it is hard to find any ſervants that do not jeſt at it too, and mock and ſlight all thoſe that have any regard to it.</p>

                     <p>I believe ſo, Madam.

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Aunt.</speaker>
                     <p>I remember it very well; and we talked a little upon that very ſubject; I mean, how rude and inſolent ſervants were grown at this time: but I think we had not much talk of their being irreligious and profane.</p>

                     <speaker>Niece.</speaker>
                     <p>Madam, ſhe had a ſervant, whom they called her woman; for ſhe was one to whom ſhe entruſted every thing, and who was like a houſe-keeper; and all the ſervants were as it were under her: ſhe was a very good ſort of a body indeed in the houſe; and as that lady, if you remember, was very lame, ſhe could not ſtir about to look much after her ſervants herſelf, but truſted all to this woman.</p>
                     <p>She was a ſenſible woman, had the knowledge of almoſt every thing in the world, and talked admirably well; had a world of wit and humour, very mannerly and well behaved, ſober and modeſt enough; in ſhort, ſhe was an excellent ſervant.</p>

                     <speaker>Niece.</speaker>
                     <p>In a word, Madam, ſhe had every thing about her, that could be deſired in a ſervant, but religion; and
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:025384_0243_0FCD11A7D498DF78"/>
of that ſhe was as entirely empty as you can imagine it poſſible for any creature in the world to be, and that had ever heard of God or the devil, or had lived among Chriſtians.</p>

                     <speaker>Niece.</speaker>
                     <p>No, indeed, Madam, ſhe was ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ignorant, that ſhe was able to deceive any body: ſhe would talk of religious things as well, and argue upon them ſtrongly enough to delude any body: and this made it the worſe, for ſhe was ſuch a human devil, that ſhe made uſe of a fluent tongue, and of an uncommon wit, not to talk irreligiouſly only, but to mock and make a jeſt of religion in general, and of all thoſe that had any regard for it.</p>

                     <p>She had never been married, Madam, but I think was engaged to a man whom my ſpouſe ſent to Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: and they are to be married when he comes back.</p>

                     <p>Yes, madam, I dare ſay ſhe is. But her wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, profane, and atheiſtical behaviour is enough to poiſon a whole family.</p>

                     <p>She has ſuch a ſubtilty in her conduct, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haves ſo cunningly, that her miſtreſs does not perceive it; at leaſt ſhe does not think her ſo bad as ſhe is.</p>

                     <speaker>Aunt.</speaker>

                     <p>Yes, madam, he knows more of it than ſhe does; for the men-ſervants tell him of it, and give him a particular account ſometimes of paſſages which they obſerve.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Aunt.</speaker>
                     <p>Perhaps he does not trouble himſelf about it; for the men do not often value theſe things.</p>

                     <p>Indeed, madam, juſt the contrary; for he is a very ſober, religious gentleman, and keeps very good order in his houſe, and it is a very great diſturbance to him.</p>

                     <speaker>Niece.</speaker>
                     <p>Why, firſt of all, ſhe pretends that ſhe does not believe it; that the other ſervants rival her in the favours ſhe receives, and her miſtreſs' particular kindneſſes, and do it out of a malicious deſign: than ſhe ſays ſhe has examined her, and ſhe finds ſhe clears herſelf of much of the charge, and makes the reſt appear to be trifling, and not worth notice.</p>

                     <speaker>Aunt.</speaker>
                     <p>But perhaps, niece, it really may be ſo too, and the other ſervants may make things worſe than they are, for the reaſons you mention.</p>

                     <p>But, madam, it is otherwiſe in fact; for the truth is, the wench, or woman, manages all the ſervants ſo effectually, that, in ſhort, if any of them are religiouſly inclined when they come, ſhe makes them aſhamed to be ſo, when they come to her; for ſhe makes ſuch a meek of religion, and ſuch a jeſt of going to church, or going to prayers in the family, that ſhe laughs them out of their religion, and, in a word, they all turn reprobates like her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>

                     <p>So it was, madam; for it made the poor gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman decline performing his duty for ſome time, and made a very great breach between him and his lady, which is hardly quite made up yet.</p>

                     <speaker>Niece.</speaker>
                     <p>Why, madam, ſhe wanted to have him conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue to go on with his duty, and to pray in his family as he uſed to do; he declared he could not do it while that crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was to be there; that it was a reſtraint to him, and he could not perform when he knew there was one in the place who made a ſcoff and jeer at him for it.</p>
                     <p>She alledged, he ought to perform his duty for all that: and that it was a piece of the devil's craft, contrived to interrupt the worſhip of God in his family, and that he ought to diſregard it entirely.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Aunt.</speaker>
                     <p>Well, I think he was very much in the wrong in that part; for he certainly ought not to have omitted his duty upon ſo mean an objection as that.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Niece.</speaker>
                     <p>That is true, and he owned it; but ſaid it was a difficulty upon him, a reſtraint to him in the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his duty, and that ſhe ought to remove it from him.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Aunt.</speaker>
                     <p>He ought to have conſidered, that the leſs of religion was to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ound in his ſervants, the more reaſon he had to pray for them, and with them; that he might perhaps be the occaſion of good to them; and of bringing
<pb n="247" facs="unknown:025384_0246_0FCD11ABF71AE730"/>
them to the knowledge and love of religion, which would be an advantage he ought to be thankful for, and think it a bleſſing to his houſe if it happened ſo.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Niece.</speaker>
                     <p>She did argue juſt ſo to him, madam: but he returned it ſo ſtrong upon her, that ſhe ought, as far as lay in her, to remove every difficulty that lay in the way of his duty, that it was much more forcible as to her; for he told her, that if ſhe granted, that the difficulty was a ſnare laid in his way by the devil, ſhe ought, at the ſame time, that ſhe told him it was his duty to reſiſt it, do all ſhe could poſſible, or that lay in her power, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the occaſion; otherwiſe ſhe made herſelf acceſſary to the temptation, and aſſiſtant to the devil, in laying a ſnare for her huſband, and much of the ſin would lie at her door.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Aunt.</speaker>
                     <p>There was a great deal in that, I confeſs: and I think ſhe ought to have yielded immediately. Pray, what did ſhe ſay to it?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Niece.</speaker>
                     <p>She inſiſted that the charge was falſe; that her woman denied it, and, as I ſaid before, that it was a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious deſign of the other ſervants; but, in ſhort, the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs was, that ſhe was very loth to part with her woman, who, as I ſaid before, was a very good ſervant, and uſeful to her divers ways.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Aunt.</speaker>
                     <p>But you ſaid, that he heard ſomething of it himſelf. Surely ſhe would believe him then.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Niece.</speaker>
                     <p>Why, ſhe could ſay nothing to that indeed: but ſhe put it off as well as ſhe could, with telling him ſhe would tell her woman of it, and take care ſhe ſhould do ſo no more.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Aunt.</speaker>
                     <p>That ſeemed to be trifling, becauſe it was in a matter of ſuch conſequence, as ought not to be trifled with.</p>

                     <p>It was ſo: but he went yet further; he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated her, he begged of her to take away a thing ſo irkſome from him, and which was ſo much a hinderance to his duty. He told her, that had a ſervant been a mere ignorant, untaught creature, he ſhould have no difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty upon him, but rather it would be an encouragement to do his duty, in hopes of being an inſtrument of open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their eyes: but, for a mocker at religion, and one
<pb n="248" facs="unknown:025384_0247_0FCD11AEADE2C7C8"/>
that not only deſpiſed religion itſelf, but mocked at others for it: this made the caſe differ exceedingly, and he knew not how to get over it.</p>

                     <p>Truly, madam, the conſequences were bad many ways For, firſt, it kept the lady and her huſband in very ill terms with one another for near two years. And, ſecondly, that unhappy creature bantered all the other ſervants of the family out of the little religion they had, and indeed made them all like herſelf.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Niece.</speaker>
                     <p>Why, madam, beſides this, it broke and put an end to all good order, and to the worſhip of God in the family; I mean, to all family worſhip.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Aunt.</speaker>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Niece.</speaker>
                     <p>No, madam. Her huſband, who is a very religious gentleman, could not content himſelf with living in that manner with his family, and not being able to prevail with his wife to part with her woman, he took ſo much upon him as to force her out of the houſe, that is to ſay, he put away the whole ſet of ſervants in the family; for they were all made alike at laſt, and took all new peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple at once.</p>

                     <p>And how did the lady take it?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Niece.</speaker>
                     <p>Truly, madam, I cannot ſay ſhe took it ſo well as I wiſh, for her ſake, ſhe had: for though her huſband and ſhe are very religious, ſober, and good people, yet I cannot but ſay, it has broken very much in upon their tempers and affection one to another, and there is not all the harmony between them that there uſed to be.</p>

                     <speaker>Niece.</speaker>
                     <p>Why, madam, in the firſt place, ſhe made all religious things her jeſt; turned all that was ſaid to them at church, or in the family, that had any thing ſerious in it, into banter and ridicule, and laughed them out of every thing that looked like religion She repreſented religion to be a mere piece of ſtate policy and prieſt-craft, contrived between the clergy and the ſtateſmen, only to ſubject the world to their management.—The miniſters and ſervants of Jeſus Chriſt ſet apart for the altar, and whoſe buſineſs it is to preach ſalvation to a loſt world, by a glorious but crucified Redeemer, ſhe deſpiſed with the loweſt or laſt degree of contempt, calling them mercena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and tradeſmen, the church their idol, and the pulpit their ſhop, where they ſold the word of God to who bid moſt; and ſuch-like horrid and blaſphemous ſtuff. When the honeſt ſervants would have gone to church with their maſter and miſtreſs, ſhe would carry them away into the fields, or to make ſome viſit or other, and continually turn them off from what was religious to ſomething of levity and diverſion, as a more ſuitable work for the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-day; and ſtill when ſhe had brought them to break in upon conſcience, and to profane the Sabbath-day, ſhe would fall foul of religion for laying the burden of rules upon the liberties of the world; and all ſhe did or ſaid was with a great deal of wit, and by way of ſarcaſm, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  <p>IN the evening, the lady and her niece taking a walk in the garden, had a farther converſation upon the ſame ſubject, and the niece ſaid to her aunt, which began the dialogue, madam, when we left off our diſcourſe in the morning, you were pleaſed to ſay, at the end of my ſtory of an irreligious, profane wench, that my neighbour Mrs.—had been troubled with, that you would tell me a ſtory of another.</p>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Aunt.</speaker>
                     <p>I did ſo, child: it is of a family that lives at [She points to a houſe that could be ſeen over the garden wall] that houſe, juſt over the way, in the back lane. The people are Diſſenters; the gentlewoman is a very ſober, religious, good ſort of a perſon indeed; and her huſband is a very grave, religious man alſo. They endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to take ſervants of their own perſuaſion as much as they can; but that is ſometimes very difficult to do; and ſhe has indeed had very bad luck that way. However, this gentlewoman, as ſhe told me herſelf, having occaſion to hire a maid ſervant, I forgot whether ſhe was a cook or chamber maid, or what elſe, for they kept three or four: but after ſhe had agreed in every thing elſe, ſhe aſked her maid (that was to be) what religion ſhe was of?</p>
                     <p>Madam, ſays the maid bluſhing (for ſhe looked migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſober) that is a queſtion I do not underſtand very well.</p>
                     <p>Why, ſays the miſtreſs, I hope you are a Proteſtant; I do not mean, whether you are a Papiſt or no.</p>
                     <p>Yes, madam, ſays the maid, I think I am a Proteſtant.</p>
                     <p>Nay, ſays the miſtreſs, do you think ſo? but then, I doubt you do not think much about it.</p>
                     <p>Not ſo much as I ſhould do, madam, ſays the maid, and looked very ſimply and innocently at the diſcourſe.</p>

                     <p>It is true, madam. But what ſhall we ſay, that ſome that are good Chriſtians, are nevertheleſs not good ſervants: nay, there is a kind of a ſcandal upon thoſe we call religious ſervants, that they are generally ſaucy, reſerved, and value themſelves too upon it, always making conditions with you, and claiming times and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties on account of religious affairs, which are neither pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for the work of religion, nor perhaps employed ſo, when granted.</p>

                     <p>I told you the gentlewoman, my neighbour, aſked the wench about her religion, and how modeſtly ſhe anſwered. However, her miſtreſs put an end to that kind of diſcourſe, and ſaid, Look ye, ſweet-heart. I ſhall not catechiſe you too far; the queſtion is, whether you have been bred to the church, or the meeting houſe; for I tell you before-hand, we are all Diſſenters, and go to the meeting.</p>

                     <p>No, no; ſhe was willing to let her know firſt, and ſee what anſwer ſhe would give to it, not doubting but that if ſhe gave an anſwer not founded upon principle, ſhe ſhould find it out.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Niece.</speaker>
                     <p>That's true; and ſo between both, I ſuppoſe ſhe was bred to be indifferent to either.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Aunt.</speaker>
                     <p>No, my dear, 'twas worſe than that; and her miſtreſs took it immediately; for ſhe turned pretty quick upon the wench; and ſo ſweet-heart, ſays ſhe, I ſuppoſe
<pb n="253" facs="unknown:025384_0252_0FCD11B722BD8630"/>
you were bred between them, and go neither to one nor t'other.</p>
                     <p>Yes, madam, ſays the maid, ſometimes I went to one, and ſometimes to t'other.</p>
                     <p>And ſometimes to neither, ſays the miſtreſs.</p>
                     <p>My father and mother were poor people, madam, ſays ſhe.</p>
                     <p>Poor people! ſays the miſtreſs, what then, child? They might have carried you to ſerve God with them, one where or other; their poverty did not hinder that.</p>
                     <p>That's true, madam, ſays the maid: but they could not agree about it.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Niece.</speaker>
                     <p>So, in ſhort, the poor girl was left between them without any government or inſtruction; I ſuppoſe that muſt be the caſe. A ſad example of a family, where the huſband goes one way, and the wife another.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Aunt.</speaker>
                     <p>Ay, ſo it was: however, ſhe anſwered upon the whole, that ſhe was willing to go to the meeting, ſince her miſtreſs deſired it.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Niece.</speaker>
                     <p>That was to ſay, ſhe was perfectly indifferent in the matter, and it would have been the ſame thing to her, if her miſtreſs had been a Church-woman, or a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholic, or a Jew, or any thing, or nothing.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Aunt.</speaker>
                     <p>But her miſtreſs did not take it ſo; but ſeemed ſatisfied, that ſhe agreed to go to the meeting, and ſo took her into the houſe.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Niece.</speaker>
                     <p>And pray, madam, what came of it? how did ſhe prove?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Aunt.</speaker>
                     <p>Why, juſt as a poor, uneducated, ignorant crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture would prove. She went with them to the meeting, but pretended to the ſervants ſhe did not like it, and ſhe had rather go to the church. So her miſtreſs, taking an opportunity of talking with her again one day, told her what ſhe had heard in the houſe of her, and aſked her, if ſhe had ſaid, that ſhe did not like going to the meetings, but had rather go to church; and ſhe ſaid, that indeed ſhe did ſay ſo, but ſhe meant nothing of harm.</p>
                     <p>Well, ſays her miſtreſs, I never deſire to offer violence to any ſervant's conſcience; if you had rather go to church, you ſhall go to church, though you know what
<pb n="254" facs="unknown:025384_0253_0FCD11B8E716BE90"/>
you ſaid to me, when I hired you, that you were very wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to go to the meeting.</p>
                     <p>That was very true, ſhe ſaid, and ſhe had not ſaid otherwiſe now; but ſhe ſaid only, that ſhe had rather go to church: However, if ſhe pleaſed, ſhe would ſtay at home.</p>
                     <p>No, no, ſays the miſtreſs, I'll have no ſtaying at home; I will have all my ſervants go to the public worſhip of God ſomewhere: ſtaying at home may be as much miſpending the ſabbath-day, as going abroad for pleaſure: therefore go to church, Betty, ſays her miſtreſs, by all means; I am not ſo much againſt going to church, as to think that they do not ſerve and worſhip God there. By all means, if you do not care to go to the meeting, go to church; 'tis certainly your duty to go ſomewhere, and mine to oblige you to it.</p>

                     <speaker>Niece.</speaker>
                     <p>Well, pray what followed?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Aunt.</speaker>
                     <p>Why ſhe went to church, as ſhe ſaid; but in a little while her miſtreſs began to ſuſpect her: and once or twice ſhe betrayed herſelf, and diſcovered among the ſervants that ſhe had been rambling about, but had not been at church at all. Upon this ſuſpicion, her miſtreſs told her one day very calmly, that ſhe had ſome reaſon to ſuſpect, that her ſaying ſhe had rather go to church than to the meeting, was not a ſincere diſlike, or approving of the one more than of the other, but really a project of her own to have the liberty of ſpending the Sabbath-day no where; that is to ſay, in running about, as ſhe had been ſuffered to do, when ſhe was at home with her father and mother.</p>
                     <p>She replied with ſome confidence, that indeed it was not ſo, and began to be more poſitive about her having been at church than her miſtreſs deſired ſhe ſhould be, becauſe ſhe knew ſhe told her what was falſe. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſhe run on, told her miſtreſs a lie or two, which ſhe
<pb n="255" facs="unknown:025384_0254_0FCD11BA23842DA8"/>
knew to be ſo; and inſiſted that ſhe deſired to go to church, becauſe ſhe liked to ſerve God in that way better than the other. So her miſtreſs let it paſs for that time, and ſhe went to church as uſual, that is to ſay, went where ſhe pleaſed for ſome time.</p>
                     <p>At laſt ſhe was trapped accidentally, and could not get off any manner of way. For, going rambling for her pleaſure with ſome of the neighbouring ſervants, men and maids together (for by this time ſhe had got a gang like herſelf) and going to croſs the road about a mile from the town, a citizen that was ſpending the Sabbath-day on horſeback, as ſhe was ſpending it on foot, I mean in pleaſure, coming juſt up at that minute, his horſe ſtarted at ſomething, I know not at what, and giving a ſpring forward, ran againſt the poor wench, beat her down and threw him off a little farther, and hurt him too very much.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Niece.</speaker>
                     <p>And what became of the poor girl?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Aunt.</speaker>
                     <p>Why, ſhe was more frighted than any thing elſe; but ſhe had a kick or bruiſe by the horſe on her knee, or the horſe trod on her knee, ſhe could not tell which. But by that means ſhe was lamed, and could not get home till about eight o'clock at night, when her miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, coming to the knowledge of it, ſent the coach for her, and brought her home.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Niece.</speaker>
                     <p>Then there was a full diſcovery indeed.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Aunt.</speaker>
                     <p>Ay, ſo there was; for the neighbour's ſervants that were with her, owned where they had been, and with whom: and told honeſtly that they had been at a cake-houſe to be merry.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Niece.</speaker>
                     <p>It was no crime perhaps in the families where they lived.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Aunt.</speaker>
                     <p>No, none at all; or at leaſt no notice was taken of it, eſpecially ſince they were only with neighbours, and, as they called it, were in no bad company.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Niece.</speaker>
                     <p>But what did ſhe do with her maid?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Aunt.</speaker>
                     <p>Why her maid was the ſame; ſhe was ſorry for a while, and pretended ſhe would never go abroad for pleaſure again on a Sabbath-day. But that held but a little while; ſhe was the ſame again a little while after; ſo her miſtreſs reſolved to part with her, for ſhe two or
<pb n="256" facs="unknown:025384_0255_0FCD11BDF1DF9400"/>
three times enticed the other ſervants to go abroad with her, and ſtill when they had been miſſed, the anſwer was, they went to church with Betty; and then if Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was aſked, ſhe would lie very readily too, and ſay yes. At laſt this came out too, and Betty was called to an account for it, and when ſhe could deny it no longer, then ſhe would own it, but promiſe to alter it, and do ſo no more. At length her miſtreſs, who was in a little ſtrait ſtill, and loth to put any force upon the wench a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout going to the meeting, told her ſhe could not bear theſe things, and gave her warning.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Niece.</speaker>
                     <p>It was time to part with her, when ſhe found ſhe ſpoiled the reſt of the ſervants.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Aunt.</speaker>
                     <p>Well, but the wench, very loth to leave a good place, came to her miſtreſs, and begged her to let her ſtay, and ſhe would go to the meeting, and then ſhe ſhould be ſure ſhe did not ramble any more on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-day.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Niece.</speaker>
                     <p>So that 'twas plain ſhe would ſerve God any way for a good place; and that was what I ſaid of her as ſoon as I heard her firſt anſwer.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Aunt.</speaker>
                     <p>But her miſtreſs acted upon another principle ſtill, and ſhe refuſed her: No, ſays ſhe, Betty, you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in the houſe that you uſed to go to church; that you did not like the meeting, and that you had rather go to church. Now, I will not have any body forced from going to church, to pleaſe me; if you had been one that was bred to go to the meeting, I had been better pleaſed, becauſe I have been ſo brought up myſelf; but if you chuſe to go to church, becauſe you like to ſerve God after that manner, better than in the way I go, God forbid I ſhould put any force upon you. I doubt not, but you may ſerve and worſhip God very accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly either way; but if you go to the meeting, which you do not like, 'tis only to keep your place which you do like, 'tis plain to me you will worſhip God no where; for you cannot be ſaid to worſhip God in a way you do not like.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Niece.</speaker>
                     <p>She was too nice, I think, and talk'd to an ignorant wench in language that ſhe did not underſtand;
<pb n="257" facs="unknown:025384_0256_0FCD11BF6CA53AD0"/>
ſhe might e'en have let her gone any where: for 'twas plain ſhe would ſerve God no where.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Aunt.</speaker>
                     <p>Well, ſhe acted on her principles, however.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Niece.</speaker>
                     <p>But what did ſhe do with the maid then?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Aunt.</speaker>
                     <p>Why, ſhe made her a new propoſal. Look-ye Bett, ſays her Miſtreſs, if you will go to church honeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſatisfy me that you do ſo, and that you do not under a pretence of going to church, go abroad and ſpend your time idly, I ſhall be eaſy; for this was all the reaſon why at firſt I aſk'd you where you went, and told you I expected you ſhould go with me; not that I am againſt any body's going to the church, but becauſe I deſire they ſhould ſerve God, and not ramble abroad. Betty promiſed heartily; ay, but ſays her miſtreſs, how ſhall I be ſatisfied of the performance? Betty ſtood hard to have her word to be taken for it; but that would not do, becauſe ſhe had broke her promiſe before, and had told ſome lies too about the other ſervants' going to church with her, as above. Well, Betty, ſays her miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, I'll put you in a way to ſatisfy me effectually: you know the clerk of the pariſh lives juſt by, and in your way to the church; his wife is a very good, ſober woman, and I know never fails of going to church, if ſhe be well. Now, if you will go every Sunday with her, I'll anſwer for it, that if you are not there ſhe will be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

This her miſtreſs readily conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to, not doubting, but that one, that was under ſuch obligations, would certainly be careful to do her duty; and when ſhe mentioned to the maid that ſhe was very ready to yield to her going where ſhe ſaid ſhe went, that ſhe only deſired to be ſatisfied that her ſervants did really go where they ſaid they went; the maid ſeemed a little ſurprized, that ſhe ſhould be thought capable of ſo wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a thing as that, and ſo ſtopped her miſtreſs' mouth with her character.</p>

                     <p>We agree in that part exactly; and indeed, were I to chuſe, I would rather take a ſervant, who being ignorant in religious matters, was yet ſober and willing to be inſtructed: I ſay, much rather than take one fixed in his or her religious opinion, and that opinion differing from my own.</p>

                     <p>Indeed, Madam, I am poſitive in that point; I cannot go from it. I would not take one that differed from me in opinion in religion by any means; no, upon no account at all; it is attended with nothing but confuſion in the family. I would almoſt as ſoon take a looſe, profane, wench, that owned no religion at all; I have ſeen ſo much of it, and found ſuch inconveniencies in having religious quarrels and differences in the family by it, that I think 'tis inſufferable. I told you the ſtory of our poor Negro, that would turn Chriſtian. We had one ſervant a Papiſt, and he would have the boy a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholic; another would have him to be a Church of England Proteſtant, and another would have had him to be a Preſbyterian. 'Twas a reproach even to the name of Chriſtian, to hear one how he told him he would be damn'd if he was this; another told him he would be damn'd if he was that; and the other told him he would be damn'd if he was either of them, and ſo of the reſt; ſo that the poor boy was almoſt diſtracted among them, as I told you at large before.</p>

                     <p>My dear, you touch us all there, and that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a nice point too; it muſt be confeſſed that it is becauſe there are ſo few religious families, that there are ſo few religious ſervants.</p>

hand, looſe, profane, irreligious ſervants are a great hindrance to the ſetting up a religious family. Thoſe I am utterly againſt.</p>

                     <speaker>Aunt.</speaker>
                     <p>And that is the reaſon, child, that I ſay they ſhould not be taken into our families.</p>

                     <p>And ſhould be turned out again as ſoon as diſcovered, and that without any certificate given them of their good behaviour, or without giving them what we call a good character.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Aunt.</speaker>
                     <p>We cannot deny them a certificate, child, when they have not wronged or robbed us, the law requires that of us.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Firſt Niece.</speaker>
                     <p>But then, Madam, the certificate ſhould mention that I diſmiſs ſuch a man, or ſuch a maid, for being a profane, irreligious perſon, or for breaking the Sabbath day, or for not going to church, when ordered to go there, or for going abroad to be merry, when they ſhould have been at church, and ſuch like, as the caſe may happen to be.</p>

                     <speaker>Aunt.</speaker>
                     <p>I own there is a great deal of reaſon to do ſo; but we are apt to think it hard to do ſo, and that it is taking a poor ſervant's livelihood from them.</p>

We cannot ſay we can do juſtice to our neighbour, to do as we would be done by: For ſtill I go back to what we both ſaid before, that irreligious ſervants are a great hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance to maſters and miſtreſſes in ſetting up religious rules and exerciſes in their families.</p>

                     <p>I join heartily with my ſiſter in her o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, if ſuch ſervants can be had; but what then muſt be done when we get irreligious and profane-creatures in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our houſes, and cannot help it; or find them ſo when we expected the contrary.</p>

                     <speaker>Aunt.</speaker>
                     <p>No! my dear! The caſe is plain; we muſt not let ſervants laugh us out of our religion: We muſt
<pb n="268" facs="unknown:025384_0267_0FCD11D7919BD3E8"/>
go on in the way of our duty, and ſet up the worſhip of God in the houſe; and as often as we find the ſervants flout at it, or contemn it, return the contempt upon themſelves, and turn them out, but go on to perform the duty: Turn them all away, that pretend to behave irreverently, or pretend to mock or ſcoff at it; I ſay, turn them all away, and let it be the ſtanding known rule in the family, that all the ſervants that come, may hear of it as ſoon as they converſe in the houſe; then they will know what they have to truſt to, and will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have accordingly. 'Tis omitting our duty in our fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, not our performing it, that makes ſervants mock. When they ſee us religious to day and wicked to-mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, they may well ſcoff; but where ſerious religion is ſteadily maintained in a family, it commands that awe and reverence of ſervants, that they grow religious of courſe. Thus one good family breeds good ſervants for another, and the good example of a ſober family makes the ſervants all ſober.</p>

                  <p>A Few days after this lady and her two nieces had diſcourſed this point about ſervants, the aunt had both her neices, that is to ſay, the eldeſt of the ſiſters and the widow, had another dialogue upon the ſubject of giving a character to ſervants, and the juſtice that was to be done in it on one ſide, and on the other, on the following occaſion.</p>
                  <p>The eldeſt ſiſter had taken a very ſcoundrel, idle jade of a ſervant, and that too after having received a very good character of her from a gentlewoman with whom ſhe had lived before; and ſhe complained heavily of the injuſtice of it, and that ſhe had been abuſed by the ſaid gentlewoman, and was telling her tale to her aunt, which introduced the following dialogue.</p>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Aunt.</speaker>
                     <p>I find, child, you lay all the fault of your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſappointed upon the wench's former miſtreſs! you don't ſeem to ſay the maid herſelf had deceived you.</p>

                     <p>Yes Madam, that is true; but I did not expect ſo much from a maid, when ſhe came to be hir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: I did not expect ſhe would tell me her own faults.</p>

                     <speaker>Aunt.</speaker>
                     <p>Well, but on the other hand, you did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect ſhe would tell you ſhe was able to do what ſhe did not underſtand, or ſhould undertake what ſhe was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways qualified to perform.</p>

                     <speaker>Aunt.</speaker>
                     <p>And to do it, ſhe muſt be allowed to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce herſelf by a parcel of lies and ſhams, and pretended to be what ſhe has no pretence to; I think that as bad as any of the reſt.</p>

                     <p>I join with my aunt in that part. I think the law ſhould have provided ſome puniſhment, for ſervants that give themſelves characters they do not

deſerve, as well as for other pieces of diſhoneſty; for, in ſhort, it is a downright fraud, a cheat, and a piece of diſhoneſty, intolerable. For example, a cook comes and hires herſelf to me, to ſerve as ſuch; and when ſhe has undertaken the buſineſs, it appears ſhe underſtands no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of cookery, and has never been any thing but a middle maid, to waſh and ſcrub the rooms, and the like: Or, a chamber-maid offers herſelf, and tells me ſhe knows how to make mantuas, cut hair, clear ſtarch, and the like; and, when it comes to the trial, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges ſhe does not underſtand any of them, or only this, and not that, as it happens: Why ſhould not this maid be puniſhed, as well as ſhe that pretending to be honeſt, proves a thief?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Aunt.</speaker>
                     <p>No, child; ſhe does deſerve to be ill uſed: But the caſe differs as to a thief; for ſhe is puniſhed not for pretending honeſty, and deceiving me in the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, but for her actual theft, and robbing me of my goods.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sec. Niece.</speaker>
                     <p>Well, Madam, then the puniſhment ſhould differ too. I do not ſay ſhe ſhould be hanged, but I think ſhe ſhould be puniſhed however ſome way or other.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Firſt Niece.</speaker>
                     <p>We have ways to puniſh ſuch a ſervant, and all ſervants too, if all miſtreſſes would be but juſt to themſelves, and to one another. We might make up the deficiency of the law in that caſe to ourſelves very eaſily, and the want of doing ourſelves juſtice is the thing I complain of.</p>

                     <p>Indeed, Madam, that is the foundation of all the grievances we are under about ſervants, that we make no conſcience of doing one another juſtice,

                     <p>We may ſay the ſame of a thief, or a houſe-breaker, when we find them in our houſes or gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, and take them even in the very fact: We are loth to ruin them for it; that it was neceſſity forced them to do what they did; and if we have them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, they will be hanged or tranſported; nay, the argument is ſtronger, becauſe the injury done may have been trifling, and the puniſhment there is loſs of life, which we may be loth to be concerned in.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Aunt.</speaker>
                     <p>I believe I take your notion right, niece; the obligation is this: If I take the thief and give him up to the law, he is undone, and his life muſt pay for it; and 'tis a ſad thing for me to let a poor fellow be put to death, or tranſported, for robbing me of a trifle: But, on the other hand, I am to conſider, 1. I am obliged by the law to do it; that it is not I that put him to death, but the laws of his country, and his own crime is the cauſe of it; and I am an offender againſt that very law, and in ſome ſenſe a confederate with him, at leaſt an encourager of him in his crime, if I omit it. But which is more than that, 2. By my perharps unſeaſonable and indeed unjuſt compaſſion, become acceſſery to all the robberies he ſhall be guilty of after it; becauſe if I had done as the law directed me, I had put him out of a condition to rob or injure any other perſon.</p>

                     <p>You have fully explained my meaning, madam, and I take the caſe to be the ſame; I by no means do as I ought, or as the law directs, if when my neighbour taking a ſervant after me, and coming to me for a character of her, I decline ſpeaking the truth of her, ay, and the whole truth too.</p>

But ſhe is therefore, on the other hand, ſhy and backward, and will ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, or but little of the real character of the ſervant, becauſe, forſooth, ſhe would not hinder her of a place; and indeed I would be very loth myſelf to ruin a poor girl, becauſe I did not like her: but I do think, as you ſay, niece, we miſtreſſes are too backward to be free with one another in ſuch caſes.</p>

                     <p>It would not only anſwer the end, madam, as to the law part, but it would bring ſervants back to be ſervants again, as they uſed to be, and as they ought to be; for really they can hardly be called ſervants now.</p>

                     <p>No, madam, but the maid gave me an account where ſhe had lived laſt, and I went to the lady, and I told her I came to enquire of ſuch a maid ſervant, who, as ſhe had ſaid, had lived with her. Yes, ſhe told me, ſhe had lived with her.</p>
                     <p>Pray, how long did ſhe live with you, madam, ſaid I?</p>
                     <p>Pray, madam, how long does ſhe ſay ſhe lived with me? ſays ſhe.</p>
                     <p>Almoſt a year, madam, ſays I; I think it wanted but a month or thereabouts: at which ſhe made a kind of a hum, and ſaid nothing for a while.</p>
                     <p>Now I did not like the way of anſwering my queſtion with a queſtion; for I thought ſhe might have told me poſitively how long the maid had lived with her, and
<pb n="274" facs="unknown:025384_0273_0FCD11E1E22EBB80"/>
left me to judge whether ſhe had ſpoken truth: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, by returning the queſtion upon me, ſhe kept it in her own breaſt to accuſe or excuſe her. So I turned it ſhort upon her. I hope, Madam, ſays I, you will be ſo plain with me, as to let me know whether ſhe ſays true or not.</p>
                     <p>Yes, yes, Madam, ſays ſhe.</p>
                     <p>This ſurpriſed me again; for this had a double mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as plain as could be, and it was impoſſible to know whether ſhe meant, yes, that it was as the maid had ſaid, or yes, that ſhe ſhould let me know whether the maid had ſaid true or not. So I ſtopped a while to give her time to go on, and explain himſelf; but finding ſhe did not, I repeated my queſtion. Pray, Madam, ſays I, be pleaſed to let me know exactly how long ſhe lived with you.</p>
                     <p>Why, Madam, ſays ſhe, not quite a year: The maid ſays true in that.</p>
                     <p>I was far from being ſatisfied with that kind of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, the manner of drawing out her words ſhewing me plainly that the wench had lied. However, leſt I ſhould quarrel with her too ſoon, and ſo have no more out of her, I dropped it, and aſked her ſome other queſtions.</p>
                     <p>Pray, Madam, ſays I, is ſhe a good work-woman?</p>
                     <p>Yes, yes, ſays ſhe, ſhe does her work well enough.</p>
                     <p>This was all equivocation again. Any body would have underſtood by my queſtion, that I enquired if ſhe was good at her needle; but ſhe would not take it as I meant it, and put it off with an anſwer which might be true, if the wench knew but how to make a bed, or ſweep a room; ſo I explained myſelf, and ſaid, Madam, by a good work-woman, I mean at her needle, I hope you underſtand me.</p>
                     <p>Truly, Madam, ſays ſhe, I think ſhe is well enough, I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> put her to much of that kind, having other hands in the houſe.</p>
                     <p>Well, there ſhe came better off with me a little than before; but ſtill all this gave me no character of the maid; ſo I went on.</p>
                     <p>Pray, Madam, ſays I, what do you ſay to her hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſty? She is honeſt, I hope.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="275" facs="unknown:025384_0274_0FCD11E360F84308"/>
I have no reaſon to tax her honeſty, ſays ſhe, ſhe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver wronged me of any thing that I know of; I charge her with nothing.</p>
                     <p>Even this was but a very indifferent way of vouching for a girl's honeſty, and if ſhe was really honeſt, ſhe was not juſt to her.</p>
                     <p>Well, Madam, ſays I, may I aſk you what was the occaſion of your parting with her?</p>
                     <p>O, Madam, ſays ſhe, we parted indeed; ſhe and I could not agree; I am paſſionate and pretty trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and my maid and I could not hit it; but ſhe may do very well with another. Perhaps other miſtreſſes may not be ſo troubleſome and difficult as I am; ſhe may do very well; I aſſure you ſhe knows how to pleaſe any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy but me; ſhe told me ſo herſelf.</p>
                     <p>I was indeed provoked now, and anſwered, Madam, you are pleaſed to give yourſelf ſome hard words; but I beg you will allow me to ſay, I did not come for a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the maid's miſtreſs, but a character of the maid; and I doubt, by your diſcourſe, you are willing to recommend your maid's character at the expence of your own.</p>
                     <p>She only ſmiled at me, when I ſaid this, and ſaid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, ſhe was very difficult and ill to pleaſe; but Betty might do very well with another.</p>
                     <p>I preſſed her again to let me know what ſhe parted with her maid for: but ſtill ſhe ſhuffled me off, and gave me the cunningeſt, evaſive anſwers. Betty herſelf could not have put me off with half the dexterity as her miſtreſs did; ſo I made my honours as if I was going away.</p>
                     <p>Madam, ſays I, you are exceeding tender of your maid: but I cannot ſay you are equally juſt to a ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that you ſee reſolved to depend upon your word for the character of a ſervant. However, I ſhall take <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> the way I hope you intend it, namely, that though it may not be for the girl's advantage to have the particulars of her behaviour told; yet you would have me under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand by it, that her conduct will not bear a character, and that you would not have me venture upon her; and I ſhall take your advice.</p>
                     <p>At this ſhe ſeemed concerned, as if ſhe had expected
<pb n="276" facs="unknown:025384_0275_0FCD11E7A33EEF18"/>
that her aukward way of talking of the wench had ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied me, and that I did not underſtand her; and as I of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to go, pray, Madam, ſays ſhe, don't ſay ſo; Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty may make you a very good ſervant; I am ſorry you ſhould take me ſo; the maid may do very well in another place, though ſhe might not ſuit me.</p>
                     <p>As I was talking, I obſerved, that in the drawing-room to the room we ſat in, there ſat a gentleman read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a great book, and every now and then he looked off his book, when his wife (for it was her huſband) ſpoke, as if he was ſurpriſed at what ſhe ſaid; and as the folding doors ſtood wide open, ſo that the rooms were as it were let both into one, he heard all we ſaid, and I perceived that as he looked off his book when his wife ſpoke, ſo he almoſt laugh'd outright when I ſpoke.</p>
                     <p>At laſt, as if he was not able to hold any longer, he clapp'd up the book pretty hard, and threw it by, and came forward into the room we were in, and making me a very low bow as he paſſed, he offered to go out; when his lady ſtept up to him, and ſaid ſomething ſoftly, which he anſwered ſoftly, and with abundance of good-humour in his face, ſaid to his wife, my dear, I will not interrupt you; upon which I offered to go away. By no means, Madam, ſaid he, my buſineſs is of no moment. So taking hold of his wife's hand, he as it were turned her towards me, and at going away, my dear, ſays he, don't hold the lady in ſuſpenſe about your maid, for I hear that is the buſineſs: Let her have a true character of her; you would be glad to be dealt plainly with your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. His wife ſmiled, but ſaid nothing at firſt, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently turning to him, and all in a pleaſant, good hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, ſhe gave him a little tap on the arm with her hand: Do you give a character of her, if you think I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>I made him a courtſey, and told him I was greatly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to him for ſo much ſincerity, and found his lady
<pb n="277" facs="unknown:025384_0276_0FCD11E8BAAA66F0"/>
had been only tender of his maid's character, but had not at all recommended her. Why, Madam, ſays he, my wife was cheated in this wench, only by the people ſhe lived with before giving her ambiguous anſwers, and ſpeaking as favourably of her as they could; and that is the ruin of us all, adds he, in taking ſervants.</p>
                     <p>But Sir, ſays I, the lady ſhe lived with before, did your lady a great deal of wrong, if ſhe knew her to be what you ſay ſhe was in her ſervice.</p>
                     <p>I don't know, Madam, how it was for that: I never meddle with theſe things, ſays he, but I believe my wife was not ſo nice in her inquiries as you are; or, if ſhe was, ſhe was eaſier to be cheated in their anſwers; and 'tis the ladies being thus backward to give juſt and plain accounts to one another, that is the reaſon that ſuch a wretched gang of wenches run from houſe to houſe and get places, and behave in them as they do. Would the ladies, ſays he, be juſt to one another, ſpeak plainly and honeſtly, and give the creatures ſuch characters as they deſerve, they would take care to deſerve better characters, and not behave ſo inſolently, and ſo ſaucily as they do. This jade, Madam, ſays he, that you come to inquire of, has inſulted and taunted her miſtreſs two or three times, at ſuch a rate, that I have been forced to ſend a footman into the room to bring her out by the head and ſhoulders, for fear her miſtreſs ſhould be frighted: and yet ſhe is ſo good to that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>My dear, ſays the lady, I have not ſaid any thing but truth of her.</p>
                     <p>Well, my dear, ſays ſhe again, I was not upon my oath.</p>
                     <p>Why, that is true too, child, ſaid he, but you are upon your honour, and that is equivalent to an oath; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

and therefore the remedy is to be embraced, and the leſſer evil choſen.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. There may be methods directed by the law, that in ſuch caſes, where miſtreſſes have nothing capital to charge upon a ſervant, they ſhall be obliged to give them certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates of their behaviour.</p>

                     <p>I have often thought of that; but unleſs the form of that certificate be ſettled and adjuſted by that very act of parliament, the miſtreſſes will juſt write what they pleaſe, and when they are produced againſt a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, will ſay nothing in their certificates that ſhall do them any ſervice, or recommend them at all to any one elſe.</p>

                     <p>Well, there may be a remedy for that too, for there may be two or three ſeveral forms of certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficates directed by the law; one volunteer, and full to all the behaviour of a ſervant, and the other to her honeſty and ſobriety only.</p>

                     <p>Why then, child, nobody would take a ſervant that had only your ſecond-rate certificate; they would preſently ſay, her miſtreſs had given no character but what ſhe could not help.</p>

                     <p>Why then the maid ſhould have the ſame remedy as ſhe has for her wages, viz. complain to a juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of peace, that in caſe upon the miſtreſs's being heard, if ſhe could not give ſufficient reaſons and proof of the fact, for which ſhe refuſed ſuch a certificate, the juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice ſhould ſign the certificate to the maid, intimating that having heard all that could be alledged, he did not find there was ſufficient cauſe for refuſing it.</p>

                     <p>Why, Madam, when a miſtreſs may have a kindneſs for a ſervant, and is willing to give her an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary recommendation, ſhe may add, ſhe is a very good needle-woman, or that ſhe is a very good cook, that ſhe was not only faithful, but diligent, and ſo in other ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: But, as I ſaid, I believe any ſervant will be content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the ſecond, which is ſufficient.</p>

one day, upon occaſion of ſomethi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>g I did not like, and truly my maid turned very ſhort upon me, and told me ſhe was ſorry ſhe could not pleaſe me, and hoped I would provide myſelf then. I told her, that ſhe ſhould not ſay, ſhe could not pleaſe me, but that ſhe would not pleaſe me.</p>
                     <p>She anſwered very pertly, that it was as I would, I might take it which way I pleaſed.</p>
                     <p>Very well, ſays I, Mary, you are very tart with me, I hope when you ſend your next miſtreſs to me for a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, you will expect to hear theſe very words again.</p>
                     <p>Why, would I be ſo barbarous, ſaid ſhe, to rip up words that paſſed in anger, and give them for the character of any ſervant.</p>
                     <p>No, Mary, ſays I, you ſhould not ſay, will I be ſo bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous; you ſhould ſay, would I be ſo honeſt as to give a character of you from your own mouth. Depend upon it, Mary ſays I, I ſhould not be ſo unjuſt to any miſtreſs to conceal a thing of that moment from them; why, it would be doing them the greateſt injury in the world.</p>
                     <p>She ſtood ſtill a good while, and ſaid nothing; but as ſhe ſaw me looking at her, as if I expected an anſwer, the girl fell a crying, run to me, and offering to kneel to me, begged my pardon, and told me, ſhe hoped I would allow her to recal her warning, for ſhe was reſolved ſhe would live with me till ſhe deſerved a better character.</p>
