            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Indeed, my Lord, you impoſe a taſk that will require a Volume, rather than a Letter. As your Lordſhip's deſire, however, ſhall always carry with me the force of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, I will engage in it with the utmoſt chearfulneſs.

               <note place="margin">American colanies too long neglected tho' of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance.</note> THE American colonies, I ſpeak it with ſubmiſſion, my Lord, were too long neglected by their mother country; tho' loudly demanding her patronage and aſſiſtance. Thoſe, on the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, require her peculiar notice: They may be made an inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſtible magazine of wealth; and if ſuffered to fall into the hands of the French, ſuch will be the acceſſion to their already extended commerce and marine ſtrength, that Great Britain muſt not only loſe her former luſtre, but, dreadful even in thought! ceaſe to be any longer an independent power. Nay, ſhould every other ſcheme fail, the ſucceſs of this will inevitably accompliſh the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>projected deſign of that aſpiring nation, for ſetting up an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Monarchy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> for, if France rule the ocean, her reſources will enable her to ſubject all Europe to her deſpotic ſway. But it is unneceſſary to offer any arguments in ſupport of a propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of which the Public ſeems to remain no longer inſenſible. Happy for us, had theſe ſentiments prevailed earlier, and been more frequently inculcated!</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">More con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, on the reduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Louisburg.</note> THE importance of the colonies, my Lord, was too little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, till the commencement of the laſt war. The reduction of Cape Breton by the people of New-England, was an acquiſition ſo unexpected and fortunate, that America became, on that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable event, a more general topic of converſation. Mr. Shir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, the governor of the Maſſachuſetts B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y, was the principal projector of that glorious enterprize: An enterprize, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the obedience of his Britannick Majeſty, the DUNKIRK of North America. Of ſuch conſequence to the French, was the poſſeſſion of that important key to their American ſettlements, that its reſtitution was, in reality, the purchaſe of the laſt general Peace in Europe.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Character of Gov. Shirley.</note> OF all our plantation Governors, my Lord, Mr. Shirley is moſt diſtinguiſhed for his ſingular abilities. He was born in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:008163_0005_102E40D2F5EF28D0"/>and bred up to the Law, at one of the Inns of Court. In that profeſſion he afterwards practiſed, for ſeveral years, in the Maſſachuſetts Bay: and, in 1741, was advanced by his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty to the ſupreme command of that colony. He is a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of great political ſagacity, deep penetration, and indefati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable induſtry. With reſpect to the wiſdom and equity of his adminiſtration, he can boaſt the univerſal ſuffrage of a wiſe, free, jealous, and moral people. Tho' not bred to arms, he is emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently poſſeſſed of theſe important military virtues — An ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of capacity to form and execute great deſigns; — pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found ſecreſy; — love of regularity and diſcipline; — a fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal and laborious manner of living; with the art of conciliating the affections; — a talent which Hannibal admired in Pyrrhus, above all the reſt of his martial accompliſhments. In the firſt of theſe great qualities, Mr. Shirley is univerſally acknowledged to ſhine: and it is, in reality, more eſtimable, than all other military endowments without it; conſiſting, to uſe the words of that diſcerning hiſtorian Mr. Rollin, <q>
                  <hi>in having great views; in forming plans at a diſtance; in propoſing a deſign, from which the author never departs; in concerting all the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures neceſſary for its ſucceſs; in knowing how to ſeize the favourable moments of occaſion, which are rapid in their courſe, and never return; to make even ſudden and unforeſeen accidents ſubſervient to a plan; in a word, to be upon the watch againſt every thing, without being perplexed and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerted by any event.</hi>
               </q> But, whether it ariſes from his being ſo far advanced in years, or from his conſtitutional diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and make, he has not, in my opinion, that activity and alertneſs ſo conducive to warlike expedition; and on which the ſucceſs of an enterprize frequently depends. This was one of the characteriſtics of Braddock; a commander, vigorous in executing, as Mr. Shirly, judicious in contriving a plan— <hi>ſed non <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<note place="margin">Hisatten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs.</note> No man perhaps in the nation, has beſtowed more attention, upon the ſtate of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies in general: and having their intereſt ſincerely at heart, he has been perpetually concerting expedients, advancive of their proſperity, and to check the views of an all-graſping Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch. Upon the reduction of Louiſburgh, he earneſtly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to his Majeſty's miniſter, the demolition of that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs,

                        <hi>As I have the honour to command here in chief, Mr. Waſhington delivered me the letter, which you directed to the commandant of the French troops. I ſhould have been pleaſed if you had given him orders, or if he himſelf had been diſpoſed, to viſit Canada and our general; to whom, rather than to me, it properly appertains to demonſtrate the reality of the King my maſter's rights to lands ſituated along the Ohio, and to diſpute the preterſions of the King of Great Britain in that reſpect.</hi>

                        <hi>As to the requiſition you make (that I retire with the troops under my command) I cannot believe myſelf under any obligation to ſubmit to it. I am here, in virtue of my general's orders; and I beg, Sir, you would not doubt a moment of my fixed reſolution to conform to them, with all the exactitude and ſteadineſs that might be expected from a better officer.</hi>

If it had been agreeable to you, Sir, in this reſpect, to have made a particular detail of the facts which occaſion your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, I ſhould have had the honour of anſwering you in the moſt explicit manner; and I am perſuaded you would have had reaſon to be ſatisfied.</hi>

An immediate junction in ſuch meaſures became abſolutely requiſite for our common ſecurity. But the colonies, alas! were ſunk into a profound lethergy; and, reſigned to ſtupidity and ſlumbering, appeared inſenſible of the threatning danger. They contemned the power of Canada; confided in the number of their inhabitants; inattentive were they to the inconveniencies of an endleſs frontier; and in ſhort intirely unacquainted with the ſituation of the inland country. The waters of the Ohio, before this period, were ſcarce known, ſave to a few Indian traders; and the generality deemed thoſe French ſettlements too remote to be the object of dread, and a matter of inſignificant moment.

By his Majeſty's direction, two of the regular independent companies of foot at New-York, were ordered to the frontier of that dominion.

Mr. Clinton, a gentleman of but indifferent parts, wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned himſelf into his hands. Contenting himſelf with the title and ſalary of Governor, he left the ſole direction of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs to his miniſter, who by virtue of his late acquired om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotence with the aſſembly, carried all his points, and even endeared him to the people. This intimacy ſubſiſted no longer than it was found conducive to his deſigns. Having obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Mr. Clinton a new commiſſion for his office of Chief Juſtice <hi>during good behaviour;</hi> and flattering himſelf with the hopes of another, appointing him Lieut. Governor, through the intereſt of his friends in England, he cared not how ſoon his excellency abdicated the province, nor how tempeſtuous he rendered his adminiſtration; and was therefore prepared for an open rupture. He no ſooner thought himſelf capable of acting independently of the governor, than like Sixtus Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, who threw aſide his cruthes the moment of his exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the popedom, he put off all that humble devotion, by which he had ſo fatally deceived his too credulous maſter, and openly ſet himſelf at defiance againſt him. Now he began to dictate, rather than adviſe: and inſtead of Sejanus, choſe to be Tiberius himſelf. Dining one day with Mr. Clinton, and inſiſting upon ſome favourite point with great imperiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:008163_0016_102E40AAD920F3F0"/>the Governor, who had hitherto very cordially ſuffered himſelf to be led, refuſed on this occaſion to be driven. The Chief Juſtice then aroſe and left him; declaring, with an oath, he would make his adminiſtration uneaſy for the future: His Excellency replied, he might do his worſt. Thus they parted; nor were ever afterwards reconciled. This breach gave riſe to the contentions, which ſo unhappily imbroiled our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial affairs, during the remainder of his adminiſtration. The aſſembly were inſtantly inflamed. He who before had been able to make them connive at very unjuſtifiable ſteps, could at once ſtir up an oppoſition to the moſt unexceptionable mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. Remonſtrances, warm and virulent, were now drawn up; unworthy their own dignity to offer, and replete with the groſſeſt language to his Majeſty's repreſentative. Thus was formed againſt Mr. Clinton a powerful party, which ceaſed not, while he continued at the helm, to harraſs and perplex him. To ſuch an exorbitant length did they carry their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, as to throw off the reſtraint of humanity: They had even recourſe to force and violence. Nay, a partiſan of the Chief Juſtice, in defiance of the ſacred rights of the magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and the law — to ſhew his reſentment againſt Mr. Clin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton and his adherents — aſſaulted the mayor; whipped the ſheriff; damned the Governor; and ſtabbed his phyſician. My Lord, we became the ſport and contempt of our neighbours; and it is beyond contradiction, that Mr. De Lancey, by blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the coals of contention, did the province more injury, than he will be ever able to repair. Nor is their any reaſon to doubt, that the enorm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Nor without ſuch independence, or an abridgement of Mr. De Lancey's power, by reducing him to his primitive private ſtation, do I ſee any probability of the extinction of that
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:008163_0017_102E40E394E8DFF0"/>party-ſpirit, which hath ſo long diſturbed the tranquility, and injured the publick weal of the colony. Mr. Clinton, being ſuperſeded by Sir Danvers Oſborn
<note n="*" place="bottom">Sir Danvers Osborn arrived at New York the 7th of October, 1753.</note>, a gentleman of a moſt amiable moral character, retired into the country; from whence he propoſed to embark for Great Britain. The Chief Juſtice, notwithſtanding his long declared enmity, and unwearied in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry to embarraſs his adminiſtration, had now — the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, ſhall I call it? — to diſpatch a meſſenger to him, with deſign if poſſible to procure an accommodation — in order to ſecure his favour in England, when he could no longer diſtreſs him in America. It were difficult to determine, whether this required a higher degree of aſſurance or ſervili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But it is no uncommon thing, to behold the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon faſtidious and fawning, ſupercilious and ſycophantic. Mr. Clinton, far from an implacable enemy, began to be ſoftened; when his lady (who if born among the Scythians, had been the Thaleſtris of antiquity) unravelling the ſecret, fruſtrated at once all expectations of a compoſition; and gave the plenipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiary ſuch a volley of invective againſt his conſtituent, as rendered all future overtures entirely hopeleſs.</p>

In the firſt place, he had to convince the miniſtry of his utmoſt efforts to carry the King's inſtructions in the houſe of repreſentatives: And in the next, in order to preſerve his popularity with the aſſembly, and not in the moſt flagrant manner counteract his avowed principles, he was to ſatisfy them, that in reality he by no means ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected their compliance with them.

THUS, my Lord, I have preſented you with a faithful por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trait of the Lieut. Governor of New York, who is to bear no ſmall ſhare in the public affairs, of which I have the honour to tranſmit your Lordſhip an account — a portrait, under which there had been no need of fixing a name to direct to the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, thoſe who have the leaſt knowledge of that gentleman's character.</p>
               <p>WHILE theſe things were tranſacting at Albany, Mr. Pownal,
<note place="margin">Character of Mr. Tho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mas Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</note> brother to John Pownal, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> one of the ſecretaries to the Board of Trade, was upon the ſpot. This gentleman came over to America with Sir Danvers Oſborn, in quality of his private ſecretary; though it was imagined by many, he was deſigned to be an aſſiſtant to him in the exerciſe of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. He is ſomething of a ſcholar, but a confuſed rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner; and in his ſtile perplexed; and in that uſefulleſt of all ſciences, the knowledge of mankind, he is a mere novitiate: without the latter, your Lordſhip knows that other acquire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are comparatively of ſmall account, in the management of public buſineſs. To be only learned, is frequently to be vain, oſtentatious, and obſtinate; ſuch a one, in a word, as Tertullian deſcribes the moſt learned among the heathens, "an animal of glory." This gentleman is fond of being conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered <hi>in an important light.</hi> Inſatiable of praiſe, he can not only hear himſelf flattered; but, what is more unaccountable in a man of tolerable ſenſe, can flatter himſelf. He is a perſon of uncommon application, and a good memory. By dint of induſtry, and an acceſs to the papers in the Plantation Board Office, he has acquired ſome knowledge of American affairs: but ſo keen is his appetite for promotion, that he cannot brook the thoughts of a gradual advancement. He is for galloping into preferment: and ſo intent on the contemplation of his future grandeur, as to loſe all patience in earning it. Being more ſkilled in books than men, he is very abrupt in giving a ſcholaſtic turn to converſation, in order to diſplay his erudition. Ever ready to contradict: himſelf impatient of contradiction. But wonderful is his knack at pluming himſelf with the ſchemes and inventions of others; and, with the daw in the fable, ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="26" facs="unknown:008163_0024_102E40B4F409BB48"/>characteriſtic of a perſon, who will appear to have had ſome conſiderable influence in the courſe of American tranſactions. During the ſitting of the congreſs,
<note place="margin">Anec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting a piece he publiſhed.</note> it was ſcarce poſſible to prevent part of their ſentiments from tranſpiring. The ſcheme of a naval armament on Lake Ontario, projected by Lieut.

Mr. Pownal, intent upon riſing into ſignificance among the colonies, choſe not to ſlip ſo favourable an opportunity of diſtinguiſhing himſelf, as he could now lay hold of, from theſe whiſpered intelligences. He accordingly drew up ſome looſe indigeſted propoſals, with reſpect to American affairs. Among other trite ſentiments, he urged this ſcheme as a new unthought-of meaſure, abſolutely requiſite to ſecure the command, and preſerve the furr trade of thoſe inland ſeas. This he delivered to ſome of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the congreſs to be communicated: and afterwards tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted a copy to England; challenging to himſelf the ſole merit of being the original author of ſo uſeful and neceſſary an expedient

The ſcheme being approved by the council and repreſentatives of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, and the quotas ſettled, commiſſioners were charged to the neighbouring governments, to ſollicit their concurrence and aid, in the proſecution of this enterprize.</p>
               <p>WHILE theſe matters were in agitation. Mr. Pownal was at Boſton, intending to ſail from thence to England. He now thought fit to change his reſolution; and Governor Shirley ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured him with the embaſſy to New York, for which place he ſet out the beginning of March. Some gentlemen of the council and aſſembly were commiſſioned, on the like errand, to the other colonies of New Jerſey, Penſylvania, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>MR. POWNAL's proſpects of ſucceſs at New-York were at firſt not very encouraging.

At this time great animoſities were prevailing in the province, occaſioned by a charter juſt before granted by Mr. De Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cey, conſtituting a college for the education of youth, upon a foundation which happened to enkindle the general diſguſt. The majority of the houſe, apprehending the loſs of their ſeats on a future election, ſhould they afford it the leaſt aſſiſtance,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:008163_0026_102E40B68802F2F8"/>found themſelves obliged rather to countenance the popular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment. A gentleman of diſtinction, with whom Mr. Pownal adviſed on the ſubject of his commiſſion, thought it a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſtep to open his meſſage in part, to thoſe members of the aſſembly, who, on the above-mentioned account, were then in the oppoſition. Several of the leading men were ſecured by this method:
<note place="margin">But in vain.</note> and when the houſe met, ſuch a diſpoſition appeared to join in the ſcheme propoſed, that it was beyond Mr. De Lancey's power to obſtruct it. Out of pique howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to Mr. Shirley, to whom this expedition was ſolely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, he prevailed upon them to ſuſpend the execution of their vote, until General Braddock's approbation was obtained: and by this artifice occaſioned a conſiderable delay in the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</p>

               <p>THESE reſolutions being taken,
<note place="margin">Shirley returns to Boſton, to prepare for the Northern Expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> Mr. Shirley began his journey to Boſton, to prepare for the expedition under his immediate command; to forward that under Col. Johnſon; and to quicken the departure of the New England troops, now aſſembled by his Majeſty's directions, for reducing the French ſettlements in Nova Scotia. On his way, he ſpent ſome time in conference with Col. Schuyler, a gentleman of fortune and courage, who, out of diſintereſted love to his country, was engaged to head a regiment of 500 men, raiſed and maintained by the province of New Jerſey. In New York, he was retarded a few days to conſult with General Johnſon, and remove ſome objections made by Mr. De Lancey to the form of his commiſſion:
<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr Johnſon had his commiſſion from the governors of the provinces, which furniſhed the troops under his command; the draft of which was ſettled at Alexandria. The Lieut Governor of New York now thought proper to repeat thoſe very objections, which had been there over-ruled. This unaccountable conduct gave Mr. Johnſon great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs, who could not obtain Mr. De Lancey's commiſſion, till pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per notice was taken by General Shirley of ſo manifeſt an obſtruction to the operations of the campaign.</note> and in Connecticut, to haſten the aſſembling the troops of that colony
<note n="†" place="bottom">Connecticut had voted one thouſand men for the Crown Point expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and given aſſurances of 500 more, if the ſervice ſo required. New York was to ſupply 800; but thro' the delay occaſioned by the ſuſpending clauſe above men ſoned in the vote of our aſſembly, Mr. De Lancey's brother was ſent into Connecticut, to obtain leave for recruiting the quota we were to furniſh, in that colony; as men might there be raiſed more ſpeedily than in the province of New York.

This, with Mr. Oliver De Lancey's declaration — that if himſelf ſhould accept the command of the New York regiment, he could in ten days raiſe the whole number in this province, induced Mr Shirley to oppoſe the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication; it appearing to him not improbable, that the ſervice might afterwards require the reinforcement offered. In conſequence of which, only 300 recruits were furniſhed New York from thence — A lucky incident for M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

THE neceſſary diſpatches being given to the expedition to Nova Scotia under Col. Winſlow, Mr. Shirley, upon the arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of the paymaſter for the northern diſtrict, returned to New York;
<note place="margin">And ſails for Alba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</note> and on the 4th of July ſailed for Albany, his own Regiment having paſſed by for that place, in twenty-one tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſports, a few days before.</p>
               <p>ABOUT this time,
<note place="margin">Nova Scotia re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.</note> the colonies were filled with univerſal joy, on the agreeable news that the New England troops were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come maſters of Beau-ſejour and Bay Verte, on the iſthmus of Nova Scotia; whereby a new province was added to the Britiſh empire in America: and that a ſtrong fleet, under Admiral Boſcawen, lay before Louiſburgh, to intercept the French ſupplies; and which had alſo ſeized two of their capital ſhips, the Lys and Alcide, and ſent them into Halifax.</p>
               <p>GENERAL BRADDOCK was now on his march towards the Ohio,
<note place="margin">Braddock marches from Fort Cumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</note> at the head of about 2200 men, in order to inveſt Fort Du Queſne, and drive the French from their encroachments on the frontiers of Virginia and Penſylvania. From Fort Cumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land to Fort Du Queſne, the diſtance is not leſs than 130 miles. Mr. Braddock began his march from the former on the 10th of June; leaving the garriſon under the command of Col. Innes. Innumerable were the difficulties he had to ſurmount, in a country rugged, pathleſs, and unknown, acroſs the Allegheny mountains, thro' unfrequented woods, and dangerous defiles. From the little meadows the army proceeded in two diviſions. At the head of the firſt, conſiſting of 1400 men, was the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral himſelf, with the greateſt part of the ammunition and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery. The ſecond, with the proviſions, ſtores, and heavy bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, was led by Col. Dunbar. Never was man more confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of ſucceſs, than this brave, tho' unfortunate officer. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing adviſed at the great meadows, that the enemy expected a reinforcement of 500 regular troops, he puſhed on by forced
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:008163_0029_102E40F36F354BF0"/>marches, with ſo much diſpatch, that he fatigued the ſoldiers, weakened his horſes, and leſt his ſecond diviſion near 40 miles in the rear. The enemy being not more than 200 ſtrong at their fort on the Ohio, gave no obſtruction to the much of our forces, till the memorable 9th of July — a day never to be forgotten in the Annals of North America. About noon our troops paſſed the Monagahela, and were then within ſeven miles of Fort Du Queſne. — Unapprehenſive of the approach of an enemy, at once was the alarm given, by a quick and heavy fire upon the vanguard, under Lieut. Col. Gage. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately the main body, in good order and high ſpirits, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to ſuſtain them. Orders were then given to halt, and form into battalia. At this juncture the van falling back upon them, in great confuſion, a general panic ſeized the whole body of the ſoldiery; and all attempts to rally them proved ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly ineffectual. The general and all the officers exerted their utmoſt activity, to recover them from the univerſal ſurprize and diſorder: but equally deaf were they to intreaties and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. During this ſcene of confuſion, they expended their ammunition in the wildeſt and moſt unmeaning fire. Some diſcharging their pieces on our own parties, who were advanced from the main body for the recovery of the cannon. After three hours ſpent in this melancholy ſituation, enduring a terrible ſlaughter, from (it may be ſaid) an <hi>inviſible</hi> foe, orders were given to found a retreat, that the men might be brought to cover the waggons. Theſe they ſurrounded but a ſhort ſpace of time: for the enemy's fire being again warmly renewed from the front and left flank, the whole army took to imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate flight; leaving behind them all the artillery, proviſions, ammunition, baggage, military cheſt, together with the general's cabinet, containing his inſtructions and other papers of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. So great was the conſternation of the ſoldiers, that it was impoſſible to ſtop their career, flying with the utmoſt precipitation three miles from the field of action; where only one hundred began to make a more orderly retreat.</p>
               <p>WHAT was the ſtrength of the enemy, has hitherto remained to us uncertain. According to Indian accounts, they exceeded not 400, chiefly Indians: and whither any were ſlain, is ſtill to be doubted, for few were ſeen by our men, being covered
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:008163_0030_102E40BDD1964DD8"/>by ſtumps and fallen trees. Great indeed was the deſtruction on our ſide. — Numbers of officers ſacrificed their lives thro' ſingular bravery. Extremely unfortunate was the whole ſtaff. The general, after having five horſes ſhot under him received a wound in his lungs thro' his right arm, of which he died in four days. His Secretary, eldeſt ſon of Major General Shirley, a gentleman of great accompliſhments, by a ſhot thro' the head, was killed upon the ſpot. Mr. Orme and Capt. Morris, aid-de-camps, were all wounded. Of the 44th regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Sir Peter Halket, Colonel, was ſlain, with ſeveral other officers; and Lieut. Col. Gage wounded. Lieut. Col. Burton, of the 48th regiment, was among the wounded; and many gallant officers periſhed in the field. Our whole loſs was about ſeven hundred killed and wounded.</p>
               <p>To what cauſes this unhappy cataſtrophe is to be aſcribed,
<note place="margin">To what cauſes the defeat was aſcribed</note> has been matter of much inquiry and animated debate. The officers charged the defeat to the cowardice of the men: but, in a repreſentation they made to Mr. Shirley, by order of the Crown, they in ſome meaſure apologize for their behaviour— alledging, that they were harraſſed by duties unequal to their numbers, and diſpirited thro' want of proviſions: That time was not allowed them to dreſs their food: That their water (the only liquor too they had) was both ſcarce and of a bad quality: In fine, that the provincials had diſheartned them, by repeated ſuggeſtions of their fears of a defeat, ſhould they be attacked by Indians; in which caſe the European method of fighting would be intirely unavailing. But, my Lord, however cenſurable the conduct of the ſoldiery may be thought, Mr. Braddock, too ſanguine in his proſpects, was generally blamed for neglecting to cultivate the friendſhip of the Indians, who offered their aſſiſtance; and who, it is certain, had a number of them preceded the army, would have ſeaſonably diſcovered the enemy's ambuſcade. The Virginian rangers alſo, inſtead of being made to ſerve as regulars is the ranks with the Engliſh troops, ſhould have been employed as out ſcouts. But this ſtep, ſo neceſſary to guard againſt ſurprize, was too unhappily omitted; the whole army, according to the repreſentation above mentioned, following only <hi>three or four guides.</hi>

               <p>ALBANY, my Lord, was the grand theatre of all the prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations for the northern expedition againſt Fort St. Frederick, as well as that to the weſtward for the reduction of Niagara. The general, on his arrival there, found not the former in the forwardneſs he had reaſon to expect. The provincials diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with the inactivity of a long encampment, Major Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Lyman was obliged to make ſhort marches, to prevent their diſbanding;
<note place="margin">Is detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bany.</note> and the general was therefore detained awhile in that city, to hinder ſo fatal an event. His own troops in the mean time were filing off, in different diviſion, from She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nectady, towards Oſwego.</p>
               <p>OSWEGO, along the accuſtomed route,
<note place="margin">Route to Oswego.</note> is computed to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 300 miles weſt from Albany. The firſt ſixteen to the village of Shenectady, is land carriage, in a good waggon road. From thence to the Little Falls, in the Mohawk River, at ſixty-five
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:008163_0032_102E40BF58C746E8"/>miles diſtance, the battoes

At the battle Falls, the portage ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds not a mile; the ground being marſhy will admit of no wheel-carriage, and therefore the Germans who reſide here, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the battoes in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Taking water again, we enter a narrow rivulet, called the Wood-creek, which leads into the Oneida Lake, diſtance forty miles. This ſtream, tho' favourable, being ſhallow, and its banks covered with thick woods, was at this time much obſtructed with old logs and fallen trees. The Oneida Lake ſtretches from eaſt to weſt about thirty miles, and in calm weather is paſſed with great facility. At its weſtern extremity opens the Onondaga River, leading down to Oſwego, ſituated at its entrance on the ſouth ſide of the Lake Ontario. Extremely difficult and hazardous is the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage thro' this river, as it abounds with rifts and rocks; and the current flowing with ſurprizing rapidity. The principal ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction is twelve miles ſhort of Oſwego, and is a fall of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout eleven feet perpendicular.

OSWEGO was formerly garriſoned by twenty five men; but on the commencement of our preſent diſputes, the number was augmented to fifty. Early this ſpring fifty more were ordered up: and about the latter end of May, Capt. Broadſtreet arrived there with 200, beſides workmen to be employed in the naval preparations, purſuant to the ſcheme concerted in the congreſs of commiſſioners at Albany the laſt ſummer.</p>

Great numbers of the battoe-men diſperſed themſelves into the country, and fled to their reſpective habitations. To engage the return of above half the fugitives, equally ineffectual were threats or promiſes, rewards or puniſhments. The general, however, ſenſible of the importance of the ſervice, purſued his march in ſpite of every vexatious diſappointment. As he paſſed their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, he called upon the Indians of the Six Nations at ſome of their caſtles; and ſent embaſſadors to the reſt, preſſing them to join him, with aſſurances of his protection.

<note place="margin">Anecdote of John<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſon and Shirley.</note> Mr. Johnſon laid before him a copy of the minutes of his late treaty with the Indians. Theſe minutes, it ſeems, contained ſome unhandſome reflections upon his excellency; inſinuating, that to treat ſeperately with them, he had employed one Lydius, a perſon of not the moſt unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptionable character, either for loyalty or integrity. The ſingle reaſon upon which the ſurmiſe could be founded was this. Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius, who formerly lived near Lake George, and whoſe Indian acquaintance was very extenſive, had offered the general his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, in procuring the junction of a number of them, on the deſigned expeditions. Upon which he wrote to Mr. John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, intimating the pleaſure it would give him, if he could make any uſe of this man in his Majeſty's ſervice. On delivering thoſe minutes into the general's hands, Johnſon, ſenſible of the inſinuation, told him, he intirely diſapproved the reflection they ſeemed to contain, and appeared aſhamed of its inſertion. Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing peruſed the paper, Shirley could not avoid complaining of the ill uſage; while the other with ſolemn vows proteſted, he was not privy to it, and importuned him to return the minutes, that he might eraſe the obnoxious paſſage.

In ſupport of a charge ſo heavy as this, I think it incumbent upon me to aſſign the following inſtances: 1. Not an Indian joined General Shirley at Schenecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, agreeably to Mr. Johnſon's poſitive aſſurances. 2.

Tho' this appeared utterly incredible, 'tis nevertheleſs certain, 4. ſeveral other Indians arrived from the Onondaga caſtle, with a belt, declaring it to have been ſent them by Mr. Johnſon, with his requeſt, that not a man of them would join the King's troops, under the command of General Shirley. 5.

From himſelf came all their intelligence, and hence undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly none in his own disfavour. During theſe golden days of ſecurity and repoſe, he reſigned himſelf to pleaſure, and indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his natural diſpoſition to voluptuouſneſs and eaſe. The province, the mean while, was principally governed by his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary; who like a ſecond Atlas, bore the chief burden of the ſtate. Thus negligent of his politics, his popularity began to ſuffer a manifeſt declenſion.

<pb n="42" facs="unknown:008163_0040_102E40CA745B84C8"/>and a ſelect juncto, to paſs the evening with him, in order to conciliate his graces, and give him early impreſſions in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of their party. The next day, the governor publiſhed his commiſſion; and was, by Mr. De Lancey, invited to a public entertainment. In the evening they conducted him to the common, to hear the acclamations of the people; and on every occaſion, followed him with ſervile court and adulation. To impreſs a high ſenſe of his predeceſſor's popularity, they ſpared no pains. For this purpoſe alſo they intrigued with the aſſembly, and city corporation, two elective bodies, and thence under his influence. Of the latter, Mr. Oliver De Lancey, as alderman, was a member; and, with true fraternal affection, ſtimulated the board to inſert in their addreſs a compliment to his brother. A modeſt motion, my Lord! and ſo vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently urged, that it was carried, tho' not without ſome op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.

The addreſs was calculated to ſecure De Lancey's power both with governor and people: the former, by diſplaying to Sir Charles his formidable intereſt in that houſe: the latter by preventing a diſſolution; than which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was the object of greater dread. <q>

               <p>MAJOR GEN. LYMAN, being advanced with the troops to the Carrying-Place, about 60 miles from Albany, was waiting the arrival of General Johnſon, who ſet out from thence on the 8th of Auguſt, with the train of artillery.

Johnſon, with the main body, moved forward 14 miles more northerly, and pitched his camp at the ſouth end of Lake George, before called St. Sacrament. By ſome Indians, who had been ſent out as ſcouts, he received the following ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices: — That they had diſcovered a party of French and Indians at Tinonderoge, ſituate on the iſthmus between the north end of Lake George and the ſouthern part of Lake Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To have ſecured this paſs, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the route to Crown Point thro' the Lake, had been a meaſure extremely adviſeable. Mr. Johnſon, informed of its importance, on the 1ſt of September wrote to Gen. Shirley, that he was impatient to get up his battoes; propoſing then to proceed with part of the troops, and ſeize upon that paſs. The French however took advantage of the delay, and cut out work enough for him at his own camp.</p>

<note n="‖" place="bottom">Our artillery was got up to the camp from Fort Edward but a day or two before the action, of which the French had no intelligence.</note>. Thus diſappointed in his principal deſign, he changed his route, and began to move againſt the main body at the Lake. Gen. Johnſon,

Inſtead of any attempt to diſcover the ſtrength of the guard left with their battoes at the South Bay, which might eaſily have been cut off, a council of war reſolved the next morning to detach 1000 men, with ſome Indians, to fall upon, or, as Mr. Johnſon expreſſes it in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

ABOUT an hour after Williams's departure, a heavy fire was heard;

Upon this he ſent out a reinforcement to ſupport them; which was very judiciouſly conducted on the death of Williams, by Lieut. Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel Whiting, a Connecticut officer, who gained much applauſe at the reduction of Louiſburgh. Gen. Johnſon informs the governors, <q>
                     <hi>That about half an hour after eleven the enemy appeared in ſight, and marched along the road in very regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar order, directly upon our center: That they made a ſmall halt, about</hi> 150 <hi>yards from the breaſt-work, when the regular troops made the grand and center attack; while the Canadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and Indians ſquatted and diſperſed on our flanks.</hi>
                  </q> This halt was the baron's capital error: for, amidſt the conſterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at the camp, had he cloſely followed up the detachment, he had eaſily forced their lines, and gained a complete victory. But by continuing for ſome time a platoon fire, with little exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution at that diſtance, our men recovered their ſpirits. As ſoon as the artillery began to play, Dieſkau and his regulars found themſelves totally deſerted by the militia and ſavages, who all ſkulked into the ſwamps, took to trees, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a ſcattered fire upon our flanks, for ſome time, with variable and intermitting briſkneſs.

A party from the camp followed him, fell upon his rear, diſperſed the remaining ſoldiers about him, and being himſelf wounded in the leg, was found reſting on a ſtump, utterly abandoned and deſtitute of ſuccour. Feeling for his watch, to ſurrender it, one of our men, ſuſpecting him in ſearch of a piſtol, poured a charge thro' his hips; of which wound he is not yet recovered. Upon his retreat, the militia and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians retired in ſmall parties: and as the Engliſh neglected to continue the purſuit, they halted about four miles from the camp, at the very place where the engagement happened in the morning. Opening their packs for refreſhment, they here entred into conſultation, reſpecting a ſecond attack. Why the enemy was not purſued, when their retreat became general, no tolerable reaſon has ever yet been aſſigned; and Mr. Johnſon,

                  </q> I queſtion, my Lord, whether the whole circle of hiſtory affords a ſingle inſtance of an army's rallying, after the ſlaughter of 1000 men (his own computation) out of about 1800, the whole force of the enemy. And whence he conjectured they had any reinforcements ſo near at hand, as not to be able to join their routed detachment, ſtill remains one of thoſe arcana of ſtate, which, by common underſtandings, is not to be fathomed: or, if the French conſiſted of 200 grenadiers, 800 Canadians, and 700 Indians (the baron's account to the general) ſo great a ſlaughter as is pretended by the letter, with the loſs of the greateſt part of the principal officers, and Monſ. St. Pierre, who had the chief command and influence over the Indians, muſt have reduced them to leſs than 800. From theſe, one would have imagined, there was no danger of a ſecond attack. Fat more probable was it, that for ſo momentous an enterprize as the reduction of the forts before-mentioned, the French had muſtered all the Forces they could ſpare from Crown Point and Tinonderoge, where mary of the regular troops were poſted; eſpecially, as they went unfurniſhed with cannon. A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This, if ſuch were the facts, was a glorious opportunity to diſpoſſeſs them of Tinonderoge. But the longer they were ſuffered to fortify, the more arduous the taſk to diſlodge them, and the greater the loſs of our preſent advantage, reſulting from their defeat and our ſucceſs.

                  </q> I wonder whither this gentleman expected to reduce Crown Point without being expoſed to the French artillery. But whence this ſurmiſe of a more formidable attack, he thinks not proper to communicate. It was well known, the whole force ſent from France amounted to about 3000: — that of theſe, admiral Boſcawen took eight companies, and 1000 were in garriſon at Louiſbourgh. Admitting therefore that all the reſt arrived at Quebec, without any loſs, (a favourable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion) the utmoſt amount that reached Canada was about 1700; of which 500 were at Cadaraqui: ſo that, without any allowance for thoſe killed at the camp, or in the mock purſuit which enſued, the whole number of regulars that arrived with Dieſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kau, and could come againſt him, but little exceeded 1100. The gentleman proceeds — <q>
                     <hi>The late Col.

                  </q> And if indeed he thought Crown Point impregnable by the army then under his command, above 4000 ſtrong, he muſt neceſſarily conclude it would be found ſo the next year, by double the number: and if then attempted thro' another route, his grand fortreſs at the end of the Lake was abſolutely uſeleſs. Nor would it prove any defence to the country between Lake George and Hudſon's River, while the French could penetrate it by two other more uſual paſſages, the South Bay and Wood-Creek; thro' the former of which they had actually marched to his camp. And as to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable attack with artillery, whence could they bring it, but from Crown Point? And if they learnt he intended, in the preſent campaign, nothing beyond building a ſtockaded fort, that very intelligence was ſufficient to induce them to attack the camp with cannon; againſt which, I am confident, his fort would make but a very indifferent reſiſtance. But, in reality, 'twas moſt probable they would exert their efforts in ſtreng<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<note place="margin">Shirley abſurdly cenſured.</note> to excuſe this favourite general, the blame of not following his advantage, has been throne on Mr. Shirley, and attributed to his poſitive directions. Beſides the abſurdity of the accuſation, that he could be acceſſory to an omiſſion of this nature, it was abſolutely impoſſible for him to know whether the enemy would at all risk an attack. Your Lordſhip will conſider, the general was then at leaſt 365 miles from the place of action, nor adviſed of it till nine days after it happened. But when he received the intelligence, ſo far from directing to the inactivity of a merely defenſive conduct, that he diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed repeated expreſſes to Mr. Johnſon, urging him in the moſt preſſing terms, to purſue the advantage already obtained; and if unable to proceed in perſon, to commit the charge of the troops to Major Gen. Lyman: or, if he found it impracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to inveſt Crown Point that ſeaſon, at leaſt to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf maſter, if poſſible, of the enemy's advanced poſt at Tinon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deroge. — But all was ineffectual: the laurel being already ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, fortune was not again to be put to a deſperate venture.</p>
               <p>WE will now, if your Lordſhip pleaſes, return to Oſwego, where General Shirley arrived the 21ſt of Auguſt, and take a view of the courſe of his proceedings in that quarter.</p>

He thought proper to inform them of his intelligence concerning the ſituation and ſtrength of the enemy — which was to this purpoſe — That before he left the Oneida Carry-Place, two truſty Indians, with as many Albany traders, were ſent as ſpies to Niagara; who, after fourteen days abſence, returned with an account — That the Indians had been two days in the French fort there, which was built partly of ſtone, but principally of logs, being in a weak and ruinous condition — that the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon conſiſted of about 60 French and 100 Indians, who ſaid they had for ſome time expected 900 Indians and a quantity of ſtores from Canada; but were apprehenſive their veſſels were taken — that letters came in frequently from Fort Du Queſne, whence alſo they expected a conſiderable reinforcement. The ſpies added, that the Indians were diſguſted at the diviſion of the ſpo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="56" facs="unknown:008163_0054_102E411396F3DEA8"/>many Engliſh ſcalps, with a large quantity of cloaths and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture — that the French had there 70 or 80 large battoes, with which they intended to meet and board our veſſels: and this article was confirmed by another Indian, who ſet out after the ſpies, and meeting one of our row gallies, cautioned the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander againſt a nearer approach to Niagara.</p>
               <p>HIS EXCELLENCY alſo informed the council, that an Indian ſpy had been with the Outawawas, who aſſiſted the French in the action at Monongahela — that they had declared their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to lay down the hatchet; and that others more weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly gave the like intimations; which had induced him to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch four meſſengers with belts of wampum, to invite them into our alliance, or at leaſt to engage their neutrality.</p>
               <p>UPON the general's arrival at Oſwego, he thought it neceſſary to procure intelligence from Frontenac; and for that purpoſe ſent out a party of white men and Indians, who returned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the 8th of September, with information — that they land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon an iſland, about ſix furlongs from the fort, from whence they had a full view of it — that it was built in a bay, near the edge of the water, and ſurrounded by a ſtone wall; the land behind it cleared, and riſing in a gradual acclivity — that two veſſels, of about 40 tons each, lay moored in the harbour, unrigged, and without guns — that at the eaſt end of the fort there was a regular encampment, and ſix marquis tents; from the extent of which they imagined it contained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 3 or 400 men. — Upon the ſide of the bay, oppoſite the fort, the land projected about half a mile: between this and the iſland they were upon was another little iſland, about three quarters of a mile from the fort, inhabited by about twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Indian families. The ſpies added, that there were ſeveral other adjacent iſlands; but they diſcovered no battoes. His ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency farther acquainted the council, that an Indian that came to Oſwego about the time of his arrival, and had left Fronte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nac nine days before, declared there were 30 French within the fort; a conſiderable quantity of powder, and many guns mounted on the ſurrounding wall, which was about ſix feet thick; and the encampment without conſiſted of 600 ſoldiers. The information of Redhead, to the ſame effect, was alſo laid before
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:008163_0055_102E415316EB8DC0"/>the council, with the addition — that there were two encamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, one of Canadians, and the other of regulars, in a hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, indiſcoverable from the iſland; and that he was told by the commandant, of a much larger number of troops ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected with the general, lately arrived from France; when they propoſed to inveſt Oſwego.

                  </gap>tter of the 1ſt of September, ſignifying, that his ſcouts informed him of the departure of 300 canoes to Frontenac, was alſo conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and from theſe articles of intelligence — the account of the arrival of the French troops — the ſuſpenſion of all intercourſe between Frontenac and Niagara — and their lying ſtill ſo long at the former; his excellency obſerved, it was not improbable their deſign might be to make a deſcent on Oſwego, if the whole force proceeded on the expedition to Niagara, which was about 150 miles to the weſtward; and from whence, at that advanced ſeaſon, they could not return in leſs than 30 days. That this was the more probable, as Oſwego was of the greateſt importance for ſecuring the frontiers of the weſtern colonies, maintaining the Britiſh dominion over the great lakes, and the country beyond the Apalachean mountains. He alſo took notice of the defenceleſs ſtate of Oſwego, which would render it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to leave a ſtrong garriſon there: that the number of ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectives at that time in the three regiments and independent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, including ſerjeants and corporals, amounted to 1376; and that the irregulars, who were Albany men and Indians, procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by his own emiſſaries, conſiſted only of 120. For the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſecurity of the place, the general had ordered to be built, with all poſſible diſpatch, a ſtrong wooden fort, capable of moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting cannon, with pickets and a ditch, on a high point, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the old fort on the eaſt ſide of the river. This he obſerved was already begun, and would ſoon be compleated: and that for the propoſed enterprize, he had built and equipped a ſloop and ſchooner of ſixty tons each, two row-gallies, each of twenty tons, with eight whale-boats, each capable of carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſixteen men. He then informed them of his intention to embark for Niagara, as ſoon as the expected convoy arrived, with 600 regulars, including gunners and matroſſes, beſides the Albany and Indian irregulars, one 18 pounder, four 12 pounders, a ten-inch mortar, a ſeven-inch hoyet, two royals, and five ſmall ſwivel-hoyets, the veſſels, whale-boats, and a competent number
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:008163_0056_102E411625185E50"/>of battoes; leaving behind him 700 effectives, two 12 pounders, ten 6 pounders, ſix 3 pounders, and eight cohorns.</p>
               <p>THE council, upon this repreſentation, were unanimouſly of opinion, in anſwer to the ſeveral queſtions propoſed, that the force intended for the Niagara expedition was ſufficient: but with reſpect to Oſwego, ſome imagined it would not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſible: the majority, however, were of contrary ſentiments. All agreed, that a feint upon Frontenac, while his excellency was gone to Niagara, was by no means adviſeable. They univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally concurred in opinion, that a fort ought to be erected on the weſt ſide of the old fort: and that it would be for his Majeſty's ſervice to prepare materials for building one or more veſſels, larger than any of thoſe already upon the lake, capable of mounting ten 6 pounders, beſides ſwivels, two more row-gallies, and a 100 good whale-boats.</p>
               <p>IN conſequence of this advice,
<note place="margin">Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to proceed on the Niagara expedition</note> 600 regulars were draughted, the artillery and ordnance-ſtores ſhipped on board the ſloop On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tario, part of the proviſions on board the ſloop Oſwego, and the reſidue was ready for the row-gallies, whaleboats, and battoes. While theſe preparations were making, the weather was extremely wet and tempeſtuous. The rains began to fall ſo heavily on the 18th of the month, that on the beſt choſen ground the tents of the ſoldiers were overwhelmed. As 400 of the troops muſt have gone in open boats, it was impoſſible to paſs the lake with any ſafety, till the ſtorm abated; which was on the 26th of the month, when orders were immediately iſſued for the embarkation of the troops: but theſe could not be carried into execution. Tho' the rains ceaſed for a ſhort ſpace of time,
<note place="margin">Which could not be proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted from the bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> the weſtern winds began to blow with redoubled fury; and were again ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by continual rains for thirteen days together. During this boiſterous weather, numbers fell ſick, whoſe tents were an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient ſhelter: and the Indians, well acquainted with the cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, went off, declaring the ſeaſon too far advanced to admit of an expedition upon the lake.</p>
               <p>IN the midſt of theſe difficulties another council,
<note place="margin">Another council of war held.</note> conſiſting of the ſame members who compoſed the laſt, was called on the 27th of September. The general acquainted them with the unto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:008163_0057_102E4156B205B5B8"/>ſtate of affairs, and ſome of his lateſt advices. He ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved as follows — That the preceeding day, eight battoes were arrived, with 48 barrels of flour, and 13 of bread; ſo that there was then 14 days full allowance of thoſe ſpecies of proviſions for 2000, being the number then in his camp — That he thought it neceſſary to take with him 21,000 weight of bread and flour, which for 700 men, forty days, amounted only to three-fourths of the uſual allowance — that, in ſuch caſe, there would be leſt with the garriſon only 8000 weight of bread and flour, at half allowance for only 12 days: but, by advices received from the Carrying-Place and Mohawk River, he had the greateſt reaſon to expect ſuch a quantity of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, in a few days, as would be a full ſupply for ſome months— that a party of men with two officers, in whale-boats, ſent ſeven days before to Frontenac to diſcover the enemy's mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, were returned, with the following report — That they went into the harbour, and ſaw the fort, which appeared to be a regular ſquare faced with ſtone, having four embraſures in the front — that the encampment conſiſted of above 100 tents— that two brigantines of about 40 tons each, and a ſmall ſloop lying then at anchor, were rigged, and the ſails of one of them bent: and a number of battoes lay near the walls of the fort. He communicated to them alſo a copy of the orders and inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions given to the French regulars ſent thither; which were taken from baron Dieſkau, in the action at Lake George: whence it appeared, that ten companies of the Queen's battalion marched from Montreal to Cadaracqui, in two diviſions, upon the firſt and ſecond of Auguſt, together with 250 Canadians, excluſive of Indians: the number of men therefore at Frontenac, inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the garriſon, might amount to 1000 effectives, originally deſigned, as appears from thoſe papers, for an attack upon Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wego. He farther took notice of the departure of ſome of our Indians, and their unanimous opinion, that the attempt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Niagara could not ſucceed this ſeaſon: on which account the remainder were reſolved to return to their reſpective caſtles; giving nevertheleſs the higheſt aſſurances of their willingneſs to join us in much greater numbers in the ſpring—that the Albany tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders were of the ſame opinion, that the battoes, tho' well adapted for the navigation of ſmall rivers, could not live on the lake in ſuch tempeſtuous weather as had continued for a fortnight

His excellency informed them, he propoſed the erection of barracks, and a ſtrong redoubt on the hill, weſt of the old fort, before the winter was too far advanced.</p>

That there were then but few proper battoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men at Oſwego: nor could they be provided with a ſufficient number, as thoſe who underſtood the management of battoes were chiefly employed in the tranſportation of proviſions from Schenectady to Oſwego, and from Albany to Lake George; and that the ſoldiers were unable to conduct them to Niagara, the lake being turbulent generally five days in ſix.</p>
               <p>THE advice of the council, my Lord, was unanimouſly to this effect — That the arrival of the battoes with proviſions,
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:008163_0059_102E41583A9B47D8"/>tho' hourly expected, was by no means to be depended upon, there being ſcalping parties in the neighbourhood; one of which, ſince the laſt council of war, had actually killed three, and captivated two of the work-men employed in building the new fort on the eaſt ſide of the river: and the cutting off the battoes was the more to be apprehended, as the Indians in our alliance were now returning to their caſtles. Nor did they think it adviſeable to riſk the troops in battoes upon the lake, at ſo advanced a ſeaſon of the year. They approved his excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency's intention of raiſing barracks for the ſoldiers without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay; and thought the fort on the eaſt ſide of the Onon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daga River ought to be compleated as ſoon as poſſible; and again adviſed the erection of a work for mounting cannon on the eminence weſt of the old ſort — all which, in there opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, could not be effected before the winter was too far ſet in, without employing the whole ſtrength than at the place. They were alſo unanimouſly and clearly of opinion, that his excellency ought to defer any attempt on Niagara or Frontena<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, till the next ſpring; when they had great reaſon to expect the junction of a large body of the Six Nations, and ſome of the French allies, who had taken up the hatchet againſt the Engliſh, and were concerned on the banks of the Monongahela. Beſides, he might, in the enſuing campaign, have a greater number of troops, whale-boats inſtead of battoes, and a more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful naval force, which they conceived ought to be provided againſt the next ſpring.</p>
               <p>THIS advice, my Lord,
<note place="margin">Which was carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into execution.</note> the general proceeded immediately to carry into execution. Compleating the fort on the eaſt ſide of the river, was a matter of principal attention, becauſe ſituated on a high point of land, at 100 yards diſtance from the lake, commanding the ground round about it— the old fort at 450 yards diſtance — and the entrance of the harbour. Its circumference was 800 feet, being built of legs from 20 to 30 inches diameter, and the outer wall 14 feet high. Round it was to be a ditch 14 feet broad and 10 deep. Within, a ſquare log-houſe to overlook the walls, and barracks for 300 men. — This fort, called Ontario, was to mount 16 pieces of cannon. Another, called Oſwego, was immediately begun, upon an eminence 450 yards weſt of the old fort. It was a ſquare of 170 feet, with baſtion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, and a rampart of earth and maſonry;
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:008163_0060_102E411B399A9500"/>which, beſides the parapet, was to be 20 feet thick, 12 in height, with a ditch 14 feet broad and 10 deep. The barracks within were to contain 200 men. This was to mount eight pieces of cannon; being made the more defenſible, as it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded a good landing, diſtant 150 yards on the edge from the lake.</p>
               <p>WHILE theſe works were carrying on,

Others were ſent to foment the diſſaffection of the Outawawas, giſguſted at the French partition of the plunder, on Braddock's defeat. With the Senecas, the remoteſt from our ſettlements of all the five cantons, and therefore the moſt debauched by the French, he ſucceeded ſo well, that they now diſmiſſed Jon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<note place="margin">And re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns to Albany.</note> When nothing fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could be proſecuted, the general retired from Oſwego the 24th of October, leaving 700 men in garriſon, under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Lieut.

               <p>HAVING, my Lord, taken up too much of your time in a circumſtantial relation of the proceeding in this quarter, I ſhall not trouble you with any reflections upon them. Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip has ſeen the inſurmountable difficulties attending this weſtern expedition; and will doubtleſs approve our not hazarding the loſs of Oſwego.
<note place="margin">French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to cut off Oſwego.</note> That ſuch would have been the event, had Mr. Shirley left the place about the beginning of October, was wiſely foreſeen, from the advices he had received: and baron Dieſkau, juſt after the action at Lake George, aſſured a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman

Sir Charles Hardy, then at Albany, called in the militia: and a detachment of the regular troops, with a train of artillery, held themſelves in readineſs to march at a moment's warning. But another expreſs gave reaſon to believe thoſe apprehenſions were ill-grounded, and General Johnſon's fears in ſome meaſure abated.

                  </gap>nectady, conſiſting of about 150 houſes. The inhabitants are far from being indigent: the adjacent country
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:008163_0062_102E411DC7422398"/>abounds with proviſions; and in ſuch quarters, your Lordſhip is ſenſible, his Majeſty's troops <hi>will</hi> not want neceſſaries; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <hi>fuel,</hi> in a country covered with timber. Where then the probability, that the forces, which conſiſted of 1200, would ſuffer in a poſt like this? As to the affair of barracks, my Lord, there was a council held at New York, on the firſt of Auguſt, when the news arrived of Col. Dunbar's retiring into winter-quarters, after Braddock's defeat. It was compoſed of Mr. De Lancey the Lieut. Governor, Meſſ. Alexander, Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedy, Murray, Holland, Chambers, and Smith; and the opinion of that board then was, <q>
                     <hi>That not only the King's forces to the ſouthward, but elſe thoſe that could be ſpared from Nova Scotia, ſhould quarter near Albany, for any future operations.</hi>
                  </q> This reſolve Mr. De Lancey tranſmitted to the general at Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wego; and as Dunbar's troops were ordered to Albany, for the defence of that Country, and particularly to make a ſtand, in caſe the provincials were defeated; they had, methink, the higheſt reaſon to expect favour from the inhabitants, and the ſpecial countenance of the government, even had they been quartered upon them as uſual: and which at preſent is actually the caſe, by expreſs orders of my Lord Loudon. The general, I ſay, had no reaſon to expect, upon this head, any oppoſition from the civil magiſtrate. But Sir Charles Hardy, on his arrival at Albany, about the 26th of September, ſignified to him by letter, his apprehenſions of uneaſineſs ariſing among the inhabitants, ſhould the ſoldiers be quartered upon private families; and wiſhed to have his excellency's orders for building barracks, both there and at Schenectady; leſt his aſſembly ſhould not chuſe to put the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince to that charge. He alſo expreſſed his hopes, if ſuch an expence was ſaved them, of their greater readineſs to raiſe more men, ſhould the ſervice require it, the next campaign. The general's anſwer to this letter equally demonſtrated his integrity to the crown, and concern for the troops. He intimated his fears, that the conſtruction of barracks would be thought an extraordinary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence; but it being neceſſary for the ſervice, that Dunbar's, and the regiment of the late Sir Peter Halket, ſhould winter in Albany and Schenectady, he complied with Sir Charles's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt; and deſired him to provide barracks for thoſe regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with all poſſible diligence, that the troops on their arrival in his government, might not find themſelves deſtitute of quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:008163_0063_102E415FAD186B18"/>To relieve the crown in the expence, he farther took notice to Sir Charles, of the requeſt made by his own government for drawing theſe troops to Albany — that they would in a ſpecial manner cover the frontier of New York — be of ſervice to Oſwego in the enſuing ſpring — and that the inhabitants would draw very large ſums from their reſidence amongſt them. Nor did he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get to recommend an imitation of the Maſſachuſetts Bay; who thought it reaſonable to erect barracks for his own regiment tho' they knew their continuance among them would be ſhort, deſtined as they were for the weſtern expedition. But that there might be no delay in building the barracks, ariſing from any doubt of the expence being paid by the province of New York, Mr. Shirley informed Sir Charles, that if they would not, after theſe conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, take that expence on themſelves, he would defray it out of the contingent-money in the hands of the deputy pay-maſter. Thus, my Lord, if any ground for complaint of the want of barracks, Mr. Shirley 'tis clear was intirely unſenſurable: and if the troops, as this libeller informs us, did ſuffer in their tents,— I ſubmit it to your Lordſhip, whoſe province it was to have found them better quarters. But the fact is, that the barracks were finiſhed, and the troops quartered in them before the firſt of December, fuel provided for them ſufficient for the winter, and all at the expence of the crown.</p>
               <p>THE winter now approaching, commiſſioners were appointed by the governments concerned in the Crown Point expedition, to aſcertain their reſpective quotas for garriſoning the forts <hi>Edward</hi> and <hi>William-Henry,</hi> and diſbanding the reſt of the army. After this was compleated, the general and Sir Charles Hardy returned to New York; where the former convened a grand congreſs of governors and field officers, to deliberate on a plan for the operations of the ſucceeding campaign. But before I enter upon their tranſactions, I ſhall briefly lay before your Lordſhip thoſe between Sir Charles Hardy and his aſſembly; which was opened on the ſecond, and continued ſitting till the 23d of December.</p>
               <p>I HAVE already obſerved, that the miniſtry,
<note place="margin">Tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in New York between Sir Charles Hardy and his aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.</note> from the time of Mr. Clinton's departure in 1753, had been ſolicitous about procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the conſent of our aſſembly to a law eſtabliſhing a permanent proviſion for the governor, and other neceſſary officers. When Sir Danvers Oſborne arrived, he brought with him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> inſtruction for that purpoſe; from the terms of which it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> apparent that the
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:008163_0064_102E412291F36DB0"/>miniſtry had it much at heart; and Sir Danvers, before he left England, was made to believe that Mr. De Lancey, by means of his great popularity, would enable him to carry it into execution. This I had from a gentleman, to whom Sir Danvers opened himſelf, and whom he conſuited before his embarkation for his government. The gentleman is a perſon of the firſt figure in theſe colonies; and being acquainted with the ſyſtem of politics in New-York, he informed Sir Danvers, that thoſe promiſes were by no means to be depended upon: that Mr. De Lancey was inexpreſſibly jealous of his aſcendancy over the aſſembly, who were utterly diſinclined to a perpetual ſupport: that he would join in no meaſures that might weaken the confidence they repoſed in him: that as long as he maintained his influence in their counſels, he would virtually be the governor of the province; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore upon the whole, his intereſt and ambition would infallibly lead him to keep every governor in a ſtate of dependence upon him. Sir Danvers diſliked ſo diſagreeable a prediction; and many are of opinion, that its accompliſhment haſtened his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy fate. Excuſe me, my Lord, for troubling you with a relation of facts,
<note place="margin">Anecdote of Sir Danvers Oſborne.</note> a little out of the ſtrict order of time. There is an anecdote of Sir Danvers, of which I would not have your Lordſhip uninformed. He arrived here on the 7th of October, 1753, under very diſcouraging apprehenſions of the people; and indeed not without reaſon, the oppoſition againſt Mr. Clinton having been carried beyond all decorum. Governor Oſborn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>'s commiſſion, thro' Mr. Clinton's abſence, remained unpubliſhed till the third day after his arrival. This is uſually done, firſt privately in the council-chamber; and immediately after, in the moſt public manner at the city-hall. To wait on his excellency thither, Mr. Clinton came abroad; an aſtoniſhing crowd being aſſembled at the Fort Gate, to attend the proceſſion. Mr. Clin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton's enemies were very aſſiduous in exciting the popular accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations; and the huzzas of the mob were ſcarce intermitted for a moment. There appeared, in ſhort ſuch a profuſion of joy, accompanied with ſome indecent expreſſions reſpecting himſelf, as gave Mr. Clinton juſt reaſon to ſuſpect more open indignities. He therefore ſoon took his leave of Sir Danvers, who expreſſed his diſpleaſure at the conduct of his enemies. This, my Lord, proved a day of general feſtivity and Bacchanalian frolic. In the evening, the city was illuminated: the common blazed
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:008163_0065_102E41613704FDD0"/>with bonfires: great was the conſumption of Madeira; and every company rung with maledictions againſt the late com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in chief, who was charged as the ſole procurer of the new inſtruction; an account of which could only have tranſpired from ſome of the council. Sir Danvers alone appeared unaffec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with our intemperate revels; and on his countenance ſat a melancholly gloom. He convened the council on Thurſday the eleventh of the month; and prayed their ſentiments on the probability of obtaining a permanent ſupport, according to his inſtructions. That the point was unattainable, they all delivered as their unanimous opinion. He then required the ſolution of the ſame queſtion from each member ſeverally; and ſtill from each received the ſame reply. Upon this, he turned himſelf about in apparent diſtreſs, uttered a deep ſigh, and reclining his head againſt a window, in a diſponding accent ſaid, <q>What then am I come hither for?</q> The next morning — But I deſiſt. This inſtruction, as your Lordſhip will be pleaſe to recollect, remained unrevoked all the time of his ſucceſſor: and 'tis natural to expect, that the people of this province were very inquiſitive whether it was continued to Governor Hardy—They were ſo. But Sir Charles did not follow the example of Mr. De Lancey, in laying his inſtructions before the aſſembly. The article relative to the ſupport has undergone, as I am credibly informed, very few alterations, and thoſe only in the preamble. That it was in ſubſtance the ſame, is evident from his ſpeech to the houſe, on the 3d of December, at the opening of that ſeſſion. His words are theſe: <q>

               <p>MR. CLINTON, my Lord,
<note place="margin">Their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour different from what it was in Clinton's time, and the reaſon.</note> aſked of this ſame aſſembly only a ſupport for five years and it was refuſed with indignation and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulence. Sir Charles here demands much more; and we ſee, that he is anſwered with the moſt commendable decency. To help your Lordſhip in accounting for this contradictory behaviour — Mr. De Lancey was bent upon expelling that governor from the province: and to gain his point, continually fomented the quarrel he himſelf excited. But Sir Charles was to be treated in a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent manner, and meaſures more lenient were to be purſued. An aſcendancy over him would enſure to his lieutenant many advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages; and enable him to procure the governor's aſſent to a bill, for paying him a large ſum, now due for his ſalary and other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſites, while he had the chief command. He might indeed, but durſt not paſs ſuch a bill himſelf, and therefore it was not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered. Accordingly, the houſe, at their very next meeting, ſent up a bill to the council, on the 4th of February, 1756, for paying the debts of the government; in which he was a creditor for near 4000 <abbr>l.</abbr> But of this I ſhall have occaſion to take more particular notice.

<pb n="71" facs="unknown:008163_0069_102E41644F74E8C0"/>to the River Chandiere, and proceed to its mouth, three miles diſtant from Quebec; and by dividing themſelves in ſmall parties along the banks of the river St. Lawrence, and deſtroying the ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered ſettlements there, keep that part of Canada in continual alarms.</p>
               <p>HE then obſerved, that if the ſeveral attempts upon Crown Point, the forts upon the lakes, and the Ohio, were not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted at the ſame time, very perilous might be the conſequences: That if in particular, while Frontenac and Niagara were attacked, no attempt was made againſt Crown Point, the whole force of Canada would march to oppoſe us; which would defeat the deſign, and require ſo large a body of troops, as to render the tranſportation of neceſſaries to Oſwego impracticable. So nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous an army might alſo march againſt Albany, as effectually to cut off the retreat of our forces, or at leaſt totally obſtruct their ſupplies: That ſhould, on the contrary, our whole ſtrength be deſtined for Crown Point, and the weſtern operations neglected; Oſwego, the grand object of the French, was in the utmoſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of falling into their hands. A loſs irreparable and beyond eſtimation — The loſs of the whole country down to Albany, with that of the Six confederate Nations; and to the French the acquiſition of an abſolute dominion on the lakes, and the whole ſouthern country.</p>
               <p>HIS EXCELLENCY finiſhed, with informing the council of his late intelligence — That the French were building three large veſſels, of ſuperior force to ours, in the harbour of Frontenac: and upon the whole prayed their advice.</p>
               <p>A PLAN ſo well digeſted, and ſo clearly ſtated,
<note place="margin">Which was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, with ſome little alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</note> required but little conſideration; and accordingly it was in the main unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly approved. The council adviſed the general, to give orders for building three or more veſſels at Oſwego. They were of opinion, that 10,000 men were neceſſary for the Crown Point expedition, and 6000 for that on Lake Ontario. The attempt againſt Fort Du Queſne, by the weſtern governments, 'twas thought would anſwer very good purpoſes, eſpecially in ſecuring the fidelity of the weſtern Indians. The feint againſt Quebec was approved, if it interfered not with the other expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions. The operations on Lake Ontario, they conceived ought to begin with the attack on Frontenac — and upon the whole, were of opinion — that an additional number of regular troops would be neceſſary for effectually recovering and ſecuring his Majeſty's rights and dominions on the continent.</p>

He earneſtly ſought an introduction to General Braddock; and Mr. Shirley did the office with great politeneſs. He was then juſt informed of his appointment to be lieut. governor of New Jerſey, and on that account preſſed for an admiſſion into the council. Mr. Shirley, in a very genteel manner, declined a taſk, which might give offence to the general; and if any reſolution tranſpired, draw himſelf into a ſnare<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This change of temper recommended him to Mr. De Lancey, who failed not to exaſperate the riſing reſentment: and now his oppoſition became open and unreſerved. Juſt at this juncture, arrived Sir Charles Hardy; and Mr. Shirley being then at Oſwego, your Lordſhip ſees how ſeaſonable their opportunity, for ſowing the ſeeds of prejudice in the breaſt of the new governor. I will not take upon me to ſpeak of their ſucceſs; but doubtleſs no miſrepreſentations were wanting to ſtrengthen the cabal. Yet no ſooner did the general arrive from Oſwego at Albany, where M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Pownal and De Lancey attended upon Sir Charles, than the former, diſſembling his enmity, laboured to procure his confidence, that he might pry into his ſecrets: but from previous intimations of his preſent diſpoſition, in a letter to a gentleman then near the general, he failed in that inſidious deſign. He could now no longer ſuppreſ his male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence, or conceal his recent connections; and therefore openly traduced the very man, to whom he was indebted for all his ſignificancy amongſt the provinces. My Lord, it is with reluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance I utter theſe things. But your Lordſhip is as determined to know every tranſaction which concerns the operations in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, as I am to diſcharge the office of a faithful hiſtorian. Truth is too ſacred to be violated either out of fear or favour; and whatever your Lordſhip may think of this gentleman, ſuch was his conduct. I knew him an avowed enemy to Mr. De Lancey, and to Mr. Shirley as ſanguine a friend. I have ſince known him to calumniate the latter, and applaud the former.

I can't think your information well groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; becauſe I am clearly of opinion, that office was extinguiſhed by his acceptance of the lieut. governor's commiſſion: and I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Mr. De Lancey will hardly venture to diſpute the matter with the crown. The main reaſon I go upon is, that thoſe two offices are incompatible. To make this plain to you, you muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand—that to every office there are duties annexed. The ſame perſon cannot exerciſe two offices, inconſiſtent with one another. One of them muſt therefore be loſt; becauſe as every office is</hi> pro bono publico, <hi>its uſe lies in the exerciſe of it: and the inferior office is that which is loſt; becauſe it is moſt for the public good, teat the officer ſhould hold the ſuperior office; as the law preſumes every man capable of the office which the King, who is the fountain of offices and honour, is pleaſed to confer upon him.

               <p>PERHAPS, my Lord, no higher evidence can be aſſigned of a man's influence, than ſuch a bold invaſion of his Majeſty's prerogative. Mr. De Lancey was determined not to loſe an office, which he knew to be the grand ſource of his popularity, and the main prop
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:008163_0078_102E413180664B80"/>of his power. For, whoever is chief juſtice of the province, unleſs a very device, muſt be the ſecond man in the government. Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor Hardy made no oppoſition to this large ſtride of ambition: and the other not long after, by his wonderful artifice, ſubjected him to his abſolute dominion. It was effected in the following manner — Your Lordſhip will be pleaſed to recollect,

                  <abbr>l.</abbr> 16 <abbr>s</abbr> and ſeveral other ſums were payable to his brother. It was in reality a bill for diſcharging the arrears due to the ordinary officers of the government. To render it the more palatable to the governor, proviſion was made for paying him alſo large ſums for preſents to the Indians, and the expences of his voyage to Albany, after the French repulſe at Lake George. When it came up to the council, it obtained a majority only by one voice: and of theſe, my Lord, two gentlemen, beſides lieut. gov. De Lancey, were themſelves intereſted in the bill. They were the puiſne judges of the ſupreme court, Meſſ. Horſemanden and Chambers, whoſe arrears of ſalary were now by the act to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged. Moſſ. Colden, Alexander, and Smith looked upon it, as a mean invaſion of the King's inſtructions, which, until they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned their ſeats at the council board, they were bound in honour to regard with ſacred punctuality. — It was beſides evidently par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial; no proviſion being made for other creditors, whoſe demands were indiſputable. They alſo conceived it derogatory to the digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of that board, to paſs an act, excluding themſelves from any knowledge of thoſe ſervices, for which the reſpective ſums were made payable. For theſe reaſons, among others, they oppoſed the bill; and prayed their diſſent might be entered, as a vindication of themſelves to his Majeſty<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>in his lieutenant, who had the bill much at heart; not only on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the large ſums thereby payable to himſelf and brother; but becauſe the paſſing it into a law, would be the fulleſt evidence of his aſcendancy over the governor; and if he could bring him
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:008163_0079_102E417442B4DB18"/>into diſgrace with the miniſtry, by leading him into a breach of inſtructions, it was plain he would have nothing to rely upon, but his own popularity. This was an important card, and to be ſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully played off. So indeed it was: and when I finiſh the ſtory, I am perſuaded your Lordſhip will entertain to very mean opinion of American politicians.—The ſpring was now advancing; and it became neceſſary to paſs a law for levying forces, not only to join the eaſtern colonies, on a new expedition againſt the French fortreſs at Crown Point, but for the protection of our weſtern frontiers, in conjunction with Pennſylvania and New Jerſey, which were become fields of blood, by the daily ravages of inhuman barbarians. The bill for this purpoſe originated with the aſſembly: and Mr. De Lancey, who was now cloſeting the members, was its principal conſtructor. When it came before the council on the 28th of March, that board immediately objected to it, according to his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations: and the governor declared, that if the council approved, he ſhould himſelf give it a negative. According to the tenor of this bill, the forces deſigned for the weſtern expedition were to ſerve but forty days, when the province of New Jerſey had ordained their quota, to be diſbandable by Mr. Belcher: and Sir Charles Hardy inſiſted, that the like confidence ought to be repoſed in his judgment. The two houſes now engaged themſelves in a diſpute, at a time when, of all others, every contention ſhould have been avoided. Mr. Oliver De Lancey, appointed by the houſe to provide the ſupplies for the regiment deſigned as our quota towards the Crown Point expedition, now gave orders to ſtop all farther preparations, an open rupture between the governor and aſſembly being daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected. The members began freely to ſpeak againſt him. The council laboured to procure an alteration of the bill — but all to no purpoſe. The principal thing aimed at, was the paſſing of the debt-bill: and a leading member in the houſe plainly intimated their deſigns to the governor. Doubtleſs your Lordſhip will won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der he did not diſſolve them with indignation. Believe me, my Lord, it would have been a ſtep, at this time, extremely unadviſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Forty days intermiſſion between the teſt and return of the writ of ſummons for the election of repreſentatives, being required by law; the public exigencies were too preſſing to admit of any delay. Mr. De Lancey knew all his advantages: and that Sir Charles Hardy might be at no loſs to conjecture that the houſe was now acting at his beck, nor himſelf under the neceſſity of
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:008163_0080_102E413309B24CC0"/>joining with the council againſt the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>bouring colonies in the mean time were urging the diſpatch of our preparations for opening the campaign. Reduced at length by theſe perplexities, he was obliged to ſend for his lieutenant, and gave him his promiſe to paſs the favourite bill for payment of the public debts. The houſe then privately took back the quota-bill; and after a few alterations, the council paſſed it on the 31ſt of March. To both of them Sir Charles gave his aſſent the following day: and they were enrolled among our laws. I leave this affair to your Lordſhip's own reflections; obſerving only, that from this period, the lieutenant governor's influence became more apparent than before — and that as it always was, ſo it will ever continue to be, his ruling paſſion, and the grand engine of his politics, to cruſh or controul the King's governors in this province.</p>
               <p>THE plan of operations,
<note place="margin">Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence from En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland.</note> concerted at New York in December, was a few days after tranſmitted to Sir Thomas Robinſon, to be laid before his Majeſty, for the royal approbation

The general very civilly thanked him fear the offer of his ſervice; but choſe rather to confide in Major Rutherford and Capt. Staats Mortis. Mr. Pownal followed ſoon after them to England.</note>. Upon the arrival of the firſt veſſels from Europe in April following, we were ſurpriſed with theſe remarkable articles of intelligence: That the action at Lake George had been magnified in England into an almoſt deciſive victory—that Mr Johnſon was advanced to the dignity of a baronet, and 5000 <abbr>l.</abbr> ſterling voted by the commons, as a farther reward for his great ſervices—that Eyres, his engineer, was raiſed to a majority—and Wraxal, his ſecretary to the command of a company. To crown, in fine, the utmoſt wiſhes of his adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries— that Mr. Shirley's conduct having been intirely diſappro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, his Majeſty had been pleaſed to remove him from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, <note place="margin">agreeable to Mr. Shir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley's ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, and why.</note> and appoint the right hon. the Earl of London general of all his forces in North America. Than theſe particulars, nothing could have been more pleaſing to the New York cabal; as they were ſhortly to reap the fruits of all thoſe calumnies of which they had been the original authors. A change of the general at once gratified their revenge and ambition, and facilitated the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of an affair earneſtly ſolicited, and greatly advancive of their intereſt.</p>

Mr. Shirley laid before them the minutes of the congreſs in Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and acquainted them with the ſtate of affairs.
<note place="margin">and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints them with the ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of affairs.</note> With reſpect to the weſtern expedition the naval force upon the lake conſiſted, he obſerved, of two veſſels of ten carriage-guns each; two row-gallies, each of ten ſwivels; and that he had three months before iſſued orders for building three other veſſels, one of eighteen, another of ſixteen, and a third of twelve carriage-guns. Beſides which, there would be 250 Whale-boats upon the lake, each of them capable of containing 16 men.

As there was a magazine of proviſions and ſtores at the Canajohary Falls, about 35 miles from Schenectady; his excellency propoſed poſting there 100 men out of thoſe forces: as many more at the German Flats, to ſecure another magazine, guard the portage, and convoy the proviſions thro' the Wood Creek: and as the fall near Oſwego occaſioned another ſmall portage, a fort was there alſo to be erected, for a garriſon of fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ty men at leaſt. It was, my Lord, of the greateſt moment to keep open the communication between Albany and our fort on the lake; his excellency was therefore intent upon raiſing four companies of ſixty privates each, to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in ſcouting along the paſſage, and harraſſing the French ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements between Frontenac and Montreal.</p>
               <p>THE general gave them alſo an account of the ſtrength of Oſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go, when he left it the laſt fall — adding, that he had ſent up Mr. M'Keller, the engineer in ſecond, and Mr. Sewer, a practiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner engineer, with orders to make ſuch additional works, as they ſhould think neceſſary for the ſecurity of that important poſt. And
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:008163_0082_102E4137EFAC6050"/>your Lordſhip will be pleaſed to take notice, that theſe orders were iſſued very early in March, before the Mohawk river was open; and that the engineers actually arrived at Oſwego in April. At theſe ſeveral garriſons were to be depoſited ſix months provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions for 7000; and he obſerved to the council, that for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, 200 whaleboats and 500 battoes had been diſpatched ſince the firſt of April from Schenectady. The remaining quantity would have been tranſported by the middle of July, had his deſigns been carried into execution.</p>
               <p>As to the provincial expedition, he informed them — that the troops voted by the ſeveral colonies amounted to 8800 men, inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the officers and garriſons at the ſorts Edward and William-Henry. One, or perhaps two hundred Indians might be expected to join them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> beſides a company which his excellency had raiſed, to harraſs the enemy upon lake Champlain, and procure intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of their motions in Canada; and three more, for the like ſervice, were intended to be choſen out of the whole force deſtined for Crown Point.</p>
               <p>ABOUT this time one Rogers, of New Hampſhire, capt. of a ranging company,
<note place="margin">Capt Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, an active of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer, gains intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence; of which the general informs the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.</note> gave repeated demonſtrations of his activity in the neighbourhood of Crown Point. He made many incurſions upon the enemy, fell on their ſcattered parties, and ſcarce ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to Fort William-Henry without ſcalps and priſoners. The general took particular notice of him; and he became ſingularly ſerviceable in procuring intelligence. By a cadet, whom he took on the 20th of May, we were informed, that the whole number of men at Fort St. Frederic, Tinonderoge, and at an advanced poſt, were 1100, compoſed of the regiments of Languedoc, the Queen's regiment, two companies of the colony troops, and the militia. Beſides theſe, there were Indians; but their numbers uncertain: that at Tinonderoge the French had twelve pieces of ordnance mounted, and carriages preparing for an additional number; but that the retrenchment at the advanced poſt was without any can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non. Theſe troops wintered at Montreal and Chambly; and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at the ſouth end of the lake about the middle of April, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing plentifully ſupplied with proviſions and mil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>tary ſtores.—Theſe intelligences the general laid before his council; and then obſerved that the 50th and 51ſt regiments, the four independent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, and the regiment of New Jerſey, were ſcarce a third part of the number of troops deſigned by the general plan for the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon Lake Ontario: that the provincials were alſo not only
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:008163_0083_102E417751A0E0E0"/>deficient of the complement thought neceſſary at the congreſs, but even of the number voted by the provinces concerned in the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize againſt Crown Point; and that it was impracticable, even with the junction of the 44th and 48th regiments, then at Albany, to carry on both the northern and weſtern expeditions at the ſame time: that he had no dependance upon the Indians of the Six Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; Sir William Johnſon being unable to procure ſcouting par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and that upon this account he propoſed raiſing four compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies for that ſervice.</p>
               <p>YOUR Lordſhip may hence obſerve, what reaſon the congreſs in December had for their opinion, that more troops were neceſſary for his Majeſty's ſervice in America. No reinforcements being yet arrived from England, for carrying the general plan into exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, the council were of unanimous opinion—that 1300 ought to be poſted at Oſwego, 50 at the Falls,
<note place="margin">Their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion and advice.</note> 200 at the Oneida Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying Place, 150 at the German Flatts, and as many more at the Conejohary Falls. They adviſed therefore, — that the 50th and 51ſt, and the New Jerſey regiments, the independents, and the North Carolina provincials (all which amounted to about 2000 men) ſhould be employed in that ſervice. The 44th and 48th regiments, with the colony troops, were thought ſufficient to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Crown Point. Accordingly, they recommended their junc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: adviſing, however, that the regulars ſhould continue for a time in their encampment at Albany. — The ranging companies, propoſed by the general, were highly approved; and the raiſing of others ſtrongly recommended. They alſo concurred with him in ſentiment — that a road ought to be made from the German Flatts to Oſwego: and declared, it appeared to them very neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to ſtrengthen Fort Edward, and erect another at the South Bay, The former was a depoſit for ſtores, and at the concurrence of all the routes from Crown Point to Albany. The latter would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the route taken by baron Dieſkan for his deſigned attack upon Fort Edward — a route thro' which incurſions were frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made upon our northern frontier. A fort at the South Bay was conceived requiſite, to cover our convoys of proviſions for the nothern expedition from the inſults of the enemy, who in flying parties infeſted the paſſage from Albany to

               <p>THUS I have ſhewn your Lordſhip the reaſons why the general plan continued to be unexecuted, till the ſitting of this laſt council of war. Mr. Shirley, however, in hopes of the arrival of the expected reinforcements, and loth to be diverted from his favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite deſigns upon Lake Ontario, continued to throw large quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities of proviſions and ſtores into Schenectady, and all the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazines between that place and Oſwego. This, it was ſuppoſed, was done to induce his ſucceſſor, from theſe ample ſupplies, to act upon this quarter; it being univerſally imagined, that Crown Point was now become the main object of the miniſtry. Till the arrival of General Webb on the 7th of June, this was only conjecture, and general report. The effects of the miſrepreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of American affairs in England, then became evident to all; for the ſtores laid in at Schenectady were now reconveyed to Albany for the nothern expedition; and freſh clamours excited againſt Mr. Shirley, for his ſupplies towards the weſtern operations. On the 15th of June,

               <p>THE whole force, of which General Abercromble now took the command, conſiſted of the 44th, 48th, 50th, and 51ſt regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, four independent companies, the New Jerſey regiment, four companies raiſed by the province of North Carolina, Otway's, and the Highland regiments
<note n="*" place="bottom">Theſe two regiments arrived with him, and conſiſted of about 900 men.</note>, and the provincial forces deſtined againſt Crown Point.</p>
               <p>INSTRUCTIONS had been given to Sir William Johnſon, to procure a large body of the Six Nations,
<note place="margin">Sir William Johnſon holds a conference at Onon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daga.</note>, to join in any attempt that might be made upon the Lake Ontario; and to engage 100 more, for the aſſiſtance of the provincial army. To effect which, he was then holding a conference with the deputies of the Six
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:008163_0085_102DD0649298D570"/>Cantons at Onondaga; from whence he was to proceed immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to Oſwego. Mr. Shirley had, beſides, raiſed a company of Indians from Stockbridge, to be employed in ranging the woods between Fort William-Henry and Montreal: and that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's ſervice upon Lake Ontaric might be free from the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, by which it hath been the year before greatly embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſed, he had inliſted 40 companies of battoemen, each of 50 men,

Theſe were put under the direction of Capt. Bradſtreet, an active vigilant officer, inured to the hardſhips to which that ſervice inevitably expoſed him. This, tho' one of the moſt judicious meaſures that could have been taken, was made the ſubject of low invective. The faction at New York laboured to repreſent it as a project to involve the Crown in a needleſs expence: but time has given the fulleſt evidence of the propriety of this ſtep; and <hi>proper</hi> it will appear to your Lordſhip, before the concluſion of this letter. General Shirley wiſely foreſaw, that the Indians of the Six Nations, whatever influence over them Sir William John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon might pretend, could not be engaged even to protect the King's troops in the paſſage thro' their own country; and that unleſs the communication was kept open to Oſwego, nothing could be effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon the Lake, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the garriſon itſelf preſerved from falling into the hands of the enemy. Accordingly,
<note place="margin">A ſmall poſt cut off in the Indian countrys</note> no ſooner did the ſpring open, than a little blockaded poſt, with 25 men, at the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying-Place, in the very center of the Oneida country, was cut off; the Oneidas themſelves being unqueſtionably concerned in the maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacre. Nothing could ſecure us againſt the repetition of theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults, but paſſing through the country with large ſquadrons of battoes: and to facilitate the tranſportation, Mr. Shirley, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſſed every expedient for the preſervation of Oſwego, employed a working party of 80 men, under a director, to remove the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions in the Wood Creek; by this means, the portage from the Mohawks River, acroſs the great Carrying-Place, was reduced from eight miles to one. Nor did he omit obſerving to his ſucceſſor, that an attempt upon Niagara was of the laſt importance; the loſs or preſervation of our Indians depending upon the ſucceſs of the operations on Lake Ontario.</p>
               <p>RELATIVE to the Crown Point expedition, he recommended the march of part of the army, in a new diſcovered route, on the weſt ſide of Lake George, to the enemy's advanced works, five
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:008163_0086_102E413D08A53220"/>miles ſhort of Tinonderoge. Which being carried, the heavy ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery and ſtores might be there landed, and tranſported thro' a road to Tinonderoge and Fort Frederic: and after the reduction of thoſe fortreſſes, he adviſed General Abercrombie immediately to conſtruct armed veſſels, to ſecure the command of Lake Champlain.</p>
               <p>YOUR LORDSHIP may remember,
<note place="margin">Governor Sharpe's deſigned attempt on fort Du Queſne fails.</note> that an attempt was propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, at the congreſs in December, againſt Fort Du Queſne, with an army of 3000 provincials. Gov. Sharpe was to have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in that enterprize; but there remained now no hopes of its proſecution. Virginia choſe to be intirely upon the defenſive. — Maryland was wholly inactive; her frontier being covered by the adjoining provinces — and as to Penſylvania, ſhe raiſed indeed 1500 men, but only with a view to protect her out-farms; nor probably would thus far have conſulted her own ſafety, but for the daily murders and horrid cruelties perpetrated upon her borders.</p>
               <p>WITH reſpect to the circumſtances of Indian affairs to the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward — While Mr. Shirley was at Oſwego,
<note place="margin">Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Indian af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs to the north ward.</note> and upon his return, as I before obſerved to your Lordſhip, he propoſed to the Senecas, Cayugas, Onondagas, and Oneidas, the erection of ſmall forts for the protection of their reſpective caſtles. The two laſt tribes conſented, deſiring alſo, that the forts might be mounted with cannon: and the Tuſcoraras afterwards ſent deputies to him, with the like requeſt: — the Senecas and Cayugas had alſo lately ſignified their acquieſcence to Sir William Johnſon; and the general tranſmitted him the plan of a fort, directing the proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the work with all poſſible diſpatch, as a moſt effectual means to ſecure the Indian country to his Majeſty.</p>
               <p>BEFORE Mr. Shirley left Oſwego the laſt year, he propoſed to the Six Nations their convening this ſummer, in a grand council there, the Indians on the north ſide of lake Ontario, and round lake Erie, to conſult their common intereſt, and maintain a correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence by annual councils at Oſwego. And to draw off the latter from their attachment to the French, recommended to the Six Nations their concurrence, in opening a free trade with the foreign Indians, at the entrance of the Onondaga river, upon terms more advantageous to all the Indians than any hitherto purſued. This ſpring Sir William Johnſon informed his excellency, that the Six
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:008163_0087_102E417CC9B7C718"/>Nations were extremely well pleaſed with the projects relating both to the trade at Oſwego, and the conſtruction of forts in their can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons. To accelerate the latter, the general ſupplied him with 5000<abbr>l.</abbr> ſterling, in addition to 5000 <abbr>l.</abbr> advanced to him by General Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dock: and yet, my Lord, he was conſtrained to confeſs, in a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent<note n="*" place="bottom">10 May, 1756.</note> letter, that unleſs his excellency could engage ſeveral companies of rangers, he deſpaired of the preſervation even of a free paſſage thro' their country: and whether he has to this day built a ſingle fort, as the general propoſed, I have not been able, after much inquiry, to diſcover.</p>
               <p>EQUALLY unpromiſing was the ſituation of our affairs with the ſouthern Indians.
<note place="margin">Situation of our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires with the ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians.</note> Some hopes indeed were entertained of the fidelity of the Cherokees — a people warlike and powerful; in whoſe territories the Virginians were erecting a fortreſs. The Shawaneſe nevertheleſs continued their eruptions into that province: and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor Dinwiddie was obliged to draft the militia, to oppoſe their progreſs, and preſerve the town of Wincheſter. Theſe Indians al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, with the Suſquehanas and Delawares, committed frequent hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilities upon the Penſylvanians. Governour Morris, for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the country, carried a line of forts on the weſt ſide of the Kittatiny mountains, all along the extended frontier of that colony, from Delaware to the river Potowmac. The government of New Jerſey proceeded even to declare war againſt the Delaware Indians; and would have penetrated into their ſettlements, had not aſſurances been ſent by Sir William Johnſon from the council at Onondaga, that the Delawares and Shawaneſe, in obedience to the Six Nations, were under renewed and poſſitive engagements, to refrain from any farther outrages upon the ſouthern frontiers. If any ſuch promiſes were really made, 'tis certain they were immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately broken, many of our inhabitants having ſince been murdered and captivated by the ſavages of thoſe very tribes. Whence we may fairly conclude, that either the Six Nations connived at theſe infractions of their commands; or that their antient ſovereignty is become the contempt of their tributaries. In fact, my Lord, the matter is ſtill worſe. Too much reaſon is there to believe the truth of both theſe alternatives.</p>
               <p>I INFORMED your Lordſhip,
<note place="margin">Sir Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered.</note> that Sir William Johnſon was order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to proceed from Onondaga to Oſwego, with as many Indians
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:008163_0088_102E413F8E4D54C8"/>as could be perſwaded to march with him; not only for the more effectual preſervation of that poſt, but to execute the plan which Gen. Shirley had concerted, for the eſtabliſhment of an annual coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil there, with thoſe Indians who had been long in the French in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and ſeemed ready to liſten to propoſals for an alliance with us. It was expedient, my Lord, that he ſhould have complied with theſe inſtructions, nay it was his duty; but no ſooner was he acquainted with Mr. Shirley's reſignation of the command of the army, than he returned from Onondaga to Albany, at the head of about 60 Indians; leaving Capt. Patten with his company of gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadiers, to wander thro' a forlorn wilderneſs, in ſearch of Oſwego. Whether this inſtance of his conduct was not intended to raiſe his reputation with the new general, as a leading man among the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, I leave to your Lordſhip's conjecture. By arts like theſe, he acquired his Indian fame: and the influence of the faction at New York ſo powerfully ſuſtained it, that few perſons doubted his ability to procure ſeveral hundred warriors for our aſſiſtance, tho' every day exhibited freſh proofs of their melancholy defection. Beſides the deſtruction of our poſt in the very country of the One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>idas mentioned before, the enemy infeſted the parts about Oſwego, and the whole paſſage thither, without the leaſt oppoſition from the Six Nations. Alarms indeed were frequently given of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of their flying parties; and it was obſervable, that Sir. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Johnſon, on thoſe occaſions, as Colonel of the county, raiſed the militia of Albany, and proceeded to the ſpot; tho' every man acquainted with Indians well knows, that of all places, theſe are the moſt unlikely for finding the enemy. By ſuch ſham expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have our northern inhabitants been impoveriſhed and diſtreſſed: nor could they anſwer any other end, than to raiſe a bruit thro' the colonies; and with parade and oſtentation ſet the gazetteers upon ſounding his applauſe. — Even in theſe wild romantic excurſions, but few Indians attended him: and yet if we credit our news wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, hundreds were in his train.</p>
               <p>MR. SHIRLEY had ſcarce reſigned the command to Major Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Abercrombie,

Bradſtreet</note> when the good effect of the battoe ſervice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſo irreſiſtibly evident, that his very enemies recollected their ungrounded calumnies with ſhame and confuſion. — I allude, my Lord, to the action between the French and our battoe men, on the 3d of July. Senſible of the importance of Oſwego, the enemy col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected themſelves about the latter end of May in a large body, not
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:008163_0089_102E418090E539D0"/>many miles to the eaſtward of that garriſon; from whence detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were perpetually ſent out to fall upon our workmen, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt the paſſage thro' the Onondaga River. Capt. Bradſtreet, who had the direction of the battoes, was apprized that ſmall parties lay in ambuſh, waiting a favourable opportunity to attack him. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, when he left Oſwego, he ordered the ſeveral diviſions to proceed as near each other as poſſible: but ſo numerous and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular a body could not without difficulty be kept to any tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble order. He was at the head of about 300 battoe-men, in the firſt diviſion, upon his return to Schenectady; and about nine miles from Oſwego, when the enemy, who were 700 ſtrong, roſe from their ambuſcade, and fired upon his front. Near the place of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack, was a ſmall Iſland, by which the enemy might eaſily have forded the river. Bradſtreet in an inſtant landed upon the iſland, to prevent being incloſed between two fires; and with ſix men maintained his poſſeſſion, bravely repelling twenty of the enemy, who attempted to ſeize that advantageous poſt. He was then rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced with ſix others; and even compelled a ſecond party of 40 French to give way. Enraged at this ſhameful diſappointment, the enemy, to the number of 70 men, thought proper to make a third attempt; but the battoe-men, who did not exceed 20, with redoubled bravery ſtill kept their ground, and again forced their adverſaries to retire. During theſe ſkirmiſhes, which laſted near an hour, the battoe-men in the rear landed, without loſs or confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, upon the ſouth ſide of the river. Four hundred of the enemy now advanced up the north ſide of the ſtream, intending to ford it about a mile higher, and ſurround us. Bradſtreet, aware of the deſign, left the iſland, and with two hundred men marched on the other ſide to oppoſe them. But they had actually forded over, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he came up, and poſted themſelves in a ſwamp. Dr. Kirk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, with the ſecond diviſion of battoes, was now advancing to his aſſiſtance; but Bradſtreet ordered, and Capt. Butler, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the third diviſion, to keep their poſts, and cover the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Bradſtreet, at length animating his men, ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the thicket thro' twice his number, and gallantly puſhed them into the river, where many of them periſhed. Another attempt was made, in the mean time, to ford the river a little higher; but thoſe being alſo repulſed, the whole party was intirely routed and diſperſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="92" facs="unknown:008163_0090_102E41421F8BC670"/>
JUST after the defeat, Capt. Patten, with his grenadiers from Onondaga, fell in with our battoes; and the next morning a reinforcement of 200 men came up from the garriſon, and but for the exceſſive rains, which began ſoon after the action, and continued all the next day, theſe brave battoe-men would probably have cut off the whole party. Had Sir William Johnſon, as was expected, accompanied Capt. Patten to Oſwego, with the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians from Onondaga, Bradſtreet might have made immediate purſuit, and many of the enemy muſt have been overtaken: but this pacific plenipotentiary was then haſtening to Albany (a ſafe ſituation) with the important minutes of his late conference. A conference full of affectionate Indian ſpeeches, and large promiſes of their aſſiſtance; when ſcarce a man of them could be prevailed upon to turn out of his hut for the defence of the common cauſe. Bradſtreet had but 3 Indians of the Six Nations with him at this attack. Of theſe, one took to his heels; a ſecond fought bravely; but the third went over to the enemy, and aſſiſted in pointing out our officers. In theſe ſeveral actions we had about 30 men killed and wounded. How many of the French were ſlain, is not certainly known; tho' it is generally ſaid, they loſt about 120. Eighty Arms were brought to Schenectady; and about 70 men found in the woods, and carried to Oſwego. The French fled in the utmoſt diſorder, and ſome of their regular ſoldiers, being ſtrangers to the country, got bewildered in the deſart, and periſhed for want of ſuſtenance.</p>
               <p>BRADSTREET arrived at Schenectady on the 11th of July;

Upon the receipt of this intelligence, orders were iſſued to Major General Webb, to hold himſelf in readineſs to march for its defence with the 44th regiment.

               <p>THE garriſon of Oſwego conſiſted now of 1400 men, and about 300 workmen and ſailors. Four hundred and eighty-five were poſted, in ſmall parties, between that place and Burnet's Field, to maintain an open paſſage thro' the country of the Six Nations. The 44th and 48th regiments at Albany and Schenectady, with the Britiſh troops juſt arrived, conſiſted now of 2600 men; and the provincials, under the command of General Winſlow, were about 7000, and ready to march from Fort William-Henry.— Of the naval force of Oſwego, I have already given your Lordſhip an account: and as to the ſtrength of the enemy at Tinonderoge and Crown Point, according to the lateſt intelligence obtained by Capt.

               <p>IT is much to be wiſhed, my Lord, that Mr. Shirley's advice to General Abercrombie had been followed: and equally to be regretted, that Sir William Johnſon returned with ſuch precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from Onondaga to Albany.

He had proceeded no farther than Burnet's Field, with his regiment of 900 men, and the remaining 800 battoe-men, when the deſerters brought him the news of the ſiege. Upon the receipt of which, he made a forced march to the Oneida Carrying-Place; where he immediately felled trees into the Wood Creek to prevent the approach of the

               <p>MY LORD,
<note place="margin">Unhappy conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of the loſt of this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant poſt.</note> by theſe intrigues our country bleeds — Oſwego is loſt — loſt perhaps for ever, — with the naval armament—above 60 pieces of ordnance, and a rich ſupply of ſtores and proviſions, laid in at a vaſt expence, for ſeveral thouſand men, during the whole cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign. — Would to God this was all, and we had nothing worſe to apprehend! — Our furr trade, which has long been the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal object of the national attention, and the ſupport of our frontier city of Albany, is at an end. The French can now with the utmoſt facility ſecure the inland country, and confine us to the very brinks of the ocean — a free communication is opened between Canada and Louiſiana; and all our intercourſe with the Indians totally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcinded. The enemy, on the other hand, may, without oppoſition or reſtraint, render theſe innumerable tribes of ſavages their allies and dependants. The Six Nations are more wavering than ever: and ſhould they no longer think it expedient to preſerve their neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trality, the whole continent muſt inevitably become a field of blood. Whatever may be thought of theſe colonies, which of late have been magnified for their numbers and opulence,
<note place="margin">The colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies not ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agined.</note> I do aſſure your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, that a ſhort war will effectually exhauſt them. Their ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are ſcattered; their frontiers extenſive; the inhabitants but few, generally in very moderate circumſtances, and ſtill luxurious, and without reſources. The irruption of a few Indians into Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania, had already occaſioned the loſs of ſeveral hundred ſouls, and the deſolation of near two thouſand farms. The frontiers of the neighbouring colonies are equally defenceleſs: and the power of the native ſavages, at preſent in the French intereſt, is of itſelf ſufficient, by ſlow but inevitable means, to reduce us to extreme beggary and diſtreſs.</p>

<pb n="96" facs="unknown:008163_0094_102E41452D6FBAA8"/>in our political affairs. If I have erred, I am perſuaded it is not in any article of importance, nor purpoſely in the minuteſt. — E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very line of this letter hath been penned with the moſt ſacred vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for truth, and a mind equally unbiaſſed by reſentment or affection. — For obtaining an intimate acquaintance with the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters rehearſed, few in the colonies have had ſuperior advantages: nor in collecting proper materials, has any one been more aſſiduous. Add to this, that I had no other intereſt in the public meaſures, than the intereſt of every man on the continent. I am unconnected with all parties; neither enjoying any poſt myſelf, nor ſtanding in the leaſt relation to a ſingle officer in the army. The love of my country was the ſole ſpring of my curioſity; and ſo far, indeed, I was not an unconcerned ſpectator of the publick tranſactions. If I have made honourable mention of General Shirley, it was owing to my approbation of his ſchemes, as conducive to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weal of the britiſh plantations: and if my judgment was in this regard erronious, I have the pleaſure to find myſelf in very reſpectable company. Except New York, or rather a prevailing faction there, all the colonies hold him in very high eſteem. Some have made public declarations of their ſenſe of his great merit; and that too, at a time when he appeared deſcending from his meridian of glory. But he needed no other than the teſtimonials of his own province; for he, my Lord, whoſe conduct is approved by the people of the Maſſachuſets Bay, muſt be diſtinguiſhed both for his abilities and his virtue. They are too numerous and wiſe to be deceived, too free and independent to be driven. An undue influence can never be obtained by the governor of a colony, who has neither power nor places to beſtow. — Their aſſemblies are annual — the members elected by ballot, in number near 200. — The council, or middle eſtate, choſen yearly by the aſſembly; — and as all the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices are elective, not a man in the province is dependent on the ſmiles or the frowns of the King's repreſentative: — and yet ſo wiſe, free, and loyal a people have approved his judgment; confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in his integrity; teſtified in his favour; and publickly lamented his departure from the continent. I would by no means, my Lord, be underſtood, by theſe favourable ſentiments of Shirley, to diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage his noble Succeſſor in the command. He yet has not, at leaſt he deſerves not to have, a ſingle enemy amongſt us: and I hope it will ſerve the purpoſes of no man to be his enemy. I could only have wiſhed, that at this critical juncture, a gentleman ſo tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:008163_0095_102E41879F753900"/>verſed in American affairs, had been continued in America for his Lordſhip's aſſiſtance. We have to contend with a ſubtle enterpriſing foe—a foe, rapacious, martial, and bloody, committing murders, rather than waging war<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Tho' the French colony con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains perhaps not 30,000 men capable to bear arms; yet theſe are all under the deſpotic command and ſole direction of their gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor-general; and experience teaches us, that in ſpite of our navy, they may be annually reinforced. The ſtrength of our colonies, on the other hand, is divided; and the concurrence of all neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries both for ſupplies of men and money. Jealous are they of each other—ſome ill-conſtituted—others ſhaken with inteſtine di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions—and, if I may be allowed the expreſſion, parſimonious even to prodigality. Our aſſemblies are diffident of their gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors—governors deſpiſe their aſſemblies, and both mutually miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſent each other to the Court of Great Britain. Military mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures demand ſecrecy and diſpatch: but while the colonies remain undivided, and nothing can be tranſacted but with their univerſal aſſent, 'tis impoſſible to maintain the one, or proceed with the other. Without a general conſtitution for warlike operations, we can neither plan nor execute. We have a common intereſt, and muſt have a common council, <hi>one head,</hi> and <hi>one purſe.</hi> — The French ſervice is unexpoſed to thoſe embarraſsments; and hence they project without diſcovery, and we ſcarce collect their deſigns, till we are attacked and defeated. Hitherto they have proſecuted the war with ſuperior advantage; and yet the militia of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of the Maſſachuſets Bay alone, undoubtedly exceeds, by ſome thouſands, all the troops of Canada. Since the commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the preſent hoſtilities, his Majeſty has loſt above 3000 loyal ſubjects: and as all the Indians are at the devotion of the French, and Oſwego is now loſt, many thouſand farms before the opening of the next ſpring, will probably be abandoned; and the interior ſettlements deluged with the innocent blood of all ages and ſexes. Indeed, my Lord, 'tis not beneath the moſt elevated ſtation, to indulge the benevolent feelings of humanity; nor, reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring awhile from the pomp and gaiety that ſurrounds you, to ſhed a pitying tear over families inhumanly bereft of their ſubſtance, or more inhumanly ſloughtered in their beds. — It is a celebrated ſaying, and does honour to human nature, <q>Homo ſum, et nihil humanum a me alienum puto.</q>

WHAT the preſent or the next campaign will bring forth, it known only to the Omniſcient Governor of the univerſe. The co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies are nearly exhauſted, and their funds already anticipated by expenſive unexecuted projects: and whether they will ſtill continue their efforts, or reſign to a liſtleſs deſpair, is uncertain. I fear the worſt — and yet you know, my Lord, I am not of a melancholy caſt. There is too much reaſon for general concern: and I ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to predict, what every judicious perſon foreſees, that unleſs ſome ſucceſsful blow is ſtruck—and ſpeedily ſtruck, at the power of France, Britain muſt inevitably loſe her poſſeſſions in America. An event my Lord, of the moſt tremendous conſequence to us — to you—to the Proteſtant religion—to the peace of Europe— yes — and to the peace and happineſs of all mankind.</p>
               <p>HITHERTO we have waſted our ſtrength in lopping off branches, when the axe ſhould have been laid to the root of the tree. Canada, my Lord, Canada muſt be demoliſhed — Delenda eſt Carthago — or we are undone. Strength ſufficient have we left, with proper aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, for a deciſive ſtruggle: but a lingring conſumption will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly enervate and deſtroy. France has been, ever can, and will be annually, throwing over freſh troops into her colony, in defiance of our great maritime force: and ſhould peace enſue, even before our ruin is compleated, what will be the ſtate of theſe provinces upon the next rupture between the two crowns, when the inland country is filled with our enemies? — As you therefore value, my noble Lord, the cauſe of liberty; the glory of the Britiſh name; the honour and dignity of the beſt of Kings; and the preſervation of theſe colonies from bloody carnage and total ruin; exert, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, exert your influence, to extirpate this brood of French ſavages from the face of the continent. In a ſcheme ſo deciſive, and in no other, will the provinces heartily unite; and if well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed, and our unfortified ſea-coaſts at the ſame time ſufficiently protected; it will doubtleſs ſucceed — humble the pride of France — and cloſe the preſent war with a laſting and honourable peace.</p>
