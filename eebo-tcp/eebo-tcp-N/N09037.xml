            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <hi>The Publiſher may, by ſome, be though blamable for thus expoſing an extempore Diſcourſe, delivered without Notes, or any Regard to grammatical Niceties of Expreſſion; but I doubt not, the Reader will be kind enough to excuſe any little Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieties he may diſcover of this Sort, tho' I confeſs, if there are any that need an Apology, they have eſcaped my Notice.</hi>

The Sentiments in the following Diſcourſe, are juſt and important; the Language expreſſes thoſe Sentiments, with Clearneſs, Strength, and Solemnity; and as they ſeem to flow with Sincerity and Warmth from the Heart, will be likely to reach the Heart; for ſhe practically ſeems to have improved the following Lines of Advice to a Preacher,</hi>

O! how many youths are there, (I make no doubt, tho' I hope none within the audience of my voice,) who when their parents have rebuked them for their good, tho' with expreſſions of the utmoſt tenderneſs, have ſlighted or deſpiſed the reproof? How unſeaſonable have they reckoned the admonition! <q>I don't like to come till my preſent amuſements are over,</q> think they, <q>whatever be the conſequence, I'll not quit my diverſions till I ſee ſit; my companions like it beſt, they will perhaps deride me, if I leave <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

Tho' I have known many to blame others, when indeed the fault was really in themſelves. O conſider the ſhortneſs of life, and the certainty of death. <q>All fleſh is graſs, and all the goodneſs thereof is as the flower of the field, the graſs withereth, and the flower fadeth, but the goodneſs of God endureth forever.</q> One day or other, we <q>muſt all appear before the awful judge of quick and dead, to anſwer for the deeds done in the body, whether they be good or whether they be evil;</q> and O! that we may learn, every one of us, <q>ſo to number our days, that we may apply our hearts unto wiſdom;</q> then let us turn inward, and narrowly examine our ways, ſcrutinize tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly into our own hearts, and ſee if every thing is right within; let us deny ourſelves eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry gratification that wou'd, otherwiſe, divert our thoughts from that which is our higheſt good.—It is much to be wiſh'd, that all who really love their children, would endeavour, by all the means in their power, to cultivate their morals, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure for them their immortal intereſts; to bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord, (like one that I heard of, who, on his death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, very affectionately exhorted his children to make his God their God) and then you will have great reaſon to expect in them an uſeful and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blamable conduct, through the whole courſe of their lives; thus by endeavouring to conduct their minds into an early knowledge of Chriſt,

what a reciprocal advantage will it be from the one to the other? Every thing wou'd go on with that good harmony and underſtanding that it would viſibly carry it's own reward along with it; there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

If God was in truth made the ultimate end of all our aims, the firſt and the laſt of each day's thoughts, what manner of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſhou'd we then be, in all holy converſation and godlineſs?

            <p>Many I know are apt to complain, and ſay, the fault lies ſometimes in their maſters and miſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; I grant it, but this is not a caſe ſo general as the contrary; I ſhould rather ſuppoſe, good ſervants would make good maſters.

My dear friends, it is very improbable I ſhall ever have an opportunity of ſeeing you, or any of you, again: Cleave unto the Lord, and ſerve him with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect heart and willing mind, leſt the Lord of hoſts ſhould ſwear in his wrath, that ſuch abuſers of his long-ſufferings ſhall never enter into his reſt.—Evil habits are ſoon apt to get rooted and ingrain'd in the diſpoſition; by that means we contract as it were a familiarity with ſin, and with Solomon's fools, learn to make a mock of it, till by degrees our conſciences are hardened, and not to be touch'd by any ſoft impreſſion: My fear is, that many of you, by a long courſe of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, have ſo accuſtomed yourſelves to that which is ſinful, that evil habits have grown in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly upon you: Evil habits ſteal impercep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibly upon us; to the truth of this, experience daily witneſſes.

            <p>My friends, the moment you give yourſelves up to ſin, you give yourſelves out of your own power; you lay a reſtraint upon reaſon, and ſet the paſſions free: Upon the whole, there is great reaſon to fear, that ſin, if once we indulge it, ſhould get the better of and deſtroy our reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of repentance; and, Oh my friends!

what danger you are in; a few moments can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be too much to ſpend in ſo weighty an affair; and whenever you retire to theſe cool thoughts, may the father of mercies influence thoſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of your life, upon which all eternity de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends: Moſt people are apt to ſay, "I have now ſuch and ſuch buſineſs to do, and will not beſtow a ſerious thought upon religious matters until the morrow;"—when, alas! we know not whether we ſhall ever <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap>n unto our divine Lord, in whom is no variableneſs nor ſhadow of turning; he is an undivided foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, thither let us repair: He giveth unto all men liberally, and upbraideth not; many and manifold are the bleſſings that God has in ſtore for them that fear him. He who has fixed in his mind a juſt notion of God, will find his way to peace, be the darkneſs about him ever ſo thick. It is a great misfortune for a perſon to know much of religion, and little of God; ſuch a perſon's reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion muſt either be his plague or his contempt; it muſt appear to him either ridiculous or terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and let him take it which way he will, he will find a terror in it at laſt. It is in vain there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to ſeek for ſatisfaction till we know God; till we can witneſs to our hearts, that we know him
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:011535_0007_0F87262AD0B6DEA0"/>
in whom we have truſted: This will make our religion become an holy and reverential fear, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed with terror and confuſion; it will make our knowledge in religious matters become a wiſdom unto ſalvation, and preſerve to us that true freedom of mind, to which, as well the ſcof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers of the age, as the ſuperſtitious, are mere ſtrangers.</p>
            <p>And further, friends! don't let us entertain wrong notions of God; that is, don't let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider him in his attribute of juſtice only, nor his darling one, that of mercy; but let us conſider him as a God, who himſelf hath ſaid, <q>I will vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit the iniquities of the fathers upon the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me, and will ſhew mercy unto thouſands of them that love me and keep my commandments.</q> There are too many, now a days, who forget the plain parts of ſcripture, (of which there are enough for every man to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit withal) and from a want of underſtanding the more obſcure ones, are too apt to think irreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently of the Deity, and ſo grow entirely negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent with reſpect to the great work of their ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.—But, my friends, the word of God is plain to every man who has the light of reaſon, <q>that without holineſs, no man ſhall ſee the Lord;</q> this is the foundation of all religion. Surely no one need be at a ſtand how to act with reſpect to God, his neighbour and himſelf. God has promiſed his aſſiſtance to all who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to ſerve him; and ſurely there can be no difficulty in underſtanding this. When we read, that all who in any manner injure their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:011535_0008_0F87262B8F8DEB18"/>
and fellow-creatures, ſhall periſh everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly; we perceive that the crimes and the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments are ſo inſeparably connected, that, being conſcious of the crimes, we ſee no way to eſcape the puniſhment.</p>
            <p>But, when on the other hand, we conſider, <q>that unto whomſoever much is given, of him ſhall much be required;</q> we are too apt to infer from thence, that unto whomſoever little is given, of him ſhall little be required; and ſo conclude, that all our imperfections, of what kind ſoever, are well ſecured; and ſo we think, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever errs, be it for want of underſtanding, or the outward means of knowledge, or through paſſion and prejudices, that ſuch want the light, and are to be conſidered as thoſe to whom little is given. I ſay, my friends, this is one way the lukewarm have to lull their conſciences to ſleep, as it were: But ſtill conſcience returns, and proves that they have had the light, in many inſtances in which they have been great offenders.—Surely, the ſtate of ſuch people plainly anſwers to our Lord's likening the kingdom of <q>Heaven to a man's travelling into a far country, who called his own ſervants, and delivered unto them his goods: And to one he gave five talents, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother two, and to another one, to every man according to his particular ability, and ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way took his journey. Then he that had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the five talents, went and traded with the ſame, and by a prudent management made them other five talents. And he that had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived two, gained alſo other two. But he that received one, went and hid his Lord's ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:011535_0008_0F87262B8F8DEB18"/>
And when their Lord came to reckon with them, he that had received five talents, came and ſaid, Lord thou deliveredſt unto me five talents; behold I have gained beſide them five talents more. His Lord ſaid, well done thou good and faithful ſervant; thou haſt been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord. He that had received two talents, gained beſide them other two:</q> He likewiſe had the anſwer of, <q>Well done thou good and faithful ſervant, thou haſt been faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful over a little, I will make thee ruler over much.</q> But the other came, we are told, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <q>Lord, behold here is thy pound, which I have kept laid up in a napkin: For I feared thee, becauſe thou art an auſtere man: Thou takeſt up that thou laidſt not down, and reap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt that thou didſt not ſow.</q> But his Lord's reply was, <q>Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee, thou wicked ſervant; thou kneweſt that I was an auſtere man, taking up that I laid not down, and reaping that I did not ſow; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore then gaveſt not thou my money into the bank, that at my coming I might have required mine own with uſury.</q> Here then we ſee is no excuſe;—it is in vain to plead ignorance, <q>for there is given unto every man, to profit withal.</q> No one ſhall be condemned by a law he knew nothing of; every one ſhall ſtand or fall by the light that was given him; it being true of every action, what the apoſtle has affirmed of alms-gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, <q>It ſhall be accepted according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:011535_0009_0F87262D927A6860"/>
not.</q> Upon the whole, my friends, it appears from ſcripture, that every man hath the light of reaſon to direct him, knowing thus much, <q>That without holineſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord.</q>—And ſince morality is founded upon that reaſon which is a common gift to mankind, every man muſt anſwer for the uſe of his reaſon: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore where reaſon ſhews him the difference of good and evil, if he chooſes the evil, he is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out excuſe. And ſince there is given unto every one to profit withal, let us inſtantly ſet about im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving the talents that God has given us; nay, even tho' it were but one, for it ſhall be accepted according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not: Neither let us, my friends, look with envy on thoſe above us, who may be endowed with greater gifts than we; or contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly on thoſe below us; but let each act up to the light of reaſon, which we have given us, and we ſhall do well. 'Tis an old received max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im, in my country, that <hi>evil thinkers are generally evil doers:</hi> And the caſe is ſo general indeed, every where, that methinks there needs not much to be ſaid to prove it. I could wiſh, that all the difference amongſt us, was only, which ſhould live a life moſt conſiſtent with the character of a chriſtian.</p>
            <p>I am concerned to admoniſh each and every of you, to ſeek the Lord while he may be found. <q>Let the wicked forſake his ways, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous man his thoughts, and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him, and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon him</q>. But then, my friends, we are
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:011535_0009_0F87262D927A6860"/>
not to plead any merit in ourſelves, nor ſtand up, and, with a ſelf-ſufficient temper, think to vindicate or juſtify ourſelves for our own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, which is as filthy rags, and can ſtand us in no ſtead before the eyes of a perfectly pure and holy God. Oh friends! the day is coming, when all that is on the earth ſhall be as ſtubble: Then the ſcoffers, who mock at ſin, and make their game of the ſerious and devout;—thoſe, who, inſtead of giving all diligence to make their calling and election ſure, have trampled upon the frequent admonitions given them to a better life; will wiſh they had employed their time to a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter purpoſe.—But it will be too late!—For when once the maſter of the houſe has ſhut to the door, in vain we ſhall ſtand without and knock. Alas! are we not ſtupid? Are we not ſenſeleſs to the laſt degree, to live thus in open rebellion againſt the beſt of beings, when, for ought we know, the next minute we may be call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, we may be ſummoned to appear, all guilty as we are, before an injured God, in whoſe preſence no impure thing can enter? <q>Every man's work ſhall be made manifeſt, for the day ſhall declare it.</q> There is no other way to ſecure to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the favour of the Lord, but by a timely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; and repentance is the gift of God: Aſk it of God, ſaying, <hi>we are unworthy ſervants,</hi> and he will give it you; he will ſend none away that thus come unto him, nay, he delights in ſuch; don't let thy ſins, tho' heinous as they may be, retard thee one moment from ſupplicating for mercy. Chriſt ſays, <q>I came not to call the righteous, but ſinners to repentance:</q> He came
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:011535_0010_0F87262E79168850"/>
'to ſeek and to ſave that which was loſt;' for as he ſaith himſelf. <q>what man of you, having an hundred ſheep, if he loſe one of them, doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderneſs, and go after that which is loſt, until he find it? And when he hath found it, he layeth it on his ſhoulders, rejoicing. And when he cometh home, he calleth together his friends and neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, ſaying unto them, rejoice with me, for I have found my ſheep which was loſt. I ſay unto you, that likewiſe joy ſhall be in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, over one ſinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine juſt perſons who need no repentance.</q> So we ſee here is a promiſe of life everlaſting, provided we repent: We have only to repent, and live. Oh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then, <q>let the wicked forſake his ways, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him, and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon him.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The very end and deſign of Chriſt's coming, was to aboliſh ſin, and bring in a new and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete ſatisfaction, a new and ſufficient righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; which he did, by offering himſelf a ranſom for ſinners, and ſuffering in their ſtead, <q>that we might be made the righteouſneſs of God in him.</q>
            </p>
            <p>O! that there was, from this moment, <q>a death unto ſin, and a new life unto righteouſneſs.</q>—Finally, my brethren, ſince Chriſt Jeſus has ſtood in the place of ſinners, <q>has become ſin for us, who knew no ſin, that we may be made the righteouſneſs of God in him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </q> Then let there
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:011535_0010_0F87262E79168850"/>
be, from this moment, <q>a death unto ſin, and a new life unto righteouſneſs.</q> Let us liſten to the apoſtle's admonition. <q>Walk not in cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering and wantonneſs, in ſtrife and envying, but put ye on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and make not proviſion for the fleſh, to fulfil the luſts thereof.</q> God has given us appetites, and made it part of our trial to govern and reſtrain them within their proper channels; and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge theſe appetites beyond meaſure, wou'd be the higheſt ingratitude to our heavenly benefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. Let us look to the glory and immortality which is placed before us, the everlaſting manſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, prepared for thoſe who ſerve their maſter in holineſs and newneſs of life, and keep themſelves unſpotted from the world: Then, let us view the vaſt variety of temptations which are ſo apt to fix us down to this world, and interrupt all our hopes of a better.</p>
            <p>From theſe conſiderations, what more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful arguments can there be imagined, to prevail with us, to abſtain from fleſhly luſts, than this; that <q>we are ſtrangers and pilgrims on earth, and look for another, even an Heavenly habitation, whoſe builder and maker is God.</q> Let us then inſtantly bid adieu to all unlawful, worldly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, which are ſo apt to enſlave and captivate the heart of man. Let us inſtantly ſet about the great work of our ſalvation, while it is day, that is, while we have the bleſſed opportunity. Let us ſay, with the apoſtle, <q>The world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.</q> Let us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly beg of God, to <q>lead us into the way, the truth and the light.</q> Oh! that his holy
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:011535_0011_0F87262E9FEF7DC8"/>
ſpirit may guide you into all truth. The ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſaith, <q>It is God that worketh in us both to will and to do of his good pleaſure.</q> The a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle poſitively renounceth all ſufficiency of his own, he will have no merit imputed to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; 'not I,' ſaith he, <q>but Chriſt that dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in me.</q> All human accompliſhments are no more than droſs or dung, when compared to the excellency of the knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>If there was really a thorough change in our natures; if there was really a longing, an earneſt longing after God, what univerſal charity wou'd then abound among all ranks of people? Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters wou'd have that care and ſincere love for their flock, as knowing that one day they muſt give an account. In ſhort, my friends, were we to conſider the great and almighty Being, as he really is, the Alpha and Omega, the Firſt and the Laſt! I ſay, my friends, were we to make this God our <q>God, the Firſt and the Laſt of each day's thought; what manner of perſons ſhould we then be in all holy converſation and godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?</q> Our lives would be ſuch as would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeak us <q>a peculiar, choſen people, zealous of good works.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The day is haſtening, when all that we ſee now, will be no more! Then let us ſecure to ourſelves an everlaſting inheritance; and inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance among the firſt born, whoſe names are written in Heaven.</p>
            <p>The day is haſtening, when that awful doom will take place,—<q>He that is holy, let him be holy ſtill, and he that is filthy, let him be fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy ſtill!</q> This is an alarming thought, and well deſerves our attention.</p>

Methinks I am concerned to ſpeak it again and again in your ears, that you all earneſtly attend to the one thing needful; that you preſs forward towards the mark of the 'prize of our high-calling in Chriſt Jeſus.' It will not do to be lukewarm, to be liſtleſs and careleſs in an affair of the utmoſt conſequence, and eſpecially ſince we know, <q>It is appointed unto all men once to die.</q>

            <p>Methinks it argues a depravity of underſtanding, as well as the greateſt impiety, to make no proviſion for another world, whither we are all haſtening.</p>
            <p>Here is no abiding place.—Give all diligence, I beſeech you, to ſecure to yourſelves an intereſt in Chriſt, before that day come, when proclamation will be made, <hi>
                  <q>That time ſhall be no more.</q>
               </hi> 
               <q>All fleſh is graſs, and all the goodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs thereof as the flower of the field. The graſs wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth, and the flower fadeth, but the word of the Lord endureth forever.</q> This was the prophet's declaration. Every thing relating to human life will ceaſe, the world it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf will come to an end.</p>
            <p>Be wiſe then betimes, leſt that day come upon you when you think not, and in an hour when ye are not aware: O! 'buy the truth, and ſell it not;' like the merchant our Lord ſpeaks of, <q>who when he had found the coſtly pearl, the pearl of great price, he immediately ſold all that he had,</q> (he denied himſelf of every gratification that might otherwiſe divert his thoughts from that which was his chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt good) that he might purchaſe that field where the inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable pearl lay.</p>
            <p>Moſt men live as though they were never to die.</p>
            <p>There is either a total neglect, or a general careleſneſs, with regard to ſpiritual things, in every thing they do; but this is certainly bad,—'tis ſhocking to the laſt degree, to live regardleſs of futurity; to live thus unmindful of that being who has ſet a day in the which he will judge the world! A tribunal, at which every created being muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, there to anſwer for the deeds done in the body! And, my friends, I will aſk you this plain queſtion: Is not this a matter that well deſerves our attention? Is it not a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration ſufficient, of itſelf, to draw off our attention from the vain and trifling amuſements of this tranſitory life, and engage ourſelves in the purſuit of the one thing needful, the pearl of great price, which will viſibly carry it's own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward along with it? The grave is the land where all things
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:011535_0012_0F87262F4D69A3B8"/>
(of temporal concernment) are forgotten: Let us give all diligence to have our lamps trimmed, that if ſickneſs ſhould attack us, and death ſtare us in the face, we may ſay, with reſignation, cheerfulneſs and triumph, <q>O death! where is thy ſting? O grave! where is thy victory? All fleſh is graſs, and all the goodlineſs thereof as the flower of the field, the graſs withereth, and the flower fadeth, but the word of the Lord endureth forever.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Eternity is at hand, <q>behold he that cometh, will come; and will not tarry.</q> Let our lives be ſuch, that when our Lord comes to reckon with us, we may be able to render him a juſt and true account. And indeed by conducting ourſelves in the path of religion and virtue, and where on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true joy is to be found, our lives will be influential of the lives of others: Example is better than precept, it would ſpeak to them thus, 'you follow us, as we follow God.'</p>
            <p>O that miniſters might have a watchful care over their flocks! O, that their lives may be a tranſcript and pattern of what they teach. Finally, my brethren, let me adviſe you to live as becometh chriſtians: There would be that harmony, that content and ſatisfaction, that the world's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe cannot give, nor it's cenſure take away.</p>
            <p>God has promiſed his peace to all who ſeek it: It is a peace which far ſurpaſſeth all human underſtanding. <q>My peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you; not as the world giveth, give I unto you</q>
            </p>
            <p>But then, my dear friends, we can never expect this peace, if we live in a courſe of wickedneſs; for, <q>there is no peace, ſaith my God, to the wicked:</q> 
               <q>He that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noureth me, I will honour, and he that deſpiſeth me ſhall be lightly eſteemed.</q> Neither muſt we content ourſelves with thinking that by thus departing from the moſt enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous crimes, God will be thus ſatisfied. No, this is a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken notion: God is not to be mocked; he ſaith, <q>My ſon, give me thine heart.</q>
            </p>
            <p>There muſt be an utter deſtruction of Amaleck, or God is not ſatisfied, it is not doing our duty in part, that will avail us; we muſt give up every thing, every darling ſin, that moſt eaſily beſets us. <q>That for the fire to the fire, and that for the hammer to the hammer. God is of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer eyes than to behold iniquity.</q> He will not dwell in an unclean temple. Let us narrowly inſpect into our ways,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:011535_0012_0F87262F4D69A3B8"/>
and ſcrutinize into our own hearts, and ſee if every thing be right within; and if ſo, it will be readily manifeſted by our lives and converſations. Oh! my friend, whoever thou art, that is within the audience of my voice, let me intreat thee to make God thy friend; for, after death, comes the judgment,—on each of us! I would alſo, that miniſters give all diligence in their callings, for if we fall, we fall not alone. <q>Cry aloud, and ſpare not; tell my people their tranſgreſſions, and the houſe of Jacob their ſins.</q>—Our buſineſs (as preachers) is to preach repentance to all, without reſpect to perſons, <q>whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.</q> If we act counter to this, if we, for fear of it's hurting our temporal concerns, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect to preach with that plainneſs that ought ever to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh a goſpel miniſter,—Let me tell thee, whoever thou art, that neglecteſt to ſtrike at the root of ſin, and doſt thy duty but in part, thou wilt receive Saul's condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; who, notwithſtanding his expreſs order from God, was to make an utter deſtruction of Amaleck, yet ſpared what was beſt, agreeable to his own fond inclination: we read, he ſaved the beſt of the ſheep and oxen, and Agag.</p>
            <p>But, however merciful this may appear, in Saul's ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Agag, his fooliſh pity and compaſſion to the captive king, was ill timed, when God's will was otherwiſe. I don't want to go through with every proof that could be brought in ſupport of what I have been endeavouring to enforce: Let us only act agreeable to the will and pleaſure of our maker, and what he orders to be done, to do it with cheerfulneſs and alacrity as unto a faithful Creator. I can ſay truly, that he who th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s approves himſelf, is worthy of all honour. Finally, my brethren, let us inſtantly ſacrifice every darling ſin that may ſeem to ſtand in our way to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Let us give up every thing;—'that for the fire to the fire, and that for the hammer to the hammer.' Don't be drudges to the Devil any longer. Hard taſk-maſters, ſin and Satan are: But our God, whom we ſerve, is no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtere nor hard maſter. His unbounded mercy hath in this our day loſt none of it's efficacy; he requireth nothing without giving ſuitable abilities.</p>
            <p>O! that we may all gather the manna, the bleſſed man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, the which he who eateth ſhall even live thereby. Let me utter it in your ears again and again, <q>All fleſh is graſs, and all the goodlineſs thereof, as the flower of the field;
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:011535_0013_0F8726300F45B6B8"/>
