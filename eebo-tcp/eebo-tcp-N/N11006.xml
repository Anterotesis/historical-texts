            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>WE know not which is moſt to be deteſted, your Lordſhip's puſillanimity, or your villany, ſuch a miſcreant never before diſgraced the adminiſtration of any country, nor the confidence of any King; one day you are all fire and ſword, Boſton is to be laid in aſhes, and the rivers of America are to run with the blood of her inhabitants; ſhips are prepared, troops embarked, and officers appointed for the threatened carnage; you no ſooner find the brave Americans are deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to reſiſt your inſtruments of ſlaughter, and to oppoſe the cruel deſigns of a deſpotic tyrant, to rob them of their rights, than all the bravadoing and all the bluſtering of your Lordſhip, is imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſoftened into a calm, and you relax; fear
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:013945_0002_0F925D1FC1BD05C8"/>ſeizes your daſtardly ſoul, and you ſink beneath the weight of accumulated guilt.</p>
            <p>One day we hear of nothing but accuſations, proſcriptions, impeachments, and bills of attainder againſt the patriots in America, and they are ſpeedily to be apprehended, and to receive a puniſhment due to their crimes, due to rebels; three days do not clapſe before this juſt and noble reſolution of your Lordſhip to bring thoſe traitors to a trial is dropped, and lenient or no ſteps are to be taken againſt them. Another day all the colonies are in a ſtate of rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, and the laſt advices received from America, you tell the Houſe of Commons, were of a very alarming nature, and ſuch a daring ſpirit of reſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance had manifeſted itſelf throughout the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, that it was now high time Parliament ſhould adopt meaſures for enforcing obedience to the late acts, a plan is no ſooner propoſed by you, but car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by a rotten majority, for reducing them to a ſtate of ſubjection to your, and your royal maſter's will; and bloodſhed and ſlaughter ſtare them in the face; they laugh at your impotent malice, and with a ſpirited firmneſs, becoming of freemen, dare you to the ſtroke; when behold, your threats, and the reſolutions of your venal troop (I will not call it a Britiſh ſenate) become like the threats and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions of a ſociety of coal-porters, who declare vengeance againſt another body of men, who will not comply with their unlawful impoſitions, but fear the next day, without even the ſhadow of juſtice on their ſide, to carry their deſperate deſign into execution. The motion you made, my Lord, in the Houſe of Commons, on Monday laſt, for a ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion of the ſeveral American acts, till it is known which of the provinces will raiſe a revenue, and contribute to the luxuries of the parent ſtate, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:013945_0003_0F925D204604BDB0"/>to the controul of the Britiſh Parliament, is a ſubterfuge too low, and too thinly diſguiſed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Americans, or to impoſe upon the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the meaneſt capacity; it is evident to the world this is only a villanous plan to divide them, who, while united together, may bid defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to all your Lordſhip's cunning, fraud, force, and villany. The Americans, my Lord, are too ſenſible, and too brave to be drawn into any trap, either of your, or your royal maſter's making; you may weave the web as artfully as you pleaſe for their deſtruction, and they will be ſure to break it; their cauſe is juſt, 'tis the cauſe of heaven, and built upon the ſolid foundation of truth and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; they will carefully watch over the ſacred gifts of God, and never ſurrender them to you, nor any power upon earth, but with their lives. You have found, my Lord, that your hoſtile inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and all your force and violence would not terrify them into a compliance with your meaſures, nor anſwer the infamous deſign of making the King abſolute in America; and now you are determined to try, whether by fraud and artifice you can ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect your purpoſe.</p>
            <p>You have, my Lord, by the moſt cruel oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions drove the Americans to a ſtate of deſperation, you have deſtroyed their charters, invaded their rights, impoſed taxes contrary to every principle of juſtice, and to every idea of repreſentation, and by blockading the port of Boſton, reduced near thirty thouſand people, in eaſy circumſtances, to a ſtate of dependence upon the charity and benevolence of their fellow ſubjects; and now, rare condeſcenſion, ſuſpenſion, of the ſeveral American acts, or in other words miniſterial oppreſſion and villany is to be granted them, provided they will raiſe a revenue in
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:013945_0004_0F925D23C0541B40"/>America, ſtill ſubject to the controul of the king and Parliament in England: This ſuſpenſion ſcheme, my Lord, will not do, the Americans will have a repeal of all the acts they complain of, and a full reſtoration of all their charters, rights, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, and privileges, before they grant you a ſingle farthing, and then not ſubject to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul of a banditti of rotten members in St. Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen's chapel, of your appointing, for where would be the difference between their taxing themſelves, ſubject to the controul, and at the diſpoſal of the King and Parliament here, or of the Houſe of Commons in England taxing them in the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, there would be none, my Lord, and they would ſtill be in the ſame ſituation they are now; ſtill ſubject to the will of the King, and the corrupt influence of the crown; this ſcheme, my Lord, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to me as ridiculous and abſurd, as the nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſtill veſted in the court of Aldermen of the city of London, which gives a power to a majority of twenty-ſix to ſet aſide the choice of ſeven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Liverymen, in the election of their Mayors. Be aſſured, my Lord, this new plan muſt fall to the ground, with all your former ones in this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; the day of trial is at hand, the Americans will be firm, they will have a confirmation of all their rights; they will have a redreſs of all their grievances; they will levy their own taxes, not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to any controuling power; and they will fix the conſtitutional liberties of America, upon a foundation not be again ſhaken by you, nor any puſillanimous, weak, wicked, or cruel tyrant.</p>
            <p>It is unnatural; but for a moment, my Lord, ſuppoſe the Americans ſhould come into your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals, or agree with the terms of your motion; how, my Lord, can you make reparation for the
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:013945_0005_0F925D24D5459268"/>injuries England and America have ſuſtained, or will it in any degree leſſen your villany, or atone for your crimes; what compenſation can you make for the loſs of our trade, to the amount of near three millions? What compenſation can you make for robbing the nation of near one million and a half of money, to carry on your execrable deſigns againſt your fellow ſubjects in America? You can make none: Your head indeed would be a pleaſing ſpectacle upon Temple-Bar, but the loſs of that, and your eſtates, would never atone for a ten thouſandth part of your crimes and villany, ſtill it is to be hoped the minority in the Houſe of Commons, and the people will never leave you, till they have both made you a public example, and brought you to condign puniſhment.</p>
            <p>Every meaſure, my Lord, of your adminiſtration at home has been cruel, arbitrary, and unconſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutional; and every meaſure, with reſpect to foreign affairs, has been weak, cowardly, abſurd and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous; unbecoming an Engliſh miniſter, and only calculated to deſtroy the honor and inteteſt of this kingdom.</p>
            <p>The glory and dignity of the Britiſh nation, was never ſo infamouſly ſacrificed both by you and the King, as in the year 1770, by a ſcandalous ſecret convention with Spain, concerning Faulk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land's Iſlands.</p>
            <p>With reſpect to domeſtic affairs, you have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to erect the Sovereign into a deſpotic tyrant; you have made him trample under foot, all laws human and divine; you have made him deſtroy the rights and liberties of the people in every part of the Britiſh empire. You have made it appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently his intereſt to promote diviſions at home; you have obliged him to quit the glorious title of
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:013945_0006_0F925D2580FC8C58"/>father of his people, and debaſe himſelf into the head of a party, whom he has inveſted with an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute dominion over him, and whilſt he monarchs it in its own cloſet, becomes contemptible in the eyes of his ſubjects, and the whole world; weak, timid, and irreſolute, he deeply engages in all your Lordſhip's infamous meaſures, and the reſt of his miniſters; and it is for this reaſon we ſee every act of miniſterial villany and murder ſanctified by royal authority.</p>
