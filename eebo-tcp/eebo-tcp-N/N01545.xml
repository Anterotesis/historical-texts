            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE</head>
            <p>IF the Reader does Expect any thing Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or Rare in the <hi>Subsequent Sermons,</hi> he will find himself disappointed. In my Youth I Endeavoured to comply with that Apostolical Rule, in doctrine to <hi>shew In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptness, Gravity, Sincerity, found Speech, which cannot be condemned.</hi> It would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming my <hi>Old Age</hi> to do otherwise.</p>
            <p>Concerning the <hi>Prevalency of Prayer,</hi> I Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished a Discourse Forty Years since, in which I mention'd many Instances of Signal Answers of Prayer, in the time of the <hi>Indian War,</hi> began by <hi>Philip</hi> Sachem, by which we have seen that the LORD is a <hi>Prayer-Hearing GOD,</hi> Of which having had such Experience we should be Encouraged to take up the Psalmists holy Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution <hi>to Call upon Him as long as we live.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the Subject of <hi>Old Age</hi> many have Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. Several Moralists among the Gentiles have treated th<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>. In special <hi>Plutarch, Cicero,</hi> and <hi>Seneca</hi> of whom it is said, That the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of his having that Name given to him, was, his being <hi>Born with gray hairs</hi> upon him.
<pb facs="unknown:001838_0003_0FB916AD80400E70"/>
Some profitable Observations are to be seen in those Authors; but not comparable with what has been Written by those Eminent Divines <hi>Tos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanus</hi> and <hi>Rivet,</hi> and of our own Nation Mr. <hi>Borroughs,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bridge,</hi> and more lately Mr. <hi>Boyse,</hi> has done worthily. Also, that Reverend and Aged Minister of CHRIST, Mr. <hi>Steele,</hi> (whom I knew in <hi>London</hi>) has an Eleborate Discourse of <hi>Old Age.</hi> He mentions Dr. <hi>Sheafes</hi> Vindication of Old Age, Written by him when he was Fourscore, and Dedicated to Dr. <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derton,</hi> who was an Hundred Years old. I have not been able to obtain the sight of that Book, in which I doubt not but that there are many things very Edifying.</p>
            <p>AGE is commonly attended with many Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, <hi>O quam continuis, et quantis plena senectus longa malis.</hi> There have been but few Men in the World, that could say as that Philosopher did, who being asked when an Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and Seven Years Old, Why he desired to Live longer, Replyed, Because he had nothing to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse Old Age with. And few that can say as that Learned and Critical Divine, <hi>D<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>usius</hi> did, <hi>Mihi Senectus metior quam ipsa Juvenius.</hi> That his Old Age was more Comfortable to him than his Youth. For a Man to Enjoy Health, and the continuance of his <hi>Intellectual</hi> Abilities in Old Age is a rare and wonderful Mercy. It is impossible to be Thankful enough for so great a favour of Heaven. An holy and fruitful Old Age, though accompanied with Infirmities is in <hi>good Old Age.</hi> And if it is not so quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed, yet there is a <hi>Veneration</hi> due to Age it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
<pb n="iii" facs="unknown:001838_0004_0FB916AED8EC9D80"/>
The Ancient <hi>Romans</hi> (who indeed had, some of them, very noble Sentiments) were of that Mind, witness their famous Poet, who sayes,</p>
            <q>Magna fuit quondam capitis reverentia cani, Inque suo pretio, ruga senilis erat.</q>
            <p>Happy is the Man that has lived many Years, and has been doing good in the World all that time. I am troubled to think how long I have Lived, and to how little purpose. Having obtained help from GOD, I have seen many Dayes, and have been favoured with great Opportunities to be doing of Service for CHRIST, and for His Churches, in more Capacities than One, and in more Lands than One; but I have been a Cumberer of the Ground: Were not the LORD whom I Serve, a GOD of Infinite Patience and Goodness, I had been Cut down for my Unfruitfulness long ago. He has seen meet to Employ me in His Service for a longer time, than any Minister now Living in <hi>New-England.</hi> Nine and Fifty Years are Lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, since I began to Preach the Gospel, in my Youth in Lands afar off, in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> for Three or Four Years, until for <hi>Nonconformity</hi> I was rendred uncapable of further Service there. Since GOD brought me to <hi>Boston,</hi> Five and Fifty Years are within a few Weeks Expired. What Changes have I Liv'd to see? A whole Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion buried, and the best that these Latter Ages have seen. And now that I am going out of the World, it is a grief of heart to me, to see Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and Practices set on foot, which are Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially differing from that <hi>Congregational Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline</hi> which was once owned in these Churches,
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:001838_0005_0FB916B118E58130"/>
and has been the distinguishing Character and Glory of <hi>New-England.</hi> Stated Councils with any thing of a Juridical Power, are not consistent with the Congregational Discipline. There was Pull su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed many Years since, <hi>A Declaration of the Faith and Order owned and practised</hi> in the Congregational Churches in England, <hi>Agreed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Consented to by their Elders and Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers in their Meeting at the Savoy,</hi> Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 12. 1658. In that part of their Confession which concerns the Institution of Churches, and the Order appointed in them by Jesus Christ: Their words are <hi>(Thes. 26, 27.)</hi> 
               <q>In Cases of difficulties or differences, either in point of Doctrine, or in Administrations, wherein either the Churches in general are Concerned, or any one Church in their Peace, Union and Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or any Member or Members of any Church are injured, or by any proceeding in Censures, not agreeable to Truth and Order, it is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Mind of Christ, that many Churches holding Communion together, do by their Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers Meet in a Synod or Council, to Consider and give their Advice on, or about the matter in difference to be reported to all the Churches concerned. Howbeit, these Synods so assembled are not Entrusted with any Church Power, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly so called, or with any Jurisdiction over the Churches themselves, to Exercise any Censures, either over any Churches or Persons, or to impose their determination on the Churches or Officers.</q> 
               <hi>Besides these occasional Synods or Councils, there are not Instituted by CHRIST any Stated Synods in a fixed Combination of Churches, or their Officers in Lesser or
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:001838_0006_0FB916B298BAEAD8"/>
Greater Assemblies, nor are there any Synods appointed by CHRIST in a way of Subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination to one another.</hi> There were in this <hi>Savoy Convention</hi> the Messengers of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twenty Congregational Churches, among whom Dr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Nye</hi> were Principal. The large and Judicious Preface to that result, was Written partly by Dr. <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win,</hi> and partly by Mr. <hi>Nye.</hi> Eighteen Pages of it are Dr. <hi>Goodwins,</hi> the rest is Mr. <hi>Nyes.</hi> That which Concerns the <hi>Order of the Churches</hi> was Dr. <hi>Owins</hi> Composure. It may be some Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders will be gratified with this Information, and so far as I understand, I am the only Person now Living that had the knowledge of these Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars. <hi>Sed haec obiter.</hi> With the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional <hi>Brethren</hi> in England, agrees our <hi>New-England Platform of Church Discipline,</hi> which declares that <hi>it belongs not to Synods, or Councils to Exercise Church Censures, nor any act of Church Authority, or Jurisdiction.</hi> But if a Council shall take upon them to sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend a Considerable Number of Persons, belonging to a particular Church, where CHRIST has given them no Authority, do they not <hi>Exercise Jurisdiction</hi>? If a Council has power to sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend which is <hi>Excommunicatio Minor,</hi> they have power to deliver to Satan, which is <hi>Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicatio Major.</hi> All that a Council can do, is to advise the particular Church to suspend their delinquent Members if their is cause for it, but it belongs to no Council in the World to Exercise that Authority. Moreover, to allow unto half the Ministers in a Council, a Negative Voice, is not Congregational, nor yet Presbyterial. That Great
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:001838_0007_0FB916B4EC297738"/>
Light in <hi>Connecticut Colony,</hi> the for ever fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Mr. <hi>Thomas Hooker,</hi> has illuminated those Churches with better Principles. In his Elaborate and Accurate Survey of Church Discipline, <hi>part 4. p. 46. 47</hi> He proves that in Councils or Synods, <hi>all have equal power, nor do any act there as Officers</hi> but as sert by their Churches, nor has any Minister a right to Vote in an Ecclesiastical Council, without a Mission from his Church. In the Reformed Churches abroad, there is no Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive on their Councils, but the Vote of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority is Conclusive: Which has occasioned some Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latick Writers to Speak reproachfully of them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Majority of their Synods consisting of those they call <hi>Lay Men,</hi> they may carry it against the other. For their Synods consist of <hi>Deacons</hi> as well as of <hi>Lay Elders</hi> and Pastors. Nor will they admit a Pastor Except he brings One or more with him, that is not such. As may be seen in the French Protestants Discipline. <hi>Chap. 5. Art. 2.</hi> And in Mr. <hi>Quicks</hi> Synodicon <hi>Passim.</hi> In the time of the Reforming Parliament, there was a Provincial <hi>Synod</hi> settled at <hi>London,</hi> whose Constitution was such, as that their acts would have been valid altho' not so much as One Minister had consented therewith. If we change our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational Principles, I am abundantly perswaded that we shall not <hi>ad Meliora transire,</hi> change for the better. The words of the Reverend and Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Mr. <hi>Urian Oakes,</hi> in his Election Sermon, deserve to be well thought on, He sayes concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning those Godly Men, who were the first that Planted Churches in this part of the World, That <hi>GOD did more for them, than for any Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the World, in shewing them the Patern
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:001838_0008_0FB916B899BE4178"/>
of His House, and the true Scriptural Way of Church Government and Administration. GOD was certainly in a more than Ordinary way of favour Present with His Servants, in laying our Foundations, and in Setling the way of Church Order, according to the Will and Appointment of CHRIST. I fully believe that the</hi> Congregational Way, <hi>is the highest step that has been taken towards</hi> Reformation, <hi>and for the Substance of it, it is the very same way, that was Establish'd and Practised in the Primitive Times, according to the Institution of Jesus Christ. I must needs say, I should Look upon it as a sad Degeneracy, if we should leave the Good Old Way, so far as to turn Councils and Synods into Classes and Provincial Assemblies, &amp;</hi>c. Thus Mr. <hi>Oakes,</hi> my Dear Friend and Worthy Predecessor in the <hi>Presidentship</hi> of the <hi>College</hi> in <hi>Cambridge.</hi> It was a Mercy to all the Churches in <hi>New-England,</hi> when that Excellent Man was the President, <hi>who being Dead yet Speaks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT must be acknowledged, that controversies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Church Government,</hi> and Ecclesiastical Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministrations, are not Fundamentals in Religion. There are among <hi>Episcopalians, Presbyterians, Antipedobaptists,</hi> as well as among <hi>Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onals,</hi> Many Godly Men. Such notwithstanding their different perswasions may hold Communion together in all the Ordinances of the Gospel. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, they cannot all in things wherein they differ, have Truth on their side, nor may they part with any Truth. <hi>Sell it not.</hi> When some would be compounding for the Truth, <hi>Luther</hi> Spoke like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:001838_0009_0FB916BAD8B48A08"/>

               <q>
                  <bibl>I. PETER III.12.</bibl>
                  <p>The Eyes of the Lord are over the Righteous, and his Ears are open unto their Prayers.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE Apostle in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text Exhorts Christians to demean themselves as they ought to do, both towards good Men and towards evil Men. With good Men they should endeavour to maintain Unity &amp; Love, as in the 7th Verse. As for evil Men they should not do as they do, rendring evil for evil, or railing for railing, but on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry they should bless them. The Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:001838_0012_0FB916C198D9CD18"/>
by which the Exhortation is ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, is, because to do so, is the way to obtain a blessing from God. Verse 9. This he proves by a Testimony of Scripture taken out of the 34th <hi>Psalm,</hi> to which this with the two preceding Verses hath respect.</p>
            <p>In the words which have been read, we consider, (1.) The Subject spoken of, <hi>viz. The Righteous.</hi> By which Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers are intended who have the Righteousness of Christ by Faith im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to them, which makes them Righteous in the sight of God, who have also Sanctifying Grace inherent in them. Imputed &amp; Inherent Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness always go together. (2.) The thing affirmed concerning such. <hi>The Eyes of the Lord are over them.</hi> The Eye of His Favour is continually watching over them. And because they are the Objects of His special Favour, <hi>His Ears are open to their Prayers.</hi> The meaning, is, Not only
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:001838_0013_0FB916C318B6FB08"/>
that God sees them and hears what they <hi>Pray</hi> before Him. For He that has an alseeing Eye, and an alhearing Ear cannot but see all Men, and hear every word that is spoken by them, but that He heareth them so as graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously to accept &amp; answer their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. That therefore is the Doctrine before us to be insisted on, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>DOCT. <hi>That GOD will graciously hear and answer the Prayers of the Righteous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the clearing of the Doctrine, we shall only Enquire into two Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars. (1) How it does appear that GOD will graciously hear and answer the Prayers of the Righteous? (2) The Reason why He does do?</p>
            <p>Quest. 1. <hi>How doth it appear that the LORD will graciously hear &amp; answer the Prayers of the Righteous?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:001838_0014_0FB916C498F9B510"/>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. The Scripture does abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly bear witness to this Truth. Therein it is declared that the LORD is a <hi>Prayer-hearing GOD.</hi> He is made known by that Attribute: Psal. 65 2. <hi>O thou that hearest Prayer, unto thee shall all flesh come.</hi> The Scripture does abound with precious Promises con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this. Isai. 41.17. <hi>When the Poor &amp; Needy seek water, I the Lord will hear them.</hi> Mat 7.7. <hi>Ask &amp; it shall be given you; Seek &amp; you shall find.</hi> There are Conditional Promises of Temporal blessings on Praying for them, <hi>viz.</hi> if it shall be most for the Glory of God &amp; for the best good of His Servants, that such blessings should be granted to them. <hi>Godliness hath the Promise of the Life that now is.</hi> But Spiritual blessings are more absolutely Promised to Praying Ones. Every one that asketh receiveth. If you know how to give good gifts to your Children, how much more shall
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:001838_0015_0FB916C6DD05FA38"/>
your heavenly Father, <hi>give the Holy Spirit to them that ask Him,</hi> Luk. 1<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>.10, 13. Audience of Prayer is a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Article of the Covenant of Grace. Zech. 13 9. <hi>They shall call on my Name, &amp; I will hear them; I will say it is my People, &amp; they shall say, the Lord is my God.</hi> A Praying Man has the Lord to be his God. And when the Lord ingageth to be a God to any Man, He promiseth to hear his Prayers.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Experience of the Saints of God has Confirmed the Truth of this Doctrine. It is not only true that God is a Prayer-hearing God, but He has always been so; He never was otherwise. Isai. 49 19. <hi>I have not said to the seed of Jacob, seek ye me in vain.</hi> One way or other, in whole or in part their Prayers have been Ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered. The Lords People in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral have seen this verified. And par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Saints have had Experience of it. Our Father <hi>Abraham</hi> had so. God
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:001838_0016_0FB916C922FC15D0"/>
said to him, <hi>I have heard thee,</hi> Gen. 17.20. And <hi>Jacob</hi> had experience of it. He therefore built an Altar to <hi>God who Answered him in the day of his distress,</hi> Gen. 35.3. And <hi>David</hi> had the like experience. Psal. 34 4. <hi>I sought the Lord &amp; he heard me, &amp; delivered me from all my fears.</hi> And Verse 6. <hi>This poor man cried, &amp; the Lord heard him, and has saved him out of all his troubles.</hi> Again, in another place he sayes, <hi>Verily God has heard me, he has attended to the voice of my Prayer, and blessed be God, who has not turned away my Prayer nor his Mercy from me,</hi> Psal. 66.19, 20. <hi>Ezra</hi> says of himself, and the Lords Servants who joyned with him, <hi>We besought God, and he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated of us,</hi> Ezra 8.23. All the true fearers of God, that do indeed know what it is to Pray, have experienced this. Psal. 145.18, 19. <hi>The Lord is nigh to all them that call upon him, to all that call upon him in truth; He will
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:001838_0017_0FB916CB522F6928"/>
fulfill the desire of them that fear him, be also will hear their cry &amp; will save them.</hi> Thus has it ever been. <hi>To which of the Saints wilt thou t<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> thee?</hi> Ask one, Have not you found the Lord to be an <hi>Hearer of Prayer</hi>? He will say I have found him to be so. Ask another, and he will say so. And another, and he will say the same. The Scripture sayes, <hi>Every one that is godly will pray,</hi> Psal. 32.6. So every one that is godly will set his Seal to this Truth, that the blessed God is an Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Prayer. The Righteous know it by happy Experience. For,</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Righteous are the Lords Favourites. Which is implied when it is said, That His <hi>Ears are open</hi> to them, as the Ears of a Prince are open to one that is his favourite. Such an one has the Kings Ear: He is apt to grant the request of such an one, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be for himself or others. The Tyrians and Sidonians were sensible
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:001838_0018_0FB916CC199DF3F0"/>
of this: Wherefore when Herod was displeased with them, and they stood in need of his favour, in order to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining it, <hi>they made</hi> Blastus <hi>the Kings Chamberlain their friend,</hi> Act. 12.20. Now righteous Men, especially such as are eminently righteous and holy, are highly in favour with God. They are the objects of His singular love. Psal. 146 8. <hi>The Lord loves the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</hi> They are His Jewels. No Jewels are in such esteem with Men as the righteous are with God. A few of them are more valued by Him, than Millions of other Men. Since they are precious in His sight, and that He Loves them, He sayes, <hi>He gave men for their Life, and Egypt, &amp; Ethiopia</hi> for an handful of His People. How many were those Egyptians, and Ethiopians, and Assyrians whom God gave for the Life of the People whom He Loved? When Pharaoh with his Egyptians followed the Israelites into
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:001838_0019_0FB916CD98BDB5B0"/>
the red Sea, the Jewish Historian says, There was in that Army Fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Horses, and two hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Foot: They were all drowned that the Lords People might be Saved. We know from the Scripture, that in the Etheopian Army, in <hi>Asa's</hi> time, there were a Million. And what an Army had the Assyrians? When God sent an Angel to kill an hundred four-score and five thousand of them in one Night. And all this for the Life of those whom He Loved, <hi>Isai.</hi> 43.3, 4. As for the righteous, their Persons are acceptable to God, &amp; the objects of His delight, therefore their Prayers are so too: Prov. 15.8. <hi>The Prayer of the Upright is his delight.</hi> Under the New Covenant God does not accept of first the Work &amp; then the Person: but first the Person, and then the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering. This we see in <hi>Cain &amp; Abel. Cains</hi> oblation was not accepted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was an Unbeliever and so
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:001838_0020_0FB916CFF539D6D8"/>
Unrighteous, but <hi>righteous Abel</hi> sound acceptance with God. Heb. 11.4. <hi>By faith Abel offered to God a more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Sacrifice than Cain, by which he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained witness that he was righteous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Quest. 2. <hi>Whence is it that the Lords Ears are open to the Prayers of the Righteous?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. It is from the gracious Nature of the blessed God. Exod. 20.27. <hi>I will hear for I am gracious.</hi> Gracious is His Name and Nature. When God did in a most wonderful manner make known His Name to <hi>Moses,</hi> He passed by before him, and proclaimed, the Lord, the Lord God <hi>Merciful &amp; Gracious, abundant in Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> Exod. 34.6. It is an Infinitely gracious Condescension in Him to look upon such Poor beggars as we are. <hi>He humbleth himself to behold the things in Heaven.</hi> How much
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:001838_0021_0FB916D158A00808"/>
more to behold such dust and ashes on the Earth! Besides, we are not only mean considered as Creatures, but we are Sinners. <hi>Peter</hi> fell down at Christs feet and said, <hi>Depart from me for I am a sinful man, O Lord,</hi> Luk. 5.8. God might say to the best of us, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part out of my presence, for you are Sinful Men, and shall not come near me. And as our Persons are Sinful, so are our Prayers also. There is iniquity in our holy things. Isai 64.6. <hi>We are all as an unclean thing, &amp; all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags.</hi> Our <hi>Righteousnesses,</hi> in the Plural number, not some of them, but <hi>all</hi> of them: They are but <hi>rags,</hi> nay <hi>filthy</hi> rags. If then God shall accept of us, or of any of our Services, it is wonderful and astonishing Grace.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Reason why the Ears of the Lord are open to the Prayers of the Righteous, is, because they Pray to Him in the Name of Christ. The
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:001838_0022_0FB916D2D8A4EA08"/>
Lords People Israel were taught this, when they were directed to Pray to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Temple. They were to <hi>spread forth their hands,</hi> that's a Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing posture, <hi>towards that house,</hi> 1 King. 8.38. Thence it was that <hi>Daniel</hi> when in Babylon his Windows being opened in his Chamber towards Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem, kneeled upon his knees and Prayed. He did not open his Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows towards the Kings Palace, that Men might not think that he Prayed to him, according to that Idolatrous decree of the Court of <hi>Persia,</hi> nor to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the East, as they that worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the Sun were wont to do, but to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Jerusalem, because of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples having been there, which was a Type of Christ. Prayers that comes in such a Name must needs find accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. For Jesus Christ the Son of God, is so dear to the Father, that He will deny Him nothing. He sayes, <hi>Thou hearest me alwayes,</hi> Joh. 11.22.
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:001838_0023_0FB916D458A56ED8"/>
On which account Christ might well say as He did to the Disciples, John. 16.23. <hi>Whatsoever you shall aks the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in my Name, he will give it you.</hi> To ask in Christ Name is to ask for His sake. When the righteous Pray, they do not present their Supplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons before God for the sake of their own righteousnesses or deservings, but only for Christs. Thus did the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi>: He said, <hi>Hear the Prayer of thy Servant, and his Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, for the Lords sake.</hi> Meaning for the sake of Christ, the <hi>Messiah</hi> that was to come into the World, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.17. To Pray in Christs Name is to ask by vertue of a Command from Him. If a Man goes to another by direction from one whom he has the greatest kindness for, and says, Such an one sent me, he bid me come to you with this request, he comes in his Name, and will be likely to speed, Thus when Believers come to God,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:001838_0024_0FB916D69B231138"/>
and say, Christ has Commanded me to Pray for daily Bread, and therefore I come to thee for Temporal Blessings so far as thou shalt see them conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for me, Christ has directed me to Pray for the forgiveness of my Sins, and for Sanctifying Grace, I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ask for these blessings as being appointed by thy Son my Saviour to ask for them; surely such Prayers will not be in vain. To Pray in Christs Name, is to Pray for the sake of the Merit of his blood. Christ said to His Disciples, <hi>Hitherto you have asked nothing in my Name,</hi> Joh. 16.24. because they had not asked any thing on the account of the Merit of Christs blood shed to purchase the Salvation of their Souls and the Audience of their Prayers. For altho' it is now an Article of our Christian Faith, that we are reconciled to God by the death of His Son, nor can any Man be Saved that does not believe it;
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:001838_0025_0FB916D8DCD20D40"/>
Nevertheless, the Disciples had but a dark knowledge of this Mystery before the Death and Resurrection of our Saviour. His blood has Merited all the good promised in the Covenant of Grace; It is <hi>the blood of the Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Covenant.</hi> The Sins of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers cry against them, but the blood of Christ has a louder cry in it for Mercy. It speaks better things than the blood of Abel. They may with Faith in that blood be humbly confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that their Prayers shall be heard and answered. Heb. 10.19. <hi>Having boldness by the blood of Jesus to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the holiest of all.</hi> When we Pray, <hi>We enter into the holiest of all.</hi> Only the High Priest entred into the holiest of all, and that but once a year, but the Believer may every day by Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er enter into the holiest of all, with confidence of acceptance, through the Merit of the blood of Jesus.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:001838_0026_0FB916DA58B393F0"/>3. Christ in Heaven intercedes for Believers that their Prayers may be heard. Heb. 6.25. <hi>He ever lives to make intercession for them that come to God by him.</hi> Praying is coming to God. When the Priest was offering Incense in the Temple, the People were Praying without in the Time of Incense, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.10. Thus when Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers are Praying here on Earth, Christ our High Priest is in Heaven offering the Incense of His own Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit &amp; Mediation. <hi>John</hi> saw an Angel unto whom was given much Incense, that he should offer it with the Prayers of all Saints; and the smoke of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense which came with the Prayers of the Saints, ascended up before God, out of the Angels hand, <hi>Rev.</hi> 8 3, 4. Christ is that Angel; It is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the Incense which comes out of the Angels hand, that the Prayers of Saints are pleasing and prevalent with God. There is much infirmity
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:001838_0027_0FB916DBD8AB4EC0"/>
attending the Prayers of Saints on Earth, and that which make them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>savory. How then shall the Lord be pleased with them, or smell a sweet savour in our Oblations? It is the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense which Christ offers to God, that takes away the ill savour of our Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Prayers, and makes them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come adoriferous in the Lords Nostrils. From thence it is, that <hi>the Prayers of the Saints are golden vials full of odours,</hi> Rev. 5.8. If Christ in Heaven shall say, There is such a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of mine Praying for such a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, I would have his Prayers gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, it will certainly be done.</p>
            <p>Before we proceed to the Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Doctrine, there is an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to be answered. It is this.</p>
            <p>The Lords Servants complain that He turns a deaf Ear upon them, and will not hear their Prayers. How then is it said, that His Ears are open to the Prayers of the Righteous?
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:001838_0028_0FB916DD58A74F50"/>
Does not holy <hi>Job</hi> say, <hi>I cry unto thee and thou doest not hear me, I stand up, viz</hi> to Pray, for, standing as well as kneeling is a Praying posture, <hi>&amp; thou regardest me not,</hi> Job 30.20. Do not the Lords People make a sorrowful complaint: Psal. 30.4. <hi>How long wilt then be angry against the Prayer of thy People.</hi> And is it not among the Churches Lamentations, <hi>When I cry and shout, he shutteth out my Prayer; Thou hast covered thy self with a cloud that our Prayer should not pass through</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Lam. 3.8, 44.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The Lord does many times hear the Prayers of His People, when they themselves are not sensible of it.</p>
            <p>For, 1. He does not always give the thing Prayed for immediately, when their Prayer is graciously accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and in due time they shall receive what they have begged for. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times indeed God hears the Prayers of His Servants, and answers them
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:001838_0029_0FB916E0380961F8"/>
forth-with. They no sooner speak but speed. Nay, it may be when they do but purpose to Pray, He is so gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious as to prevent them with His blessings. Isai. 65.24. <hi>Before they call I will answer, and while they are yet speaking I will hear.</hi> So it was with <hi>Daniel, While he was speaking &amp; pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing &amp; presenting his supplication before God, yea, whilst he was speaking in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> God sent an Angel to acquaint him that his Prayer was heard, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.20, 21. But it is not thus always. The Lord for wise and holy ends de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers the Answer when He intends to give the thing Prayed for. It may be there is one repulse after another to try the Faith of His Servants, as it was with the Woman of Canaan. Sometimes to exercise their Patience, as it was with <hi>Job.</hi> Let them wait patiently, and the Answer will come at last, and in the best time, and will not be delayed a day beyond that.

Hab. 2 3. <hi>The Vision is for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak and not lye, though it tarry, wait for it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it will surely come it will not tarry.</hi> And it may be the longer it is before it comes, the greater will be the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing in it. Possibly we are not for the present fit to receive the Mercy we Pray for. <hi>The Lord waits that he may be gracious,</hi> Isai. 30.18. He waits to see when His Servants will be duely prepared for the blessing they Pray for, and then He will graciously ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer them. There has been many a Child of God that has Prayed and Waited long for a Mercy, and when it has come at last, they have seen, that if it had come as soon as they Prayed for it, they would not have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaned themselves suitably under it, not so humbly and so thankfully as they ought to have done. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, it may be there is some Sin lies in the way, and stops the answer of
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:001838_0031_0FB916E818058558"/>
Prayer for the present. No doubt but <hi>Joshua</hi> and the Lords People with him, Prayed for success in their Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition against <hi>Ai,</hi> but they were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed; it was then said, <hi>Israel has sinned, destroy the accursed from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you,</hi> Josh. 7.11, 12. After that an Answer came.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Lords Servants are apt to mistake and think their Prayers are not Answered, because not in the very thing which they Pray for, whenas He gives them something else instead thereof, which is better for them; sometimes, yea, many times God grants to the Righteous, the very bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings they have been pleading for. So he did to <hi>Jabez.</hi> He called upon God, saying, <hi>Oh that thou wouldst bless me indeed, and inlarge my coast, &amp; keep me from evil that it may not grieve me; and God granted him that which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quested,</hi> 1 Chron. 4.10. And thus it was with <hi>Hannah,</hi> She said, <hi>For this
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:001838_0032_0FB916E958BBB9E0"/>
Child I prayed, &amp; the Lord has given me the Petition which I asked of him,</hi> 1 Sam. 1.27. But the Lord does not always Answer the Prayers of the Righteous; in <hi>Specie sea in valore,</hi> in the thing which they ask, but in something else, which is more valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. And then He fulfils his promise in hearing their Prayers. If a Man does promise another a hundred Pound, but in stead of that gives him a thousand, he is as good as his word. Thus when God sees meet not to grant to His Children that particular blessing they Pray for, He useth to give them something else of far great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er worth. <hi>Moses</hi> pray'd, that he might go into the Land of Canaan, and that he might <hi>see the goodly Mountain which was there,</hi> Deut. 3.25. The Jewish Expositors suppose that he intended <hi>Mount Moriah,</hi> where <hi>Abraham</hi> offered <hi>Isaac,</hi> &amp; where afterwards the Temple was built. God would not hear him,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:001838_0033_0FB916EAD97E0040"/>
but bid him Speak no more to Him of that matter; but then God gave him to enter into Heaven of which the goodly Land of Canaan was a Type, and therefore the <hi>goodliest Mountain</hi> in all the Creation of God. Heaven is so. The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> being exercised with sore Temptations, pray'd again, and again, that that messenger of Satan might depart from him, but it was not so for some time. Only in Answer to his Prayer, God told him that a sufficiency of Grace should be vouch-safed to him to support him, and carry him well thro' his Temptations, which was a greater Mercy than a present deliverance. The Righteous when in affliction pray for deliverance, God gives them Patience &amp; that's better. They pray for Temporal blessings, and God answers their Prayers in Spiritual blessings, which are a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Times better.</p>

               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:001838_0034_0FB916ED19283368"/>We proceed to the <hi>Application</hi> of the Truth before us. Let the first USE be for <hi>Information.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>Inf.</hi> 1. If the Ears of the Lord are open to the Prayers of the Righteous, then certainly <hi>it is wisdom to desire and obtain an interest in the Prayers of such.</hi> Abimeleck was directed by the Lord Himself to desire Abrahams Prayers for him. God said to him concerning Abraham, <hi>He is a Prophet, he shall Pray for thee, and thou shalt live,</hi> Gen. 20.7. When Abimeleck and all his Family was sick, in Answer to Abrahams Prayers they were heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>Eliphaz</hi> &amp; his two friends were bid to apply themselves to <hi>Job,</hi> that he might Pray for them. And if <hi>Job</hi> had not done so it would have fared ill with them, <hi>Job</hi> 42.8, 9. And the Prayers not only of the most E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent Servants of God, such as A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham and Job, who have a singular interest in Heaven, but of others also,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:001838_0035_0FB916F204C786A8"/>
if they are righteous Persons are to be valued. For <hi>the Prayer of a righteous Man availeth much,</hi> Jam. 5.16. The most eminent Servants of God may need the Prayers of those who are much inferiour to them. How often do we hear a Great Apostle, not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to the chief of the Apostles, begging for the Prayers of other Christians, notwithstanding he was himself no stranger to Prayer. To the <hi>Ephesians</hi> he says, <hi>Pray for me,</hi> Eph. 6.19. And he hoped for benefit by the Prayers of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> for him, 2 Cor. 1.11. <hi>You helping by Prayer for us.</hi> And to the <hi>Philippians</hi> he says, I know that shall <hi>turn to my salvation through your Prayer,</hi> Phil. 1.19. And to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> he says, <hi>Pray for us, I beseech you the rather to do it, that I may be restored to you the sooner,</hi> Heb. 13.18, 19. They that care not for the Prayers of righteous Men are worse than Pharaoh, who desired <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:001838_0036_0FB916F4A0135590"/>
&amp; <hi>Aaron</hi> to <hi>intreat the Lord</hi> for him. And worse than <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> who when he heard what sad things were like to befall him, said to <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> Act. 8.24. <hi>Pray ye to the Lord for me, that none of these things which you have spoken may come upon me.</hi> It is a very great Mercy to have an Interest in the Prayers of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous. There have been those in the World, (and there are such) who owed their lives to the Prayers of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers for them. It has been related concerning our <hi>English Josiah</hi> (as he has been by some deservedly called) King <hi>Edward</hi> VI. That when his Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, for whom he had a great value, was dangerously sick, enquiring of his welfare, he was told that he was a dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man, the Physicians had given him over; You are mistaken (said that excellent Prince) <hi>I have this Morning on my knees begged his Life from God, and I have obtained it, he shall not dy<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="27" facs="unknown:001838_0037_0FB916F618B2F3C8"/>
and he did strangly recover and live. When <hi>Myconius</hi> (one of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Divines in <hi>Germany</hi>) was in all appearance a dying Man, being far gone in a Consumption, <hi>Luther</hi> set himself to Pray earnestly for him, that his life might be spared, and he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the continuance of that useful and precious Life, so that <hi>Myconius</hi> would often say, that under God he owed his life to <hi>Luthers</hi> Prayers for him.</p>
            <p n="2">Inf. 2. <hi>It is a dangerous thing for any Person or People to have the Prayers of the Righteous, whose Prayers God will hear, to be ingaged against them.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the two Witnesses it is said, <hi>If any man will hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their Mouth &amp; devoureth their Enemies,</hi> Rev. 11.5. Prayer will kill those Enemies, as it did those Captains and their Companies who came to apprehend the Prophet Elijah. Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Prayer is doubtless one thing in
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:001838_0038_0FB916F859732EB8"/>
that fire which proceeds out of the Mouth of the Witnesses. It is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of a Queen in <hi>Scotland,</hi> that She said, She was more afraid of Mr. <hi>Knox</hi> his Prayers, than of an Army of ten thousand Men. And 'tis said of a Prince in <hi>Wales</hi> that being advised to ingage in a War with another Prince, that was famous for his Religion, he declined it, saying he was afraid of his Prayers. Armies have fallen before the Power of Prayer. When an Army of Philistines came against the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Israel, <hi>Samuel cryed to the Lord for Israel, and the Lord heard him and thundred with a great thunder that day, and discomfited them,</hi> 1 Sam. 7.9, 10. Whatever the World may think of it, Prayer is more terrible than thunder. When in <hi>Jehosaphats</hi> time three Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions combined against an handful of the Lords People, that godly King was very sensible that he had not a might sufficient to go against so great a Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:001838_0039_0FB916FACD7720D8"/>
of Enemies; but he set himself to seek the Lord, and proclaimed a Fast throughout all Judah, to seek the Lord and ask help of him, and poured out servent Prayer before him. Those Prayers routed all their Enemies, so that they needed not to strike a stroke, but to stand still, and see the Salvation of God: This hath Prayer done. Once more, in <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> time, when <hi>Sennacherib</hi> came against him with a formidable Army of Assyrians, Hezekiah betook himself to the old tried weapon of Prayer, and desired the Prophet Isaiah to joyn with him, those Prayers slew an hundred and fourscore &amp; five thousand Assyrians in one Night. As for the Enemies of God and His Church in these latter days, Vials of wrath must be poured on them, until they are utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed. It is said of those Vials, that the Angels who are the Instruments of Providence in executing the wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:001838_0040_0FB916FCDA3DD988"/>
Judgments contained therein, <hi>Come out of the Temple,</hi> Rev. 15 6. Now the Temple is the house of Prayer. It is the Prayers which are made in the Temple that bring down the Seven Plagues of the Vials on the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian Generation. O what Praying will there be when that time is come!</p>
            <p>USE. II. <hi>Let it be for Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whether our Prayers are such as that we may have reason humbly to hope that they shall find acceptance with God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> How may we judge concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that? What are the signs of a Prayer that will be surely Answered and not return in vain?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. If the Spirit of God helps us to believe as well as pray; such a Prayer does not use to miscarry, Jam. 5.15. <hi>The Prayer of Faith shall heal the sick</hi> If it is indeed Faith and not Presumption or Delusion it will have a blessed effect. David when greatly
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:001838_0041_0FB916FE58D4BC38"/>
afflicted could say, <hi>I have believed therefore have I spoken,</hi> Psal. 116.10. He believed that God could &amp; would deliver, therefore did he speak accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, not to others only, but to God in Prayer. We often hear him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing his Faith: Psal. 4.3. <hi>The Lord will hear when I call unto him.</hi> And, 6.9. <hi>The Lord will receive my Prayer.</hi> When Asa believed and relied upon God, that Prayer of Faith was more powerful than a Million of Armed Men. A Prophet some time after when he was too diffident &amp; unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, put him in mind of his former Faith. 2 Chron. 16 8. <hi>Were not the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopians a huge host, yet because thou diast rely on the Lord, he delivered them into thy hand.</hi> The Believer by Faith takes hold on the Almighty arm of God. And then what can he not do? What Evil can he not prevent? What Mercy can he not obtain? Isai. 27.5. <hi>Let him take hold of my strength that he
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:001838_0042_0FB91700A8A32320"/>
may make peace with me, and he shall make peace with me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. An holy importunity in Prayer is many times a sign that the Prayer will be Answered. When the Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant at the Throne of Grace will not be discouraged, but resolves to hold on still praying and waiting, and wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and praying, it is to be hoped that the Mercy will come at last, and the longer it is prayed and waited for, the greater will the Mercy be when it comes. When Elijah Prayed for Rain, he sent his Servant to see if there were any Cloud, or sign of Rain, he brought word that there was none; go again Seven times, sayes he. Thus when there is a resolution to pray Seven times, will not the Lord incline His Ear and hear? This Christ has confirmed by diverse Parables. One is that of a Man that having Guests come to him, and nothing to entertain them with, goes to his friend at Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night,
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:001838_0043_0FB91704689FD760"/>
night, &amp; prays him to lend him three Loaves; his friend said to him trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble me not, I cannot rise &amp; give thee, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.7. but then in the 8. verse 'tis said, <hi>Though he will not rise &amp; give him because he is his friend, yet because of his importunity he will rise &amp; give him as many as he needs.</hi> So sayes the Lord, Do you be importunate in Prayer, especially for Spiritual bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings, and doubt not but God will give you what you ask for. Another Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to this purpose is that in the Eighteenth Chapter of <hi>Luke,</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the unjust Judge and the poor Widow, who cryed to him for Justice. That he had no mind to, yet said, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this Widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me,</hi> verse 5. Now God is a righteous Judge, we may therefore conclude that He will avenge His own Elect that cry to Him day and night, altho' He may in their apprehension
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:001838_0044_0FB91705D9C59860"/>
bear long, He will avenge them spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily. When the Believer will take no denial from God, it is a sign that God will Answer his Prayers. This we see in Jacob, when he wrestled with the Angel that appeared unto him in the form of a Man, which Angel was the Lord God of Hosts, the Lord is his Memorial, <hi>Hos.</hi> 12.5. Therefore he was Christ, Let me go says Christ, Jacob replied, <hi>I will not let thee go ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept thou bless me,</hi> Gen. 32.26. Then he had power with God and prevailed. Another instance to this purpose is that of the Woman of Canaan, who cryed to Christ for Mercy, but He ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered her not a word; yet she would hold on praying. The Disciples be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sought Christ that He would send her away, give her, what she would have, that we may be no more troubled with her. Then Christ said to her, I am not sent but to the lost Sheep of the house of Israel. I am sent to Preach
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:001838_0045_0FB91708813B5690"/>
and Work Miracles only among the Jews, but you are none of them Thou art a Gentile, and among the Canaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites, and dost thou think I will work a Miracle for thee? Here was a plain repulse, yet does she continue crying to Christ for help. Then Christ seems to give her a sharper denial. Tells her that the Gentiles were dogs. And shall I give the Childrens bread to dogs. I confess (said she) I am a dog, but may not a dog have a crumb that falls from his Masters Table? So that there was no repelling of her, but Mercy she would have from Christ. And what an Answer did the Lord give to this Importunate Prayer? The Answer was, <hi>Be it unto thee even as thou wilt,</hi> Mat. 15.28.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A Christian may judge some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing whether his Prayers shall be heard, by the frame of his heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore duty, and in the duty, and after it. If before he poureth out his Soul
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:001838_0046_0FB91709A0816940"/>
to the Lord, God prepares him by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his heart into a suitable humble praying frame, that's a sign that his Prayer shall be heard: Psal. 10.17. <hi>Thou hast heard the desire of the humble, thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine Ear to hear.</hi> And if in the duty there is an holy fervency wrought in the heart by the Spirit of God, its a sign that the Prayer will be prevalent. Jam 5.16. <hi>The effectual fervent Prayer of a righteous man availeth much.</hi> When a Man Prayeth like an holy <hi>Energon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> like a man possessed and acted by the holy Spirit which is the Spirit of Prayer, such Prayers do not use to fall to the ground; no, they pierce the Heavens. As 'tis said of a Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er once made by the Priests &amp; Levites, <hi>Their voice was heard, and their Prayer came up to his holy dwelling Place, even unto heaven,</hi> 2 Chron. 30.27. We read concerning Cain and Abel that <hi>Abels</hi> offering found acceptance with God,
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:001838_0047_0FB9170D5A29DC58"/>
but Cains did not, at which he was very angry. But how was this known? No doubt but there was some visible sign of it. The Hebrew Doctors say that fire came from Heaven and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed Abels Oblations, but not Cains. It is very probable that it was so. For this was an usual sign of Divine accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. When Solomon made an end of Praying at the Dedication of the Temple, fire came down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and consumed the Sacrifices. So it was at Elijahs Prayer on Mount Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 18.38. Thus when God by His holy Spirit does fire our Spiritual Sacrifices, it is a sign of His being pleased with them. And if after Prayer the troubled Spirit is compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and easy having left the matter with God, waiting quietly for a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious answer in Gods good time. Thus the Prophet Habbakuk, having Pray'd he said, <hi>I will stand upon my watch, I will watch to see what he will say to me,</hi>
               <pb n="38" facs="unknown:001838_0048_0FB9170ED982DA70"/>
Hab. 2.1. A blessed sign this is that a gracious Answer is coming Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Church says, <hi>I will wait for the God of my salvation, my God will hear me.</hi> This we see in that godly praying Woman, <hi>Hannah,</hi> in the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terness of her Soul she prayed to the Lord and wept sore, she poured out her Soul before the Lord, and after that <hi>her Countenance was no more sad,</hi> 1 Sam. 1.18. This was a sign that her Prayer was heard, and her Tears put in the Lords bottle.</p>
            <p n="3">USE. III. <hi>This Doctrine is an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to be Instant in Prayer.</hi> Let the righteous Pray without cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, considering that the Ears of the Lord are open to their Prayers.</p>
            <p>Quest. <hi>For what, or for whom ought we to be Instant in Prayer</hi>?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. We ought to be Instant in Prayer <hi>for the Church of God. Pray for
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:001838_0049_0FB91711ACF77D68"/>
the Peace of Jerusalem, they shall pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per that love thee.</hi> We should Pray that the implacable Enemies of Christ and his Church may fall and perish and rise no more. Especially the great enemy <hi>Antichrist.</hi> Mystical Babylon is as sure to fall as if it were done already. Therefore is it expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed twice and in the present tense im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting the undoubted certainty of it. <hi>Babylon is fallen, is fallen,</hi> Rev. 18.2. And then and not till then, the Church on Earth will have a glorious day. <hi>Glorious things are spoken of thee O City of God. Selah.</hi> The Scripture must be fulfilled, that there shall be no more a pricking brier unto the house of Israel, nor any grievious thorn of all of that are round about them. And not only so, but an universal dominion over the whole Earth shall be given to them, for which nothing can be more express and clear than that Scripture, in Dan. 7.27. <hi>The Kingdom
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:001838_0050_0FB917129DE9A378"/>
and Dominion, and greatness of the Kingdom (<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>)</hi> under <hi>the whole heaven shall be given to the People of the Saints of the Most High.</hi> It ought to quicken our Prayers that the time draws on apace when the Prophecies and Promises concerning the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Church in the last dayes shall be fulfilled. When <hi>Daniel</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood by Books that the Seventy Years of Captivity was well nigh ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished, he set himself to Pray a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it after an extraordinary manner. Several very Learned Men, have thought that this Year which we are now entring upon, would prove hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily fatal to the Antichristian Interest in the World. Whoever lives a few Months longer will see whether they are not mistaken. Several things are very encouraging; Namely, the Death of the Most <hi>Antichristian King,</hi> than whom there never was a greater enemy of the Church of God in the
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:001838_0051_0FB91716706A60F0"/>
World; and it is said that he that is the present <hi>Regent</hi> in France is more favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the Protestants there; And in that God has given to our Nation a Protestant KING, who is a professed enemy of Persecution and of Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors. These are hopeful signs that God will shake once more not Earth only, but Heaven also. But if the Wheel should begin to turn, we may not think that all will be overturned at once. <hi>Rome</hi> was not built in a day, nor will the last Plagues of it be over in a day, tho' in a short time. The downfall of Antichrist has by some been predicted to be in such a Year, and then in such a Year. In Sixty six and in Seventy seven, and in other Years. Yet he is standing still, which has occasioned many to deride all Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions of that nature as delusions. They are ready to say as <hi>Ezekiels</hi> Jews did, the days are prolonged, and every vision faileth, but truly that is
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:001838_0052_0FB91717D9501E28"/>
a sign, that <hi>the dayes are at hand, and the effect of every vision,</hi> Ezek. 12.23. Lets turn all into Prayer.</p>
            <p>And shall we not be Instant in Prayer for our own most sinful Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is under the guilt of bloody crimes, and yet has had Miraculous deliverances. When was there a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (except the Jewish) that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested a greater contempt of the Gospel? What shall we say when near upon two Thousand Ministers of God were silenced in one black day? Was there ever Nation that declared a greater Enmity against being a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Nation,</hi> when a Covenant for Reformation was burnt after the most ignominious manner that possibly could be? And is there not a cry of Innocent blood! In some of the late unhappy Reigns were not Lives, and some of them of Eminent Men taken away by forms of Law, just as <hi>Naboths</hi> was in the days of <hi>Ahab,</hi> and not one
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:001838_0053_0FB9171A0F56E528"/>
of those Murderers call'd to any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count? How many hundreds have dyed in Prisons for their Religion in the time of the <hi>Caroline Persecution</hi>? And has there not been a National Profanation of the blood of Christ, by means of a <hi>Sacramental Test? Pareus</hi> said to the <hi>Heydelbergians,</hi> that he did not wonder at the War &amp; Blood shed in <hi>Germany,</hi> when he considered how the blood of the Son of God was profa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by admitting wicked men to the Lords Table. And does not the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion seem to be incorrigible under the dispensations of God? National Judgments have come upon us. Was it not so when one hundred thousand were swept out of one City by the Pestilence in one Year? And when in the next Year that Capital City was set on fire and thirteen thousand Houses burnt to the ground. And has not God tryed the Nation with Mercies and Deliverances? How
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:001838_0054_0FB9171AD9661B10"/>
great a Mercy was the <hi>Revolution</hi> Twenty-eight Years ago, when Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery and Slavery was coming in like a flood, but that Providence gave a check to it. And when not two Years ago, the Nation was in the hands of treacherous Ministers who betrayed it to the French King, and the way was paved for a Popish Pretender to come to the Throne, GOD by one Death has made a mighty change in Three Kingdoms, and instead of a Queen has given us a wise KING: but an ungrateful Generation has not been Thankful to GOD for so great a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of Heaven, to a sinful Nation. A wicked sort of men who assume and arrogate to themselves the Name of <hi>the Church,</hi> but are enemies to the true Church of CHRIST, have joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Papists, and have laid waste the Houses in which the Lords Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants used to worship Him; <hi>They have burnt the Synagogues of God,</hi> and have
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:001838_0055_0FB9171F1B52CBF8"/>
risen up in Rebellion against the King whom GOD has set over them, and who is without flattery and without reflection on any Prince the best King living on the face of the Earth. We may by Prayer to the Almighty be instrumental in subduing those Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels and Enemies, to their King and Country. <hi>So let thine Enemies perish, O Lord</hi>!</p>
            <p>And shall we not be Instant in Prayer for <hi>New-England?</hi> And for those that are to succeed us, that they may Know and Serve the GOD of their Fathers. There is matter of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement before us from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of Gods gracious Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, which says, That <hi>His Spirit shall not depart from His Servants, nor from their Seed, nor their Seeds Seed,</hi> Isai. 59.21. And there is matter of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement if we Consider whom they are descended from. It has been the observation of some Divines
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:001838_0056_0FB917201A3A9D68"/>
that when in the last of those eight <hi>Beatitudes</hi> (as they are called) Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted ones are pronounced blessed twice over, it imports their being bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed not only in themselves, but again in their Posterity, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.12, 13. Many of the Children in <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> are the Posterity of those who have been Eminent Confessors and Sufferers in the Cause of Religion, and for the Purity of it. For that it was that they followed the Lord into this Land, when it was a Wilderness, and a Land not sown: will not God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that kindness to their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren after them? Also, the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which we have had of the Lords hearing Prayer, should Encourage us to be Instant therein. When Forty Years ago the whole Country was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in a dangerous War, with great Multitudes of Indians, we saw many very signal Answers of Prayer, which I thought it my duty in the time of
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:001838_0057_0FB9172255956FB8"/>
them, to take Notice of and publish to the World. And so has it been all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long. No longer since than a Year &amp; half ago, we were in eminent danger of a Famine, by reason of a drought of long continuance. We set apart the Second day of the Seventh Month, to be a day of Solemn Prayer, immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God sent gentle showers, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued from day to day, so that the fruits of the Earth were wonderfully and beyond expectation revived, and a comfortable Harvest followed. Ought we not to remember such things, and thereby be Encouraged to Pray to that God whose Ears are open to the Prayers of the righteous?</p>
            <p>And shall we not be Encouraged to Pray for our Selves &amp; Families? who knows what Mercies we may obtain for them? It is related concerning an Eminently Pious Man in <hi>Scotland,</hi> that he said to an intimate friend of his, whom he could acquaint with the
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:001838_0058_0FB91723194BA1B8"/>
secrets of his Soul, <hi>This day I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained Mercy from God, not only for my Self but for all Mine.</hi> And it was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served that all his Children were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable for their godliness.</p>
            <p>To Conclude, since the Lords Ears are open to the Prayers of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, Let us make sure that we be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Righteous,</hi> whose character is, <hi>Faith &amp; Holiness.</hi> And let us Love and Serve that God who hears our Prayers, and resolve (by His help) to Live a Life of Praise and Prayer as long as we shall live. I finish with the words of the Psalmist: Psal. 116.1, 2. <hi>I love the Lord: because he hath heard my voice, and my supplications<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Because he hath inclined his Ear unto me: therefore will I call upon him as long as I live.</hi>

               </epigraph>
               <p>IN this verse, we have an assertion and a supposition. (1) An As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion in the former part of it, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>an hoary head is a crown of glory,</hi> h. e. a crown that does adorn and honour the Person on whom it is. By the <hi>hoary head</hi> Old Age is meant, that being an usual sign &amp; symptom accompanying Old Age. The words are a Metaphor alluding to Kings, or great Personages that have Crowns and Diadems set on their heads, on the account whereof respect and honour
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:001838_0060_0FB91727990AFAF0"/>
is given to them. The great Men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to <hi>Niniveh</hi> are called, <hi>Their Crowned,</hi> Nah. 3.17. They that have an hoary head, God has set a <hi>Crown</hi> on their heads which calls for respect. (2) There is a supposition in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of the verse, <hi>If</hi> ('tis said) <hi>it is found in the way of righteousness.</hi> There is indeed no <hi>If</hi> in the Hebrew Original, whence some Interpreters take the meaning of the words to be, that they who walk in the way of righteousness, shall be honoured with living to Old Age, when the wicked shall have their days shortned, which indeed many times happen to be so yet not always. But if we take the <hi>if</hi> in our translation as Explanatory, they import that it is most honourable when there is a Conjunction of Age and Righteousness together in the same Person. Not that there is no honour due to Age if righteousness is wanting, but that then especially it is
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:001838_0061_0FB91729197C46D8"/>
a crown and glory; accordingly the <hi>Doctrine</hi> to be insisted on from the words, is,</p>
               <p>DOCT. <hi>That there is an honour due to Old Age, especially when found in a way of Righteousness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Doctrine may be opened and confirmed in Two Propositions, both which are contained in it.</p>
               <p>PROP. 1. <hi>That Old Age is honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi> It ought to be revered and honoured. The Scripture declares it to be honourable. Isai. 9.15. <hi>The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient &amp; the honourable he is the head.</hi> If he is Ancient he is on that account honourable. As a Man that has a Crown or Diadem set on his head is therefore regarded. The <hi>hoary head</hi> is a crown of glory. Prov.20.29. <hi>The beauty of Old Men is the gray head.</hi> Several things may be mentioned
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:001838_0062_0FB9172A98F9A958"/>
which will confirm &amp; clear the Truth before us.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>GOD is the Author of this Crown.</hi> It is to be respected considering from whom it comes. Indeed the Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Old Age are the effect of Sin, but Age it self comes from none but God. Deut. 30.20. <hi>He is thy Life and the length of thy dayes.</hi> God said to Solomon, <hi>If thou wilt keep my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, I will lengthen thy days,</hi> 1 King.3.14. If any Man is favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with long life, it is God that has lengthened his days. As life is ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally from Him, so is the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of it to Old Age. Considering the many dangers which attend Men, not only by diseases, but by innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable accidents, it is a marvellous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence that upholds a frail life to Old Age. Psal. 66.9. <hi>O bless our God, which holds our Soul in Life.</hi> Our Souls and Life had been taken from us, if God had not held it. The Apostle
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:001838_0063_0FB9172CD05AEB90"/>
ascribes the continuance of his Life to the Power &amp; Providence of God. Act. 26 22. <hi>Having obtained help from God, I continue to this day.</hi> Altho' life may be lengthened by the use of natural means, in special great Temperance has a natural tendency to prolong Life, and to preserve from diseases, nevertheless Men cannot by all the art they can use keep themselves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live for a few dayes. If then any Man shall attain unto Old Age, it is because God has redeemed his Life from destruction, and has <hi>Crowned him</hi> with loving Kindness and tender Mercy.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>GOD has put honour upon Age.</hi> He has so by requiring others to shew respect to it. The Word of God has said, <hi>Rebuke not an Elder, but entreat him as a Father,</hi> 1 Tim 5.1. It is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from the next verse, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle by an <hi>Elder</hi> in that Place does not mean an <hi>Elder</hi> in respect of Office,
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:001838_0064_0FB9172D98F3A260"/>
but an <hi>Ancient Man.</hi> If there is cause to reprove him, you must consider that he is a Father, and therefore not to use harsh language, but to treat him with that decency that becomes his <hi>Senio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> and in respect of Age <hi>Superiority.</hi> The Commandment of God is very solemn &amp; awful, in Levit. 19.32. <hi>Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head, and honour the face of the Old Man, &amp; fear thy God, I am the Lord.</hi> Rising up is a sign of honour. Therefore <hi>Solomon</hi> when he saw his Mother coming to him rose up and bowed himself in to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of a reverential respect always due to a Parent, especially to an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Parent. The Hebrew Writers say, that among them, if an <hi>hoary headed Man,</hi> came within four Cubits of him that was sitting, he was to rise up and not to sit down again until the Old Man was past him, such reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence had they for the face of the Old Man. And where do we find a more
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:001838_0065_0FB9172F19708ED8"/>
solemn charge in all the Scripture, than this of honouring the Old Man? God sayes as ever you would mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest the fear of My Name to be in your hearts, honour the face of the Old Man. If you do it not, you do not fear Me, you do not acknowledge Me to be the Lord, if you make no Conscience of this Commandment. Moreover, God has put honour upon Old Age by Promising it as a great favour &amp; blessing. Psal. 91.16. <hi>With long life will I satisfy him.</hi> It is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised as a reward of Obedience to the Commandment of God. He said to His People Israel, <hi>You shall walk in all the ways which the Lord your God hath Commanded you, that you may live and that you may prolong your dayes,</hi> Deut. 5 33. How often in the Scripture, &amp; especially in the Proverbs of <hi>Solomon,</hi> are such Promises inculcated thereby to Encourage Obedience. Prov. 3.1, 2. <hi>Keep my Commandments, for length of
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:001838_0066_0FB91731767F7A20"/>
days &amp; long life shall they add unto thee.</hi> And Chap. 4.10. <hi>Receive my sayings, and the years of thy life shall be many.</hi> In special, long life is promised as a reward for Obedience to the Fifth Commandment Eph. 1.2, 3. <hi>Children obey your Parents in the Lord, for this is right; honour thy Father &amp; Mother, which is the first Commandment with promise, that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayst live long on the Earth.</hi> Long life is spoken of as a greater blessing than the Riches and Honours of the World. It is said of Wisdom, That <hi>length of dayes are in her right hand, &amp; in her left handriches &amp; honour,</hi> Prov. 3.16. The preference is given to long life, that's the right-hand blessing. And this is promised as a blessing that shall attend the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py times on the Earth yet to come. Isai 65.20. <hi>There shall be no more thence an Infant of dayes, nor an old man that has not filled his days, for the Child shall
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:001838_0067_0FB91732D8F6E268"/>
dye on hundred years old.</hi> Yea, it is promised as a blessing to a Town that there shall be Old Men, and Old Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in it. Zech. 8.4. <hi>There shall be Old Men &amp; Old Women dwell in the Streets of Jerusalem, &amp; every man with his staff in his hand for very age.</hi> He shall need a staff to support him, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of Sickness, but because of his great Age. And the removal of Aged Persons out of the World, is mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as a Judgment, and a sad <hi>Omen</hi> to the Places where they had lived and saved God. The Lord threatned His People that he would <hi>take from them the Prudent &amp; the Ancient,</hi> Isai 3.2. And it is spoken of as an heavy Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on a Family, that none of that family should live to Old Age. So was it said to <hi>Eli, There shall not be an Old man in thy house,</hi> 1 Sam. 2 31. Now God by promising long life as a blessing, and threatning shortness of days as a Judgment, has put honour upon Old Age.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="58" facs="unknown:001838_0068_0FB917359D0594A8"/>3. <hi>Aged Men have more Experience &amp; many times more Knowledge &amp; Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom than others have attained unto.</hi> It is presumed that Old Men know more than Younger ones who have not had their experience and advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. Wherefore the Apostle said, <hi>I have written unto you Fathers because you have known him that is from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.14. <hi>Job</hi> wondred <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> the rash and weak Judgment of his three friends, considering they were Old Men, and therefore should have been wiser: He said, Job 12.12. <hi>With the Ancient is wisdom, &amp; in length of days understanding.</hi> In verse 20. <hi>He takes away the understanding of the Aged.</hi> Which is not to be understood as if it were impossible for a Young Man to have wisdom. <hi>Elihu</hi> a Young Man discovered more Wisdom in his discourses than three Old Men. It was said to <hi>Solomon</hi> when he was Young, <hi>Thou art a wise Man</hi> &amp; knowest what
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:001838_0069_0FB9173699297B88"/>
thou oughtest to do, 1 <hi>King</hi> 2.9. Some by singular advantage of Education have gained a great deal of wisdom in a little time. Nor have gray hairs engrossed this commodity of Wisdom, <hi>Great men</hi> are not always wise, as was said. So neither are <hi>Old Men</hi> always wise, <hi>Job</hi> 32.9. <hi>Neither do the aged un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand Judgment.</hi> Wisdom (sayes <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> to be asserted. (1.) That Aged Persons have had greater advantages than others to gain Knowledge and Wisdom. And it is a great shame to whom, if they have not done so. <hi>Senex Elementaris,</hi> an A, B, C, Old Man is a despicable Creature. (2.) It must be asserted, that many times Old Men excel in Wisdom. That expression of Davids: Psal. 119.100. <hi>I understand more than the Ancients, because I keep
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:001838_0070_0FB9173A6E130370"/>
thy Precepts,</hi> imports that Ancient Men use to understand more than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. This <hi>Elibu</hi> was sensible of. Therefore he said to some Ancient Men, <hi>I am young, &amp; you are very old, wherefore I durst not shew you mine opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, I said days should speak, &amp; multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Years should teach wisdom,</hi> Job 32.6, 7. His words are Elegant and Rhetorical, that which belongs to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons is ascribed to Time. If Men have improved a Multitude of dayes and years well, they must needs be fitter to teach wisdom than they were before they had the experience of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years. Aged Persons are fittest to give counsil. It was the saying of a wise Man, That <hi>that City will be happy, that makes use of Young Mens Arms, &amp; follows the counsil of Old Men.</hi> What ruine did <hi>Rehoboam</hi> bring upon his Kingdom, he lost Ten Tribes of Twelve by forsaking the counsil of the Old Men, and counselling with the
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:001838_0071_0FB9173D5EF39580"/>
Young Men. That came of his hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tening to the counsel of <hi>green Heads,</hi> &amp; declining the counsil of <hi>gray Heads</hi>: Now if Old Age has wisdom accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying of it, then it is Venerable. It commands reverence. People fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Solomon when <hi>they saw that the wisdom of God was in him.</hi> It is a crown of glory, it is an Ornament to who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever has it. Prov. 14.18. <hi>The prudent are crowned with knowledge.</hi> Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astes says, that <hi>Wisdom makes a mans face to shine,</hi> Eccl. 8.1. It makes a Man Venerable &amp; Amiable. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is also said, Wisdom is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal thing when thou dost embrace her, <hi>she shall give to thine head an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament of Grace, &amp; a crown of glory shall she deliver to thee,</hi> Prov. 4.9.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>The light of Nature teacheth Men to honour Age.</hi> I remember Mr <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs</hi> in one of his Sermons, relates a Passage worthy of Commemoration, concerning several <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors,
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:001838_0072_0FB9173EDAE2B0C0"/>
who being in a Theater at <hi>Athens,</hi> when they saw an Aged grave Man coming altho' they knew him not, only because of his <hi>hoary head,</hi> they knew him to be Aged, they rose up &amp; bowed to him, the whole Theater admired &amp; applauded those Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors as Men worthy to be honoured themselves, for their shewing such Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration to an Aged Man, purely on the account of his great Age. It has been shewed that the People of God who had His Word to direct them, have given a preference to Age. When <hi>Moses</hi> needed some to be Coadjutors &amp; Assistants to him in Rule &amp; Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, God said to him, <hi>Gather Seventy men of the Elders of Israel whom thou knowest to be the Elders of the People,</hi> Numb. 11.16. Of such Elders their <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedrim</hi> or great Council did consist. Their Priests were Ecclesiastical Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, besides them, there were of other Tribes Civil Rulers; these are called
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:001838_0073_0FB9174174DE7068"/>
                  <hi>the Elders of the People.</hi> And in the Gospel, <hi>Pastors</hi> of Churches are called <hi>Elders.</hi> Act. 14.23. <hi>They Ordained El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in every Church.</hi> Such were to be either in respect of their Years El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, or to be endowed with the Knowledge, and Wisdom of Old Men. In which respect there may possibly be <hi>an Old Young Man.</hi> A Young Man that has the Seriousness, Piety, and Gravity of an Old Man, is a Young Old Man. The <hi>Rabbi</hi> said true, <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piens appellatur Senex, etiam si diebus sit exignis.</hi> But moreover, they that have not had the Scriptures, yet the Law written in their hearts by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, has directed them to give a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar respect and deference to Aged Men. In most Civilized Nations they have done so: They have thought such fittest to be trusted with the greatest and most honourable Offices, inasmuch as Age has given the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination to their Publick Councils.
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:001838_0074_0FB91742991639D8"/>
Among the Romans their Rulers had the Name of <hi>Senators</hi> as being <hi>Senes</hi> Old Men, and their Magistrates were called their <hi>Senate.</hi> So among the <hi>Spartans</hi> in Greece, their Publick Councils had the Name of <hi>Gerousia,</hi> which signifies a <hi>Senate.</hi> Such was their honour for Age as that it became a proverbial saying, <hi>It is good living to be an Old Man in</hi> Sparta, because the People in the City, did exceedingly respect and revere Old Men. In our Nation Magistrates have had the Name of <hi>Aldermen</hi> given to them, which word has respect to Age, impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>Elder-men.</hi> By all this it appears that they who honour not the <hi>hoary head,</hi> Sin against the light of Nature as well as against the light of Scripture.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Not to honour Age is a sign of great inhumanity &amp; barbarousness.</hi> It was predicted that the Apostate Children of Israel should for their Sins fall into the hands of a <hi>Nation with a fierce
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:001838_0075_0FB91746741BC090"/>
Countenance which would not regard the person of the Old,</hi> Deut. 28.50. Which was fulfilled when the inhumane Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans came upon them, who were bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish Men &amp; skilful to destroy. Their brutality and barbarity appeared in that they <hi>had no Compassion on the Old man,</hi> nor on him that was so old <hi>as to stoop for Age,</hi> 2 Chron. 36.17. This is twice mentioned in the Prophet <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiahs</hi> Lamentations, Chapter 4.16. <hi>They respected not the persons of the Priests, they favoured not the Elders.</hi> And 5.12. <hi>The faces of the Elders were not honoured.</hi> So inhumane were those Heathen.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>There is something of the Image of God in Age.</hi> The greater Seniority there is in any, the more does he in that respect approach to the Eternal God. It is said of Him, <hi>Neither can the number of his years be searched out,</hi> Job 36.26. In respect of their Age there is a stamp of God upon Old
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:001838_0076_0FB91747D9F90858"/>
Men, more than upon others. He is called <hi>the Ancient of Days,</hi> Dan. 7.9. And Christ in respect of His Eternity is represented as having <hi>his head &amp; his hair white like wooll, as white as snow,</hi> Rev. 1.14. Altho' all Ages put them all together are not a Moment to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, nevertheless, as to our Computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Old Age bears the fairest Image of Eternity. Therefore is the hoary head a Crown of glory.</p>
               <p n="2">PROP. II. <hi>It is especially true, that Old Age is honourable, when found in a way of Righteousness.</hi> If the hoary head is an honour, this is the honour of that honour. It is a Crown, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness is the Crown of that Crown. It has been well said by some, that Life is not to be measured by the length of it, but by the righteousness of it. <hi>When the Silver Crown of Old Age is adorned with the Golden Crown of Religion,</hi> as one expresses it, that is the
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:001838_0077_0FB9174A1A1258D0"/>
honour of it. The proposition before us may be opened and confirmed in two Assertions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He that is in <hi>the Way</hi> of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness is a righteous Man. He is one that not only does actions which as to the matter of them are according to the rule or law of righteousness, for so may an unrighteous man, but one that as to his spiritual State is, a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, or a godly Man. One whose <hi>way</hi> and course is righteous. Men while in this World are <hi>Viatores,</hi> they are travelling in one of two ways. Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the <hi>broad way</hi> which leads to destruction, which the most of Men are going in, that's the <hi>way of Unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness</hi>: Or in the <hi>narrow way</hi> which leads to life; that's the way of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness. Prov. 12.28. <hi>In the way of righteousness is Life, &amp; in the path way thereof is no death.</hi> This is that which is called <hi>the good way</hi>: 1 Sam. 12.23. <hi>I will teach you the good &amp; the right
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:001838_0078_0FB9174DF07DAA70"/>
way,</hi> which men should be very solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous about their getting into that way. Jer. 6.16. <hi>Ask where is the good way &amp; walk therein.</hi> And <hi>the way of good men,</hi> Prov. 2.20. And <hi>the way which is called holy,</hi> Isai. 35.8. So the way <hi>John Baptist</hi> walked and taught others by his example as well as by his doctrine to walk in it. Matt. 21.32. John came <hi>in the way of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi> This way of righteousness is <hi>the way of Gods Commandments,</hi> and of His Precepts, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.27. Men do not naturally choose or walk in that way. Wherefore going in the <hi>way of righteousness</hi> implys, <hi>Conversion.</hi> For Unconverted Sinners are not in that way. Among all the Unconverted Sinners in the World, there is not one righteous Man to be found. Rom. 3.10. <hi>It is written, there is none righteous, no not one.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It is to be asserted, That being <hi>found</hi> in the way of righteousness, does
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:001838_0079_0FB9174F5A76F2B8"/>
imply having been therein for some time. How should hoary heads be <hi>found</hi> in the way of righteousness, if they were not in that way afore they were adorned with hoary heads, and then their gray hairs will be a great glory to them. The Expression im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies not only a Conversion to God, but an early Conversion. A Man that from his Youth to his Old Age has gone on in a course of righteousness and holiness, is honourable indeed. It is mentioned to the honour of a Disciple whose Name was <hi>Mnason</hi> that he was <hi>an Old Disciple,</hi> Act. 21.16. He had been a Disciple for many years. The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> mentions it to the honour of some kinsmen of his, they were (says he) <hi>in Christ before me,</hi> Rom. 16.7. And that which is recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded concerning <hi>Obadiah</hi> is a great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to his Name &amp; Memory, that he said to the Prophet Elijah, 1 King 18.12. <hi>I fear the Lord from my youth.</hi> That
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:001838_0080_0FB917519CB08B20"/>
Expression intimates that he was not then in his Youth, but that Age had overtaken him, and found him fearing God, and that for many Years he had done so. Such an one was <hi>Samuel</hi> He therefore said, <hi>I am old &amp; gray headed and I have walked before you from my Childhood unto this day,</hi> 1 Sam. 12.2. He began to fear and serve God in his Childhood, and continued to do so, until he had an hoary head. Such Persons be they Men or Women that have for many Years walked in the ways of righteousness, have an honour due to them. Such as <hi>Zechary</hi> &amp; <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> of whom it is said, Luk. 1.6. <hi>They were both righteous before God, &amp; walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in all the Commandments &amp; Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of the Lord blameless.</hi> It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported concerning <hi>Polycarp</hi> (once a famous Pastor of the Church in <hi>Smyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>) that when he came to dye he said to his Persecutors, <hi>I have served Christ fourscore &amp; six years.</hi> It is supposed
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:001838_0081_0FB917531A1E37E0"/>
that he was Converted about the Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Year of his Age, &amp; that he was an hundred Years Old at his Death and Martyrdom. Surely that was a Venerable Old Servant of the Lord. None of us in this Congregation can say, that we have served Christ Eighty &amp; six Years, but I trust there are some among us that can say that they have these fifty, nay sixty Years and more been His Servants in the way of righteousness. Why should not such be honoured? That a crown of glory does in a singular manner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to such Servants of the Lord as have not only lived but continued faithfully Serving of Christ for many Years, will appear in several parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Grace in the Soul makes Men to be Excellent &amp; Glorious.</hi> For Grace is a glorious thing. It is an internal glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Psal 45.13. <hi>The Kings Daughter is all glorious within</hi>: viz. in respect of
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:001838_0082_0FB91756EC7D01F0"/>
the Grace wherewith her Soul is ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Grace is called Glory. Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers beholding Christ as represented in the glass of the Gospel are changed <hi>from glory to glory,</hi> i.e. from one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Grace to another, which is their Glory, 2 <hi>Cor</hi> 3.18. Grace is an ornament to whoever has it. No Gold, nor Jewels, nor costly Apparel does adorn the body, so as Grace does the Soul that is invested with it. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apostle speaks, as 1 Pet. 3.3, 4. <hi>Whose adorning let it not be that out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward adorning of plaiting the hair, or of wearing of gold, or of putting on of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel; but let it be the hidden man of the heart, even the ornament of a meek &amp; quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.</hi> Who are the most excellent Persons on the Earth! It is they that are in the way of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. Prov. 12.26. <hi>The righteous is more excellent than his Neighbour.</hi> Men that excel their Neighbour in Riches,
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:001838_0083_0FB917585E6789F0"/>
or in Wordly greatness or grandieur, are not the more excellent in the sight of Heaven on that account, but they that have godly Souls within them are excellent in the Lords esteem. Psal. 16 3. <hi>The Saints on the Earth, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent in whom is all my delight.</hi> They are so because they are <hi>Saints.</hi> Their <hi>Sanctity</hi> makes them excellent. One sayes well, That <hi>a Saint in rags out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shines the greatest man on earth, if he is a wicked man.</hi> And it is a Celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted saying of <hi>Luther, That a poor Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant doing the meanest work, if they do it from a principle of Grace &amp; in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to God, is a more glorious sight than Caesar in all his triumphs.</hi> For Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness makes Men like Angels. What is the difference between the Angels of Heaven, and the Devils of Hell? It is Holiness that makes the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. Angels are holy, but Devils are spiritual wickednesses. A very holy Man is an <hi>Angel Incarnate.</hi> One of
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:001838_0084_0FB9175ACA4EF638"/>
our English Martyrs blessed God for his being cast into Prison, because there (said he) I became acquainted with that Angel of God Mr <hi>John Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.</hi> Nay, Holiness makes Men like God. A <hi>Godly</hi> Man is a <hi>Godlike</hi> Man. The Image of God does especially consist in Holiness. Eph 4.24. <hi>Put on the new man, which after God,</hi> i. e. after the Image of God, <hi>is created in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness &amp; true holiness.</hi> The blessed Angels resemble God more than any other Creatures, because they are of all Creatures the most holy ones. These Watchers over the World are called <hi>the holy Ones,</hi> Dan. 4.17. What Men on Earth are they, that do most of all resemble the blessed holy God? They are the holiest Men. His holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is in a singular manner his glory. Exod. 15.11. <hi>Thou art glorious in Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi> Then this must needs be the greatest Crown of glory that any Man on Earth has or can have. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:001838_0085_0FB9175C1FC1EDB8"/>
holiness is venerable. It com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands respect and reverence. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ungodly men and great men too, will <hi>revere</hi> a very holy Man. It is said of <hi>Herod</hi> that notwithstanding his being a King, He <hi>feared</hi> John Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist <hi>knowing that he was a just man &amp; an holy.</hi> There was no perswading him out of the way of righteousness, <hi>Mark</hi> 4 20. Now if being in a State of Grace, or in the way of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, calls for respect &amp; honour, then certainly, they that have been in that State a long time, and have walked in that way for many Years are on that account honourable.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Aged Servants of the Lord have had a long acquaintance &amp; communion with God.</hi> They are to be honoured, since God has vouchsafed to honour them with His Presence, and that there have been Mutual Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between them for a long time. 1 Joh. 1.3. <hi>Truely our Fellowship is with
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:001838_0086_0FB9175FE2B4C018"/>
the Father &amp; with his Son Jesus Christ.</hi> They have had the honour of being admitted into the Presence of the King of Glory, and that every day, and for many Years. God has bid them come to Him with their requests, and that they should open their hearts &amp; speak freely to Him; and this of matters which they cannot speak to any one else of, and this have they done many a time &amp; often. Psal. 142.2, 3. <hi>I poured out my complaint before him, I shewed before him my trouble, when my spirit was overwhelmed within me.</hi> God puts honour on His Servants when He will permit them to be thus free with Him. They have come to God in the Name of Christ many a time, and He has through Christ come to them. He said to His People, <hi>I will meet with them &amp; I will commune with them from above the Mercy-seat,</hi> Exod. 25.20. Christ is the Mercy-seat, and it is a blessed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion which through Him, Believers
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:001838_0087_0FB9176159BD4F48"/>
have with God. And this is what Christ has promised to such as abide in the way of righteousness. Joh. 14.23 <hi>If a man love me he will keep my Commandments, &amp; my Father will love him, &amp; we will come unto him, &amp; make our abode with him.</hi> It is among Men counted an honour to have a free con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation with an Earthly King, but the Servants of God can say, our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation is in Heaven, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.20. And when there has been for many years an holy blessed conversation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Lord and them, a blessed Familiarity proceeds from thence. It has been related concerning an Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Christian, that when he was on his death bed he could say to those a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, <hi>If the walls of this Chamber could speak they would say that I have met with God here many a time, &amp; that He has been Familiar with my Soul.</hi> When <hi>Moses</hi> had been conversing with God forty days, his face did shine.
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:001838_0088_0FB91762D9B55068"/>
Then aged Christians who have been Conversing with God for more than Forty years, do they not shine? Surely there is a Crown of Glory be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Aged Servants of the Lord have done a great deal of good in the World.</hi> The Generation in which they have lived has fared the better for them, and it may be after Generations too. David lived to a good old Age, and he has left this Character behind him, That <hi>he served his own Generation ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the will of God,</hi> Act. 13.35. Sometimes Young Men have been very useful and serviceable having done a great deal of good in a little time: had they lived to Old Age they would have done a great deal more. But more especially such Servants of God as His Providence has set in a Publick Station, if they walk in the way of righteousness, many will fare the better for them. Rulers in the
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:001838_0089_0FB91765195C2C18"/>
Civil State, if they set themselves to promote righteousness, they are bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings to the Land in which they live. One such Man in Jerusalem would have saved the whole City from ruine, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.1. But if they continue many Years to do thus, how much Evil will they prevent, and how much good will they obtain, in the place where Providence has cast their lot. Such a King as David that continued ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Publick Forty years together, until Old Age, and in his Old Age to the last a whole Nation fared the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for him. So for such a Governour as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> who never took a bribe all the time of his Government, which was twelve years, nay, considering the People were poor, he would rather deny himself of the Salary which was due to him as Governour, than the poor People should be burdened, <hi>Neh.</hi> 5.14, 15. He was one that the whole Province had cause to bless, and to
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:001838_0090_0FB91768D9CB2A28"/>
bless God for him. And a Minister in the house of God, if he has been so a long time, and has been faithful, must needs have been an instrument of much good. It may be many Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners have been Converted, and thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands Edified by his holy labours. It is said concerning that faithful &amp; emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Minister of God Old <hi>Jehojadah,</hi> that he had <hi>done good in Israel</hi> both towards God, and towards His House, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24 16. But others also, altho' but in a private Capacity, if they have walked <hi>in the way of righteousness,</hi> and continued to do so for many years, they have done much good. They have been blessings to their Families, &amp; blessings to their Neighbours. They have done good by their Example, by which they have shined as lights in the world, they have been like Stars which are common blessings. They have done good by their Prayers. So have they been a means to keep off
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:001838_0091_0FB9176A5984C2B8"/>
destroying Judgments from the places where they have liv'd. The Jews have a saying, <hi>Sinc stationibus non staret Mundus,</hi> If it were not for Prayer the World would not stand. And whose Prayers? The Prayers of such as walk in the way of righteousness. The righteous is an everlasting foundation. It is eminently true concerning such as have been a long time in that way. Men will regard the Requests of an Old Friend, or of an Old faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant. So will God regard the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of His Old Friends that have been serving him faithfully for these many years. Surely they will obtain no little good for those they Pray very much for. Now a great respect is due to such as have been useful and serviceable. The more serviceable the more honourable. For Men in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beneficial to many resemble the blessed God. How Extensive is His goodness who is good to all, and His
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:001838_0092_0FB9176C9AA99B78"/>
tender Mercies over all His works. The more universally beneficial we are, the more do we approve our selves the Children of our Father which is in Heaven, <hi>Matt.</hi> 5.45. And Men that do a great deal of good in the World are in that respect like Christ. How many did He do good unto both as to Body and Soul? Act. 10.38. <hi>He went about doing good &amp; healing all that were op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed of the Devil.</hi> The whole World has fared the better for Him, since He is <hi>the Light of the World.</hi> God has made the Sun to be a Mercy to the World. Christ the Sun of Righteousness has been an infinitely greater Mercy. Man-kind has fared the better for His Mediation. That tree had been cut down, if the Son of God had not said, spare it. But especially the Elect of God in all Ages and Places of the World have been blessed by Him On which account it was said to <hi>Abraham, in thy Seed,</hi> by which Christ is intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:001838_0093_0FB917716A010188"/>
                  <hi>all the Nations of the Earth shall be blessed,</hi> Gen. 22.18. Now Aged Christians having had longer oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities of doing good in the World than others have had, if they have done accordingly, they do in that respect the more resemble God and Christ, &amp; then their Old Age becomes a Crown of glory to them. Hence,</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Aged Christians being found in the way of righteousness have brought more glory to the Name of God, than they could have done, if they had not been favoured with Time &amp; Age to glorify Him in.</hi> Christians are in the Scripture compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to Trees. The fruit which grows upon such Trees, if they are Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans indeed, is righteousness. Isai 61 3. <hi>Trees of righteousness of the planting of the Lord that he might be glorified.</hi> The more of that fruit any Christian bears, the more is God glorified in them and by them. Wherefore Christ said to the disciples, Joh. 15.8. <hi>Herein is my Father glorified, that you bear much fruit.</hi> And
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:001838_0094_0FB9177299CE6648"/>
the Apostle shews that if Christians be <hi>filled with the fruits of righteousness</hi> that will be to the <hi>glory of God,</hi> Phil. 1.11. Now a Tree that has been bringing forth fruit many years one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther until it is grown Old brings forth much fruit. An Aged Saint is such a Tree. If Christians live to Old Age, it will be a great shame for them, if they have not brought forth much fruit in all that time, but if they have done so, God has been glorified by them. Nay, such Christians do not only glorify God themselves, but they cause others to glorify Him. They that <hi>see their good works will glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify their Father which is in Heaven,</hi> Matth 5.16. They that are about them may well say, if the Servants of God are thus good and thus holy, than how good is their Father who has made them to be such! And what respects is due to such Persons who have for so many years been glorify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="85" facs="unknown:001838_0095_0FB9177537DF4C88"/>5. <hi>Aged Servants of the Lord are near their Crown.</hi> Their Salvation is nearer than when they first believed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.11. It was a comfortable word which was spoken to Jerusalem, Isai. 40.2. <hi>Speak you comfortably to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem, cry unto her that her warfare is accomplished.</hi> Thus may it be said to Aged Saints, be of good comfort, your warfare is well nigh accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: you are not far from the Kingdom of God. A Man that is like to have a rich Inheritance speedily fall to him, is respected. This will be the Porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Aged Saint. An Inheritance incomparably better than any in this World will soon be his. One that is like to have a Kingdom in a little time, is on that account highly respected. An Aged Christian is a sincere Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, will speedily be in the Possession of a Kingdom infinitely better than any in this World. An Aged Saint, like old <hi>Peter</hi> knows he must <hi>Shortly</hi>
                  <pb n="86" facs="unknown:001838_0096_0FB91776595D35B8"/>
put off his Earthly Tabernacle, and so <hi>shortly</hi> be in Heaven. It is reported of a singularly Pious Lady in <hi>England,</hi> (the Lady <hi>Falkland</hi>) that when She went to her rest at Night, She would ly down with those words, <hi>Now I am one day nearer Heaven than ever I was before.</hi> Old corn is not kept long out of the barn. No more will it be long before the Old Servant of God will be gathered into the heavenly barn. It was said to Job, <hi>Thou shalt come to thy grave in a full Age, like as a shock of corn comes in</hi>; it comes into the barn, <hi>in its season,</hi> when it is fully ripe, <hi>Joh</hi> 5 26. They that are so near their crown in Heaven ought to have the more respect from Men whilst yet on Earth.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>If Men continue long in the way of righteousness, their Crown of Glory in Heaven will be the weightier for that.</hi> The longer thy Crown is in preparing (sayes an excellent Writer) <hi>the more

full of Diamonds &amp; Pearls will it be when it comes.</hi> There are righteous Men who if they had dyed Fifty Years ago, they had gone to Heaven, but they would not then have had so great a Crown there, as now they shall. All those years of Service will be an aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation of their Glory. The more Glory Men by being active Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in His Service, shall bring to the Name of God here on Earth, the greater shall their own glory be in Heaven. Will not degrees of glory there be according to degrees of grace and serviceableness in this World? Does not the Scripture say, <hi>He that soweth sparingly shall reap sparingly, &amp; he that soweth plentifully shall reap plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully,</hi> 2 Cor. 9.6. And if Men are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in improving and exercising the Grace which they have received, will they not have more? <hi>The righteous shall hold on his way &amp; he that hath clean hands shall be stronger &amp; stronger,</hi>
                  <pb n="88" facs="unknown:001838_0098_0FB9177DD9E228E0"/>
Job 17.9. <hi>The path of the just is as the shining light, that shines more &amp; more unto the perfect day,</hi> Prov. 4.18. The Christian that has been many years improving the Grace bestowed on him, must needs have attained to a great measure. In is said in the Parable of Talents, <hi>To every one that has shall be given, &amp; he shall have abundance,</hi> Matt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>. 25.29. It is to be presumed concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Aged Christians, that they have <hi>been laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come.</hi> Store of good works, store of works of Piety; none but God knows how many thousands and ten thousands of Prayers, and store of works of Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And then how great will their Crown of Glory be in the life to come? For all their works will be rewarded in a future State and World. <hi>Their works,</hi> that is the reward of their works, <hi>do follow them</hi>; Whither will they follow them? They will follow
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:001838_0099_0FB9177F597E4E60"/>
them to Heaven, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.13. Not the least good work but what shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded. He that shall give a cup of cold water only, to a Disciple, in the name of a Disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise loose his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.42. What a blessed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward then shall that Man have, that has done great Services for Christ, and it may be has endured Persecutions for his Fidelity to the Truth &amp; Interest of Jesus Christ. O the glorious Crown that is reserved for him! How great will it be? Psal. 31.19. <hi>How great is thy goodness which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee</hi>! Where is it laid up? It is laid up in Heaven. That Servant of the Lord, who for many years, from his Youth until Old Age has been faithfully Serving God in Jesus Christ, how great is that Crown which is laid up for him in Heaven?</p>

               <p n="1">Inst. 1. <hi>They that walk in the way of Righteousness, many times live to Old Age, &amp; it is a Mercy when they do so.</hi> We cannot say that all righteous Men shall be <hi>Crowned</hi> with this Mercy, for some of them dye before they have <hi>hoary heads.</hi> Promises made concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Temporal blessings are to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood not absolutely, but with li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitations. If God shall see, that it will be most for His glory, that some who are in the way of righteousness, should dy whilest they are Young, they shall not live to Old Age. It may be God will have them <hi>Crowned

with Martyrdom,</hi> which is a far more glorious Crown than that of an hoary head. It is said of many who lived in the Primitive Ages of Christianity, that <hi>they loved not their lives to the death,</hi> Rev. 12.11. According to the ordinary course of Nature they might have lived many years longer, but they laid down their lives for Christ, and by that they brought more glory to Christ in one day, than they could have done by many years active O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience. Sometimes God in singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar love and compassion to righteous Ones takes them out of this evil World whilest they are yet Young in Years. It may be sad Calamities and Desola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>ons are coming on the Places where they live, &amp; the Lord would not have them grieved with beholding such sad Spectacles. Isai. 57.1. <hi>The righteous is taken away from the evil to come.</hi> We have an Instance for this in <hi>Josiah,</hi> who was one of the most Pious Princes in
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:001838_0102_0FB91788534716D0"/>
the World, and yet he dyed before he was full Forty Years Old. To him it was said, <hi>Thou shalt be gathered to thy Grave in peace, neither shall thine Eyes see all the evil that I will bring on this Place, and upon the inhabitants of the same,</hi> 2 Chron. 34 28. Or it may be, there is a righteous Man that dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful misery is coming on his Family and nearest Relations, which if he should live to gray hairs, he must be a sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Spectator of: Therefore he must dy before that. Thus concerning <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboams</hi> godly Young Son. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet having predicted the lamentable ruine that was to come on his Fathers family, said. <hi>He only of Jeroboam shall come to the Grave, because in him there is found some good thing, toward the Lord God of Israel,</hi> 1 King. 14.13. But altho' it is sometimes otherwise, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless very often they that are in the way of righteousness, have their lives lengthned out to Old Age. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:001838_0103_0FB9178919CCDFA8"/>
it is said, <hi>The fear of the Lord pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth days,</hi> Prov. 10.27. God blessed the holy Patriarchs with long life. It is said of <hi>Abraham</hi> that when he died, he was <hi>an Old Man &amp; full of years,</hi> Gen. 25.8. Some have observed that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> is the first Person who is in the Scriptures called <hi>an Old Man,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing there were many older Men than he that dyed before him. His Old Age was a reward of his singular Obedience to God. His Son <hi>Isaac</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so lived to be an Old Man: Gen. 27.2. <hi>He said, behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my death</hi>; and yet he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Forty Years after he spoke those words, that is, after he began to be an Old Man. And <hi>Jacob</hi> lived to be an Old Man. Before <hi>Joseph</hi> made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self known to his Brethren, he enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with a real concern about his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Fathers welfare: Gen. 43.27. <hi>He asked them, is your Father well? The Old Man of whom you spake, is he yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live.
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:001838_0104_0FB9178A9A415040"/>
Samuel</hi> lived to Old Age. And then the People unworthily slighted him after all the many Years Service he had done for them. They said to him, behold <hi>thou art Old,</hi> make us a King to Judge us, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.5. The Prophet <hi>Elisha</hi> was an Aged Servant of the Lord. For King <hi>Joash</hi> bewailed his death with the same words that he bewailed the departure of <hi>Elijah</hi> Fifty Years before that. Several of the Apostles notwithstanding their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defatigable Labours, &amp; that the Devil &amp; his instruments sought to take their lives from them, yet lived to Old Age. So did <hi>Peter</hi>: He was an Old Man when he suffered Martyrdom, as Christ did many years before signify to him. Joh. 21.18. <hi>When thou art old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands,</hi> h.e. thou shalt be Crucified and thy hands nailed to the Cross. The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> was an Aged Servant of the Lord before he dyed, <hi>Philem.</hi> 9. <hi>Paul the aged.</hi> But
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:001838_0105_0FB9178CE75A2090"/>
especially the Apostle <hi>John,</hi> who was the only one of all the Apostles that dyed a Natural Death, all the rest were Persecuted to death; Writers inform us that he lived to be an hundred Years old. It is reported concerning <hi>Simeon</hi> who was the Son of <hi>Cleophas,</hi> and therefore the Lords kinsman, that he was an hundred and twenty Years old when he was Crucified. Some E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent Servants of God in these latter Ages have lived to a great Old Age. <hi>Robert Constantine</hi> who was <hi>Beza</hi>'s great friend lived till he was an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and three Years old; his Senses of Body and Mind being perfect and his Memory strong. Now it is a Mercy when they that are in the way of righteousness live to Old Age. When 'tis said, <hi>The hoary head is a Crown of glory,</hi> that implies that there is the Mercy and Favour of God in it. The Lord promised Abraham that he should be <hi>Buried in a good Old Age,</hi>
                  <pb n="96" facs="unknown:001838_0106_0FB91790EB720E18"/>
Gen. 15.15. If righteous Men live to Old Age, it is a Mercy to the World, especially if they are in a Publick Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for many fare the better for them. They do a great deal of good in the World. If their Intellectual Abilities hold they do a great deal of good by their Wisdom and Counsil which the Authority of their Age makes to be the more regarded. So was aged <hi>Jehojada</hi> a blessing to the whole Land in his Old Age, since by his Wisdom he kept the People from a great Apostasy <hi>all his days,</hi> which as soon as ever that Old Minister of God was laid in his Grave they were subject unto, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24.17, 18. So by their holy Example, and by their Prayers to God they are blessings to the Places where they live; for thereby they keep off Judgments, as <hi>Moses</hi> &amp; <hi>Samu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi> and the Prophet <hi>Amos</hi> did more than once; and obtain Mercies, as <hi>Elijah</hi> did, when there was a sore drought,

                  </gap>he Prayed earnestly and the Heavens gave rain, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.18. And if a Man that is in the way of righteousness shall live to Old Age, it will be a Mercy to himself as well as others. For that (as before was intimated) it is to be hoped that in many years he will gain a large stock of Grace, so as to become <hi>strong in the Grace which is in Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus. Old Abraham</hi> was strong in the Faith. So was <hi>Old Jacob</hi>: He had a strong Faith not only for himself, but for his Posterity; for his Children &amp; Childrens Children that God would bless them after he was gone out of the World. He that is in the way of righteousness, if he continues grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Grace all his days, the longer <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he lives, and the more good he does, the greater will his happiness be in the Eternal World, as also before was intimated.</p>
               <p n="2">Inst. 2. If Old Age when found in the way of righteousness is honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:001838_0108_0FB917945DCE0CF8"/>
then <hi>they that despise Aged Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the Lord, are guilty of a great Sin.</hi> Has God set a <hi>Crown of glory</hi> on their heads, &amp; shall Men despise them for it? If Men are Aged there is a reverence due to their Age, supposing that to be all their honour, but much more if they are adorned with godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. Not to shew an Aged Man the respect which his Age calls for, is a great Sin. An heathen had so much of Natural Religion in him as to say, That if a Young Man did not rise up to show respect to an Old Man, it was a crime <hi>Morte piandum,</hi> which deserved to be punished with nothing less than death. But then to treat Aged Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons with disrespectful and disdainful Language only because of their Age, is a very criminal offence in the sight of God: yet how common is it to call this or the other Person, <hi>Old such an One,</hi> in a way of contempt on the account of their Age? Do they not
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:001838_0109_0FB91795D9AF2A30"/>
offend God, who is styled, <hi>the Ancient of days?</hi> Thus did the Children of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thel</hi> to <hi>Elisha,</hi> 2 King. 2.23. They Mocked him, and said, <hi>Go up, thou bald head, go up, thou bald head.</hi> After this manner did they treat that Aged Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, Thou Old bald head, it is preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that thy Instructor <hi>Elijah</hi> is <hi>gone up</hi> to Heaven, Lets see thee <hi>go up</hi> after him: <hi>Go up</hi> if thou canst. Bears came out of the woods &amp; tare above Forty of those Children. The Judgment was extraordinary, and that was a sign that the Sin was more than ordinary. To deride Aged Persons because of those Natural Infirmities which Age has brought upon them, is a great Sin. It may be they are become weak and childish, as the Proverb sayes, <hi>Once a Man &amp; twice a Child.</hi> They that laugh at them on that account, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps if they should live to their Age will be as childish as they. And would they be willing then to be made a
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:001838_0110_0FB9179819BA22C8"/>
laughing stock, by those that are Yonger than they? Or, if there are Moral Infirmities which their Old Age is attended with, they ought to be covered with a Mantle of Charity. It may be they are pettish and hard to be pleased. To expose Fathers for such Infirmities is to be like <hi>Cham,</hi> who dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered his Fathers Nakedness. But it is in a most peculiar manner true concerning Children with respect to their Aged Parents, Any way to des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pise them in their Old Age, is a wicked thing. To disregard the Advice of an Old and a Godly Father, is great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety. Children are apt to do so, and especially to despise an <hi>Aged Mother.</hi> Wherefore the word of God, gives a special caution to Children to beware of that Sin. Prov. 23.22. <hi>Hearken to thy Father that begat thee, &amp; despise not thy Mother when she is old.</hi> When In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities of Age are added to that of her Sex, it does often occasion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:001838_0111_0FB9179CB89569A0"/>
but it ought not to be so. For still she is thy Mother who endured much sorrow in bringing thee into the World, and in thy Education when thou wast a Child, and therefore it will be vile ingratitude to despise her. And there is another Scripture in which the Mother is mentioned before the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when Children are Commanded to reverence them both: Luk. 19.3. <hi>You shall fear every one his Mother and his Father.</hi> Children cannot do bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for themselves than to honour and cherish their Aged Parents. They should study to require them for all the care and cost &amp; sorrow which for their sakes they have endured. And in that they will shew something of Piety. 1 Tim. 5.4. <hi>Let them shew piety at home, &amp; to requite their Parents.</hi> The Stork useth to be called <hi>Avis Pia,</hi> a Pious bird, because when the old ones are decayed and not able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for themselves, their young ones
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:001838_0112_0FB9179E19A65860"/>
provide for them, and feed them. The Stork will rise up in Judgment against those unnatural Children that have no regard for their Aged Parents. We have the greatest Example that ever was in the World, to instruct Children that they should take care for the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of their Aged Parents. For our Saviour Christ when He was dying on the Cross, seeing His poor Widow Mother standing by, He said to His beloved Disciple, <hi>Behold thy Mother, &amp; from that hour that disciple took her to his own home,</hi> Joh. 19 27. Those Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that will suffer their Aged Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents to want, if they are able to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply them, do not deserve the Name of Christians: They are worse than some Infidels have been. The most famous of all the Greek Poets, speaks of one whose life was short. Why! sayes he, <hi>He gave not food &amp; nourishment to his Parents.</hi> On the other hand, there have been some dutiful Children, who when their Aged Parents have been
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:001838_0113_0FB917A059C365E0"/>
decayed, they have maintained them honourably, and by that means have brought a signal blessing from God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themselves &amp; upon their Posterity.</p>
               <p n="3">Inst. 3. <hi>Aged Servants of the Lord may have Comfort against the Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions &amp; Afflictions which their Old age <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

Suppose a Lamp to have shined never brightly, when it is going out, 'tis <hi>Lamp despised,</hi> Job 12.5. That's often the case of Aged Servants of the Lord. And sometimes they think themselves more despised than they are; that's a natural Infirmity of Age: but suppose they are so, if God does not despise them, it is no matter tho' the World does. God despiseth no Servant of His for his being Old, but respects him the more for his having been many Years in the way of righteousness. One of the greatest discouragements
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:001838_0114_0FB917A202503D48"/>
of Old Age, is, that then a Christian cannot do that Service for God and Man which in his Younger Years he was capable of. Yet sometimes God is so gracious to His Aged Servants, as to continue their Abilities for Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, which is a signal and more than ordinary favour. There are some whose Old Age is like Abrahams, a <hi>good Old Age,</hi> Gen. 25 8. If a Man is capable of doing good in his Old Age, God has blessed him with a good Old Age. Some Aged Servants of the Lord have done singular Service for the Church of God just as they have been going out of the World. Some of their last words and works were of great use after they were dead &amp; gone. Thus concerning <hi>the last words</hi> of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid the Man of God, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.1. The Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> wrote his Second Epistle to <hi>Timothy</hi> in his Old Age, a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his death, which has been of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular use to the Church of God. The
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:001838_0115_0FB917A8D6039308"/>
like is to be said concerning <hi>the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Epistle of Peter.</hi> But suppose Age has debilitated him, and rendred him unserviceable, if when he had youth and vigour he laid himself out for God, he may comfort himself with this thought, the Lord remembers it. Jer. 2 2 <hi>I remember the kindness of thy youth.</hi> Moreover, Aged Servants of the Lord may comfort themselves with this consideration, God will never forsake them. They may live to be a burden to themselves and others: their near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Relatives may grow weary of them; but then the everlasting Arm will not be weary in supporting them. It was Davids Prayer, <hi>Cast me not off in old Age, forsake me not when my strength faileth,</hi> Psal. 71.9. Sometimes God is pleased to comfort His Aged Servants, who have walked with Him, and been Eminent workers of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness with sensible manifestations of His favour. It is related concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

Old Man. Isai. 65.20. <hi>The sinner of an hundred years old shall be cursed.</hi> O how cursed! yet there are such Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Creatures in the World. There are Old Atheists. Ezek. 8.12. <hi>Hast thou seen what the Ancients of the house of Israel do in the dark. They say, the Lord seeth us not.</hi> Such Atheists are they.

There was a destroying Angel sent to Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem with a slaughter weapon in his hand, and a positive order to destroy utterly: but who did he slay in the first place? Ezek. 9.6. <hi>He began at the Ancient men.</hi> They because of their long continuance in Sin best deserved the destruction. For the longer Men live in their Unregenerate Estate, the more Sin they will have to answer for at the Day of Judgment. All the Sins
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:001838_0118_0FB917AE48875D68"/>
of their Youth, and of their Middle Age, and of their Old Age, will lye down in the Grave with them, and go to Hell with them, and rise up in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against them at the dreadful day. Of an Old Sinner it is said, <hi>His bones are full of the sins of his youth, which shall lye down with him in the dust,</hi> Job 20.11. Wo to the Old Impenitent Sinner, for <hi>he has only done evil before the Lord from his youth,</hi> Jer. 32.30. His gray hairs would have been a crown to him, if he had Served God, but the crown is fallen from his head, wo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him that he has sinned. How much Sin is a wicked man guilty of in one Year? But then if he shall live Sixty or Seventy Years, &amp; all that time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue Sinning against God, what a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious heap of guilt, will he have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted on his woful Soul! God has given an Old Sinner a large space to Repent in, and that will aggravate his Impenitency and Condemnation, as it
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:001838_0119_0FB917B19AA91A90"/>
did <hi>Jezabels,</hi> of whom the Lord says, <hi>I gave her space to repent, &amp; she repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not, I will cast her into great tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> Rev. 2.21, 22. Not only tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, but great tribulation, not only damnation, but great damnation will be the portion of such Sinners except they repent. And it may amaze them to think how near they are to that damnation, having already one foot in the Grave and so in Hell. An Old Man cannot but know that death will be upon him quickly. It may be so on a Young Man, but to be sure on an Old Man. And when death comes and finds him in his Sins, what will come along with it! What will imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately follow it? That you see in, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.8. where you read of <hi>a pale horse, &amp; his name that sat on him was death, &amp; hell followed with him.</hi> What an Old Sinner! O be awakened, for you have reason to expect death and hell every Day, every Moment of thy
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:001838_0120_0FB917B31AA676C8"/>
life? How dost thou know but that an <hi>Apoplexy</hi> or a <hi>Palsey,</hi> or some other sudden accident may put an end to thy space of repentance! And there is one thing more to be thought on. It is a truth, and an awful one, That if Men have lived under the light of the Gospel all their days until gray hairs are upon them, &amp; yet remain in their Natural Unconverted estate, it is not usual for such obdurate Sinners ever to be Converted. They have slighted so many offers of Grace; they have continued so long in their rebellion, grieving the holy Spirit of God, Sin and Satan has got such a fast hold on their Souls, that nothing less than a Miracle can cast him out. And yet I would not have you despair neither. For with God nothing shall be unpos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible. Is there any thing too hard for the Lord? <hi>Nicodemus</hi> said, <hi>Can a man when he is old be born again?</hi> As impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable as this may seem, with God
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:001838_0121_0FB917B55A1CD468"/>
it is possible. The Arm of God is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to bow &amp; bend an old oak, which no arm of a Man can do. He that was able of the Stones which were taken out of Jordan, (for I suppose John Baptist spoke of them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.9.) to raise up Children to Abraham, can of Old <hi>Sons of Belial,</hi> make <hi>Children of God.</hi> Can <hi>Old dry bones</hi> live? Can Old Sinners be converted? If the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Spirit of God will enter into them they shall. He that raised <hi>Lazarus</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had been dead Four days, can as easily cause a Man that has been dead in trespasses and sins fourscore Years to live. If Christ shall say, Thou Old Sinner come out of thy Grave, he that was dead shall come forth &amp; live. There have been some wonderful instances of it, in our days. I have formerly put you in mind of an Old Man who although living under the light of the Gospel was not saving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Converted before a great Old Age
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:001838_0122_0FB917BA4FB875B8"/>
had overtaken him, and then he would often say, <hi>If I had dyed before I was Seventy &amp; six years Old I had not gone to Heaven.</hi> I was a poor Unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Creature until then. But what must such <hi>Old Sinners</hi> do to be saved? The Answer is that Old Men must be saved in the same way that Young Men are, namely in the way of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance towards God, and of Faith in Jesus Christ. Let the Oldest Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner turn from all his Sins, and believe on Jesus Christ, and all his Sins shall be forgiven: He shall not then perish but shall have everlasting life.</p>

Men were in that way. It is a way which few there be that find it. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless, it is <hi>the good way</hi>; You cannot turn into it, too soon, but if you keep long out of it, a thousand to one you will never find it.</p>
               <p>Consider 1. <hi>That if you would live long on the Earth, in this way you are most likely to find length of days.</hi> Psal. 34 12. <hi>What man is there that desireth life, &amp; loveth many dayes?</hi> Where is there a Young Person that does not? The 14 <hi>v.</hi> tells them what they must do, <hi>Depart from evil, &amp; do good</hi>; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake the ways of Sin, and walk in the way of Righteousness. He that is in the way of righteousness, will abstain from those things by which life is shortned. An intemperate course of life shortens days. Excess in drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or in eating does so. Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness will make Men careful to beware of such excesses. Fleshly Lusts war against the Body, as well as the Soul,

and destroys both. They whose life has been among the Unclean frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>dye in Youth.</hi> As for the <hi>Young De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch, a dart strikes through his liver,</hi> as a bird when hasteth to the snare, and knows not that it is for his life. He is smitten with a Consumption of his Liver, and that in a little time puts an end to his life, <hi>Prov.</hi> 7.13. Had he been in the way of righteousness, he had lived longer. Oh then, Let Young Persons make it appear that they are in the way of righteousness, by their Obedience, as in a special manner to the Fifth which is the Commandment to which a promise of long life is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed, so to all the Commandments of God. And being in that way hold on in it, as they that are really therein will do. Job 17.9. <hi>

their goodness has been like the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning cloud, and as the early dew it is gone away. What will such seeming vanishing righteousness stand them in stead? No life is promised to them, but the contrary. Ezek. 18.24. <hi>When the righteous turn away from his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, and committeth iniquity, &amp; does according to all the abominations that the wicked man does, shall he live? all his righteousness that he has done shall not be mentioned.</hi> Oh be not like <hi>Ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziah,</hi> who for some time did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, he <hi>sought the Lord,</hi> and as long as he did so, God made him to prosper, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26.5. but after a while his heart was lifted up to his destruction. He provoked God to make him a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable example of His holy indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. For in the very act of Sinning he was smitten with a Leprosy, &amp; lived and dyed a Leper. Be not like <hi>Joash,</hi> who seemed to be a Pious Young Man,
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:001838_0126_0FB917C21AEF8200"/>
was a zealous encourager of the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God, but he fell in with wicked companions after the death of his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle <hi>Jehojada</hi> under whom he had a Religious Education, he became a fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant Apostate, he left the house of God, and served Idols, and was a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digy of ingraditude, Murdering the Godly Son of the Man to whom he had been beholden both for his Life and Crown: And his end was woful.</p>
               <p>Consider 2. <hi>That if you abide in the way of righteousness from Youth to Old Age, great will be your reward in the Life &amp; World which is to come.</hi> Those <hi>hoary heads,</hi> which God has set a crown of glory upon, shall then have another kind of crown &amp; glory given to them. The longer you have continued faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully Serving God, the more Diamonds will your crown of glory shine with in the Eternal World. All the number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Prayers which you have poured out before God, for your selves or
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:001838_0127_0FB917C4BAD61E58"/>
others, all your other deeds of Piety, all your works of Charity, will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred. The Lord whom you Serve will not forget one of them. If when you were Children, you did from a principle of the fear of God in your hearts, behave your selves dutifully to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards your Parents, God will reward you for that Obedience which was your duty. If you have been Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and then were diligent &amp; faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to your Masters, not with eye Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice as Men pleasers, but as Servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart, He will reward you for the Service you did for your Masters. <hi>Whatever good thing any man does the same shall he receive of the Lord whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be bond or free,</hi> Eph. 6.8. In the space of many years, you must ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to meet with manifold Afflictions and Temptations. If you bear the Cross as becomes the Servants of Christ, He will reward you for all your

Patient sufferings. Thus shall it go well with the righteous. Therefore let Young Persons make sure of their being such: And the sooner you do it, the happier are you both for Time and for Eternity. Oh! that Young Men would do now as probably they will wish they had done when they shall see Death and Eternity ready to take hold on them. They will then wish that they had lived a Life of serious Godliness: that they had spent more Time in Communion with God. I have often thought of the dying words of a great Man, when he was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the World, he expressed himself after this manner, <hi>I</hi> (said he) <hi>have been Privy Counseller to four Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, have been present at State-transacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for thirty Years together, &amp; I have learned this after so many Years expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience; that Seriousness is the greatest Wisdom, Temperance the best Physick, &amp; a good Conscience the best Estate; yea, I
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:001838_0129_0FB917CB1A220C58"/>

Wherefore as the Apostle speaks to those that were on another account Elders: 1 Pet. 5.1. <hi>The Elders which are among you I Exhort, who am also an Elder.</hi> So the Ancient Men in the Assembly, I Exhort, who am also my self Ancient. Why may not I, who have been (altho' the most Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy in the whole World that ever could say so) a Publick Preacher of the Gospel Nine &amp; Fifty Years, (for this Month &amp; this Week Nine &amp; Fifty Years are past since I began to speak
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:001838_0130_0FB917CD5A88C150"/>
in the Name of the Lord,) why should not I esteem it my duty to speak a few words to my Aged Friends? There are a considerable number of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Persons (tho' short of my Age) here before the Lord. For there are many who have attained to Three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score, &amp; such are every where accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Old Men.</hi> It has a long time been a Proverbial saying, <hi>Sexagenarius de ponte,</hi> a Man that is Sixty is to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missed from those Employments which are proper for Youth and Strength.

               <p n="1">1. <hi>Aged Servants of the Lord should be humbled for the many Sins of their Life past.</hi> A Man that has lived long in this sinful World, how many Sins has he been guilty of? Innumerable evils, more than the hairs on his head.

How many Sins of Commission in Words, Thoughts, and Deeds. And much Sin also in respect of Omissions. Alas! how little good have we done in the World! Our famous Dr. <hi>Usher</hi> had been a great blessing in his day, not only by the Sermons he Preached, which were instrumental in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version of many, and among others of several Young Scholars when he resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for some time in <hi>Oxford,</hi> but also by the Books he wrote, by which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thousands have been Edified, yet when he drew near to his End, his Prayer was, <hi>The Lord forgive my Sins of Omission.</hi> Moreover, The vanities of Childhood and Youth, should be matter of Humiliation in Old Age. They were so to David, whose Prayer was, <hi>Remember not the Sins of my Youth, nor my transgressions,</hi> Psal. 25.7. Nor has our Elder Age been without Sin. It was an humble Expression of one of the Ancients, <hi>Diu vixi<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="122" facs="unknown:001838_0132_0FB917D35AC5F930"/>
have lived a long time, &amp; I have been a Sinner a long time. It is not enough for us once to have confessed our past transgressions, but the remembrance of them, should cause us to go softly in the bitterness of our Souls all the dayes of our life. We should go Mourning for them to our Graves. It is reported of Old <hi>Austin</hi> that he dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed reading the <hi>Penitential Psalms.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. <hi>Let Aged Servants of the Lord be watchful against what ever will be a blemish to that Old Age which God has crowned them with.</hi> Nothing will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally blemish our Age, but only Sin, and that will do it. It is not the natural decays &amp; infirmities of Age, but Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and Sinful Infirmities that will prove a blemish and dishonour, which we ought to watch against. And the rather because some Eminent Servants of God have miscarried very scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously after they have been Old. So, did <hi>Solomon,</hi> notwithstanding he was
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:001838_0133_0FB917D59ACE7128"/>
beloved of God, and therefore had the Name of <hi>Jedidiah,</hi> which signifies <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved of the Lord,</hi> given to him, yet 'tis said that <hi>when he was old</hi> his Wives turned away his heart, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 11.4. So <hi>Asa</hi> in the time of his <hi>Old Age,</hi> when a sore disease was upon him, sought to the Physitians, but <hi>he sought not to the Lord,</hi> 2 Chron 16.22. He Persecuted an holy Prophet, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed some of the People at the same time: by these things he greatly ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mished his Old Age, which has caused some to question whether he was a sincere godly Man. Aged Persons should be far from those Sins which are directly contrary to the Vertues which ought to be the Characters of Persons who are stricken in Years. Aged Men and Women may do well to read the <hi>Second,</hi> and <hi>Third,</hi> and <hi>Fourth Verses</hi> of the Second Chapter of the Epistle to <hi>Titus,</hi> and there they will see what Qualifications and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:001838_0134_0FB917D71A6124B0"/>
become their Age; I shall not mention them all, but <hi>Gravity</hi> is one of them. The whole deportment of such as are in Years should be attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a becoming Gravity. <hi>Levity</hi> in Words, and much more in Actions is unsuitable and a shame to them, considering their Age, and stains their glory. For Old Men to be gay and youthful in their Apparel, or if Aged Women dress themselves like young Girls, it exposeth them to reproach and contempt. Again, The Apostle sayeth of Aged Persons that they should be <hi>Temperate.</hi> For such to be overcome with Wine or any other Strong Drink is very lamentable. There have been some Old Men, and Old Professors of Religion also, who supposing their Age required it, have indulged themselves in drinking of Drams to a sinful Excess, whereby their <hi>hoary heads,</hi> have been dishonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, &amp; a blemish has been left on their
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:001838_0135_0FB917D95A40E2E0"/>
Names. Again, It becomes Aged Christians to be <hi>Sound in the Faith,</hi> and to be stedfast therein, and this not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as to fundamentals in the doctrine of Godliness, but in Truths relating to Worship and Discipline, and that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Gospel which is of Divine Institution. Our Fathers came into this Land when it was a Wilderness, that so they might Worship God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Scripture Pattern without any humane Inventions therein; but there have been some of late who in their Old Age have Apostatised to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Way of Worship differing from that which their Fathers walked in, so have they corrupted themselves, and blemished their Old Age, when just going out of the World. All Men, but especially Old Men ought rather to dye than to forsake the way of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness. There was a famous Jew whose Name was <hi>Eleazar,</hi> some of his Enemies had a reverence for him
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:001838_0136_0FB917DEDC80E7D0"/>
on the account of his great Age. They would have perswaded him to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress the Law of God only in a <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Precept,</hi> promising him his life if he would do so: but he with a noble courage chose a cruel Death rather than to Sin against his Conscience in a <hi>Ceremony.</hi> The Jewish Historian sayes of him, <hi>He considered his Ancient Years, and the honour of his gray head. I</hi> (said he) <hi>am above fourscore and shall I get a stain to my Old Age. I will rather <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="3">3. <hi>Aged Servants of the Lord should be very careful to redeem the Time.</hi> For it is certain that they have but a very little time to be in this World. Death and Old Age are not far asun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Hence Old Barzillai said, <hi>How long
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:001838_0137_0FB917E208D0A338"/>
have I to live</hi>? 2 Sam. 19.34. There are Young Persons who if they did really believe they should dye very shortly, they would be careful to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem their time. They that are Aged cannot but know that they must dye shortly. Time is a precious Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, and they have but a very little of it left, and shall they Squander away any of that little. Let us rather en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to live much and do a great deal of Good in a little time. It is true, they that are Aged cannot do as in their Youthful dayes they could, nor does God Expect it from them, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the infirmities that attend their Age. In Old Age <hi>a Grashopper is a burden,</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> speaks. That which was a Recreation in Youth, will be an insupportable burden in Old Age. Yet may they do a great deal of Good. They may do so by being shining Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of Piety: and by their wise and godly Counsels to Younger ones,
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:001838_0138_0FB917E31C729BA8"/>
and by Communicating their holy Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences to others. They have had great Experiences of the Lords carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them through many Temptations, and of wonderful answers of Prayer, by declaring to them that fear God, what he has done for their Souls, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny may be Edified. They may also before they go out of the World be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumental of a great deal of Good by being much in Prayer to God. In that respect not only Aged Men, but Aged Women may be great blessings to the World, as <hi>Anna</hi> was, of whom it is said, That she was <hi>a widow of about fourscore and four years, which departed not from the Temple but served God with fasting &amp; prayers night &amp; day,</hi> Luk. 2, 37. That Aged Woman was a blessing to the whole Town. Oh! Let us Pray that our last dayes may be our best dayes. There was an Eminency in Davids <hi>Last Words,</hi> 2 Sam. 23.1. And it is mentioned to the lasting ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:001838_0139_0FB917E55B051D40"/>
of the Pastor in the Church in <hi>Thyatira,</hi> That <hi>his last works were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the first,</hi> Rev. 2 19. So shall we live desired, and dye lamented.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Aged Servants of the Lord should be always ready and very willing to dye.</hi> Alwayes ready: For many times A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Persons are taken away by a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Death. It may be by the Palsey, or Apoplexy; or it may be they will dye in their Sleep. Some Eminent Servants of God, have gone well to bed at Night, and have been in Heaven before the Morning. O blessed Night! An Aged Man in a special manner should live by that rule, <hi>Never to do any thing that he would be afraid to do if he knew he should dye the next day.</hi> And make haste to do every thing, he would have to be done before his death. He should alwayes keep a Will or Testament by him, as they that think they are dying use to do. And let them be <hi>very willing to dye &amp; leave
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:001838_0140_0FB917E6DA4EB208"/>

                  </gap>. Men that are at Sea desire to get into a safe Harbour as soon as may be. And shall not Christians who are tossed in a tempestuous World long to be in their blessed Haven. Travellers long to be at Home. While in this World we are Travellers and Pilgrims. Not Earth but Heaven is our Home, and shall we not think the time long until we are there! A Souldier longs for a Victory, and is not easy until he has obtained it. And shall not Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, especially such as have been long ingaged in a difficult and dangerous Warfare, desire the day when they shall have a perfect Victory over all their Spiritual Enemies! Some Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralists among the Gentiles have thought that Aged Persons should be willing to leave the World. It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of the Emperor <hi>Adrian,</hi> that he said, <hi>He wondred that a Man who was above threescore would send for a Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian:</hi>
                  <pb n="131" facs="unknown:001838_0141_0FB917E85D008F80"/>
He thought that a Man of that Age must needs have had so much Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of the undesirableness of this Evil World as to be weary of it, and willing to be gone out of it. But Christians have higher &amp; more noble reasons to induce them to bid Death welcome, <hi>e. g.</hi> That so they may be perfectly and for ever delivered from <hi>Indwelling Sin,</hi> which is like the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prosy in the house of the Israelite, which must be pulled down or it could not be cleansed. So must the house of his body be dissolved that he may become pure from Sin: Rom. 6.7. <hi>He that is dead is free from sin.</hi> When the blessed day of his death comes, the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever on Christ will never Sin more in Word, Thought, or Deed. Who would not be willing to dye on that condition? Then do Believers go to be with Christ, who said to <hi>Peter,</hi> Whither I go thou canst not follow me <hi>now,</hi> but <hi>thou shalt follow me afterwards,</hi>
                  <pb n="132" facs="unknown:001838_0142_0FB917EA99DF13D0"/>
Joh. 13.36. He did so, and is with Christ at this day. Well may those Christians be willing to leave the World, who when they are gone hence shall be with Christ. The thought of this made the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> not only willing but desirous to be gone out of this World. Phil. 1.23. <hi>Having a desire to depart &amp; to be with Christ.</hi> They that are with Him behold His Glory, which is the Heaven of Heaven it self. Wherefore He has said, <hi>Father I will that they whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am, that they may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold my glory,</hi> Joh. 17.24. When the Immortal Souls of Believers are sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from their Bodies, <hi>they go to God. The Spirits of just men made perfect, are with God the Judge of all,</hi> Heb. 12.23. There they have such divine Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications as are ineffable, and to us in this Mortal State unconceivable. God said of Moses, <hi>With him will I speak mouth to mouth &amp; the similitude of the
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:001838_0143_0FB917EE5DE99BA8"/>
Lord shall he behold,</hi> Numb. 12.3. Much more does God do so with the Saints in Heaven. If dying <hi>Stephen</hi> could say, <hi>I see the glory of God and Jesus standing at the right hand of God,</hi> most certainly glorified Souls do so. They see God and are therefore blessed. Their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness consists in that <hi>Beatificai Vision,</hi> which they shall enjoy in the fulness and perfection of it after the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. Moreover, Aged Servants of the Lord may well be very willing to dye, considering that decrepit Old Age renders them uncapable of that which is the chief reason why life in this World is desirable, <hi>viz.</hi> That so we may do Service for Christ and for His People. In this respect there is a difference between Young Men and Old Men. Young Men altho' they also should be willing to dy if that be the will of God concerning them. Nevertheless, with submission to the Divine Will, Let them Pray for the
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:001838_0144_0FB917EFDB19B6B0"/>
continuance of their life, that so they may do Service for the Name of the Lord. Thus the Psalmist, <hi>I said, O my God take me not away in the midst of my dayes,</hi> Psal. 102.24. Thus also <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> when he was dangerously sick, he Prayed unto the Lord, who sent the Prophet Isaiah to say to him, <hi>I have heard thy Prayer, I will add to thy dayes fifteen years,</hi> Isai. 38.5. And <hi>David</hi> in his younger years, Prayed. <hi>O spare me, that I may recover strength, before I go hence, &amp; be no more at all,</hi> Psal 39.13. He did not Pray so, when he was arrived to Seventy Years. No: It is said that then he was <hi>full of dayes.</hi> He was satiated, having had enough of the World, and was willing to go out of it. It is a very undesirable thing for a Man to out-live his work. Although if God will have it to be so, His holy will must be humbly &amp; pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently submitted unto. When a Mans work is done he may well desire a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission.
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:001838_0145_0FB917F26EF83350"/>
When through decay of Age, he can do little or no Service for Christ and for His Church, then to be called out of this, and removed to the better Country, that is an heavenly, is a very desirable Mercy. Why then are some Aged Servants of the Lord, fond of living here still! There is not an Old Man that hears me this day, but let him do two things, which I will menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and he will be very willing to leave this World as soon as the Lord shall please. One is, Let him think much of Heaven. Let Heaven come into your Minds every day, and often in a day. The more you Meditate on the heavenly World, the more you will long to be there. When <hi>Monica</hi> (the Pious Praying Mother of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Austin</hi>) heard <hi>Ambrose</hi> Preach a Sermon concerning the glory of Heaven, the Meditation of it was rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turous to her. <hi>Is there</hi> (said she) <hi>such glory in Heaven! why then do I

stay here any longer</hi>! And the other thing to be done, is, Get a well ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Assurance that your Names are written in Heaven. Let us do so, and I am certain of it that we shall not be afraid to say with good Old Simeon, <hi>Lord, NOW lettest thou thy Servant depart in peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Let Aged Servants of the Lord be content to live longer if God will have it so.</hi> There are but few that need this Exhortation. Too many are like that great Man among the <hi>Romans,</hi> who said he would be content to live in any Misery, provided he might be assured that he should never dye; so terribly was he afraid of Death. So lothe are the most of Men to leave the Earth, that it would be very superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to perswade them to be willing to stay here. <hi>There was</hi> (sayes one) <hi>a Parliament, concerning which it was Enacted that they should not be Dissolved
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:001838_0147_0FB917F5DDA72BD8"/>
until they themselves pleased. If God should say so to Men, Heaven</hi> (sayes he) <hi>would be very Empty, and there would be more Men here below than the Earth could contain.</hi> Nevertheless, there are some that are too impatient of their continuance here. Was not the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Elijah</hi> so, when he was feign to fly his Country, and hide in a Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness: 1 King. 19.4 <hi>He requested for himself that he might die, and said it is enough.</hi> I am like to do no more Service for God, on which account I have lived long enough, and therefore <hi>Now O Lord take away my life.</hi> And <hi>Jonah</hi> in too much pet and passion Prayed, <hi>Now O Lord take I beseech thee my life from me, for it is better for me to dye than to live,</hi> Jon. 4 3. Nay, and the Meek <hi>Moses</hi> discovered hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane frailty when he said to God, <hi>Kill me I pray thee out of hand, if I have found savour in thy sight, and let me not see my wretchedness,</hi> Numb. 11, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

How much good did Moses do in the World after that, which if God had granted that request would not have been done. The truth is, that if a Man is subject to some very exercising Affliction, and Meditates much on Heaven, and is assured of his Interest there, he is apt to be too earnest and impatient to be gone. But we must leave as the way and manner, so the time of our departure out of this World, with the wise and faithful Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God, waiting all the days of our appointed time until our change shall come. It becomes a Christian both to endeavour that his last dayes may be his best dayes, and to <hi>desire to dye,</hi> yet to be <hi>content to live,</hi> espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if he is not so decayed, but that he is capable of doing some Service for Christ among His People. Thus it was with the holy Apostle: Phil. 1.21, 23, 24. <hi>For me to live is Christ, and to dye is gain. I am in a great strait

betwixt two, having a desire to depart and to be with Christ, which is far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you.</hi>

               <p n="6">6. <hi>Let Aged Servants of the Lord be much in Prayer.</hi> An Old Man should be a Man of Prayer, oft on his knees before the Lord. Why not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day and why not often in a day? Blessed Mr. <hi>Chauncey</hi> the Learned Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident of <hi>Harvard</hi> College, seldom saw a day in which he was not with God at least Six Times. Surely such a Praying Man will be a blessing to the World as long as he lives in it, and will obtain good for his own Soul and for his Family, and Posterity by laying up a stock of Prayers for them. And in Prayer, Let us who are Aged, plead the Promises that are made to Old Age. There is a promise that they shall be fruitful. Psal. 92.14. <hi>They shall still bring forth fruit in old

                     </gap> &amp; flourishing.</hi> Let us plead that promise. There's a promise that they shall have the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious presence of God with them in their Old Age. Isai. 46.4. <hi>Even to old age, &amp; to hear hairs I will carry you.</hi> That promise may encourage Aged Servants of the Lord, to Pray as, <hi>David</hi> did when Old Age had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken him: Psal. 71.17, 18. <hi>Thou hast taught me from my youth, &amp; hitherto have I declared thy wondrous works. Now also when I am old &amp; gray head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, O God forsake me not.</hi> It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported concerning that very Learned and Holy Man Dr. <hi>Rivet,</hi> that he used in his Old Age to repeat those words every day. They are words very suitable for Old Christians to remember. Let us live and dye Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And how will all our Prayers end? They will end in Praises, not only whilst we are living on the Earth, but in Heaven to all ETERNITY.
