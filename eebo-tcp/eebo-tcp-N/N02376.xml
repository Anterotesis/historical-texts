            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And no other Witnesses appearing against the Prisoners, they were directed to make their Defence: which accordingly they did; And the King's Advocate thereupon Concluded the Prosecution by summing up the Evidence, and submitting the same to the Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Court.

            <p>To which Articles the said <hi>Morrice Cundon</hi> pleaded not Guilty.</p>
            <p>The Witnesses on behalf of His Majesty were Sworn, namely Capt. <hi>William At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinson, Thomas Streaton,</hi> and <hi>Samuel Walker.</hi> And it appeared by their respective Testimonies, That the said <hi>Morrice Cundon</hi> belonged to the said Snow while called the <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and Commanded by Capt. <hi>Green,</hi> and that he was at Helm when Capt. <hi>Green,</hi> and his Mate, were thrown over-board by <hi>William Fly,</hi> and several others of the said Snows Company; But that the said <hi>Cundon</hi> was no ways Acting or Consenting thereto, or to any of the Acts of Piracy, and Robberies, afterwards committed; And therefore the said <hi>Fly</hi> talk'd of dismissing the Prisoner, the first Vesse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> he took, and of getting another Man in his room. And further the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses Deposed, that when the said Snow was taken by Capt. <hi>Atkinson,</hi> and others, the said <hi>Cundon</hi> exprest his Joy thereat. And in his own Defence, declared to the Court, that he never suspected the least design in any of the Snows Company, to Murder the said Capt. <hi>Green,</hi> and his Mate, before <hi>Fly</hi> came to him while at Helm, and threatned to blow out his Brains, if he stirr'd from the Helm: And then it was not in his power to prevent their Executing their wicked design, because most of the Snows Company were at that time upon Deck, Assisting in, or Consenting to the throwing of the said Capt. <hi>Green,</hi> and his Mate over-board: and it would have been a Rash Attempt, in him alone, to oppose them.</p>
            <p>The Advocate-General Concluded this Prosecution, in Observing to the Court, That the Prisoner by no Act, discovered his Disapprobation of the Proceedings of such as were actually Concerned in the said Murther; and was therefore by Law a Principal, and Pray'd Judgment accordingly.</p>
            <p>Upon which the Court was Cleared, and in Private; And after mature Delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Consideration of what the King's Witnesses Deposed, and the Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner offered in his Defence; as also the Replication of the Advocate-General, The Court <hi>Voted,</hi> That the said <hi>Morrice Cundon</hi> is not Guilty.</p>
            <p>Whereupon the Prisoner being brought again to the Bar, the President Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced him not Guilty; And the Court Ordered him to be Discharged without paying any Fees.</p>
            <p>Then the Court was Adjourned to Tuesday the 5<hi>th.</hi> Day of <hi>July</hi> Instant, at Nine a-Clock, before noon.</p>

            <p>And the said <hi>Morrice Cundon,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Streaton</hi> both Deposed, that some Days after the Master and Mate were Drowned, they met a Ship called the <hi>Pompoy,</hi> which came from <hi>Jamaica</hi> in Company with the Snow, when the Captain of the Ship hail'd the Snow, and ask'd how Captain <hi>Green</hi> did; and <hi>Fly</hi> being upon Deck, made Answer, very well at your Service Sir.</p>
            <p>Afterwards Capt. <hi>William Atkinson, Samuel Walker, Edward Apthorp, John Cole, Robert Dauling, John Brown, George Girdler,</hi> &amp; <hi>James Benbrooke,</hi> Witnesses for the King were called and Sworn; and Testified, that they were all taken by the said Snow, and that the said <hi>William Fly</hi> Acted as Captain, when the several Vessels, (mention'd in the Articles) to which they respectively belonged, were taken; And at such times ordered the Black Flagg to be hoisted, and Encouraged the Pirates when they were backward, to go on Board the said Vessels. And the said <hi>William Atkinson</hi> particularly Deposed, That soon after the Caption of the Schooner, named the <hi>James,</hi> whereof the said <hi>George Girdler</hi> was Master, they discovered <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> her Schooner, whereupon the said <hi>Atkinson</hi> Advised the said <hi>Fly</hi> to Man the said Schooner <hi>James</hi> with some of his Hands &amp; go in Chase of the said Vessel, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore exprest by the said <hi>Atkinson,</hi> in his Defence made upon his Tryal; which the said, <hi>Fly</hi> accordingly did; And some short time afterwards the said <hi>Atkinson</hi> discovering other Vessels forward, diverted the said <hi>Fly</hi> from his Arms, which lay on the Quarter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Deck; And while he was looking with his Glass to take fight of said Vessels, the said <hi>Atkinson</hi> and others, Overcame and subdued him, and Three other Pirates, as before is set forth.</p>
            <p>After the Witnesses had been fully heard, the said <hi>William Fly</hi> was Informed by the Court, that then was his time to offer what he had to say in his own Defence; which he did, by Denying any hand in the Murther, and several other Facts Sworn to by the King's Witnesses: And thereupon the Advocate-General summ'd up and Enforc'd the Evidence, and gave the Law upon the Facts: and Concluded, that the Prisoner at the Bar was Legally Guilty of Murther, Piracy, Felony and Robbery, according to the Articles.</p>
            <p>Afterwards the Court was Cleared, and in Private. And upon Deliberate Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the several matters and things by the Witnesses Sworn to against the Prisoner, as also the Law thereupon; the Court <hi>Voted.</hi> That the said <hi>William Fly</hi> is Guilty of the several Articles Exhibited against him.</p>
            <p>Then he was brought to the Bar again, when the President in the Name of the Court Pronounced the said <hi>William Fly</hi> Guilty. Upon which the Advocate, in behalf of His Majesty, demanded Sentence against the Prisoner. Who was thereupon ask'd if he had any thing to say why Sentence of Death should not be given against him; and shewing no sufficient Reason to the contrary, The President pass'd Sentence against him accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly in the words following, <abbr>

Afterwards the Advocate-General moved the Court, That <hi>Samuel Cole, George Condick,</hi> and <hi>Henry Greenvill,</hi> Articled against for Piracy, and Robbery, might be brought into Court to receive their Tryal: Accordingly the Marshall, pursuant to the Warrant to him Directed and Deliver'd brought them to the Bar, where they were Arraigned upon the Articles Exhibited against them, which the Register Read in the words following, <abbr>

            <p>To which Articles the said <hi>Samuel Cole, George Condick,</hi> and <hi>Henry Greenvill,</hi> severally pleaded not Guilty. Then the Witnesses on His Majesty's behalf, Namely <hi>Morrice Cundon,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Streaton,</hi> Marriners, which Sail'd from <hi>Jamaica</hi> in the said Snow, were Called and Sworn.</p>
            <p>And first, the said <hi>Morrice Cundon,</hi> Testified, That <hi>Samuel Cole,</hi> and <hi>Henry Greenvill,</hi> were both of them upon Deck, with others, when Capt. <hi>Green,</hi> and the Mate were thrown overboard, on the Twenty seventh of <hi>May</hi> last before Day.</p>
            <p>And the said <hi>Thomas Streaton</hi> Deposed, That as he lay in his Bed in the Morning of that Day, between One &amp; Two of the Clock, he heard <hi>Samuel Cole,</hi> one of the Prisoners at the Bar, say to <hi>Jenkins</hi> the then Mate, <hi>Come out of your Cabbin, you Dog,</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently after he was haul'd out of his Bed upon Deck, and the Deponent heard some Body fall upon the Deck, which he believ'd to be <hi>Jenkins,</hi> and soon after one <hi>Winthrop</hi> told him, that he should go over-board after his Captain; and he was soon thrown in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Sea, where he called to the Doctor earnestly several times to hand him a Rope, but by that time the Doctor was put in Irons.</p>
            <p>Afterwards <hi>William Atkinson, Samuel Walker, Edward Apthorp,</hi> and <hi>John Cole,</hi> were Sworn, and Testified<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That the Prisoners were reputed Pirates when the several Vessels mentioned in the said Articles were Taken and Robbed; and upon all Occasions acted as such, never pretending to the contrary in the Deponents hearing; only the Dep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Articles were taken; and that <hi>Condick</hi> was commonly the worse for Drink, and not able to bear Arms when several of the Vessels were taken; and for the most part was ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to the Pirates as their Cook.</p>
            <p>Then the Prisoners were heard what they had to say for themselves: And the said <hi>Samuel Cole,</hi> and <hi>Henry Greenvill,</hi> deny'd that they had any hand in Murthering the said Capt. <hi>Green,</hi> and his Mate; but said they had both of them been cruel to the Men, and therefore they had agreed to rise upon them, and put them on shoar the first Land they made. And the said <hi>Cole</hi> and <hi>Greenvill</hi> also owned that they were with others upon Deck when the Captain and his Mate were thrown overboard<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the said <hi>Condick</hi> confess'd in like manner that he was consenting to the said Capt. <hi>Green,</hi> and his Mates, being put on shoar, but deny'd that he had any hand in their being Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, alledging that he was then in his Hammock asleep. Upon whom the Advocate Replied, That by Law the Prisoners Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ederating and Consenting to do an Unlawful Act in Rising against their Commander (which by the Statute is declared Piracy) and forcibly pretending to put him on shoar, and Death ensuing, they were severally Guilty of Murther, if there were no other Evidence against the Prisoners: but the Advocate also summ'd up the Evidence against them in Support of all the other Articles, and Concluded in Demanding Judgment.</p>
            <p>Whereupon Orders were given to Clear the Court: The Court being in Private, fully and deliberately weighed &amp; Considered the Evidences against the Prisoners, and also the Defence made by them respectively, and the Advocate-General's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, and <hi>Voted,</hi> as follows, <abbr>

            <p>2<hi>dly.</hi> That the said <hi>George Condick</hi> is not Guilty of the first Article of Murther Exhibited against him, but of the other five Articles the Court <hi>Voted</hi> him to be Guilty.</p>
            <p>3<hi>dly,</hi> That the said <hi>Henry Greenvill</hi> is Guilty of all the Six Articles Exhibited against him.</p>
            <p>Then the Court being Open'd, The said <hi>Samuel Cole, George Condick,</hi> &amp; <hi>Henry Greenvill,</hi> were again brought to the Bar, when the President in the Name of the Court Pronounced them severally Guilty as aforesaid. And then the Advocate-General in His Majesty's behalf demanded Judgment against them.</p>
            <p>Whereupon they were ask'd, what they had to say, why Sentence of Death should not be given against them. And they offering no sufficient Reason to the contrary, The President Pronounced Sentence against them in the words following, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Then the Prisoners were Remanded to Prison, and the Marshall caution'd to take strict Charge of them. After which the Court was Adjourned to Six a Clock <hi>Post Meridiem.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Afterwards, The Court proceeded to Consider when the Sentence against the said <hi>William Fly, Samuel Cole,</hi> &amp; <hi>Henry Greenvill,</hi> should be put in Execution.
