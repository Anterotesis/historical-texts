            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A DOOR OPENED FOR CHRISTIAN LIBERTY.</head>
            <p>THE return of PEACE to the nations, and to this land in particular, with its circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and privileges, is a very great event indeed; which calls loudly to all for gratitude and thankfulneſs, to be manifeſted by a wife improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the favours granted us, and a faithful diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of duty in our ſeveral ſtations. And as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions about religious liberty have cauſed much difficulty among ourſelves, whereby our enemies hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have got advantage againſt us, it may be of public benefit to lay open the proſpect we now have of their being happily terminated.</p>
            <p>The eaſt pariſh in Attleborough, ſuppoſing that our laws about worſhip were the ſame as formerly, taxed and made diſtreſs upon ſeveral perſons, for the ſupport of their worſhip, who did not attend thereon.
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:017824_0004_0FA319BF85FF2418"/>One of them thought proper to try how our laws now are in that reſpect; and for that end ſued their aſſeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors before a juſtice of peace in Norton, February 22, 1782; when and where he fully proved, that he had uſually attended public worſhip with the firſt baptiſt church in Attleborough, ever ſince May 1780, and had communicated to its ſupport to their ſatisfaction. Yet judgment was given againſt him; from which he appealed to the county court at Taunton. And it being a matter of great importance, to have points of law well defined and ſettled under our new conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of government, both parties agreed to have the caſe tried by the honorable juſtices of the court; namely, Walter Spooner, Thomas Durfee, Benjamin Williams, and William Baylies, Eſquires. The council for the appellant were the honourable William Bradford, and James-Mitchel Varnum, Eſquires. For the appellees was the honorable Robert Treat Paine, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> attorney general for this Commonwealth.</p>
            <p>The latter, when pleading for ſaid pariſh, owned that religion muſt at all times be a matter between God and individuals, and declared that he diſclaimed all ſubordination of any one ſect to another: but pleaded, that the certificates, formerly required by law, were not tokens of ſubordination of one ſect to another, but of ſubordination to the government; and accuſed the baptiſts of refuſing to be ſubordinate to government. He alſo pleaded, that the appellant was born in the ſecond pariſh in Attleborough, was baptized there, and therefore was to all intents a member of that ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety; ſo that if he thought he had cauſe to leave thein, the law, reaſon, and even common civility, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired that he ſhould give them notice of it, which he had not done.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:017824_0005_0FA319C046D96718"/>
The chief pleas for the appellant were, that RELIGION was prior to all ſtates and kingdoms in the world, and therefore could not in its nature be ſubject to human laws; that the certificates heretofore required, were giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to pariſh officers, officers of one particular ſect, and not to officers of government; and as our conſtitution ſays, <q>No ſubordination of any one ſect or denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to another, ſhall ever be eſtabliſhed by law,</q> thoſe laws are repealed thereby. And as the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution was eſtabliſhed by the people, it is ſtronger than any law the aſſembly can make, it being the foundation whereon they ſtand. Alſo the ſociety to which the appellant joined, is as regular a ſociety as the other that taxed him.</p>
            <p>Theſe points were learnedly diſcuſſed, on March 16, 1782; after which the juſtices retired a little by themſelves, and then returned, and declared, <q>that they were unanimouſly agreed in giving the appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant damages and coſts.</q> Which judgment not only ſettled the controverſy in Attleborough, but has been extenſively beneficial elſewhere.</p>
            <p>As far as my memory and judgment ſerve me, this is a fair repreſentation of thoſe tranſactions; and if any can ſet them in a more juſt light, they are wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to do it. And ſince ſome in Attleborough ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed the baptiſts of great inconſiſtency, in proteſting againſt the third article in our bill of rights, and yet now making uſe of it againſt them, I ſhall take leave to make a few remarks upon this ſubject.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is well known that on December 2, 1779, three months before the conſtitution was finiſhed, as agent for our churches, I publiſhed that article in the independent chronicle, with exceptions againſt the power claimed therein; when I declared, that I <q>fully
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:017824_0006_0FA319C106877A70"/>concurred</q> with that part of it which we have now made uſe of; and none could tell how it would oper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate but by experience.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If natural birth, and the doings of others, could make a perſon a member of a religious ſociety, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his own conſent, we ſhould have no objection againſt the way of withdrawing from ſuch a ſociety, that our opponants plead for. But ſince religion is ever a matter between God and individuals, how can any man become a member of a religious ſociety with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his own conſent? And how can a man who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves it to be impoſſible, practically ſay, that it is poſſible, without contracting guilt to his conſcience? This is the exact ſtate of our controverſy about reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious liberty. We have been very far from perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in our behaviour therein; but we have not been accuſed of diſobedience to government, and of diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the public peace, becauſe of our ever invading the rights of others; but only becauſe we will not give up our own. It is becauſe we have choſen ſufferings, rather than to ſin againſt God. We believe that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendence upon public worſhip, and keeping the firſt day of the week holy to God, are duties to be incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated and enforced by his laws, inſtead of the laws of men; but we have had no controverſy with our rulers about that matter. The town of Boſton muſt now look at home, for a want of ſubordination to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in that reſpect.<note n="*" place="bottom">A law about theſe things was made here laſt fall, which, after repeated meetings, is not obeyed by this town.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:017824_0007_0FA319C1C3CA0050"/>
3. The firſt, and moſt eſſential article in the order of Chriſt's kingdom, is that no man <hi>can ſee it,</hi> nor have any right to <hi>power</hi> therein, until he is <hi>born again.</hi> John i. 12, 13. iii. 3. And the fathers of the Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſett government paid ſuch a regard to this truth, that, during their firſt charter, none were admitted to full communion in their churches, nor to govern in the choice and ſupport of miniſters, without a credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble profeſſion of that great change. And their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding of all others from a vote in civil government, and yet compelling of them to attend and ſupport their worſhip, gave the moſt plauſable handle that the Britiſh court ever had, to rob us of the ſtipulated privilege of chooſing our own governors, while they demanded our property to ſupport governers arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily ſet over us. And contentions upon this point was the root of the late bloody war, which has coſt a multitude of lives, and involved both countries amazingly in debt. Yet many are ſtill attached to the errors of our fathers, while they are reſolutely ſet againſt their virtues.</p>
            <p>After a glorious reformation, the firſt church in Middleborough, were bereaved of their beloved paſtor, in April 1744. The church then conſiſted of above an hundred male communicants; but after they had voted to hear Mr. Silvanus Conant four ſabbaths upon probation, the pariſh committee went and got another miniſter to ſupply the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit the ſame days. And a council of ſix mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, approved of their ſo doing, and adviſed them to perſiſt in that way. By this means the ſociety was divided; and a paſtor choſen by three quarters of the church, and who proved to be one of the beſt miniſters in the county, had no
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:017824_0008_0FA319C283ACEB00"/>better place than a barn to preach in, till they built a new meeting houſe for him. The mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters who <hi>cauſed that diviſion,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Rom xvi. 17.</note> belonged to Scituate, Hingham, Hanover, Pembroke, and Bridgewater. And the ſetting up of the world to govern the church about ſoul-guides, was the evident cauſe of the following prophane, cruel, and ſcandelous actions.</p>
            <p>Mr. Richard Lee, a gifted member of one of our churches, having laboured with ſucceſs in Scituate, was earneſtly requeſted by a man in Hingham, to come and hold a meeting at his houſe, which he conſented to. The meeting was appointed to be in the evening of May 28, 1782; but as the people were aſſembling for worſhip, a large mob came up, armed with clubs and ſtaves, and warned Lee and his friends to depart out of Hingham immediately, or it would be much worſe for them. He enquired whether they came with any authority? and finding that they did not, he, with the bible in his hand, began to exhort the people to fear God rather than man. Upon which one of them violently ſeized him by his arm and collar, and others alſo laying hold of him, halled him away out of the houſe, and out of the town. When he attempted to ſpeak, and to recite paſſages of ſcripture, they repeatedly ſmote him on his mouth, with the palms of their hands, and alſo made loud noiſes to prevent his being heard. As one who had hold or him blundered down, and another ſhook
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:017824_0009_0FA319C344228478"/>a club over his head, and ſwore that if he ſlung ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther down, he would ſink Lee to hell in a moment. He then ſaid, <q>I look upon this holy bible to be the very beſt law that ever I heard of.</q> Upon which it was ſpitefully ſtruck out of his hand, and ſtamped under foot, with curſes and execrations too horrid to be here repeated! When the mob had got him over the town line, their captain ſhook a club over Lee's head, and ſwore, that if he ever came into that town again, he would tie him up, and whip him thirty ſtripes. Said our ſuffering brother, <q>that's not ſo much as they whipt Paul.</q> 
               <hi>What! d—n you,</hi> ſaid one, <hi>do you compare yourſelf with Paul!</hi> A Hingham man ſaid, Mr. Lee may go and hold a meeting at my houſe.—But others declared that if he did, they would burn his houſe down, and carry him out of town. One of the mob caſt ſoft cow-dung in Lee's face, and then they inſulted him becauſe of that defilement, with a great deal more of abuſe to men, and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my againſt God. Two other baptiſt brethren were then hauled by violence out of Hingham, and they went and held a religious meeting in Scituate the ſame night.</p>
            <p>In the above actions they tore Mr. Lee's cloaths conſiderably, and alſo bruiſed and injured his body ſo much that he was ill for ſome days, and then he returned home to Gloceſter in the county of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. In July I met him at Scituate, where we were credibly informed, that his ſafety, and even his life, were ſtill threatened by thoſe rioters. We then went to Boſton to aſk advice; and many there as well as in the country, adviſed him to preſent a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint to the grand jury of Suffolk county, againſt thoſe rioters, as a neceſſary means of ſecuring the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:017824_0010_0FA319C4045B20A8"/>public peace, and the liberties of mankind. This was accordingly done, when the county court ſat at Boſton in October. Thirteen men were named in the complaint, which was ſupported by the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of eight witneſſes; and a warrant was granted againſt live of the rioters, four of whom were taken, and pleaded not guilty before the court; upon which their trial was appointed to be on January 14, 1783.</p>
            <p>Snow, ice, and a very ſharp air, cauſed the travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be exceeding difficult; yet Mr. Lee travelled ſeventy miles from his houſe to Scituate, and, with other witneſſes, twenty-three more from thence to Boſton, at the appointed time. But after an expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive attendance of two days, the caſe was put off till April. And the ill treatment he then met with made him determine not to appear there again, without ſomebody from a diſtance to ſpeak for him; and the event juſtified this determination. For no ſooner did a lawyer from Providence appear for him in Boſton, on April 23d, than a propoſal was made to leave the whole affair to choſen men to ſettle it. This was agreed too; and the gentlemen appointed met upon it in Bridgwater the 6th inſtant. But then the defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants could not bear to have their caſe publicly open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and Mr. Lee was prevailed with to ſettle the matter with them, upon their promiſing to pay a ſum far ſhort of what many thought they ought to have done. So that none can juſtly charge him with proſecuting them out of a revengeful ſpirit, nor with taking all the advantages of them that the law would have given him. And their names are not omitted in this publication, out of any fear of not being able ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to prove every article; but becauſe we could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and give proper warnings againſt ſuch actions

            <p>The fathers of this town and government miſtook the work of civil rulers ſo much, as to imagine that they were to inflict corporal puniſhments upon men, as ſinners againſt God, and not only for crimes againſt the community.<note n="*" place="bottom">In Iſrael God was their only lawgiver; and our fathers run in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their error, by attempting to form a chriſtian common wealth, in imitation of the Theocracy of the Jews. Theſe things I mention, not out of diſreſpect to them, but for our inſtruction.</note> They therefore baniſhed ſeveral perſons upon pain of death for adultery, before they did any for hereſy; and ſome were hanged here for adultry near twenty years before they hanged the quakers. But the Apoſtle has plainly taught the churches, to put away wicked perſons out of their communion; and ſays upon it, <hi>Them that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God judgeth.</hi> 1 Cor. v. 13. And in the parable of the tares of the field, our Lord has commanded his ſervants, to let the children of his kingdom, and the children of the wicked one, grow together in the world, till the end of it. Which divine laws have ever been violated by all thoſe who have confounded the government of the church and ſtate together. On the one hand they have been deficient about, if they have not wholly neglected, goſpel diſcipline in the church; while they have ever invaded their neighbours rights in the ſtate, under religious pretences. And for twelve or thirteen centuries, all colleges and places for ſuperior <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>rning, were under the government of men, who aſſumed the power to lay religious bands upon children before they could chooſe for themſelves, and to enforce the ſame by the ſword of the magiſtrate all their days. But I congratulate my countrymen
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:017824_0012_0FA319C586F89778"/>upon the arrival of more agreeable times, and upon the proſpect of a much greater reformation before us. For the following reaſons convince me, that God has now ſet before us an open door for equal chriſtian li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, which no man can ſhut.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Not only America, but all the kingdoms and ſtates of Europe, who have acknowledged the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of our Congreſs, have ſet their ſeal to this truth, that the higheſt civil rulers derive their power from the conſent of the people, and cannot ſtand without their ſupport. And common people know, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more contrary to the rules of honeſty, than for ſome to attempt to convey to others things which they have no right to themſelves; and no one has any right to judge for others in religious affairs.</p>
            <p n="2">2. All former taxes to ſupport worſhip, were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in each government by a particular ſect, who held all others in ſubordination thereto; which parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality is now expreſſly excluded from among us.</p>
            <p n="3">3. No man can take a feat in our legiſlature, till he ſolemnly declares, <q>I believe the chriſtian religion, and have a firm perſuaſion of its truth.</q> And as ſurely as it is true, Chriſt is the only HEAD of his church, and ſhe is COMPLETE in him, and is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to do all her acts IN HIS NAME; and all worſhip of a contrary nature, is <hi>will worſhip,</hi> and is only to <hi>ſatisfy the fleſh.</hi> Col. ii. 10, 19—23. iii. 17. And all miniſters who were ſupported by tax and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion among us before the late war, received that power in the name of the king of Great Britain, and not King Jeſus; and they are the only officers in this land, that have retained the power over the people, which they have received in that name. Whatever gifts and graces any of them have received from Jeſus
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:017824_0013_0FA319C645767BB8"/>Chriſt, let them faithfully improve the ſame according to his direction; but, as they would appear loyal to him, or friends to their country, let them renounce the holding of any earthly head to the church.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If this be not done, none can tell who they will have for their head. For the name proteſtant is no longer to be a teſt of our legiſlators; and to purſuade the people to yield thereto, the compilers of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution ſaid to them, <q>your delegates did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive themſelves to be veſted with power to ſet up one denomination of chriſtians above another; for religion muſt at all times be a matter between God and individuals.</q> This is a great truth; and it proves, that no man can become a member of a truly religious ſociety without his own conſent; and alſo that no corporation that is not a religious ſociety can have a right to govern in religious matters. Chriſt ſaid, <hi>who made me a judge, or a divider over you?</hi> And Paul ſaid, <hi>what have I to do to judge them alſo that are without?</hi> Luke xii. 14. 1 Cor. v. 12. Thus our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Lord, and the great apoſtle of the Gentiles, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly renounced any judicial power over the world by virtue of their religion. And to imagine that <hi>money</hi> can give any <hi>power</hi> in religious matters, is the doctrine of Simon the <hi>ſorcerer;</hi> and by ſuch <hi>ſorceries</hi> the whore of Babylon hath <hi>deceived all nations.</hi> Acts viii. 18, 19. Rev. xviii. 23. It was from thence that the Pope, on May 4, 1493, the year after Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca was firſt diſcovered, preſumed to give away the lands of the heathen therein. And the ſame power was claimed by the crown of England, in granting ſeveral charters of this country; from whence ſome of
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:017824_0014_0FA319C707C08710"/>the ſtates were lately contending in Congreſs with others, about the weſtern lands on this continent.</p>
            <p n="5">5. All the power that the conſtitution gives our legiſlature in this reſpect, is to make <q>ſuitable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion</q> for chriſtian teachers; and, according to their declaration, divine revelation muſt determine what is ſuitable; and that determines that they <hi>ſhall live of the goſpel.</hi> 1 Cor. ix. 14. Thoſe who under the law collected ſupport for religious teachers <hi>by force,</hi> brought compleat deſtruction upon themſelves there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for 1 Sam. ii. 16, 25. Micah iii. 5—12. Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is a voluntary obedience to God's revealed will; and every thing of a contrary nature is antichriſtianiſm. And all teachers who do not watch for ſouls as thoſe who muſt give an account to God; and all people who do not receive and ſupport his faithful miniſters, as they have opportunity and ability, are daily expoſed to puniſhments infinitely worſe than men can inflict. Luke x. 3—12. Gal. vi. 6—9. Heb. xiii. 7, 17, 18.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Reaſon and revelation agree, in determining that the end of civil government is the <hi>good</hi> of the governed, by defending them againſt all ſuch as would <hi>work ill to their neighbours;</hi> and in limiting the power of <hi>rulers</hi> there. And thoſe who invade the religious rights of others, are <hi>ſelfcondemed,</hi> which of all things is the moſt oppoſite to <hi>happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> the great end of government. Rom. xiii. 3— 10. xiv. 10—23.</p>
            <p n="7">7. If men will refuſe to be happy themſelves, yet their power to enſlave others is now greatly weakened. And a faithful improvement of our privileges will weaken it more and more, till there
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:017824_0015_0FA319C7C54F2568"/>ſhall be no more uſe for <hi>ſwords,</hi> becauſe their ſhall be <hi>none to hurt or deſtroy in all God's holy mountain.</hi> Iſaiah xi. 9. Micah iv. 1—4. And who would not be in earneſt for that glorious day?</p>
