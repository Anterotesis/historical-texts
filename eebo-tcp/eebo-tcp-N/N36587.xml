            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.</head>
            <p>THE reception which the firſt Edition of this Treatiſe has met with, has made it neceſſary to publiſh a ſecond; which I now preſent to the Reader, with ſuch additions, as I hope will be acceptable and uſeful.</p>
            <p>I have collected many authorities, to corrobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate what I have advanced; that as my opinions have prejudices to contend with, they may not, however, be objectionable on the ground of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity, and be conſidered as ſupported by no other teſtimony than my own.</p>
            <p>IN treating of the ſalutary advantages, which the Public will derive, individually, from the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral uſe of Coffee, it is impoſſible not to reflect alſo, on the political benefits which will accrue to the Parent State, by increaſing its cultivation in her Colonies.</p>
            <p>To the Coloniſts themſelves the object is very extenſive; and ſurely the proſperity of ſo import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant a part of the Empire, as our Weſt Indian Iſlands, demands the moſt liberal attention on the part of this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>FROM the produce of our plantations, that "magnificent property," as Monſ. NECKER terms the French Colonies,
"which only the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:047837_0003_10249D0612EC19D8"/>and ignorant affect to undervalue,"
this Country receives great additions to her Revenue, and a total ſupply of one of the moſt uſeful arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles (perhaps now a neceſſary) of life. Yet, from the calamities lately inflicted on ſome of them by the hand of Providence, and the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulated burthens which the Public neceſſities have laid on them all, many of the Planters are involved in ruin; and thoſe who eſcape, muſt owe their deliverance to the braveſt ſtruggles of induſtrious virtue.</p>
            <p>THE population of White Inhabitants which is the great ſecurity of the Iſlands, conſiſts chiefly of thoſe who cultivate the inferior Staple Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, among which, Coffee is now the principal; and this population has always been proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the increaſe or decreaſe of thoſe Staples. Indigo may be inſtanced as an example: When Indigo was encouraged in Jamaica, before that impolitic duty was laid on it, which exterminated the cultivation of it in our colonies, and gave it to the French, there were conſiderably more White Inhabitants in that Iſland, than there are at preſent, though the Iſland now produces five times the quantity of Sugar and Rum it did at that time.</p>
            <p>THE cultivation of Coffee requiring but little capital, is an inducement for people of ſmall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, to ſettle in the Iſlands. It is a creditable refuge for the induſtrious man, who has been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate in Trade, and to thoſe whoſe larger ſchemes in life have failed.—It is an eaſy em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment; the labour light, and many parts of it performed by children. The ſituations and ſoil where it is carried on, muſt be dry, and of courſe healthy, to be advantageous. Coffee Plantations
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:047837_0004_10249D07EDCACB28"/>in particular, may be conſidered as a Nurſery of uſeful Inhabitants for the Colonies.</p>
            <p>THE Soil beſt ſuited for coffee, is happily ſuch as can be ſpared from every other purpoſe. Large tracts of poor land, which would otherwiſe lie waſte and uſeleſs, may be rendered as profitable as the beſt, without the mortality and caſualties atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant on ſevere labour in hot climates.</p>
            <p>THE numerous little families which live on Coffee Plantations, and are diſperſed in ſmall ſettlements, in the interior parts of the Iſlands, occaſion the mountainous and woody lands to be cleared and opened; and to be interſected with roads and eaſy communications.</p>
            <p>THUS the reſidents live in ſafety, and all ſorts of property acquire a proportionate value and ſecurity. The retreats of fugitive Negroes are laid open; plunder and depredation prevented, and conſpiracies for rebellion are deprived of their hiding-places.—And thus the credit of the Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſecurity of the Merchant, ſtand on a firm baſis: Thoſe commotions being prevented, which have ſo often diſturbed the tranquillity of the Iſlands, and occaſioned the ruin of many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals abroad and at home, to the great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falcation of that immenſe Revenue, which theſe Iſlands pay to the Mother-Country<note n="*" place="bottom">The Duties and Exciſes, upon a Computation for the year 1781, amount to about £1,346<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>12, ſterling, annually, on the produce of <hi>Jamaica</hi> only.</note>.</p>
            <p>THE truth is, that Sugar Plantations, though they are the great ſources of wealth to their propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etors, as well as to Government, do not employ a ſufficient number of White People for their inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſecurity, againſt the inſurrections of the negroes. The manufacture is ſimple, and the labour whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:047837_0005_10249D0B025997D0"/>carried on by Slaves; and though the Defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency Law of Jamaica directs, that one White Perſon ſhall be employed for every thirty Slaves, under a penalty of thirty pounds per annum for every deficiency; yet, this Law is often defeated, or the fine ſubmitted to; as White Servants are expenſive, and a leſs number than that proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is ſufficient for the purpoſes of making Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar.</p>
            <p>THE cultivation of inferior Staple Commodities, is therefore neceſſary to the very exiſtence of the Sugar Colonies; and I am perſuaded, will prove to them more beneficial in many reſpects, than at preſent is generally imagined.—Here, then, is an open and grateful field for Colonial Patriotiſm; in which the <hi>Amor Patriae</hi> will neither find op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition from envy, nor diſappointment from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude.—Here is the occaſion to demonſtrate the love of our Country, and to perpetuate a benefit to mankind, which will never be forgotten: and while a PEMRHYN, a LONG, and an EDWARDS, continue to point out to the Public, with that abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity by which they are as much diſtinguiſhed as by their weight and conſequence, the true intereſt of the Sugar Colonies, and of this Country, as connected with them, there will never be wanting ſome men, at leaſt in the Adminiſtration of this Kingdom, who will underſtand that a ſubject of the realm, exerting his induſtry at four thouſand miles diſtance, may be employed as beneficially to the State, and is as much deſerving the protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, as the Country 'Squire, who leaves his fox-hounds, to give a ſilent vote or two during the winter, and retires the remainder of the year to his <hi>Sabine Fields</hi> in ſloth and ignorance.</p>
            <p>SIR NICHOLAS LAWS was the firſt perſon who planted Coffee in Jamaica;—but dying three
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:047837_0006_10249D0D658BF040"/>years afterwards, in 1731, he had not the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to ſee the cultivation of it make any conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable progreſs.</p>
            <p>IN 1732, ſeveral of the Planters and Merchants, belonging to the Iſland, became patrons of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking; and convinced, that under proper en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement it might be of importance to the Iſland, and that Coffee might become a flouriſhing Staple Article of produce, they ſubſcribed the ſum of 220l. 10s. towards defraying the charges of ſoliciting an Act of Parliament for lowering the Inland Duty, upon the importation of Coffee from Jamaica into Great Britain; which at that time was 10l. ſterling per Cwt. The circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance being but little known at preſent, and conſidering what obligation the Iſland is under to their exertions, I am happy in having an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of inſerting their names, as a proper tribute to the memory of thoſe benefactors to the Colony, and Friends to the Nation.</p>

            <p>In the ſame year, and in conſequence of this ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitation, the <hi>Act</hi> 5<hi>th Geo.</hi> II. was paſſed, enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled, "An Act for encouraging the growth of Coffee in his Majeſty's Plantations in <hi>America.</hi>"— The preamble recites, that the ſoil and climate of Jamaica, are particularly adapted for the growth of this Commodity; and the act itſelf reduces the Inland Duty upon Britiſh Plantation Coffee impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into Great Britain, from two ſhillings, to eighteen pence per pound:—And here it ſtood for many years, producing a Revenue to the Crown of about 10,000l. per anum. A few years ago, on the repreſentation of the Weſt India Planters, <hi>Lord John Cavendiſh,</hi> the then Chancellor of the Exchequer, conſented to the very important re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>ion of one ſhilling more; thereby furniſhing a moſt uſeful leſſon to all future Financiers,—<hi>the preſent Duty of ſixpence per pound actually produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing nearly three times the ſum that was received when the Duty was eighteen pence</hi>: So true is the doctrine, that heavy taxation defeats its own purpoſe.</p>
            <p>IT has been computed, that one acre of land will contain 1100 Coffee plants, which will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce berries in eighteen months from the ſowing of the ſeed. The trees will continue bearing for ſeven or eight years.—Each tree, after the firſt bearing, may produce, at a medium, one and an half or two pounds weight, one with another; and
<pb n="ix" facs="unknown:047837_0008_10249D11DBDF6BF8"/>ſix or eight ſervants can manage ten or twelve acres, beſides cultivating proviſions for themſelves. Upon this ground of calculation, it is apparent, that one acre of land, ſuppoſing the weather not unfavourable, may yield annually from 1700lb. to 2200lb. weight, which, when brought to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, may ſell for 9l. 15s. to 12l. 15s. ſterling <hi>net.</hi> This, it is true, is but a ſmall profit; for it is little more than five farthings per pound, whereas the <hi>Duty alone is ſixpence per pound.</hi> If the Duty was equalized to that upon Sugar, the medium profits per acre, would be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 40l. per annum. At preſent, the <hi>net</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits upon this Article, and upon Sugar in Jamaica, are nearly equal per acre;—that is, 10l. or 12l. ſterling.</p>
            <p>IN the year 1752, the export of Coffee from Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maica, was rated at 60,000 pounds weight. In 1775, it was 440,000 pounds weight.—Under the preſent Duty of ſixpence per pound, there is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to expect, that the exports may rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe than diminiſh. But it is not likely to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a ſubject of very extenſive culture in our Weſt Indian Iſlands, until even this Duty is low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered, or at leaſt while <hi>Foreign</hi> Coffee is permitted to enter into competition with it at the Britiſh mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket. Though the Planters of Jamaica after a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of experiments, and the moſt laudable exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, have diſcovered the art of cultivating, picking, and curing the berries, ſo as to make their Coffee equal to the growth of Arabia. Some ſamples have been produced from that Iſland, lately, which were pronounced by the London Dealers, even ſuperior to the beſt that has been brought from the Eaſt.</p>

It pays a Duty of about two-pence per pound.</note>: And it equals in virtues, and is more applicable to the general purpoſes of life, and lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury too, than any ſpice that is brought from the Eaſt. The various uſes into which <hi>Piementa</hi> is converted in Europe, are but little known to thoſe who raiſe it. One ſecret, at leaſt, I am able to divulge to them, which is, that its eſſential oil, coloured with <hi>Alkanet Root,</hi> to give it the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of age, is ſold all over Europe for the oil of cloves<note n="†" place="bottom">The principal and prevailing flavour of Piementa, is like that of Cloves: Its oil exactly reſembles the oil of that ſpice, and ſinks as that does in water. The oil reſides chiefly, like that of Cloves, in the ſhell, or cortical part.</note>.</p>
            <p>SIR HANS SLOANE, in the Phil. Trans. Abr. vol. II. p. 667, ſays that "<hi>Piementa</hi> may deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly be counted the beſt and moſt temperate, mild, and innocent of common ſpices; and fit to come into greater uſe, and gain more ground, than it yet hath, of the Eaſt India commodities
<pb n="xi" facs="unknown:047837_0010_10249D1710A70FC0"/>of this kind; almoſt all of which it far ſurpaſſes, by promoting the digeſtion of meat, attenuating tough humours, moderately heating, ſtrengthening the ſtomach, expelling wind, and doing thoſe friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offices to the bowels, we generally expect from ſpices." To this inferiority of the dear-bought and far-fetched ſpices of the Eaſt, I can bear am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple teſtimony;—while the ſpice in queſtion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the produce one of our own Colonies, and growing there in the greateſt abundance, can be afforded at a price, that the poor of Great Britain may have all the comforts of its excellent proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; which I truſt will be ſufficiently made known to them hereafter.</p>
            <p>THE encouraging every article which increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es the intercourſe with our Colonies, is increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing our Commerce. The payment for all the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the Weſt Indies, is made in our Manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; the ſale of which muſt increaſe, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the numbers that are employed in the cultivation of what is bartered for them.

            <p>IT is a generally received opinion, that the human frame is not leſs influenced by diet than by climate; that its diſpoſitions and characte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtics owe their originality as much to food, as thoſe diſeaſes evidently do, which are the legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate and indiſputable iſſue of it.</p>
            <p>IF the preceding poſition be juſt, there cannot ſurely be a ſubject more intereſting to man, than the purſuit of that knowledge which may inſtruct him to avoid what is hurtful to health, to ſelect for his uſe ſuch things as tend to raiſe the value of his condition, and to carry the enjoyments of life to their utmoſt improvement.</p>

<pb n="16" facs="unknown:047837_0015_10249D21DBBA01D8"/>Coffee, or of the manner of taking it. As he was going out of the Moſque one day after evening prayer he obſerved in a corner of it a company of people drinking Coffee, who were to ſpend the night there in prayer, and was much offended at it.

            <p>"A DOCTOR of the aſſembly replied, that BENGIAZLAH, an ancient Arabian phyſician of great authority, had ſaid that theſe berries were hot and dry and conſequently could not have the qualities juſt now aſcribed to them.</p>
            <p>"THE two Perſian phyſicians replied, that BENGIAZLAH was a perfect ſtranger to the berries in queſtion; and declared, that if Coffee was rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned among things indifferent, and free for every body to make uſe of, yet it was apt to lead to things not allowed of; and the ſafeſt way for true Muſſulmen would be, to hold it unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
            <p>"THIS determination obtained all their ſuffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; and ſeveral, either out of prejudice, or falſe zeal, did not fail to affirm that Coffee had actually diſturbed their brains. One of the aſſiſtants main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, that it intoxicated like wine, which ſet all the aſſembly a laughing; becauſe, in order to make a judgment of it, it was neceſſary to have drank wine, which is forbidden by the Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan religion. He was aſked whether he had ever drank any wine and he had the imprudence to anſwer in the affirmative; which confeſſion condemned him to the baſtinado, the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that is inflicted for this crime.</p>
            <p>"COFFEE was however ſolemnly condemned at <hi>Mecca,</hi> as a thing forbidden by law, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the <hi>Mufti</hi> oppoſed the determination. But this rigour was not of long duration; for the <hi>Sultan</hi> of Egypt, far from approving of the indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet zeal of the Governor of <hi>Mecca,</hi> was ſurpriſed that he ſhould dare to condemn a thing ſo much in favour at <hi>Cairo,</hi> the capital of his dominions,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:047837_0017_10249D2588B61270"/>where there were Doctors of much greater autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity than thoſe of <hi>Mecca,</hi> and who had not found any thing in the uſe of Coffee contrary to the law.</p>
            <p>"THE <hi>Sultan</hi> ordered him therefore to revoke his prohibition, and to employ his authority againſt the diorders only, if there were any, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in the Coffee houſes; adding that becauſe <hi>it was poſſible to abuſe the very beſt things,</hi> even the water of the fountain ZERVIZEM, in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of MECCA, ſo much eſteemed by all Muſſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, it was not for that reaſon neceſſary abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to forbid them.</p>
            <p>"THE two phyſicians who bore ſo great a part in the prohibition of Coffee, came to an unfortunate end.</p>
            <p>"AFTER the re-eſtabliſhment of Coffee at <hi>Mecca,</hi> it was prohibited again, and again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>"THE <hi>Sultan</hi> of Egypt conſulted his Doctors of the Law upon this point; who gave their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in writing, and proved by ſubſtantial reaſons, the fallacy of that condemnation, and the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of thoſe who paſſed it; which eſtabliſhed the uſe of Coffee at <hi>Cairo,</hi> upon a much ſtronger footing than ever. But in the end, this great city alſo met with much trouble upon this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
            <p>"IN the year 1523 a ſcrupulous Doctor ſtated, that Coffee intoxicates the head, and is prejudicial to health; and aſked whether it was lawful or unlawful? But none of his brethren were of his opinion, becauſe it was obvious that Coffee had not thoſe bad qualities he aſcribed to it; and therefore this gave no ſhock at all to a cuſtom ſo u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſally received.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:047837_0018_10249D2A5C59B4A8"/>"BUT about ten years after, a preacher held forth ſo vehemently againſt the uſe of Coffee as a thing prohibited by law, that the mob fell upon the Coffee-houſes, broke the pots and diſhes, and abuſed the company they found there.</p>
            <p>"UPON this there were two parties formed in the city; one of which maintained that Coffee was prohibited by the law; the other, that it was not. But the Judge in chief, having convened an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of all the Doctors, to have their opinions, they all unanimouſly declared that the queſtion had been already determined by their predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, in favour of Coffee; that they were all of the ſame ſentiment; and that there was nothing fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neceſſary than only to reſtrain the extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant heat of the zealots, and the indiſcretion of ignorant preachers. The Judge who preſided was of the ſame opinion; and immediately order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the aſſembly to be ſerved with Coffee, and took ſome himſelf: an example which preſently compoſed all controverſies, and made Coffee more faſhionable than before.</p>
            <p>"AT the time when this cuſtom was moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> the <hi>Imans</hi> and officers of the Moſques made a great clamour, that they were deſerted, whilſt all the Coffee-houſes were conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually crowded. The Dervizes and prieſts fell foul upon Coffee; not only affirming that it was unlawful, but that it was a much greater ſin to go to a Coffee-houſe than to a Tavern.</p>
            <p>"AFTER a great deal of noiſe and declamation, all the Prieſts united to obtain a ſolemn condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of this liquor; and maintained that Coffee roaſted was a ſort of coal; and that every thing which had the leaſt relation to a coal, was forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by law. Upon this they drew up a queſtion in form, and preſented it to the <hi>Mufti,</hi> with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt that he would determine it according to the
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:047837_0019_10249D2C96B33BC8"/>duty of his office. The <hi>Mufti,</hi> without giving himſelf the trouble of examining any difficulties, gave a determination according to the mind of the Prieſts and pronounced that Coffee was prohibited by the law of MAHOMET.</p>
            <p>"ALL the Coffee-houſes in <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> were immediately ſhut up, and the officers of the police ordered to prevent the drinking of Coffee in what manner ſoever.</p>
            <p>"YET notwithſtanding the rigour that was uſed in the execution of this order, they could, never prevent the uſe of it in private. AMURATH III. in whoſe time this prohibition had taken place, again indulged a liberty with regard to a thing ſo agreeable, and which was believed other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe not contrary to religion; ſo that it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to be drank in men's own houſes, and grew more and more into eſteem. At laſt, the officers of the police, ſeeing there was no remedy, were content for a certain ſum, to permit it to be ſold, provided it was not in public; ſo that it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to be drank in private houſes, ſhutting up the doors, or in the back ſhops.</p>
            <p>"THERE wanted but little, to eſtabliſh by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees the public Coffee-houſes. It happened that a new <hi>Mufti,</hi> leſs ſcrupulous, or more wiſe than his predeceſſor, declared ſolemnly that Coffee ought not to be looked upon as a coal; and that the liquor made from it was not prohibited by the law. After this declaration, the Zealots, Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Doctors, Lawyers, and <hi>Mufti</hi> himſelf, far from exclaiming againſt Coffee, took it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and their example was univerſally fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by the whole Court and City<note n="*" place="bottom">Voyage into Arabia Felix, p. 282, 296.

            <p>ABOUT the middle of the fifteenth century, the <hi>Mufti</hi> of Aden, a city in Arabia Felix, travelling into Perſia, learnt the uſe of it there, and on his return introduced it to his countrymen.</p>
            <p>IT is from this period, that any authentic ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the dietetic uſe of Coffee is derived.

            <p>THE virtues of this chearful liquor, like mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral virtues under deſpotiſm, operated in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople to its detriment:—by diſpelling the torpitude brought on by their vicious exceſſes, and recruiting their ſpirits, ſunk by the depravity of their habits, it introduced a diſpoſition to exerciſe the underſtanding,—a crime in every Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that tolerates nothing but ſilent obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>

            <p>IT has been ſaid, that a Frenchman near <hi>Dijon</hi> in France, was the firſt perſon who made the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment with ſucceſs, about the year 1670: the Trees raiſed from the ſeeds he had ſown produced berries, but they were taſteleſs and inſipid; and ſerved for no other purpoſe, than for his amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>ACCORDING to BOERHAAVE's account, a Dutch Governor was the firſt perſon who produced freſh berries from Mocha, and planted them in <hi>Batavia</hi>; and in the year 1690 ſent a plant from thence to Amſterdam; which came to maturity, and produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced thoſe berries, which have ſince furniſhed all that is now cultivated in the Weſt-Indies.</p>
            <p>IN 1714 a plant from the garden of Amſterdam was ſent by the Magiſtrates, as a preſent to LEW<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>IS the XIVth, which was placed in the garden at Marli.</p>
            <p>In 1718 the Dutch began to cultivate Coffee in Surinam; in 1727 the French began to cultivate it in Martinico; and in 1728 the Engliſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to cultivate it in Jamaica.</p>

            <p>IF the Coffee in our Weſt India Iſlands be planted in a dry ſoil, and in a warm ſituation; if after the trees have acquired a certain age, the ripe berries be collected with care and cleanlineſs, which will be ſmall when dry, like thoſe which come from Arabia; and if they are kept a proper time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are uſed, this Coffee will have flavour and excellence equal to the beſt that is imported from Mocha.</p>
            <p>BUT the time and labour neceſſary to produce Coffee of the beſt quality have diſcouraged our Planters from raiſing it at much expence; becauſe, until lately, it has been ſubject to a precarious, or loſing market.

Coffee berries are remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably diſpoſed to imbibe exhalations from other bodies, and thereby acquire an advantageous, and diſagreeable flavour.

            <p>THE cloſer it is confined at the time of roaſting and till uſed, the better will its volatile pungency, flavour and virtues, be perſerved.</p>
            <p>FOURTEEN pounds weight of raw Coffee, is generally reduced at the public roaſting houſes, to eleven pounds by the roaſting; for which the Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler pays ſeven pence halfpenny; at the rate of five ſhillings for every hundred weight <note n="†" place="bottom">In London.</note>. But the roaſting ought to be regulated by the age, and quality of the Coffee, and by nicer rules than the appearance of the fumes, and ſuch as are uſually practiſed; therefore the reduction muſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently vary, and no exact ſtandard can be aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:047837_0026_10249D3CC9473E80"/>Beſides, by mixing different ſorts of Coffee together, that require different degrees of heat and roaſting, Coffee has ſeldom all the advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges it is capable of receiving, to make it delicate, grateful, and pleaſant. This indeed can be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected no way ſo well, as by people who have it roaſted in their own houſes, to their own taſte, and freſh as they want it for uſe.</p>
            <p>THE extraordinary influence that Coffee, judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly prepared, imparts to the ſtomach, from its tonic and invigorating qualities, is ſtrongly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplified by the immediate effect produced on ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it when the ſtomach is overloaded with food, or nauſeated with ſurfeit, or debilitated by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance.</p>

            <p>AMONG the many valuable qualities of Coffee, that of its being an antidote to the abuſe of OPIUM, muſt not be conſidered as the leaſt; for as man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind is not content with the wonderful efficacy derived from the prudent uſe of opium, the
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:047837_0032_10249D4B07CCA888"/>abuſe of it is productive of many evils, that are only remediable by Coffee.</p>
            <p>THE diſeaſes generally brought on by a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued courſe of exceſſive doſes of Opium, are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther loſs of appetite, ſtupor, debility, loſs of memory, melancholy, palſy, or dropſy:— and frequently the conſequences of the neceſſary and temporary uſe of common doſes of lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danum, are nauſea, languor, giddineſs of the head, cold ſweats, head-ach, hyſterics, and tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor.</p>

            <p>THERE never was, as far as we know, any preparation, or combination with Opium, from the time of King MITHRIDATES down to the days of Doctor JONES, that could be relied on to conteract the ill effects of its firſt operations, in many conſtitutions; and that would prevent thoſe diſagreeable after operations ſo much complained of in almoſt every ſubject and diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>SUCH a preparation, would indeed be a large contribution to the Materia Medica, and would make a conſiderable figure in the practice of phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic. But this may never be accompliſhed; it may
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:047837_0033_10249D4D8A39F738"/>not be in nature;—the defect may be the inherent imperfection of the vegetable, and inſeparable from it; for as we find in the moral world, the brighteſt virtues may be ſhaded with alloy;—if ſo, it will yet be ſome conſolation, that we are able to remove thoſe ills which we cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent.</p>
            <p>EVERY Author who mentions Coffee, allows that it poſſeſſes ſingular power in counteracting the hypnotic, or ſleepy effects of Opium; this is the only virtue aſſigned to it, in regard to Opium: as if the influence which Coffee exerts on the ſyſtem, to produce that effect, could be directed to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, when theſe contradictions were not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in oppoſition, to rob each other of their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes.</p>
            <p>CONFIRMED by many years obſervation, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that Coffee beſides being the beſt corrector of Opium, is the beſt medicine to remove thoſe ills which it produces, that has yet been diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and that the operations of common doſes of Opium, may be checked or extended, and may be graduated by it at pleaſure.</p>
            <p>THE heavineſs, head ach, giddineſs, ſickneſs, and nervous affections, which attack the patient in the morning who has taken an opiate at night, are agreeably removed by a cup or two of ſtrong Coffee.</p>
            <p>In Military hoſpitals in hot climates, recourſe is often had to large and repeated doſes of Opium; from which I have frequently obſerved, that the retention of the ſtomach of the patient, has been greatly injured; the ſecretion of urine impeded, or the bladder affected by a paralyſis:—even theſe effects have been ſpeedily removed, by a few cups of ſtrong Coffee</p>

All the ancient nations who made much uſe of the <hi>Legumina</hi> in their diet, prepared many of them by torefaction and it is moſt probable that the Arabians were acquainted with the art of preparing a liquor, from the parched or roaſted berries of a tree that was indigenous among them, prior to its uſe in Egypt and Perſia, or in any of the neighbouring Countries.

               <pb n="38" facs="unknown:047837_0037_10249D5624A0E078"/>MANY have been the dogmas concerning Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fee: ſome Authors allege that it is <hi>dry,</hi> and therefore good for the groſs and phlegmatic, but hurtful to lean people; ſome contend that it is <hi>cold,</hi> and therefore good for ſanguine, bilious, and hot conſtitutions; others that it is <hi>hot,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore bad for the ſanguine and bilious, but good for cold conſtitutions. Some aſſure us, that it acts only as a <hi>ſedative</hi>; others, that it acts only as a <hi>ſtimulant.</hi> With ſuch diſputants there is no entering the liſts: Medical ſcience diſclaims their pretenſions, as creations of the imagination; and transfers their conteſt for deciſion, to a Synod of Turkiſh Prieſts.</p>
            <p>I AM aware that there are others, who are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſively of opinion, that Coffee is injurious "in thin habits and bilious temperaments; in melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholic and hypochondriacal diſorders, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſubject to haemorrhages."—WILLIS and CHEYNE, as well as LEWIS, were in ſome degree of this opinion.</p>
            <p>In haemorrhages, particularly in thoſe of the pulmonic and uterine kind, the interdiction of Coffee is every where juſtly admitted<note n="*" place="bottom">Yet Dr. <hi>Percival</hi> ſays it is "powerfully ſedative." vol. I. p.</note>; but the other exceptions however they may have been taken up, and aſſerted in England, where the confined uſe of Coffee has ſcarcely afforded a
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:047837_0038_10249D5915FD5948"/>fair opportunity to ſettle ſuch a point, will be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted in countries where it is in general uſe. Let me add alſo that the reſult of my own obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations in thoſe countries, is evidence againſt thoſe exceptions; and it is confirmed by every information I have obtained, from medical people reſident in Conſtantinople, and other parts of the Turkiſh Empire.</p>
            <p>LET us examine this arbitary reſtriction to the uſe of Coffee, and ſee what juſtice there is in the grounds on which it has been impoſed, and what reaſon there is in having ſubmitted to it.</p>
            <p>IN regard to "thin habits," where there is no diſeaſe, I can ſay but little; being acquainted with no theory that militates againſt the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent uſe of Coffee in the alimentary way; nor why it ſhould not be as harmleſs, to ſuch habits, as to thoſe who are bleſſed with the greateſt obeſity and rotundity of figure.</p>
            <p>In "bilious temperaments," facts and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence muſt determine. Bilious temperaments are ſurely no where ſo common as in hot cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates; and in thoſe very countries, Coffee is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly moſt uſed. There Coffee is found to tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and ſoften the acrimony of the bile, and is remarkably ſerviceable in the cholorea mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus. It is obſerved in bilious habits that the ſtomach receives nothing more agreeably than Coffee; and that the nauſea and inclination to vomit, which often accompany bilious complaints, are taken away by Coffee. In the jaundice, it is uſed with great ſucceſs, and in obſtructions of the liver.</p>
            <p>To the opinion that Coffee is hurtful in "me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholic and hypochondriacal diſorders," a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of opinions may be oppoſed; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>IT is well known, that there are ſome habits which cannot endure any thing that increaſes the ſenſibility of the nerves; and others that are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by particular ſtimulants.

            <p>A CUP or two thus taken after dinner without cream or milk, promotes digeſtion, and has been found very ſerviceable to thoſe who are habitually coſtive. If a draught of water is taken before Coffee, according to the Eaſtern cuſtom, it gives it a tendency to act as an aperient.</p>
            <p>THUS for the properties and medicinal effects of Coffee have been conſidered; and as the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verage made from it, contains all the eſſential vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of the berry, which united, are moſt proper for dietetic purpoſes, I have not entered into any diſcuſſion of its component parts ſeparately, nor of the diſtilled water, ſyrup, oil, and other ſimple preparations which have been made from the ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; for I do not believe, that, thoſe preparations
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:047837_0042_10249D618602A688"/>poſſeſs any properties deſerving particular notice; but that we are indebted to the virtues we derive from Coffee, to the total derangement of its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſtate, by the proceſs it undergoes in roaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, from the fire.</p>
            <p>THE mode of preparing this beverage for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon uſe, differs in different countries, principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as to the additions made to it.—But though that is generally underſtood, and that taſte, conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the quality of the Coffee, and the quantity intended to be drank, muſt be conſulted, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the proportion of Coffee, to the water in making it—yet there is one material point, the importance of which is not ſo well underſtood, and which admits of no deviation.</p>
            <p>THE preſervation of the virtues of the Coffee, as has been ſaid, depends on carefully confining it after it has been roaſted; and not powdering it until the time of uſing it; that the volatile and aethereal principles, generated by the fire, may not eſcape. But all this will ſignify nothing, and the beſt materials will be uſeleſs, unleſs this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant admonition is ſtrictly attended to: that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the liquor is made, <hi>it ſhould be bright and clear, and entirely exempt from the leaſt cloudineſs or foul appearance, from a ſuſpenſion of any of the particles of the ſubſtance of the Coffee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THERE is ſcarcely any vegetable infuſion, or decoction, whoſe effects differ from its groſs origin, more than that of which we are ſpeaking. Coffee taken in ſubſtance, cauſes oppreſſion at the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, heat, nauſea, and indigeſtion: conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently a continued uſe of a decoction of it, in which any quantity of its ſubſtance is contained, beſides being diſguſting to the palate, muſt tend to produce the ſame indiſpoſitions. The reſiduum
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:047837_0043_10249D63C10A4BE0"/>of the roaſted berry, after its virtues are extracted from it, is little more than an earthly calx, and muſt therefore be pernicious.</p>
            <p>THE want of attention to this circumſtance, I make no doubt, has been the cauſe of many of the complaints againſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>IF a knowledge of the principles of Coffee, founded on examination and various experiments, added to abſervations made on the extenſive and indiſcriminate uſe of it, cannot authoriſe us to attribute to it any particular circumſtance un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friendly to the human frame;—if the unerring teſt of experience has confirmed its utility, in many countries, not excluſively productive of thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences, habits, and diſeaſes, for which its peculiar properties ſeem moſt applicable;—let thoſe properties be duly conſidered; and let us reflect on the ſtate of our atmoſphere; the food, and modes of life of the inhabitants, ſo injurious to youth and beauty, filling the large towns and cities which chronical infirmities; and I think it will be evident what advantages will reſult from the general uſe of Coffee in England, as an arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of diet, from the comforts of which the poor are not excluded, and to what purpoſes it may of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten be employed, as a ſafe and powerful medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine.</p>
