            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <q>
                  <hi>For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? Do that which is good, and thou ſhalt have praiſe of the ſame: For he is the miniſter of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the ſword in vain; for he is the miniſter of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil.</hi>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THERE are particular occurrences, in providence, which are peculiarly fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to turn our attention to the nature and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of civil government, and lead us to prize and revere it as a divine inſtitution. The preſent affecting and melancholy occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is one of thoſe, and we are now called upon humbly to adore and bleſs God, that there is a way, of his own appointment, in
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:021599_0004_0FB419859264FFE8"/>
which the world may rid itſelf of thoſe who, by their crimes and violence, have made themſelves intolerable to ſociety. That there is a way in which this may be done, with the divine approbation, is evident from the words of our text. For God has appointed civil rulers to bear his ſword, to avenge the wrongs of ſociety, and to execute wrath upon evil doers.</p>
            <p>But it has been a queſtion, with ſome, what thoſe crimes are for which capital puniſhments may be inflicted. Many have imagined that nothing but <hi>murder</hi> or <hi>ſhedding of man's blood</hi> might be puniſhed with death by the civil ruler.</p>
            <p>A little attention to the ſacred writings may convince us of the contrary. Happy for the world that, even in matters of civil gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment, we are favoured with ſo excellent a guide.</p>
            <p>We find that, under the Moſaic law, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny crimes, beſides that of murder, were made capital. And, as the <hi>civil government</hi> of the Hebrews was far more excellent than that of any other nation, being framed and inſtituted by infinite wiſdom; it may well be patterned after by civil legiſlators: And ſuch of its laws and inſtitutions as difference of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances will admir, be adopted by other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:021599_0005_0FB41986F9AC7EF0"/>
By the Jewiſh law, a variety of crimes were puniſhable with death: Such as—<hi>Curſing, or ſmiting father or mother,</hi> Exod, xxi. 15, 17. that diſobedience to authority might be nip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in the bad.—<hi>Cauſing their children to paſs through the fire, and offering them to Moloch. Adultery, Inceſt, Lying with a beaſt,</hi> ſee Levit. xx. <hi>Blaſphemy,</hi> Levit. xxiv. 16. <hi>Idolatry,</hi> Deut. xvii. 5. <hi>Raviſhing,</hi> or <hi>Rapes,</hi> Deut. xxii. 25. If a <hi>Thief,</hi> found breaking up in the night, was put to immediate death, he that killed him was not eſteemed a criminal, Exod. xxii. 2. <hi>Witchcraft,</hi> which ſome learned men have ſuppoſed nothing materially different from thoſe baſe arts of fortune telling which have been impoſed on the credulity of mankind, and affronted common ſenſe, in almoſt every age and nation, was to be pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed with death, Exod. xxii. 18.</p>
            <p>If ſuch a variety of crimes were to be pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed with death, according to the <hi>Moſaic law,</hi> it would be ſtrange that nothing but murder might be made capital by the laws of other nations. For there is great reaſon to ſuppoſe that none of theſe crimes, not even murder itſelf, were made capital, by the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh law, <hi>becauſe they were ſins againſt God;</hi> but <hi>becauſe they were ſins againſt ſociety.</hi> Sins <hi>as againſt God,</hi> he himſelf will puniſh. He on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knows their malignity, and their deſert;
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:021599_0006_0FB41988780896D8"/>
and he only can inflict an adequate puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Accordingly, the apoſtle ſays, Rom. xii. 19. <q>Dearly beloved, avenge not yourſelves, but rather give place unto wrath; for it is written, <hi>Vengeance is mine: I will repay, ſaith the Lord.</hi>
               </q> But, that the peace of the community may be ſecured and preſerved, God has put his ſword of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice into the hands of the civil magiſtrate, to avenge the wrongs done to ſociety.</p>
            <p>Even <hi>Idolatry</hi> and <hi>Blaſphemy,</hi> there is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to believe, were not made capital <hi>becauſe they were ſins againſt God,</hi> but <hi>because they were treaſon againſt the ſtate.</hi> As God was their <hi>civil king and head,</hi> theſe ſins ſtruck at the fundamental laws of their ſociety; and were a direct attempt to ſubvert their govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The Hebrews had choſen Jehovah for their ſole and ſupreme ruler and king, and had ſworn allegiance to him. They had no other form of <hi>civil government</hi> than what had been framed and given them by Jehovah, and voluntarily choſen and adopted by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. It is hence evident, that idolatry and blaſphemy were a renunciation of their allegiance to their ſovereign, and treaſon againſt their king.</p>
            <p>And, that even theſe crimes were puniſhed with death, not ſo much becauſe they were ſins againſt <hi>God,</hi> as againſt the <hi>civil commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:021599_0007_0FB41989FA616388"/>
may reaſonably be inferred from the following conſiderations, <abbr>viz.</abbr>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. There was no ſacrifice of atonement inſtituted for theſe crimes. For ſins <hi>as against God,</hi> there then was, and now is an atonement. And the <hi>great atonement</hi> typifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the bloody ſacrifices inſtituted by the Moſaic law, is unqueſtionably of ſufficient worth to procure pardon <hi>even for theſe ſins</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt God. But ſins as againſt God are infinitely more heinous and criminal, than as againſt men: yet, as againſt men, they were unpardonable, no atonement being appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for them. Conſequently they were puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with death, not ſo much becauſe they were ſins againſt God, as againſt men. Yea, they were made capital <hi>only</hi> becauſe they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly tended to ſubvert the fundamental laws of their community.</p>
            <p>The good of ſociety, here in this world, forbids that any atonement ſhould be made for certain crimes, even be the criminal ever ſo humble and penitent; but, abſolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, if on no other account, yet for a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and warning to others, the utter exciſion—the death of the perpetrator. Even though the criminal may be forgiven at the bar of God, ſtill he may not be pardoned by the civil magiſtrate.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:021599_0008_0FB4198B89499BF8"/>
2. That the crimes, even of <hi>Idolatry</hi> and <hi>Blaſphemy,</hi> were puniſhable with death <hi>only</hi> becauſe they were againſt the peace and good of ſociety, is evident from this conſideration, <abbr>viz.</abbr> that as againſt God, they might be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given. Thus our Saviour expreſly aſſerts, Mark iii. 28. <q>That <hi>all</hi> ſins ſhall be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given unto the ſons of men, and <hi>blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi> wherewith they ſhall blaſpheme; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting only the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt.</q> But, as againſt the laws of the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh community, theſe ſins were utterly unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable. But, where the penalty of the law, as the crime reſpects the <hi>Deity, as moral gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernor of the univerſe,</hi> is remitted by <hi>him,</hi> it is unreaſonable to ſuppoſe that he ſhould require <hi>man</hi> to execute it. Where God forgives ſins <hi>as againſt himſelf, as moral governor and king,</hi> ſurely he would not put his ſword into the hand of the civil magiſtrate to execute <hi>his</hi> wrath.</p>
            <p n="3">3. From the extent of the laſt and general judgement it may be concluded that no crimes ever are, or were, puniſhable by the civil magiſtrate, in any other view, or on any other account, than as againſt the peace and good of human ſociety. All judgement is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Chriſt; and every crime of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever nature, whether it has been before any human tribunal, or not, will, at the laſt day,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:021599_0009_0FB4198CFA363CA8"/>
be brought into public view, and receive a juſt recompence of reward. But, had the Deity authoriſed the civil magiſtrate, either to puniſh, or to pardon, ſins <hi>as againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> this would ſo far ſuperſede the neceſſity of a general judgement, and deprive the Son of God of the honour of being univerſal judge.</p>
            <p>Indeed, nothing can be more abſurd than to ſuppoſe that <hi>men</hi> ſhould be judges and avengers in the cauſe of <hi>God. Men</hi> are, themſelves, all infinitely guilty in God's ſight; and muſt, all, be arraigned as crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals at his bar. Though civil magiſtrates are ſtiled gods, they are nevertheleſs to die like men. But for the protection and good of ſociety civil rulers may be clothed with an authority which is, in ſome reſpects, an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of the divine. This authority they are to uſe for the ends which they are inveſted with it; which are, that they may be a terror, not to good works, but to the evil.</p>
            <p>But whenever the civil ruler attempts, in character of judge and avenger, to animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert upon crimes as againſt God, he aſſumes that to which he has not the leaſt imaginable right, ſteps into the ſeat of God, and wreſts the ſword out of his hand.</p>
            <p>From theſe conſiderations we may ſafely conclude that civil rulers may be juſtified in
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:021599_0010_0FB4198E7A264E88"/>
making other crimes capital beſides that of murder, and the civil magiſtrate may lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inflict death upon the perpetrators of them. Men have a right to inflict capital puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in every caſe wherein the good of ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety requires it:—and, <hi>of this</hi> men muſt be the judges; not forgetting, however, their obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations to judge with diſcretion, impartiality and candour; and that they are accountable to God for the laws which they frame, and the ſanctions by which they eſtabliſh them. God has put <hi>his</hi> ſword into the hands of the civil magiſtrate to avenge the wrongs done to ſociety: and, therefore, men are required to be ſubject to civil authority, not only for <hi>wrath,</hi> but alſo for <hi>conſcience</hi> ſake, Rom. xiii. 5.</p>
            <p>From theſe conſiderations it appears that it is agreeable to the will of God, yea, that it is his own appointment, that there ſhould be lodged, ſome where in ſociety, a ſupreme power:—a power to be controuled by nothing but by the law:—a power not to be reſiſted:—a power to execute vengeance and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Without this power, the ends of the inſtitution of civil government never can be anſwered, nor the good and ſafety of ſociety inſured. Without this, rulers can never be a terror to evil doers; nor encouragers of them that do well. Without this, govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:021599_0011_0FB419900B7B6460"/>
cannot ſubſiſt; but ſociety muſt be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved.</p>
            <p>It appears, further, from what has been ſaid, that laws framed for the good of civil ſociety, are indeed binding upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of men. Were it otherwiſe we could not be required, by the divine law, to be ſubject to them, not only for <hi>wrath</hi> but for <hi>conſcience</hi> ſake. Crimes committed againſt civil ſociety are not expiated by enduring the wrath of the civil magiſtrate: but, <hi>as againſt ſociety</hi> muſt have another hearing, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go another trial, at the bar of God. Though <hi>men</hi> may puniſh crimes only as being againſt ſociety: yet <hi>God</hi> will puniſh them as being not only againſt himſelf, but againſt our fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-creatures. Laws, framed for the good of ſociety, have, therefore, the double ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>human</hi> authority, and of the <hi>divine.</hi>

            <p>By the inſtitution of civil government, and the authority with which rulers are inveſted from on high to be avengers, and to execute wrath upon evil doers: it appears that human governments are an image of the divine. One way, therefore, in which we are to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs our ſubmiſſion to God, and to his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, is by yielding a willing and due ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to civil authority and government. A member of the kingdom of Chriſt, will certainly be a good and peaceable member
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:021599_0012_0FB419917925DA30"/>
of civil ſociety: and where the divine law is written in the heart, it will and muſt produce a regular and cheerful ſubjection to human laws framed for the good of ſociety. An un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy, reſtleſs member of civil ſociety, impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient of every human reſtraint, is not qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for that ſtate of perfect peace, ſubjection and harmony, which will reign in the world above,</p>
            <p>Further, as in human governments pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhments are inflicted only for the general good; ſo alſo, in the divine. As it is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of goodneſs, and of regard to the peace and welfare of ſociety, in the civil magiſtrate, to execute the penalties of the civil law; ſo is it an inſtance of goodneſs in God, and of regard to the peace and welfare of his great family, where the ſacrifice of atonement is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, to execute the penalties of the divine law. For the good of the univerſe can no more be ſecured, unleſs the ſpirit and hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of the <hi>divine law</hi> be preſerved in admin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtration, than the peace of <hi>civil ſociety</hi> can be preſerved, unleſs <hi>civil law</hi> and juſtice be faithfully adminiſtered. And as civil rulers have no pleaſure in the pains and miſery of thoſe whom they are obliged to cut off from ſociety: ſo the Great Ruler of the univerſe, as he declares with an oath, Ezek. xxxiii 11. has no pleaſure in the death of the wicked,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:021599_0013_0FB41993064E3E18"/>
but that the wicked turn from his way and live.</p>
            <p>Though human governments are an image of the divine, yet the difference, in many reſpects, between them, is exceedingly great: and the reſemblance of the former, to the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but very faint and imperfect. As the knowledge of God extends to the ſecret mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and exerciſes of the heart, ſo do the laws of this glorious kingdom and government. But human laws extend no further than to the external actions and conduct of men; or rather to the tempers and exerciſes of the heart, <hi>only as they appear and are expreſſed in overt acts:</hi> So that, in thoſe very inſtances wherein human laws <hi>may</hi> be obeyed, the pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alties of the divine <hi>may</hi> be incurred. The perfection of the divine government, alſo, far tranſcends that of men, in this reſpect, that the great Governor of the world doth not deſcend from his high dignity as lawgiver and king, in exerciſing the richeſt mercy and grace to innumerable multitudes of the vileſt of criminals; whereas, pardons may be ſo frequent, in civil governments, as to dimin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh the authority of the magiſtrate, and take off the terror of the law.</p>
            <p>We may alſo conclude, that, if the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of man, and the vengeance of the civil magiſtrate, are attended with circumſtances
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:021599_0014_0FB41994798F3AC0"/>
ſo ſtriking and awful as thoſe now before us; the judgement and wrath of the eternal God muſt be infinitely more awful and dreadful. If it be, as we now ſee, a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the <hi>civil magistrate;</hi> how fearful a thing indeed muſt it be to fall into the hand of the <hi>living God!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the circumſtances of the criminals now before us, taking only into view the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the ſhameful death about to be inflicted on them by the hands of men, be enough to excite the pity, and move the compaſſion of even obdurate hearts; how extremely pitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and affecting are the ſtate, and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of all thoſe who are yet in their ſins, under the curſe of the divine law, and expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, every moment, to have its moſt awful penalties inflicted, in full meaſure upon them?</p>
            <p>Again, as the dignity and honor of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine government will be ſupported and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, by God's adverting to the ſmalleſt crimes, and the leaſt offences againſt his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly laws; is it not incumbent on the civil ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate carefully to notice even ſmall offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces againſt the laws of the community, and animadvert ſuitably upon them? And would not this as really tend to the honor of civil government, and the peace and happineſs of ſociety, as the ſimilar mode of conduct in the
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:021599_0015_0FB41995F9BA6970"/>
great Governor of the world, doth to the dignity and honor divine government, and the peace &amp; welfare of God's extended kingdom. Where ſmall, but real crimes, are paſſ'd unnoticed by the civil magiſtrate, the door is open to the commiſſion of greater; and vile and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men encouraged, by and by, to bid de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance to all authority. And then, puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the greateſt crimes have a leſs ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eficial effect, and the execution of them ſits more uneaſy upon the minds of the public, than when the laws are punctually executed, and <hi>every breach</hi> receives a juſt recompence of reward. Does not the ſtile and title of <hi>civil rulers,</hi> in the holy ſcriptures, where they are called gods, imply that in <hi>this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect</hi> they ſhould imitate the conduct and copy the example of HIM whoſe commiſſion they bear.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding the analogy there is, in a variety of reſpects, between human govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and the divine, there is a wide and a material difference in the <hi>latter</hi> from the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> which may ſuggeſt very comfortable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections amid ſuch melancholy ſcenes as that now about to be preſented before us. The judgement of <hi>man</hi> is not abſolutely final; nor, in many reſpects, ſimilar to that of <hi>God. God may</hi> forgive, where the <hi>civil magiſtrate</hi> is bound to hold guilty: And the vengeance
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:021599_0016_0FB419977A0CDAE8"/>
of <hi>Heaven may</hi> be averted from the unhappy object on whom that of <hi>ſociety</hi> muſt be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted. It is poſſible that a criminal <hi>may</hi> go from the halter, or the ſtake, to a ſeat of honor and everlaſting glory. The venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the civil magiſtrate, and of God, are not the ſame: nor is the great Governor of the world circumſcribed within the ſame rules and limits reſpecting executions, as bind the civil magiſtrate. Human laws leave no room for <hi>repentance;</hi> but, by the gracious conſtitution of God, <hi>this</hi> may be a mean of obtaining pardon for the moſt heinous of crimes. When, therefore, we ſee one of our fellow men cut off by the hand of civil juſtice, we cannot from thence infer, with any certainty, that divine juſtice requires his final perdition. Yea, the circumſtances of the caſe <hi>may</hi> be ſuch that we may have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to conclude that even the axe, or the halter, may be a paſſport to a world of end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs felicity and joy.</p>
            <p>But, I muſt cloſe with one or two ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes ſuited to the preſent ſolemn occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. And,</p>
            <p>I. <hi>To the priſoners now brought out for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Poor, unhappy, wretched creatures! As you are now juſt launching into the eternal world, how ſhall I frame an addreſs to you,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:021599_0017_0FB41999072475F0"/>
preparatory to that infinitely more ſolemn ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs which will ſoon be made to you from the ſeat of eternal judgement!. By your dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing crimes and wickedneſs, you have forfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the protection of ſociety, and expoſed yourſelves to the higheſt expreſſion of the diſpleaſure of the community to which you belong. And, as you have ſet yourſelves againſt the community, ſo the community now ſet themſelves againſt you. You have troubled ſociety, and this day the Lord will trouble you. You have been deaf to warnings and counſels, and to the cries and tears of thoſe whom you have plundered and abuſed; and now ſociety muſt be deaf to your cries, and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den itſelf againſt your tears. You have braved danger, and, I fear, have defied death; But now the net is ſpread over you, and trouble on every ſide hath taken hold upon you.</p>
            <p>I ſay not theſe things to inſult you: I would inſult no man, eſpecially no one in your awful and melancholy ſituation. But, I ſay theſe things, that now, if it may be, in this laſt, infinitely important hour, you may be brought to a ſuitable and proper ſenſe of your great wickedneſs. You have heard that there is an atonement made for ſins againſt God. He is yet on a throne of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, with the ever-glorious and all-prevalent
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:021599_0018_0FB4199A781A59B8"/>
interceſſor at his right hand. Still the ſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre of mercy is holden out to you; and the infinitely gracious offer of free and full par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don made to you</p>
            <p>But oh! with what a voice of thunder, and in what ſolemn and piercing accents, will you ſoon be addreſſed from the throne of everlaſting judgement, unleſs now, with penitent and broken hearts, you lift up your feeble voices in humble cries and ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for mercy. The Lord is a prayer-hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God. No one ever ſought to him in vain. He has ſeated himſelf on a throne of grace, purpoſely to hear the penitent cries of helpleſs diſtreſſed, undone ſinners. Not a groan from a broken heart, but what reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es his ears; not a ſigh but what is noticed by him. Even one prayer, now in your laſt moments, breathed forth from ſuch hearts, will aſcend, enter within the veil, meet accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and through the riches of divine mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy ſecure you a welcome into the bleſſed abodes of everlaſting peace, where fraud and violence never come. Improve, then, theſe your laſt moments, in humble, penitent, and fervent cries to God. Remember <hi>eternity</hi> now hangs upon an hour! Infinitely import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant events are now gathering and collecting <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, to a ſingle point; and infinite wiſdom is to give the deciſion, and turn the balance!
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:021599_0019_0FB4199D2EECF850"/>
May divine ſovereign mercy interpoſe for you, and pardon and everlaſting favour be your happy portion! But how your fate will be, in fact, decided, another <hi>more ſolemn and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant</hi> day than this will declare. I ill then, I bid you a laſt, a cordial, a mournful fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A few words to this great aſſembly ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the diſcourſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What an awful ſpectacle is now preſented before you. The hand of heaven viſibly turned againſt the diſturbers of the common peace; and the meſſengers of death now juſt about to ſeize and devour their devoted prey! In one reſpect we here behold a melancholy inſtance of the truth of what the apoſtle aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, James i. 15. <q>That luſt, when it hath conceived, bringeth forth ſin: and ſin, when it is finiſhed, bringeth forth death.</q> Let this inſtance be a warning, a ſolemn warning to all, how they venture to break the bands of civil ſociety, defy its laws and vengeance, and, in that, bid defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the laws and vengeance of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty! <q>If thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for the ruler beareth not the ſword in vain; for he is the miniſter of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil.</q> Be afraid of ſmall crimes, and leſs encroachments upon the
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:021599_0020_0FB4199E43BB1BD0"/>
rules of equity and righteouſneſs; and by this melancholy inſtance, ſee to what they <hi>may</hi> lead, and in what they <hi>may</hi> terminate. Great things often ſucceed, but ſmall begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and, the moſt henious offences, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally take their riſe from ſmaller crimes. Let this conſideration make you afraid even to take a ſtep in forbidden paths.</p>
            <p>Let parents take warning how they edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate their children, and what examples they ſet before them. Early habits take deep root, and are with great difficulty eradicated or overcome. Inure them to ſubjection and obedience, and endeavour to inſtill into their minds a dread, a horror of every degree of injuſtice and violence. Conſider how much the peace of ſociety, and their own ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting good, may depend upon it. Your own bad inſtructions and examples will have the pernicious influence to encourage to greater crimes; and <hi>may</hi> finally bring them to the gallows, and terminate to their ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting deſtruction.</p>
            <p>But, however ſolemn the preſent ſcene may be to the devoted criminals now before us, on account of the more awful judgement which awaits them; let us all remember that the ſame ſolemn hour awaits each one of us. Our eyes muſt ſoon ſee them, and ſee each other, at the tribunal of God. And what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:021599_0021_0FB4199FBA2C2A88"/>
may be <hi>their</hi> fate, if <hi>we</hi> die impenitent, whether we go from the gallows, from a ſtake, or from a bed of down, we ſhall with equal certainty hear the awful ſentence: <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, ye curſed, into everlaſting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O then improve, thankfully and wiſely improve, the happy ſeaſon of grace indulged to you, but denied to them! Remember we are by nature, the ſame vile creatures, in the ſight of God, as they; and perhaps, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of us much more criminal and vile. <hi>We</hi> ſtand in as abſolute need of an infinite at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement, and infinite mercy. <hi>Their</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct is but a ſpecimen of human nature—of what is naturally in each of our hearts. And not unto ourſelves, but to the kind provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and the reſtraining goodneſs of God, is it to be aſcribed, that <hi>we</hi> are not now in <hi>their</hi> mournful ſituation.</p>
            <p>Let no one, then, glory over them: but, as we ourſelves need infinite <hi>mercy</hi> as well as they, let us put on bowels of mercy, and pour out our hearts in humble cries, that divine grace may deſcend and arreſt them. That God and Saviour whom we profeſs to worſhip, is able to wound and to pour grace into their hearts. Once, <hi>when himſelf was making his ſoul an offering for ſin,</hi> he diſplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his glory and ſaving power by converting
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:021599_0022_0FB419A139CE85E0"/>
one who was <hi>that moment hanging on a tree.</hi> Let us all put up our humble and fervent cries to HIM, that a ſimilar diſplay of his power and grace may now be made! And, if we, and theſe unhappy victims of civil juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice be made the ſubjects of his converting grace, let death come when it may, or in whatever form, we may unite in ſinging that triumphant ſong, <q>O death where is thy ſting? O grave, where is thy victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry!</q> May God of his infinite mercy, grant that this may be the happy lot of us all, through JESUS CHRIST.—AMEN.</p>
