            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Again,</hi> He ingeniouſly owns, a cording to his Information, that they ſcarcely knew their buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs when they ſhou'd come <hi>there.</hi> It was (ſays he) <hi>In order to baptize or to ſee a perſon baptiz'd,</hi> &amp; I may add, &amp; they knew not what: They knew not it ſeems who, or whether any of them, was to baptize or whether any perſon wou'd be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized; and ſo it proved the next time, when they actually went to Lebanon under the ſame pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence: Baptiſm was not adminiſtred, there was no Subject, or no Officer, or they were Indifferent about it, however zealous in pretence before. Wherefore, it appears that their Infallible Spirit doth ſometimes deceive them, as it did their Great <hi>Apoſtle</hi> the late <hi>John Rogers;</hi> who pretended from the Inſpirations of it, that he was proof againſt all Infection of Body (as well as mind,) which the Wicked only (he ſaid) were ſuſceptible of, and to put the matter upon trial, daringly ventured into Boſton in the time of the Small Pox. But re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Infection and Dyed of it, with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of his Family, taking it from him; ſo the Trial of his Impaſſibility iſſued. More Inſtances of their Deception might be mentioned, But 'tis Enough here to Inſtance in this relating to the preſent
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:002726_0010_0FE614954F3FBF60"/>Caſe, for it ſeems their Spirit (notwithſtanding all their pretences to Certain Immediate Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by it (did not tell them what was their Buſineſs at Lebanon, any more than it did what ſhould be their Sufferings at Norwich, which it did not, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as much as they Expected according to their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent Boaſt to buy our Sabbaths for five ſhillings a piece, but finding them riſen in the Price, yet with a greater Liberty granted to offenders than they uſed to have, They (without any previous advices from their Spirit) did wilfully chuſe the Corporal Puniſhment, rather than the Expence of Money, and to the wonder of all ſober Men were more ſparing of their Purſes than of their Backs. But there might be this in it, to determine their Choice, according to their Boaſt of Extraordinary defence, they Expected to feel no pain, and ſo they would have ſaved their Backs and Money too, but they were evidently Diſappointed and fel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> nothing the leſs for the cauſe. And then they hoped to acquire to theſelves the Honour of Martyrs, &amp; gain ſome Proſelytes by their Coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Suffering as they pretended for the ſake of Chriſt, but were alſo diſappointed in this, and I believe got no more Honour than eaſe by their fooliſh choice. Which makes me think how wittily a Lawyer ridicul'd the folly of one of theſe Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who declared that he wou'd not for the ſake of <hi>Fifty Pound,</hi> (or a greater Sum) Endure the ſame again, &amp; yet chearfully endured this in hope of a reward in the other World, who was told of his ſad <hi>miſtake</hi> &amp; <hi>poor bargain;</hi> In ſhort, at moſt he coudn't

And it appeared by their whole Management that their hearts were more upon their Travel, &amp; <hi>Contempt of the Sabbath,</hi> than upon their <hi>Religious Meeting,</hi> which ſhews that the very end and deſign of their firſt motion was to Offend &amp; Diſturb us; For when they had done this, and got their Backs whip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
