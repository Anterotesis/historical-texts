            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Upon reading the aforeſaid Articles, <hi>John Baptiſt Jedre,</hi> alias <hi>Laver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure,</hi> deſired that the ſame might be interpreted to him and his Son <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> Junior in the <hi>French</hi> Language, for that he the ſaid <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> (the Father) did not underſtand <hi>Engliſh</hi> very well; and his Son was wholly Ignorant of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Language.</p>

               <p>PRESENT, The Honourable WILLIAM DUMMER <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Lieut. Governour and Commander in Chief of the ſaid Province, Preſident; and all the other Commiſſioners before-named.</p>
               <p>Then the Priſoners were brought to the Bar, and their Advocate hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been ſerved with a Copy of the Articles exhibited againſt them, and prepared for their Trial, the ſaid Articles were read again.</p>
               <p>After reading thereof, His Majeſty's Advocate made a Speech to the Court as followed, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>MAY it pleaſe Your Honour Mr. <hi>Preſident,</hi> and the Honourable the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> Senior, and <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> Junior, the Priſoners at the Bar, ſtand Articled againſt for Acts of <hi>Piracy, Robbery</hi> and <hi>Felony,</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted upon the High Seas, within the Juriſdiction of the Admiralty of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> contrary to the Peace of our Sovereign Lord the King, His Crown and Dignity, and the Statutes in ſuch Caſes Made and Provided: To which upon Arraignment, they have ſeverally pleaded <hi>Not Guilty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Word <hi>Pirate,</hi> with inconſiderable Variation, is taken from the <hi>Greek</hi> Subſtantive <hi>Peirates, Praedo Marinus,</hi> and therefore a Pirate in a Legal Senſe is called a <hi>Robber on the High Seas</hi>: And under this Conſideration I'm humbly of Opinion, the Priſoners at the Bar will evidently appear to your Honours, in the Series of this their Trial: Perſons whom the Law with the greateſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety juſtly Terms <hi>Pirates.</hi> And however others may pride themſelves in accurately handling abſtruſe and knotty Caſes; I eſteem it my Felicity, that the Articles now exhibited to your Honours, are grounded upon plain and clear Matters of Fact; Facts which proceed from the Rancour and Virulency of their evil Hearts, from a craving Appetite, and an inſatiable Thirſt after inordinate Gain. And finally, Facts if not now timely Corrected by Your Honours experienced Juſtice, will moſt certainly terminate in the breaking up of our Fiſhery, the moſt valuable Branch of our <hi>New-England</hi> Trade. But for as much as I'm ſenſible Gloſſes with your Honours paſs not for Arguments, or Varniſh for Evidence; So I'm well aſſured, when poſitive and direct Proofs appear before You in their full Proportion, they will have their Uſual and Legal Weight in Your Honours Determination: And therefore upon the Evidences I ſhall produce on the part of the King, I may reaſonably expect in Juſtice to His Majeſty, in Compliance with the Laws of our Land, and in
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:002818_0007_0FE64FF798EF0E80"/>
a due and tender Regard to this His Majeſty's Province, and the Safety and Preſervation of the Lives and Properties of His Majeſty's moſt Loyal and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Subjects in this Government, Your Honour and the Honourable the Commiſſioners will adjudge the Priſoners at the Bar reſpectively Guilty of all and every the Articles exhibited againſt them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then the Cryer of ſaid Court was directed by Mr. Advocate to call the King's Evidences.</p>
               <p>Afterwards the Witneſſes for our Sovereign Lord the King, Namely, Captain <hi>Samuel Doty, Nathaniel Sprague, John Roberts, Silas Cooke,</hi> and <hi>Philip Sachimus,</hi> were Called and Sworn, and ſeverally Depoſed as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, <hi>viz.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>SAmuel Doty</hi> of <hi>Plymouth</hi> in <hi>New-England</hi> Mariner, and Maſter of the Sloop <hi>Tryal,</hi> Depoſeth and Saith, That on <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the 25th Day of <hi>Auguſt</hi> laſt paſt, (with the conſent of his Men) he put into <hi>Malegaſh</hi> Harbour, to Water, &amp; from thence deſigned to Proſecute their Fiſhing-Voyage near the Iſle of <hi>Sables</hi>; And ſeeing <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> the Father, on Shoar, the Deponent haled him, and asked him to come on board. And ſoon after the Priſoners at the Bar, came on board the Sloop in a Canno, when the Deponent ask'd what News? The ſaid <hi>John Baptiſt Jedre,</hi> alias <hi>Laverdure,</hi> anſwered there was Peace between the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Indians,</hi> and particularly at <hi>Boſton, Annapolis,</hi> and <hi>Cauſo</hi>; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the ſaid <hi>Baptiſt</hi> and the Deponent went into the Cabbin, and left the ſaid <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> Junior upon Deck; After the Deponent, and <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> had drank together, the Deponent went upon Deck with intent to go aſhoar in the Canno, but <hi>Baptiſt</hi>'s Son was gone aſhoar in it, then the Deponent with the Mate and three more Men, took the Sloops Canno, and went aſhoar, leaving the ſaid <hi>Baptiſt</hi> on board, with <hi>Philip Sachimus,</hi> the ſaid <hi>Baptiſt</hi> declining to go a Shore with them when ask'd, ſaying he would Call his Son, and he ſhould carry him on Shore. That ſome ſhort time after the Deponent and his Men had left the Sloop, the ſaid <hi>Baptiſt</hi> called to his Son on Shoar, and ſpake to him in a Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage unknown to the Deponent, and preſently <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> Junior, with two <hi>Indians,</hi> namely, <hi>James Mews</hi> and <hi>Philip Mews,</hi> went into the ſaid <hi>Baptiſt</hi>'s Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no, and after they had got about a Gun ſhot from the Shore, one of the <hi>Indians</hi> held up his Gun and Fired it, &amp; called to the Deponent and Company as they ſtood on the Shoar, ſaying, You <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men, ask for Quarter; and after the <hi>Indians</hi> had got on board the Sloop, they took down the <hi>Engliſh Enſign</hi> then fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which the Deponent perceiving, he then went to the Houſe of Mrs. <hi>Giddery,</hi> Mother to the ſaid <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> and deſired her, with her Son <hi>Auguſtine</hi> to go on board the Sloop with him, and intercede with the ſaid <hi>Baptiſt</hi> that the Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent might have his Sloop again. And after ſome Conſiderable Time, Mrs. <hi>Giddery</hi> and her Son went on board with the Deponent, when he the Deponent ſaw the Enſign girded round <hi>Baptiſt</hi>'s middle, and a Piſtol tuckt in it, which

That when the Scooner appeared in ſight, the Priſoners with the <hi>Indians,</hi> divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Powder and Shot which belonged to the Sloop, put new Flints into their Guns, cut up the Fiſhing Leads to make Sluggs for their ſmall Arms, and load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them with deſign (as they ſaid) to take the ſaid Scooner, if ſhe had been an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Veſſel.</p>
               <p>And further the Deponent ſaith, That afterwards he Steered the Sloop for <hi>Mahoon Bay,</hi> to the <hi>Eaſtward</hi> of <hi>Aſhpetauget,</hi> by Order of the ſaid <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> who ſometimes Steered himſelf; And when ſhe was about ſeven Leagues Eaſtward of <hi>Malegaſh,</hi> the Deponent and his Company having agreed to riſe upon the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Indians,</hi> took their Opportunity to do it, ſoon after they had been at Breakfaſt, on the 26th. of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> when <hi>Baptiſt</hi> and three <hi>Indian</hi> Men with an <hi>Indian</hi> Woman and two Children were in the Cabbin; And the Deponent ſhut the Cabbin-Door upon them; but <hi>Baptiſt</hi> hearing the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſcuffling with the <hi>Indians</hi> upon Deck, ſoon came out of the Cabbin, having burſt open the Cabbin-Door, and the Mate ſtruck him down with a Club, and <hi>Phillip Sachimus</hi> threw him overboard; Soon after the <hi>Engliſh</hi> fired into the Cabbin, and the three <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Men got out of the Cabbin-Windows into the Sea, in order to Swim on Shoar; and Young <hi>Baptiſt</hi> and the other <hi>Indians</hi> were thrown into the Hold; And after the Priſoners and <hi>Indians</hi> were ſubdued, <hi>Baptiſt</hi> was taken on board the Sloop again from out of a Canno, which lay aſtern.</p>

                              <salute>May it pleaſe Your Honour, Mr. <hi>Preſident,</hi> and the reſt of the Honourable Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners of this Court:</salute>
                           </opener>
                           <p>IT is not without Regret that I appear before this Honourable Court in behalf of the Priſoners at the Bar: But the Senſe of my Duty, and my real Deſire that the World, and more eſpecially their Country men, ſhould be convinced of the fair and impartial Trial they will receive, weigh down all Objections to my appearing for them. And although they may labour under ſome Inconveniences on Account of their not underſtanding the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tongue, yet I take that to be ſufficiently made up to them, by the great Candour and Impartiality your Honours have ſhown in granting them Interpreters and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>
                           <p>As it is my Province to ſpeak only to Matters of Law, I ſhall endeavour to perform it as well as the very little time I have had will allow; and waving any Obſervations upon the Evidences that have been Sworn, humbly beg your Honours Conſideration of two Matters, which I conceive worthy thereof. The firſt of which relates equally to both the Priſoners, the laſt to <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> Junior only.</p>
                           <p>I am well perſwaded there hath been a great peice of Villany lately acted in the Harbour of <hi>Malagaſh,</hi> by the ſeizing and taking of Capt. <hi>Doty</hi> and his Men and Veſſel, in which the Priſoners may have borne their part, but your Honour, and the reſt of the Honourable Court, will well diſtinguiſh Crimes of different Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and not Condemn Perſons for Piracy becauſe they may be Guilty of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Robberies or other Crimes, and I ſubmit it to your Honours whether the Priſoners can be adjudged Guilty of Piracy. My Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Hale</hi> in his <hi>Plac. Coron.</hi> treating of Piracy ſays, <q>It extends not to Offences in Creeks or Ports within the Body of a County, becauſe puniſhable by the Common Law.</q> Pag. 77. <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Edition. And ſays another Book, <q>If a Pirate en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a Port or Haven, and Aſſaults and Robs a Merchant-Ship at Anchor there, this is no Piracy, becauſe it is not done <hi>Super Altum Mare,</hi> but it is a downright Robbery at the Common Law, the Act being <hi>infra Corpus Comita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> Jacob<hi>'s Lex Mercat.</hi> Pag. 183.</q> 
                              <hi>Medio,</hi> both which agree with the Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Piracy</hi> given by my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> in his Comments upon <hi>Littleton,</hi> Pag. 291. a. If then it appears to your Honours, (as I think it muſt by the Evidence) that the Facts charged upon the Priſoners were Committed in an Harbour within the Body of a County: And ſuppoſing they were the real Actors there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, they are not guilty of Piracy, but ought to be tried at the Common Law, as Robbers, by a Jury, and your Honours will acquit them of the Articles now exhibited againſt them by the Advocate General on His Majeſty's behalf.</p>

And ſo it is of an Infant, until he be of the Age of Fourteen, which in Law is accounted the Age of Diſcretion.</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>It cannot be expected I ſhould produce any Evidence of the Age of this Lad, who was born and educated in the Woods among the Wild and Salvage <hi>Indians,</hi> where no Regiſter of Births or Burials is kept; he knows not his own Age, but by the Information of his Father, who here declares in publick Court, his Son is but Fourteen this Fall; there is no Evidence to diſprove him in this Aſſertion, and where the Scale is but even, Your Honours will give the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance in favour of Life.</p>
                           <p>Your Honours will likewiſe be pleaſed to conſider the great Influences a Father hath upon his Son, not only in his Example but Precepts, as corrupt Nature is prone enough to evil; the Perſwaſions of a Father, or the fear of his Frowns and ſevere Corrections, back'd with his Example, are ſtrong and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Inſtigators to do Evil.</p>
                           <p>Upon the whole, I ſubmit the Caſe of the Priſoners to Your Honours wiſe Conſideration, not in the leaſt doubting of your juſt and impartial Judgment.</p>

               <p>Then the ſaid <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> in his own Defence alledged, That the People belonging to the aforeſaid <hi>French</hi> Scooner (who he ſaid had been at <hi>Malegaſh</hi> lately to buy Cattle to carry to Cape <hi>Breton)</hi> prevailed with him to do what he had done; telling him, that it would be the beſt way in order to get his Son <hi>Paul</hi> from the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> to take and keep one of their Veſſels till they got him out of their Hands.— And further he added, That he had no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to kill any of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> but hindred the <hi>Indians</hi> from hurting them with their Knives.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> Junior pleaded for his Excuſe, That what he did was by his Father's Order, and that the <hi>Indians</hi> adviſed him to aſſiſt in taking the ſaid Veſſel.</p>

                           </head>
                           <p>THIS Examinant ſaith, That he lived at <hi>Malegaſh,</hi> and that on <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the 25th Day of <hi>Auguſt</hi> laſt paſt, a Sloop with <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colours flying, came into the Harbour of <hi>Malegaſh,</hi> one <hi>Doty</hi> Maſter, and the Examinant and his Son went on board in a Canno; and his Son preſently went on Shoar in the Canno. Soon after Mr. <hi>Doty</hi> and all his Men (except one) went on Shoar in the Sloop's Canno, to drink ſome <hi>Punch</hi> (as they ſaid) at the Examinant's Mother's Houſe, and he was asked by Captain <hi>Doty</hi> to go on Shoar with him, but he ſaw ſo many in the Canno, he told the ſaid <hi>Doty</hi> he would call his Son to fetch him aſhoar in his the ſaid <hi>Baptiſt</hi>'s Canno, which he went aſhoar in: So the Examinant, with an <hi>Indian</hi> Man called <hi>Philip,</hi> were left on board the Sloop.— After ſome time the Examinant called to his Son, who with two <hi>Indians</hi> came on board the Sloop in a Canno; and after them two <hi>Indians</hi> more, namely one <hi>Jerman</hi> and his Son <hi>Lewis,</hi> came on board in another Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no.— The Examinant ſaith, That his Brother-in-Law <hi>Philip Mews,</hi> one of the <hi>Indians,</hi> ſtruck the Sloop's Colours, and gave 'em to him, and he tyed 'em round his middle.— That he told the <hi>Engliſh</hi> there was Peace with the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi>; Afterwards another Canno came on board with two <hi>Indian</hi> Men, a Squaw and two Children. And further the Examinant ſaith, That the <hi>Indian Philip,</hi> who was left on board, was tyed ſoon after the <hi>Indians</hi> came on board, leaſt he ſhould do them ſome Miſchief, but afterwards they ſent him aſhoar to tell the Maſter to come on board. He ſaith that he ſaw the Cabbin-Door open, but can't tell whether it was broke open or no.— That his Son had <hi>John Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berts</hi>'s Piſtol but fell a ſleep with it, and ſo the Examinant took it, and faſtened it thro' his Girdle, that he never fired it, his Hands being weak he had not ſtrength to fire; The Examinant ſaith his Mother came on board the Sloop, but did not ask the <hi>Indians</hi> on board, the Reaſon why they took the Sloop from the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in time of Peace, becauſe ſhe underſtood ſome time before, they deſigned to take what <hi>Engliſh</hi> Veſſels they could, notwithſtanding the Peace, by way of Reprizals, by Reaſon the Examinant's Son <hi>Paul,</hi> and his Brother-in-Law <hi>Francis Mews</hi> were detained by the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The Examinant further ſaith, That the <hi>French</hi> at <hi>Louisbourg</hi> told the <hi>Indians</hi> the Peace which was made with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> would not continue long.— The Examinant alſo ſaith, That the <hi>Indians</hi> intended to carry the Sloop to his Plantation; and accordingly <hi>James Mews</hi> the <hi>Indian</hi> Captain, ordered the Skipper <hi>Doty</hi> to weigh Anchor towards the Evening, and ſet ſail for <hi>Mohune Bay.</hi>— That that Night they dreſſed ſome Victuals, that the next Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing early they ſaw a Scooner, which they ſuppoſed at firſt to be an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Veſſel, but when they came near they diſcovered ſhe was a <hi>French</hi> Scooner which
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:002818_0014_0FE6500EC13806E8"/>
they had traded with ſome Days before at <hi>Malegaſh.</hi>— That when they firſt eſpied her, they Cut up the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fiſhing Leads, and beat them into Sluggs, divided among them the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men's ſmall Arms, and loaded them with the Sluggs, and the <hi>Indians</hi> took the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mens Cloaths &amp; other things, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly the Examinant took from the <hi>Indians</hi> two Gold Rings and a pair of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Buckles, which they ſaid they found in the Cabbin in a Handkerchief.— And after Breakfaſt on the 26th. day of <hi>Auguſt</hi> in the Morning, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> took their Opportunity to riſe upon the <hi>Indians,</hi> when there was but a few of them upon Deck, and the Examinant with three <hi>Indian</hi> Men, an <hi>Indian</hi> Woman and her two Children were then in the Cabbin, when the Skipper <hi>Doty</hi> came from the Helm, and ſhut the Cabbin Door, but the Examinant opened it, and was no ſooner come upon Deck but the Mate knockt him down and threw him over-board, but he took hold of the Sloops Canno which lay aſtern, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> took him on board again. The Examinant ſays, That one of the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> who jumpt out of the Cabbin Window into the Sea, had on the Maſter's Jacket; And when the Examinant came on board again, the <hi>Indian</hi> Woman in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed him that her Husband and two more <hi>Indian</hi> Men being in the Cabbin, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> fired two Guns into the Cabbin, and they three got out of the Cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin Windows, but the Examinant believes they were Drowned, the Sloop then being about four Miles from the Shoar, and the <hi>French</hi> Scooner bearing away from them, as the <hi>Indian</hi> Woman told him.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>May it pleaſe your Honours,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THE Priſoners at the Bar having nothing further to offer, nor their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate for them, I ſhall therefore with all poſſible Brevity, diſcharge
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:002818_0015_0FE6500EE2C24CD8"/>
the remaining part of my Duty, in cloſing this Trial, that has thus long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exciſed your Honours great Patience; and in order to this, I ſhall in the firſt Place recount the ſeveral principal Facts proved upon the Priſoners, and as I humbly conceive, unqueſtionably maintain my Charge againſt them, and laſtly conſider the Defence made by their Advocate for them. The Matters of Fact appear ſo Full and Irreſiſtable, that neither the Priſoners themſelves attempt to falſify them, or even to ſuggeſt any colourable Argument for their Extenua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And are ſuch, that were they committed upon the High Sea, their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate concedes would clearly amount to Piracy.</p>
                  <p>And therefore I ſhall only ſummarily Mention to your Honours, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the general Evidence againſt the Priſoners, of their Aiding, Aſſiſting, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring and Aſſenting with others in the Taking, Robbing and Plundering the Sloop <hi>Tryal,</hi> mentioned in the Articles, it's proved particularly upon the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, they were the firſt that entered the ſaid Veſſel: That <hi>Baptiſt</hi> the Father, under a pretence of going aſhoar in his Son's Canno, prevailed on the Maſter to leave him aboard; and to give the greater Terror to His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's Subjects, and Aggrandize himſelf, he made a Saſh of the Enſign, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in tuckt <hi>Roberts</hi>'s Piſtol, aſſuming the Name of <hi>Skipper,</hi> ordered Mr. <hi>Doty</hi> to come to ſail, and to ſteer the Sloop <hi>Eaſtward</hi>; and when a Scooner appeared in ſight, he and his Son, with others, divided the Powder and Shot belonging to the Veſſel, new flinted their Guns, converted the Fiſhing-Leads into Sluggs, and therewith loaded their Small-Arms: That he helped with others to bind the Mate of ſaid Veſſel, and alſo piratically robbed <hi>Roberts</hi> of two Rings and a pair of Stockings, and was active in conſuming and deſtroying the Veſſel's Proviſions and Stores.</p>
                  <p>The Facts proved upon <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> Junior, the other Priſoner, are for the moſt the ſame in Subſtance; more eſpecially that he was originally let into the Secret, for when the Canno was but not half way in her return to the Sloop, then it was that a Gun was fired into the Air, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were required to cry for Quarters. That he was not only the Perſon confided in for bringing about their wicked Deſigns, but that he had ſo well executed that part that was judged the moſt Truſty, that he was left to ſtand Gentry over the Arms: That he charged his Father's Piſtol; was Armed with a Gun; had on him a Cap, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of one of the Men belonging to the Sloop; And finally, with a Fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's Pew made ſeveral attempts to deſtroy <hi>Sprague,</hi> even after he had Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters given. All which in the Law amount to ſeveral Acts of Piracy.</p>
                  <p>From whence it evidently appears, that the Articles in reſpect to Matters of Fact, are fully proved upon the Priſoners; but whether ſuch Facts amount to Piracy at Sea, or Robbery at Land, in Point of Law, remains a Queſtion; which naturally leads me to the Conſideration of thoſe Points in Law offered by the Priſoner's Advocate in their Defence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="17" facs="unknown:002818_0016_0FE650126CA444B8"/>And Firſt, he argues, that the Veſſel when ſeized and taken by the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and others, was at an Anchor in the Port of <hi>Malegaſh,</hi> near the Land, and <hi>Infra Corpus Comitatus,</hi> and therefore is only Robbery at the Common Law.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>If a Pirate enters a Port or Haven, and Aſſaults and Robs a Merchant-Ship at Anchor there, this is no Piracy,<note place="margin">March. Com. <hi>p. 183.</hi>
                        </note> becauſe it's not done <hi>Super Altum Mare,</hi> but a down right Robbery at the Common Law, and the Anonimous Author for this quotes <hi>Moor,</hi> 756.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>In Anſwer, the Caſe is not truly given us by that Author, as reported by Sir <hi>Francis Moor</hi>; neither is the Author in putting ſaid Caſe conſiſtent with himſelf; for his following Words are, <q>And if the Crime be committed either <hi>Super Altum Mare,</hi> or in great Rivers within the Realm, which are looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as Common High-Ways, then it is Piracy.</q> Which plainly militates with what the Author immediately before aſſerted for Law. But to return to the Caſe in <hi>Moor</hi>'s Reports; the firſt Queſtion there put by the Lord Chancellour to all the Judges was, <hi>If the Clergy extended to Piracy, upon an Arraignment on the Stat.</hi> 28. H. 8. And Reſolved, It did not, unleſs the Piracy was done in a Creek or other River, in which the Common Law before the <hi>Stat.</hi> had Juriſdiction; and not if it was done in <hi>Alto Mari,</hi> and out of the Body of the County. And theſe Words, <hi>In which the Common Law before the</hi> Stat. <hi>had Juriſdiction,</hi> fully im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, ſince the <hi>Stat.</hi> the Common Law has not Juriſdiction. And the Words of the <hi>Stat.</hi> are, <q>All Treaſons, Felonies, Robberies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Committed in or upon the Sea, or in any other Haven, River, Creek or Place where the Admiral hath, or pretends to have Power, Authority, or Juriſdiction, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>My Lord <hi>Coke</hi> thereupon Comments thus; <q>Theſe Words,<note place="margin">3 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 113. q.</note> ſays he, (<hi>Or pretends to have,</hi> &amp;c.) are thus to be underſtood: Between the High-Water Mark and Low-Water Mark: For tho' the Land be <hi>Infra Corpus Commitatus</hi> at the Re-flow; yet when the Sea is full, the Admiral hath Juriſdiction <hi>ſuper aquam,</hi> as long as the Sea flows.</q> Now the Place where the Seizing and piratically Taking the Veſſel in the Articles, was in the Port of <hi>Malegaſh,</hi> where the Sea is always full, and conſequently within the Admiral's Juriſdiction. But the Books make a further diſtinction between Creeks, Ports and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, actually challenged as part of the Bodies of Counties,<note place="margin">4 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 140, 141. x.</note> and from whence a Jury may come. And Ports, Creeks and Havens, that are out of every County, from whence no Jury can come, the former appertains (as is ſaid) to the Juriſdiction of the Common Law Courts, the latter confeſſedly to the Admiralty. But if all Ports, Creeks and Harbours are generally and without this Diſtinction, out of the Admiralty's Juriſdiction, then theſe Words of the <hi>Stat.</hi> 28. <hi>H.</hi> 8. <q>Upon the Sea, or in any other Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, Creek, or other Place where the Admiral hath, or pretends to have Power, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </q> would be Vain and Idle, as alſo the Words of the <hi>Stat.</hi> of the 12, 13. <hi>W.</hi> 3. Ch. 7 which ſay, <q>All Piracies. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Committed upon the Sea, or in any Haven, Creek or Place where the Admiral hath Juriſdiction, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </q>

                  <p>All which clearly ſhews, that there are ſuch Havens, Rivers and Creeks where the Legiſlature ſuppoſes the Admiral to have Juriſdiction; and which
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:002818_0017_0FE65012A223B348"/>
moſt indiſputably are ſuch Havens, Rivers and Creeks, that (in my Lord <hi>Coke</hi>'s Words) are out of every County, and from whence no Jury can come; which is the Circumſtance of the Port where this Veſſel was piratically taken by the Priſoners. But what ſilences all Arguments of this Nature, in reſpect to the Admiralty's Juriſdiction in Ports, Creeks and Havens, touching Acts of Piracy, and removes all Pleas of this ſort, are the Words of the <hi>Stat.</hi> 8. K. G. Ch. 24. Sect. 1. <q>And if any Perſon belonging to any Ship or Veſſel whatſoever, upon meeting any Merchant-Ship upon the High Seas, or in any Port, Haven or Creek whatſoever, ſhall forcibly Board and Enter into ſuch Ship, and tho' they do not ſeize and carry her off, ſhall throw over-board or deſtroy any part of the Goods or Merchandizes belonging to ſuch Ship, the Perſons guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thereof, ſhall be deemed and puniſhed as Pirates:</q> And therefore I ſhall reſt this part of the Priſoner's Defence, and proceed to the Conſideration of the other Point of Law offered by their Advocate, and Calculated for <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> Junior, namely, That he was at the time of the taking the ſaid Veſſel, an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant under the Age of Fourteen, not <hi>ſui juris,</hi> and by Law no Act of Piracy or Felony can be imputed to him.</p>
                  <p>To which I anſwer, The Gentleman is wrong in his Hypotheſis, as by <hi>Evidentiâ Perſonae</hi>; neither did the Father or any other pretend to ſay the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner was under the Age of Fourteen. And for as much as ſuch a Special De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence is to exempt the Party from the Puniſhment of a General Statute, it's incumbent upon the Gentleman to make Legal Evidence of the Fact relied upon. But my Lord <hi>Hale,</hi> under <hi>Murther,</hi> ſays, <q>An Infant within the Age of Diſcretion,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Hale</hi>'s Pleas of the Crown, <hi>p. 43.</hi>
                        </note> kills a Man, no Felony; as if he be Nine or Ten Years old: But if by Circumſtances it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth he could diſtinguiſh between Good and Evil, it is Felony; as if he hide the Dead, make Excuſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </q> That the Pirates looked upon this <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> Junior as a Perſon capable of diſtinguiſhing, is evident by committing the greateſt Truſt and Charge unto him, namely, the Guard over the Arms; and that he could diſtinguiſh between Good and Evil, is plain, when he cry'd for Quarters, and afterwards when he thought himſelf ſufficiently armed with a Fiſherman's Pew, attempted the Deſtruction of <hi>Sprague,</hi> thereby as far as in him lay, preventing the regaining of the Veſſel: By all which, and by many more incident Matters of Fact that turned out in the Evidence, it clearly appears he was a free Agent, and capable of making Legal Diſtinctions. And for as much as there is no Diſcrimination in reſpect to the Crimes charged upon the Priſoners, as Your Honour values the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Laws of the Land, the Lives and Properties of His Majeſty's Subjects, and would ſtudiouſly avoid any fatal Conſequence that may attend an illegal Acquittal; I hope there will be as little diſtinction in reſpect to their Sentence, but that Your Honour will juſtly pronounce them equally Guilty.</p>
               </q>
               <p>The Advocate General having Concluded, the Court was cleared; and after mature and deliberate Conſideration of what the King's Witneſſes
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:002818_0018_0FE6501A8D249408"/>
Depoſed, the Priſoners Defence made by themſelves and their Advocate, together with the Replication of the Advocate General, the Court voted Unanimouſly, that the ſaid <hi>John Baptiſt Jedre,</hi> alias <hi>Laverdure,</hi> and <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> Junior, are ſeverally Guilty of Piracy, Felony and Robbery, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Articles Exhibited againſt them.</p>
               <p>Then they were brought to the Bar again, and the Preſident pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the ſaid <hi>John Baptiſt Jedre,</hi> alias <hi>Laverdure,</hi> and <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> junior ſeverally Guilty. — Whereupon the Advocate on Behalf of His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty moved, that Sentence might be given againſt them according to Law. Then they were ſeverally askt if they had any thing further to ſay why Sentence of Death ſhould not be pronounced againſt them, and they Alledging nothing but what was offered before in their behalf on their Tryal, the Preſident pronounced Sentence againſt them ſeverally in the words following, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q>You— are to go from hence to the place from whence you came, and thence to the place of Execution, there to be hanged up by the Neck until you are Dead, and the Lord have Mercy upon your Soul.</q>
               </p>
               <p>After Sentence was given againſt the Priſoners, the Marſhal of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralty was Ordered to remand and keep them in ſafe Cuſtody within His Majeſty's Goal in <hi>Boſton.</hi>
               </p>

Then the Witneſſes for our Sovereign Lord the King, Namely, <hi>Samuel Doty, Nathaniel Sprague, John Roberts, Silas Cooke</hi> and <hi>Philip Sachimus</hi> were called and Sworn, and ſeverally Depoſed as follows, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>SAmuel Doty</hi> ſaith, That on the 25th. day of <hi>Auguſt</hi> laſt, two of the Priſoners, <hi>viz. Philip Mews</hi> and <hi>James Mews,</hi> together with <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> Junior, went on board the Deponent's Sloop in <hi>Baptiſt</hi>'s Canno Armed, and about a Gun ſhot from the Shoar, one of them held up his Gun and fired, and ſaid to the ſaid Deponent and his Company, then ſtanding on the Bank, Now you <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men call for Quarter: And ſoon after they got on board the Sloop, they took down her Enſign, and fired a volley with their ſmall Arms. That about a Quarter of an Hour afterwards, <hi>John Miſſel</hi> with three more <hi>Indians</hi> went aboard.</p>
               <p>That ſometime afterwards, when the Deponent went on board, <hi>James Mews,</hi> one of the Priſoners took the Deponents Hat from him, and ſpake to him in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> ſaying, Now I am Captain of the Veſſel, do you call your Men a board, or I'le ſend aſhoar preſently and kill them all.</p>
               <p>That <hi>James Mews</hi> told the Deponent there was Peace Proclaimed between the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Indians</hi>; but the ſaid <hi>Mews</hi> ſaid he never would make Peace with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> for the Governour of <hi>Boſton</hi> kept his Brother, and he would Burn the Sloop and keep the Goods till his Brother was ſent home.</p>
               <p>That afterwards when the Deponent's Mate came on board, two of the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, <hi>viz. James Mews</hi> and <hi>Philip Mews,</hi> took hold of him and dragg'd him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Deck, threatning to kill him; and alſo told the Deponent that he would go on Shoar, and kill the reſt of his Men that were there, unleſs he called them an board; and ſoon after they got on board, the Veſſel came to ſail by <hi>Baptiſt</hi>'s Order, and the ſaid <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>James Mews</hi> hoiſted up the Anchor.— That the ſaid <hi>Philip Mews</hi> ſearched the Deponent's Pockets afterwards, and tools ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteen Shillings from him.— That <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> for the moſt part Ordered the Deponent what Courſe to Steer; Captain <hi>James Mews,</hi> as he called himſelf, having got Drunk.</p>
               <p>That all the Priſoners in their turns, draw'd the Rum which belonged to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men; Drank plentifully, and eat of the Sloop's Cheeſe, Butter and other Proviſions.— And lighted a great Number of Candles, which were burning all Night— That the next Morning they ſaw a Scooner which was ſuppoſed to be an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Veſſel, and all the Priſoners (except <hi>James Mews</hi> who was then in Drink) divided the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mens Arms, Powder and Shot, put new Flints into their Guns, and made ready to fight the <hi>Engliſh</hi> on board the ſaid Veſſel; <hi>John Miſſel</hi> in particular charged his Gun, but when they came up with her, they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered ſhe was a <hi>French</hi> Scooner belonging to Cape <hi>Breton,</hi> that had lately been at <hi>Malegaſh</hi> for Cattle, as the Deponent underſtood.

was a Fiſhing, and <hi>Philip Mews</hi> only was walking on the Deck, who with the ſaid <hi>Baptiſt</hi> were Ordered to ſtand as a Guard over the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> they took this Opportunity to riſe, and made themſelves Maſters of the Veſſel, three of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> having jumpt over board out of the Cabbin Windows, and others being thrown from the Deck into the Hold.</p>
               <p>That <hi>John Miſſel</hi> helpt to ſeize the Mate when he firſt went on board, and was as Active afterwards as the reſt of the <hi>Indians</hi> upon all Occaſions.— That the <hi>Indians</hi> ſtruck the Mate ſeveral blows, hauled him by the Head and Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and threatned to kill him with their Hatchets and Knives which they held in their Hands.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>NAthaniel Sprague</hi> Depoſeth and ſaith, That on the 25th. of <hi>Auguſt</hi> laſt, when he got on Shoar it <hi>Malegaſh,</hi> he ſaw the three Priſoners now at the Bar, with other <hi>Indians</hi> on Shoar, and asked them what News, the ſaid <hi>James</hi> and <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip Mews</hi> anſwered there was a very good Peace. The Deponent ask'd the <hi>Indians</hi> how they knew 'twas Peace? <hi>Philip Mews</hi> anſwered that the <hi>Penobſcut</hi> and Cape <hi>Sable Indians</hi> had lately been at <hi>Annapolis</hi> with the Governour, who informed them he had made Peace with the <hi>Indians.</hi>— That the Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent heard <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> on board the Sloop call to his Son on Shoar, who ſoon after with <hi>James</hi> and <hi>Philip Mews</hi> went Armed in a Canno towards the Sloop. That one of them fired a Gun, and ſaid to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> on Shoar: You <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men call for Quarter, and then went on board the Sloop, and he ſaw one of them take up an Ax and break open the Cabbin Door; then two of them went into the Cabbin; afterwards they ſtruck the Colours, and diſcharged their ſmall Arms.— That afterwards the Deponent ſaw two Cannos with <hi>Indians</hi> in them go on board the Sloop.— And ſome time after they ſent on Shoar an <hi>Indian</hi> belonging to the Sloop, namely <hi>Philip Sachimus,</hi> to tell the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to come on board and they would give 'em good Quarter; but if they would not come on board, to inform them they ſhould all be killed. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the ſaid Mr. <hi>Doty</hi> went on board.— And afterwards the ſaid <hi>Doty</hi> called to the Deponent and <hi>Silas Cooke,</hi> and told them there were two <hi>Indians</hi> on Shoar would kill 'em, if they did not come on board; ſo they went on board, and ſome of the <hi>Indians</hi> ſtampt on the Deponent, others hauled him about, and held their Hatchets over his Head, threatning to kill him; but others came to his help— And particularly <hi>James Mews</hi> (one of the Priſoners at the Bar) threatned to kill him, and would have taken away his Life, (as this Deponent believes) had not another <hi>Indian</hi> Interpoſed. Afterwards the Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent got into the Hold, where he had not been long, before ſome of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany bid him come upon Deck, and threatned if he did not they would cut him all to peices, ſo he went upon Deck, when <hi>James Mews</hi> and other <hi>Indians</hi> kickt him, and ſtruck him ſeveral blows.— That <hi>Philip Mews</hi> ſtood by when <hi>Baptiſt</hi> bound him. And <hi>James Mews</hi> held a Knife to his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Throat, and told him he would be the Death of him; And once Swore at him, ſaying, God Dam your Blood, you ſhall not live a Minute longer, and ſtruck at him
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:002818_0023_0FE65028227522F0"/>
with his Knife, but another <hi>Indian</hi> Interpoſed, and while they were ſtriving together the Deponent got from them.</p>
               <p>The Deponent further ſaith. That he ſaw the ſaid <hi>James Mews</hi> have a Gold Ring, a pair of Silver Shoe-Buckles, and a Neckcloth belonging to <hi>John Roberts,</hi> and <hi>Philip Mews</hi> had a pair of Trowzers belonging to another of Mr. <hi>Doty</hi>'s Men.</p>
               <p>That when the <hi>Engliſh</hi> roſe upon the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Indians, James Mews</hi> was on the Windleſs, <hi>Philip</hi> was near him, and <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> Junior was lying upon or near his Gun.— <hi>Miſſel</hi> was on the Deck with a Gun in one Hand, and a Fiſhing line in the other, a Fiſhing.</p>
               <p>That the Deponent ſaw Mr. <hi>Doty</hi> leave the Helm, and put to the Cabbin Door, and he took hold of <hi>Philip Mews</hi> Gun, but he flung Mr. <hi>Doty</hi> on the Floor, then <hi>Roberts</hi> and <hi>Cooke</hi> went to the ſaid <hi>Doty</hi>'s Aſſiſtance; <hi>John Miſſel</hi> in the Interim went to the Cabbin Door, and endeavoured to open it, but was hindred by an <hi>Indian</hi> belonging to Mr. <hi>Doty,</hi> viz. <hi>Philip Sachimus,</hi> who ſtood by the Door; But <hi>Baptiſt</hi> got out at the Cabbin Door, and was ſoon thrown over board— The Deponent further ſaith, That <hi>John Miſſel,</hi> with a Gauft ſtruck the Deponent, and tried to haul him into the Hold with it, but the Deponent having a Fiſherman's Pew in his Hand, ſtruck at the ſaid <hi>Miſſel,</hi> who fell backward, and ſo eſcaped the blow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>JOhn Roberts</hi> Depoſeth and ſaith, That when he went aſhoar at <hi>Malegaſh,</hi> he ſaw the three Priſoners, with three other <hi>Indians</hi> and two <hi>French</hi> Men, and the Deponent ſhook Hands with <hi>Philip Mews,</hi> and ask'd him whether there was Peace?

               <p>Then was Read the Ratification made the fourth day of <hi>June</hi> laſt, at His Majeſty's Fort of <hi>Annapolis-Royal,</hi> of the Articles of Peace ſtipulated by the Delegates at <hi>Boſton,</hi> the fifteenth day of <hi>December</hi> foregoing, (which Articles were alſo Read) in behalf of the <hi>Penobſcot, Narridgwalk,</hi> Saint <hi>John</hi>'s, Cape <hi>Sables,</hi> and other <hi>Indian</hi> Tribes belonging to, and Inhabiting within His Majeſty's Territories of <hi>Nova-Scotia,</hi> &amp;c. And by Major <hi>Paul Maſcarene,</hi> Commiſſioner for the Province of <hi>Nova-Scotia,</hi> in behalf of His Majeſty.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="unknown:002818_0029_0FE650324BA4D1D8"/>Afterwards the Priſoners being ask'd whether they had ſeen any of the <hi>Indians</hi> that were at the Ratification of the Peace at <hi>Annapolis</hi>? They anſwered, they had been in Company with ſeveral of the <hi>Indians,</hi> whoſe Names were ſubſcribed to the ſaid Ratification; And particularly <hi>James Mews</hi> owned, that about twenty days before the ſaid <hi>Doty</hi>'s Sloop was taken, he was in Company with <hi>Antoin,</hi> one of the Chiefs of the <hi>Indians</hi> at <hi>Menis,</hi> and about eight or ten days afterwards, he ſaw <hi>Indian Simon,</hi> who uſed to carry Letters from <hi>Menis,</hi> &amp;c. to <hi>Annapolis-Royal,</hi> and was preſent, as he underſtood, at the Negotiation of the Peace; and the ſaid <hi>James</hi> and <hi>Philip Mews,</hi> both ſignified to the Court their belief that <hi>Antoin</hi> was at <hi>Annapolis</hi> treating of the Peace; and they alſo own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that they lately ſaw Captain <hi>Walker,</hi> alias <hi>Piere,</hi> one of the Chiefs of the <hi>Indians</hi> at or near <hi>Malegaſh</hi> and <hi>Sabuckatook,</hi> who was at <hi>Annapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi> at the Treaty; and that his Brother <hi>Catouſe</hi> was returned from thence, ſince the Ratification of the Peace.</p>
               <p>Then the Priſoners Advocate made his Pleas in their Defence, in the following manner, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I Now a ſecond Time appear before Your Honour, Mr. Preſident, and the reſt of the Honourable Commiſſioners of this Court, in behalf of ſome Perſons accuſed of Piracy: Who tho' they be <hi>Indians,</hi> have and will experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſo much Candour and Indulgence from this Court, as muſt convince even the barbarous and Salvage Tribes to which they belong, of Your great Juſtice and Impartiality. Your Honours, I doubt not, are ſenſible I am not ſend of this Office: But my Duty to Your Honour, and the Honourable Court, and deſire that nothing may be neglected, which in Juſtice to the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners ought to be declared, engage me in this Affair.</p>
               <p>I humbly ſubmit it to Your Honours, Whether at the Time the Facts they are accuſed of, are laid to be committed, they were not Enemies, or in a State of War with us: 'Tis true it appears, that the Ratification of the Peace between His Majeſty's Government of <hi>Annapolis-Royal,</hi> and the Cape <hi>Sable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi> was made at <hi>Annapolis</hi> on the fourth of <hi>June</hi> laſt; but that regards that Government only; and the Covenant on the part of the <hi>Indians,</hi> that they not commit Hoſtilities, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> extends to the Inhabitants of that Province only. The Veſſel ſeized at <hi>Malegaſh,</hi> in which the Evidences for the King were, belongs to His Majeſty's Subjects of this Province: And the Priſoners declare, that at the Time of the taking Capt. <hi>Doty</hi> and his Veſſel, they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knew or heard of the Ratification of the Peace between this Province and the <hi>Indians</hi> at <hi>Caſ<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi>; but on the contrary, were informed even by <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:002818_0030_0FE6503C95D9D388"/>
men,</hi> as well as <hi>French,</hi> among the latter of which, were (as they inform me) Monſieur St. <hi>A<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>

                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> and his Son <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> and by two eminent Cape <hi>Sable</hi> Indians, <hi>S<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="4 letters">
                        <desc>••••</desc>

                        <desc>•••••</desc>
                     </gap>age,</hi> that there was no Peace made, but only talked of; and that but a Day or two before the Facts are charged in the Articles to be committed.</p>
               <p>The Ratification indeed at <hi>Caſes,</hi> was on the fifth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> but that does not argue that the Priſoners were acquainted with it, they living in a far, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote and diſtant Place of another Government: And being but an inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Number of People, the Law will not, with Submiſſion, preſume a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be knowing of a thing, unleſs there appear ſome Circumſtances by which it may be reaſonably concluded, he cannot but know it. If therefore the Priſoners were in a State of War with us, what they have done, they may well juſtify, by the Laws of GOD, Nature, Nations and Arms: And their declaring to <hi>Doty</hi> and his Men, that it was Peace, may be reaſonably accounted a Stratagem of War, to draw and enſnare them in their Churches; which fort of Stratagems are very frequently made uſe of in War.</p>
               <p>Your Honours may well remember what I urged yeſterday in favour of the two <hi>French-men,</hi> which therefore I ſhall not ſpend Your Time in inſiſting on, ſince the Sentence You have paſſed upon them, manifeſts it to be over-ruled; I mean, that the Fact charged being committed within the Body of a County, amounts only to a Notorious Robbery, which is triable at the Common-Law by a Jury, and not to Piracy: And herewith agrees the Definition of Piracy, given by Mr. Advocate General. I ſhall only beg leave to add to what I then ſaid, That as the Fact was certainly begun when the Veſſel was at Anchor in the Harbour; ſo it being but one continued Act, ought to be tried where it was begun, <hi>i. e.</hi> within the Body of the County.</p>
               <p>The Carriage of the Priſoners to the Men, was very Unjuſtifiable in their beating of them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But this I attribute partly to their barbarous Natures and Cuſtoms, and partly to their Drink. <hi>John Miſſel</hi> ſeems to have had the leaſt ſhare in the Affair, he not coming on board till after the Colours were ſtruck: But I ſhall leave their Caſes to Your Honour's wiſe Conſideration, and doubt not of a Judgment equal to the Merit and Juſtice thereof.</p>
               <p>Afterwards the Priſoners being ask'd, if they had any thing to ſay for themſelves, more than their Advocate had obſerved on their behalf?— <hi>James Mews</hi> ſaid, he was in Liquor; and they all excuſed themſelves by alledging, that it was the firſt Offence of that Nature they had been Guilty of, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Afterwards the King's Advocate Reply'd upon the Priſoners Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, as follows, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <pb n="32" facs="unknown:002818_0031_0FE6503CBB97DFE8"/>
                  <p>May it pleaſe Your Honour, Mr. <hi>Preſident,</hi> and the Honourable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners,</p>
                  <p>I Shall not now Treſpaſs upon Your Patience, in reiterating the ſeveral Matters of Fact proved upon the Priſoners: And more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when I conſider they turn out as ſtrong, if not ſtronger againſt them, than againſt thoſe two that juſtly received their Sentence Yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day.— And of this their Advocate is perfectly convinced, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore induſtriouſly waves any Advantage that otherwiſe may be taken to the weakneſs of the Evidence; and reſts their Defence on an Allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, That at the Time of Committing theſe Facts, they were in a State of Enmity with us, ignorant of the Ratification of the Peace, and therefore not guilty of Piracy, by the Law of Arms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To which I Anſwer:— That the Gentleman is the ſecond Time miſtaken in Fact. For on the Fifteenth Day of <hi>December,</hi> 1725. the ſeveral Tribes of the Eaſtern <hi>Indians,</hi> St. <hi>John</hi>'s and Cape <hi>Sables,</hi> &amp;c. by their Delegates, did enter into Articles of Pacification at <hi>Boſton,</hi> with the Governments of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts-Bay, New-Hampſhire</hi> and <hi>Nova-Scotia,</hi> whereby among other things, they promiſed in behalf of their reſpective Tribes, <q>That they will ceaſe all Acts of Hoſtility, Injuries and Diſcords, towards all the Subjects of the Crown of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> and not offer the leaſt Hurt, Violence or Moleſtation to them, or any of them, in their Perſons or Eſtates; but will henceforward Hold and Maintain a firm, conſtant Amity and Friendſhip with all the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi> and will never Confederate or Combine with any other Nation to their Prejudice.</q> And further, there are alſo inſerted in the ſaid Articles of Pacification theſe Words, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                     <q>We (meaning the ſaid Delegates, in behalf of themſelves and their reſpective Tribes) Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting our ſelves to be Ruled and Governed by His Majeſty's Laws, and deſiring to have the Benefit of the ſame.</q> And on the fourth Day of <hi>June</hi> following, at <hi>Annapolis-Royal,</hi> the Chiefs and Repreſentatives of the ſaid <hi>Indians,</hi> in Compliance with the ſaid Articles, ſtipulated as aforeſaid, by their Delegates, and in Obedience thereunto, Solemnly Confirmed and Ratified the ſame. By all which it moſt evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that the <hi>Indians</hi> were not, as pretended, at the Time of execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ſeveral Acts of Piracy charged upon them, in a State of War with the Crown of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> but in firm Amity with His Sacred Majeſty, and to be Governed by His Majeſty's Laws, and Entituled to the Benefit of them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="33" facs="unknown:002818_0032_0FE6503F08CDC0F0"/>
                     <q>And if any Foreigner, Subject to any Prince or State in Amity with the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> commit Piracies on the Ships or Goods of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> the ſame is Piracy, within the Stat. 28. <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>Sea-Laws,</hi> p. 478. <hi>q.</hi>
                     </q> Having thus unanſwerably acquitted this Proſecution from the Exception, I beg leave to give a ſhot Anſwer to what further was offered by the Advocate for the Priſoners, under this Head, namely, that they were ignorant of theſe Negotiations, and therefore the Crime of Piracy ought not to be imputed to them.</p>
                  <p>I muſt obſerve to Your Honours, It's a ſettled Maxim in reſpect to the Breaches of Penal-Laws, <hi>Ignorantia non excuſat Legem.</hi> And was the Fact truly ſo, who is chargeable with the Omiſſion? The Chiefs and Delegates in Duty ought to apprize (as doubtleſs they did) their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Tribes, of the ſaid Articles of Pacification and Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not the Government that ſtipulated with them. But from their own Words, and Words ſpoke in their hearing, as appeared in the Evidence, and alſo from the Circumſtances in the Caſe, it muſt be collected they were fully ſenſible of all theſe Solemn Treaties and Proceedings; for aſhoar one of them ſaluted the <hi>Engliſh</hi> as the <hi>French</hi> did aboard, by ſaying, <hi>It's Peace; the</hi> Engliſh <hi>are now all one as Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi>: And by their own Acknowledgement, they had ſeen and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed with ſome of their Chiefs, that had at <hi>Annapolis</hi> Confirmed the ſaid Articles of Pacification ſince ſuch Confirmation, and once in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, but a very inconſiderable Time before their perpetrating this their wicked Act; ſo that there is neither Colour or Shadow to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them Ignorant; or according to Law would ſuch Ignorance ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt them from the Puniſhment juſtly due to their Demerits.</p>
                  <p>Therefore I doubt not but Your Honours will in like manner declare them Guilty, as You lately have the other Accomplices in theſe their wicked Actions.</p>
               </q>
               <p>The Advocate General having Concluded, the Court was cleared; Then the Commiſſioners fully and deliberately weighed and conſidered the Evidences againſt the Priſoners, and alſo the Defence made by them and their Advocate, together with Mr. Advocate General's Replication, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And Voted Unanimouſly, That the ſaid <hi>James Mews, Philip Mews,</hi> and <hi>John Miſſel,</hi> were ſeverally Guilty.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="unknown:002818_0033_0FE6503F37E0F650"/>Then the Priſoners were brought to the Bar again, when the Preſident Pronounced them ſeverally Guilty of Piracy, Felony and Robbery, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Articles Exhibited againſt them.</p>
               <p>Whereupon the Advocate General on His Majeſty's behalf, demanded Sentence againſt them.</p>
               <p>And the Priſoners when ask'd what they had further to ſay, why Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Death ſhould not be Pronounced againſt them, alledging, they had nothing to ſay more than had been offered upon their Trial; The Preſident of the Court accordingly Pronounced Sentence againſt them ſeverally, in the Words following, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q>You — are to go from hence to the place from whence you came, and from thence to the place of Execution, and there to be hanged up by the Neck, until you are Dead; and the Lord have Mercy upon your Soul.</q>
