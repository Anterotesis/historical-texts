            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The following TESTIMONY concerning <hi>Acceptable Worſhip to Almighty God,</hi> was given in writing by <hi>DNNIS GETCHELL,</hi> late of Vaſſalborough, in the eaſtern part of Newengland, a little before his death, who was educated in the Congregational or Preſbyterian relig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion; was in the office of Captain and afterwards a Major, in the late war, and for ſome time a member of the general court at Boſton; he deceaſed aboat the month called April, <hi>1791.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>"I AM moved and diſpoſed to leave this teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony for the truth, in humble gratitude, praiſe and thankſgiving unto the great author and preſerver of my being, who in his marvellous lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kindneſs hath viſited my ſoul with a ſenſible knowledge of what I now communicate; and that I have not been moved thereunto by the advice, conſultation or direction of any mortal; but pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the honour of the holy head of the church of God, and the good of my fellow mortals, to bear teſtimony, that no man can acceptably worſhip the adorable God, but in, through and by the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of his own Eternal Spirit of Truth and Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couſneſs, in the pure ſilence of all fleſh; not as
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:027050_0003_0FD37963F0502618"/>ſome may imagine, in ſenſeleſs ſtupefaction or mere ſilence as to vocal declarations; but in an intire abstraction from all earthly or fleſhly cogitations; in which ſeaſons of holy paſſivity (all the effects of divine power) is there divine ability imparted, in which the ſoul can acceptably worſhip the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Maker of heaven and earth, in a manner no form of words can reach, And I have this teſtimony to leave for the truth, and for the ſake of that only, that in diverſe opportanities of wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Lord in pure ſilence, with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple called Quakers, in the time of my ſickneſs; my ſoul (both with and without word) has been made to rejoice in the living ſenſe of God's ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to my unſpeakable comfort, and to our mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual edification; and in unfeigned love to the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righ: hearted of this religious ſociety of people, doth my ſoul wiſh that grace, mercy and peace may be multiplied among you.</p>
            <p>"And I feel my ſoul impreſſed through a ſenſe of duty to God, and as a warning to others, who are or may have been made ſenſible of the truth as held by this people, to freely own, that being blinded by the god of this world, in love with the honour and friendſhip thereof, and through a fear of the ſhame of the croſs of Chriſt, I have been diſobedient to the heavenly viſitation of God's love, and thereby deprived myſelf of many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious opportunities, that I believe I ſhould have been favoured with, had I been faithful to the juſt witneſs which (during the time of my confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) I have often had deeply to mourn for before God: I feel therefore deſirous that none may ſlight the day of their viſitation, or ſhan the croſs through fear of man, or the reproach of the world, but
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:027050_0004_0FD37966550C8CC0"/>that they may be prevailed upon to give cheerful obedience to the dictates of truth in the mind, where is placed God's witneſs, a miniſter of the ſanctuary whom all ought to hear and obey.</p>
            <p>"In teſtimony of my love to the pure worſhip of God, I do requeſt and adviſe, that my family meet with and attend the religious meetings of Friends.</p>

            <head>Some Account of Dennis Getchell aforeſaid, as certified by a perſon who was well acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with him in Years paſt.</head>
            <p>HE was a man of good natural abilities, and reputation in the parts where he lived, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his reſidence at Vaſſalborough aforeſaid, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing ſtrong in argument, cogent in reaſoning, deep in his reſearches after the origination of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and things, of a ſteady conduct; was deemed a good neighbour and an uſeful member of civil ſociety: After ſerving in ſeveral public ſtations (as firſt mentioned) in the latter part of his life he had conferred on him a commiſſion of the peace: He had been convinced of the truth, relating to a principle of inward light and grace being confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red on every man, as a pure infallible teacher, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the doctrine of the people called Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers (although it is ſlighted and ſpoken againſt by many profeſſing chriſtianity:) And being up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of twelve years ago remarkably reached and tendered in his ſpirit under the teſtimony of a
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:027050_0006_0FD37EAF063EA9D0"/>miniſter of that religious ſociety, at a meeting held near his dwelling, his mind was for ſome time apparently turned from the ſentiments received by education, with deſires to take up the croſs and walk in a narrower way, which he then ſaw was neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in order to obtain inward peace; but his reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions did not prove to be ſtrong enough to withdraw from, and withſtand the ſtream he had been accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed to, in regard to worldly friendſhip with the maxims and honours thereof, ſo as to make a ſolid progreſs in the true chriſtian path of ſelf denial; therefore, although he retained a regard for the ſociety called Quakers, he never joined himſelf among them as a member: When his health de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined, through the prevalence of a ſore diſorder, he was viſited with a ſenſe of divine mercy, and it is hoped he witneſſed forgiveneſs of ſins; often greatly bemoaning his folly and diſobedience in not being faithful to the inward principle of truth and its diſcoveries of chriſtian duty, which he had been favoured to ſee in time path was a ſore way of obtaining ſalvation. The humble penitent ſtate of his mind near the cloſe of his life, appears from the tenor of his expreſſions heareafter inſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Out of the many of like nature which he ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in the time of his illneſs; theſe following having been faithfully preſerved in writing, were lately communicated for more general benefit to a perſon at Provindence in the State of Rhodeiſland, by one of ſaid Getchell's near neighbours, who was formerly a magiſtrate of that place, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains to be a perſon of good reputation and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted veracity.</p>
            <p>Upon his giving over any expectation of help from phyſicians at the place where he lived, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:027050_0007_0FD37EB03453ACF8"/>to embark for Boſton, and being about to take leave of his near connections and others, in an opportunity at that time happening, he appeared to be much contrited; but being evidently under the refining hand of divine power, which purifies from nature's droſs (although heretofore he moſtly had words at will) he was now ſo reduced and curbed in by an awful ſenſe of his own unworthineſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Supreme Judge of the world, that he ſaid; "notwithſtanding it looks very dark and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, whether I ſhall ever ſee my family any more; yet I am ſo ſhut up that I cannot communicate any advice or inſtruction to them; I can only ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter words without life: The Almighty hath ſhut my mouth, and whether ever it will pleaſe him to open it again, I know not; and if I am not fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to ſpeak in the life, I muſt leave them without a word, however trying."</p>
            <p>Taking leave, he ſaid, "Friends, all I can ſay is farewell," which he uttered in a broken man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
            <p>Not long after his return from Boſton (being alſo given over by the phyſicians there) he ſeemed favoured with a ſenſe of divine mercy, in the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hope of pardon and ſalvation; and many of his relations and neighbours being preſent, he warned them to beware of the polutions and vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the world; and ſtrongly adviſed them to reſtrain their families from going out into compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and not to indulge their children in frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing places of ill example, as he ſaid he had too much done in his time; he warned them in a particular manner againſt the <hi>pernicious principle of Deiſm;</hi> and alſo the <hi>Univerſalian principle,</hi> as imbibed by many now-a-days; touching a belief
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:027050_0008_0FD37EB2110C22C0"/>that none are to be perpetually puniſhed after death, whatever their actions may have been in life; "this (ſaid he) has a tendency to induce people to think light of God's attributes, mercy and judgment; to which principle I had given too much attention, to the ſcattering of my own mind from the pure principle of truth: Oh, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of its ſuggeſtions, whereby many I fear are captivated to the rain of their poor immortal ſouls," with much more to the ſame purpoſe: At another time he ſaid in ſubſtance thus, "Words do not ſeem to me as once they did; I often feel ſhut up, and cannot ſay a word; ſome people come in, and think they muſt do ſomething; and ſo without life <hi>(or with unſanctified lips)</hi> ſpeak of things they have only heard with their <hi>(outward)</hi> ears; but it is a burden to me: At other times I feel ſuch openneſs, that I fear I ſhall exceed my bounds, if you ſee this to be my caſe, pray admoniſh me."— He often deſired to collect his family, when friends came, ſaying, "I have no opportunity of getting out to meetings," upon which occaſions there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared evident tokens of divine goodneſs being near.</p>
            <p>At one time while ſome perſons ſat with him at ſupper, he ſaid in a very ſenſible and feeling man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, "I have often (when ſitting at meat) beſought the Lord for more ſubſtantial food than this, which muſt periſh; for the bread of life which comes from heaven; and oh, may we all be ſo preſerved through life, as to meet in heaven, there is hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs without mixture and without end." At another time ſoon after one had entered the room (and they being alone) he ſaid nearly as follows, "I have been made ſenſible of the nature of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:027050_0009_0FD37EB694236158"/>worſhip, through the emblem of the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ebbing of the tide, which is by a ſecret influence unknown to man; that as the tide flows into rivers, rivulets and creeks, and again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns to the ocean, ſo it is as the love and ſpirit of God flows into the mind, when reduced into pure ſilence, it is in that which returns to the ocean of <hi>(love)</hi> that God is acceptably worſhipped, and there is no other way, therefore I am convinced that Friends are before any other people; and my faith is ſuch, that thoſe who are thus in the fellowſhip of one ſpirit, feel the flowings thereof into one anothers minds: But oh! how have I deſpiſed and trampled on the bleſſed truth, through a contempt of its ſmall appearence, as others now do; my ſenſe of the greatneſs of my pride and rebellion is ſuch, that I think my ſuffering light, and that I ſhall have further chaſtiſement yet; though ſo it is, in the extreme anguiſh I am apt to think it is enough."</p>
            <p>At another time he ſaid "There was a perſon came to ſee me to day (naming him) being a man of note: And another (being one who had been convinced of the truth, and gone from it) and immediately it ſtruck my mind whether I ſhould not be aſhamed of Chriſt's words, if any were given me to ſpeak, and, through fear of the ſhame of the croſs, I began inſtantly as words were given; and I have this to ſay, truth will comfort the believers, and cauſe devils to trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:" And ſpeaking of the one above hinted, that was gone from the truth, ſaid, "he is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to patch up ſomething, but never will obtain peace until he returns to the place from whence he went out: Truth is over all, and no
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:027050_0010_0FD37EBA767C2E60"/>ſubſtitute will anſwer in its room: Many are making to themſelves ſomething they think looks like it, but nothing will anſwer but the truth it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; it is over all and the poſſeſſion of it will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a man to forſake all: Ten thouſand worlds, one upon the back of another, would be no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement to me, to live as I have lived. In the world is pollution, yea, there is <hi>poiſon in every vein of it."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At another time he ſaid, "Oh! that a ſearch may go through the churches, and none be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with a name, and in the end be diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:" At another time he ſaid, "the help of man is vain, yea, even though they were princes; my truſt and dependence is only on God, who hath power and can help; I am waiting in hopes, that in his own time he will ariſe for my help, which will be the beſt time: He is juſt, and if he ſhould caſt me off forever, I feel nothing in me that can ſay, what doſt thou? If I periſh, it ſhall be at the feet of his power, begging mercy:" At another time "We are but as children under age, and don't know what is beſt for us: We need a wiſe and tender parent to guide and direct us, it is neceſſary that we ſhould know on whom to depend; this keeps us poor and begging."</p>
            <p>About two minutes before his departure his brother aſking him how it was with him, he ſaid, "my truſt and dependence is upon a merciful God."</p>
